Transcript:  Yeah, I mean I've been tempted by it and certainly friends of mine do it quite a lot  I've you know been a frequent reader  But you know like every time I have something I feel I need to say I'm usually able to find a commercial outlet for it  And I won't have to build  It's I like I like I like not only getting paid I like getting you know  Like if I'm published with slate I get the instant slate bump I get right I published with Chronicle I higher education  Which is a different audience I get that too so I can I can sort of you know  And that really is like only once every six months  I really feel like I need to jump in there are so many smart people out there who are faster than I am so  You know so I haven't really I haven't really been been but I've been I've been building my own stuff  I've been you know trying to figure out how to and I'm going to I'm going to have  Some sort of blog like platform for my center  It's called the Center for Media and Citizenship that I'm building and it's the thing that's publishing  Right now publishing the Virginia quarterly review an award-winning  Long-form magazine and it has I have a local television show in Charlottesville called the coy barefoot show  and we're about to start a  podcast and radio show called citizens band so I'm doing all of these other things and  On top of that you know my own you know so tweeting and Facebooking which is you know?  heavy enough, but I what I what I really want to do then is start a  Self-publishing platform probably just WordPress  through my center site  That will focus on talking about the things we're doing at the center  But it'll be sort of a different speed than what I was doing before

Transcript:  Yeah  I came down in the early early days of this century back when we all started blogging you know  There weren't that many voices and at that time I felt kind of  Cutting edge I felt like like there was a vacuum to fill and I could do something good by helping to fill it  and once Jeff was proof of concept for the rest of us of how to you know actually develop a following that would be  Engaged and informative and intelligent you know it was just it was too too tempting not to do that  And I wrote that you know for from 2004 to or maybe 2003 when I started my blog  till about 2012 and  And it just at that point. I it was you know  I felt like I had done my job, and there were lots of other  Sort of faster smarter younger people out there  Doing it better, and and I didn't need to anymore. It's like the the world was bigger in that sense  So I didn't feel the pressure well

Transcript:  Certain things bother me like you know I'm an emotional robot  So I don't really care about stuff  But when the Alton sterling thing when they showed like all his kids and his son  Oh, my son was crying. I couldn't that was I cried and when the the Minnesota shooting when  this woman is  Obviously in shock because the officers has cowering shaking in his voice  And she's talking commonplace day at the time yeah  And then when she realizes everything that happened and she's in the car  She's screaming and crying her daughter's like it's okay, mommy. I'm here for your old four-year-old daughter  I started balling because I'm like wow like they're like kids really get to me because I don't worry about myself

Start time: 753.20
End time: 786.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  struck me to that it was a skill of of  needing to be  compliant under authority  Yes, you didn't want to get shot as well exactly and it was it was almost a reflexive skill  It just struck me so much that came out of her and the need to stay calm herself as he was he was off the  Off the rails yeah cop wants  But but she was the calm one because she has to be to save her life  It's it was that was the most chilling part to me and of course the the tragedy in Dallas

Start time: 786.78
End time: 831.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which is it's so intertwined  With this with five police efforts your shot and seven more injured  It just it's one of those weeks where you just don't know I think  What to think and  One of the now we're a tech network and we cover the technology  So I think the thing to cover on this for us and one of the reasons Siva and Jeff are here as  As well as you Jason is  It's it's about media and how media has changed  because there was  in both  The first two shootings particularly in the Minnesota shooting  It was video that changed the conversation  Somebody tweeted black men getting shoot a shot by police is nothing new. It's the video that's new

Start time: 831.98
End time: 908.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, can I just say one thing before I like cuz I'm trying to rage out in my heart, so I  Posted the video of the Minnesota  Shooting when it was a Facebook live and within like half an hour that whole post was deleted. Yeah now  Facebook comes out the next day and says it was a glitch  I'm just gonna say and nobody has to back me up on this because you guys have more important jobs than myself  But how in the world out of the millions of accounts does this account glitch delete her whole account?  Delete the video of the account and  within  Besides the fact that it never shows up on Facebook trending topic, but we already know they have a panel  So did somebody see it say oh my goodness and just delete it because that's evidence. That's proof. That's pride  That could save somebody's life. Well, you know, I think it's a good thing  That could save somebody's life  Well, you know and the fact that that happened is insane to me because I could watch Dora finding Dora the full movie right now  Facebook can't take down other people's copyright stuff when they send in  40,000 complaints and they can't take it down, but you took down this thing and it was a glitch at all the sites  Facebook really and then you go put up a sign says Black Lives Matter  Oh, you better put that sign up you better leave that sign up for a long time  Mr. Zuckerberg because somebody's explained to me how that account glitched and got deleted

Start time: 908.74
End time: 990.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so just for people who don't know I don't know how you would not know a  Gentleman named Philando Castile was shot by a police officer during a traffic stop his girlfriend  Diamond Reynolds was sitting next to him when it happened and started streaming which is really interesting live on Facebook  Right after the officer fired  she  Very calm weirdly calmly. Although some say she probably in shock. Yeah, perhaps protecting her four-year-old who was in the backseat perhaps  protecting herself in the face of kind of irrational use of  Force but for whatever reason narrated that she said we'd been stopped for a broken taillight  Castle Castile was licensed to carry a handgun. He told the officer that reached for his wallet  As the officer had requested and was shot the officer presumably thinking he was reaching for the handgun  Facebook by the way, as you said, oh and pulled down or something happened  The video was pulled out Facebook restored it. They said it was a technical glitch, but her entire account was gone  Diamond Reynolds the woman who shot the video later said the police demanded the phone  She thinks they deleted her Facebook account in an attempt to shut down the video  Yeah, well the Facebook shouldn't release something talking about so yeah, I don't know Facebook would presumably have known that I don't know

Start time: 991.20
End time: 1171.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. So we don't I think we don't know what happened. Well, here's here's what's amazing to me you you have a company as  Sophisticated and as experienced as Facebook  launching a  product that they had to have anticipated  would be both used for  Really powerful important events like this  and  Misused by people and they probably have  policies and procedures for the misuse I would imagine, you know that they've got themselves covered on things like  obscenity and pornography and  And even things like military exercises, which you would imagine someone in Pakistan using Facebook live  Would want to capture a drone strike at some point and I'm sure that  Facebook has worked through the protocols for what to do in that sort of event where Facebook does not want to be implicated in an  International incident for instance, right?  What they've decided we'll probably never know but you know, look they're grown-ups working there. They're lawyers working that they probably figured that out  How could they have not anticipated?  Given all that's happened in the United States in the last 24 months that there would be a moment  When we have an officer kill a civilian in  What looks like a thoroughly unjustified?  Set of circumstances where it would not come through Facebook live at some point  You know like this is the sort of thing that you would think a grown-up company would have thought through had  Policies in line for now not every scenario is gonna fit and perhaps this one was more gruesome  Than they had even imagined and more brutal than they had even imagined  so and of course, they do not want to be in the business of  putting out gratuitous  Examples of violence, but this was so I hate to use the word newsworthy. It's a crappy word  But so important to so many people that  Whatever people would think about its gratuitousness it, you know, that's that's that's trivial and in perspective  But I think we're gonna have to figure out not only as you know  the companies like Facebook have to figure out better protocols for this, but we're gonna have to figure out as  the producers of these moments  Because now we all have these devices. We're gonna have to figure out  And come to some sort of agreement as a society about about how much we're going to allow  Companies that have to protect themselves and protect their own reputation and protect their own legal standing  How much we're gonna let them be our publishers of these moments and and what are the risks and benefits, you know?  Because it's basically Facebook should be in the business of protecting itself, right and and but whatever they thought through  They're not gonna be too open. They did release a statement the next day

Start time: 1171.92
End time: 1174.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm clarifying it but you're right. I doubt they had thought

Start time: 1177.14
End time: 1301.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead Jeff, I think a few things one is I think Siva you're right what you say, but I suspect that  And I don't have no basis to know anything here  But I'm just gonna guess that there's an algorithm somewhere that says oh huge amounts of traffic to something says it could be porn  Let's play safe. That's one. So it's not thought through number two is  If a human at a low level looks at it and says oh blood gore  There's a rule somewhere says don't do this  They could have made an unsophisticated decision if it is if a human decision was made  But then number three I've argued for some time that Facebook needs a high level editor on staff not to edit not to create content  but to bring  Decisions that represent the public's interest rather than just the brands interest of Facebook  I think these decisions are being made now in great measure from a PR perspective of is this good or bad for Facebook and  Facebook didn't really intend I fully believe to become a major distributor of news  But now that it is it has to grapple with the responsibility that comes around that and has to make  Decisions based on principles. So a week ago, they released their principles for the news feed and said friends and family come first  No news there always been the case next comes in entertainment and information  And that's fine. That's what Facebook's about as you have said about Google Siva. It's a company  It's gonna operate like a company. It knows what its company's priorities are  but now that it is like it or not in this position where it is going to be the  Distributor of what witnesses witness then it has to be able to make your right  mature  Responsible ethical decisions based on that and based on the importance and not take something down to protect us from ourselves  Not take something down  Because it's it's unpleasant  But also to take things down like, you know beheadings for my sis. I don't object to that myself  And it is their their right to do this. So I think so I think in this case  It's probably an immature company you say it's a big company  It's an immature company in terms of being able to deal with these things  I think this is they're gonna have to learn fast and I think they need good advice about what to do

Start time: 1302.06
End time: 1433.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And so one of the fascinating things about this moment is it was not just a video posted  It was Facebook live. It was a Facebook product. It was intended to capture a live event  And if it were just about a video posted  You know you capture it to your phone you upload it to your account  Then Facebook has the opportunity to delay and defer the decision on its distribution  And you know can gather the three people to think about it after the algorithm has flagged it  The problem we have here now is that  This was an event broadcast live I assumed to  Whoever among this woman's friends were  Were watching on Facebook at that moment. So not a lot of live viewers, but it's it lived on beyond that  after that moment so  So Facebook probably needs a completely different set of protocols for the live moment  Next time that we have a situation much more like what happened in Baton Rouge  I'm sure it's happening in the next five to six days  We are gonna see most likely a Facebook live situation  rather than just a captured video one because someone's now gonna think I can actually  Make some more waves by using Facebook live and so Facebook's gonna face this once again  And so then it's gonna be faced with that big question right shutting down the account gosh who the heck that was no one would  Agree, that was a good idea  But but perhaps saying you know this video is under review for an hour or two isn't a bad idea  As long as at no point are they really messing with the important public discussion that comes from that  But then we are gonna see right you know what counts as important public discussion, and what does not or elements of?  You know certainly anything that Isis is promoting or anything that any other terrorist group is promoting  Is it is something that you know Facebook has no interest in and we should not have an interest in frankly  in viewing it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mean I get I get all that about Facebook and  You know they don't want to put ads up against someone being shot, but I mean I just saw all to sir Austin  sterling shot  Fully it wasn't like it was  We saw him get pop-up pop in the camera just turns away, and that was on every single page everywhere all over Facebook and  There wasn't a this might disturb you put up on those videos because I want you to stop it  But I mean like if that was the case I get it, but again you are a multi-national  Company you are the biggest thing in the world everybody's addicted to you do not tell me  Give me an adult  Reasonable response you have PR teams out the wazoo you got lawyers out the wazoo these stupid petty answers  They give insane and disrespectful. Oh, we don't have a team that  Handles the topics oh wait. We do have people that actually I mean just stop and those are the wrong people to make the decisions

Start time: 1495.28
End time: 1528.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you're exactly right wrong people make decisions are PR people and lawyers because they represent the brand where what?  Yeah, they need someone to represent the public's interest when you become so embroiled in what is as a Siva says important in  In the public now there were there's another case today where Dallas there was a you know reported case in a  parking garage next to police headquarters in Dallas and the police asked TV not to broadcast well  Are they gonna go to Facebook and say please cut off all live feeds from this area?  And as Facebook gonna say yes or no  They're gonna have to come to policy decisions on how to react to this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mean it was what you mean by good thing. I mean like there will be good consequences. I think the  The fact that these two events hit us so hard is a direct result of the fact that people were ready willing and able  To capture these scenes of brutality and distribute them so widely and and as far as I can see  We are gonna be better off in the long run because of the suffering that these two human beings went through  Now does that mean every  Incident and every result of live broadcasting by citizens in the public is going to be good  No, certainly there will be some something where there's a serious misuse  but  You know look this is what we this is how we've decided to live and and we have to figure out  Not just what the big institutions are going to do with this material  Which is what how we open this conversation big institutions like Facebook  What is their level of responsibility here, but we are actually gonna have to figure it out for ourselves  we're gonna have to come as  As as adults ourselves as citizens ourselves and say alright under the following conditions  what I'm gonna send out here or capture here is is  Exploitative or not is gratuitous or not is going to help or not  Some of the questions are gonna be easy you see cops beating up in our marbles  You see cops beating up in our own person. That's an easy call  But some of them are not going to be so easy  And and and they're we're gonna have another 20 to 25 years of these discussions as we see edge cases  Come up come up through here. It's important. Remember also that that  we are  We went through  75 years of living in a video graphical  news world  First photographs and then then television video that have been highly selected highly edited  You know CBS News in  Had very strict standards on how much blood they would show from the Vietnam War  And and so we have been living in a world for a long time in which  we had been shielded from the full brutality of

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I still think that's better than having  edited CBS decide that well  We don't want to show too much blood in the Vietnam conflict because not because probably they had a political agenda  In fact Walter Cronkite eventually came out against the war more so because they didn't want to offend their viewers and I remember  watching CNN  Anderson Cooper warned everybody we're gonna show you very graphic video. I think it was the  the Baton Rouge shooting  They pause it now and it well he said and we're gonna show it to you all of it  And then it was edited and he was kind of surprised. He said I don't know. I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was edited  So there's the same sensibilities obviously, right?  That's okay, that's appropriate I guess  That's where Facebook has an opportunity because it is the unexpurgated unedited version of the story

Transcript:  It's back to see this point about being live is that it you know  They take my phone away from me. They try to erase the file. Sorry the file is in the cloud  Oh, it's been seen. It's too late  And so putting a delay on that is a has a very huge implications  That if witness if others people cannot witness what's happening, and if it can be it becomes a form of prior restraint  If we expect the platforms to hold back live is the is why she went to Facebook live  It's why the value was there because witnesses were with her and she wanted them there  And even if it was two people before it became two thousand before it became two million  It mattered because she was not alone in witnessing what was happening and then having an impact on that so

I don't know how many times you guys been pulled over but even when you watch any of these recordings the cops get super extra  22% aggressive when they see a phone out. Oh you want to record me okay?  Well, and then bubba bubba bye it turns up  So you know Facebook live like you said they could take your phone away  They could smack your phone it could smash your phone so at least for a second for a minute or however long you can run it  Yes, it's going out for somebody else to help you because I've never recorded the last time I got stopped  I did put the audio record on and I set my phone down in a dash because  He literally pulled me over for no reason and I was freaking out so I did audio record that but I  Can't hold my phone up record you and Sam record you because then they catch attitude and it goes through the roof  But live I have somebody like you said two people one person somebody's out there to be like hey

Transcript:  There's yeah, I mean, but it obviously ridiculous  Right so so the but the thing is though that doesn't mean it's cost-free right so as  As a good dr. Owen has said right it's there is you are putting yourself at risk for more aggressive behavior  You are putting your phone at risk physically and otherwise  You are likely to be drawn into a very difficult day or weekend  If you choose to do this so and everyone understands that everyone who's you know?  Likely to face this sort of situation understands those costs now we have different costs  If if I'm standing on the side of the road, and I see something that I think should be captured  I'm gonna get less flack than some of the other people who might do that largely because I'm less of a target than some  Other people for all the obvious reasons and you know that's part of our problem  That we don't all have equal status as citizens exercising our rights whether they're First Amendment or obviously Second Amendment rights  In this country now  but nonetheless the cops will lie to you and tell you that you shouldn't be doing this and and they you know  Doesn't matter what the law is they will say you shouldn't be doing this but  Absolutely, you could and should be doing it and the ACLU has a simple site that guides you through this  Tells you what to say to an officer in this situation how to calmly explain what you're doing and that you mean no harm  And all of that's good advice and and any there are a number of other sites that talk you through this  But absolutely now it doesn't mean though as citizens. We should probably use our discretion  You know because sometimes we might interpret what is not a particular and a particularly antagonistic situation  We might help to escalate it especially if you're dealing with someone with mental illness for instance  So sometimes you do have to read the situation with some experience and sophistication, but you know that's not always possible

Transcript:  So I think in the case of Facebook one of the things we have to  What this ultimately boils down to is that they have to embrace?  Realize and embrace the fact that it is an editorial platform and that every editorial platform  Has its sort of editorial policy its you know point of view its mission  And so you know in the case of you know twit it has its mission tech Republic has its mission  Every time we had started social media

Transcript:  They definitely you know and maybe  Maybe we're seeing the seed of that in Zuckerberg's response  Where he put said well, I hope we never have to see another video like diamonds  It reminds us why coming together to build a more open and connected  Remember those two world is so important and how far we still have to go  So that's a little bit of an acknowledgement that they've got a lot of work to do which they do  But the open and connected part. I think is  What those are the words that they use again and again in there and have used in their mission  Statement which is interesting because there's things of what they do which are very much not open or connected  You look at the policies  They're in a policy internet policy in India you look at some of the things the fact that it is a closed platform  And why it's such a valuable platform nevertheless what they?  What they want to the values that they say they want to portray is to build this sort of open-connected world  Remember it is a publicly held company mark may have all the best intentions in the world

Transcript:  But he also has a fiduciary responsibility to the shareholders not to you know hurt the value of the company  And I'm sure this is the same conversation that went through the minds of CBS's management during the Vietnam War  That went through the minds of CNN when Anderson Cooper tried to play the full video and yeah couldn't  They've got to make these they've got it and Facebook's gonna have to do this, too  They also faces liability if they let us make all the decisions about what gets up on there right so they face liability if what?

Start time: 2260.50
End time: 2331.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We record and post violate someone's privacy they face liability if what we record and post  Is potentially obscene and recording according to any local law could be China really and you make a good point  It's not just in the US yeah, we could libel someone I could libel someone on a video  And and posted on Facebook and Facebook might be at least brought into the suit  Yeah, I choosing to run it because they are the public so there's no way for them to use some sort of safe harbor  So there is section 235 and there is for both the public and the public to use the same kind of privacy  There is for both obscenity and for copyright safe harbor but it is and that helps in the United States  But Facebook is a global company and anything I post is visible in Canada and Turkey and India and so and you know  I have followers in all those places so so that you know there are so many different venues in which Facebook could get in trouble  Which is why they do have this team of lawyers and they do run these questions through and they come up with a baseline  That protects them through most of the world through most of time or they figure out how to segregate the world with their publication policies

Transcript:  But and going beyond it's not parochial but the local the the national concerns that we're going through here in the US you have to think that  Every country has some fear of Facebook live video yes because if if you're a totalitarian society trying to keep a lid on what's going on

Transcript:  Italy where there's just a court case this last week that says that news organizations should erase content more than two years old now the right to be forgotten has gone to absurd lengths this idea that you can control knowledge and control information and control what happened in the world is a legacy of an institutional world that is not going to exist and it may take a century to get there but there's no possibility logically in the future that you can control information that well

Transcript:  But in the meantime that's why this is this is why Facebook cannot be counted on right now and Google cannot be counted on right now to be the you know completely open platform that you know people may have dreamed about and that Zuckerberg boasted about in his in his letter to investors it's just there are just too many different areas of regulation and too many different value systems that they're working in and the US model is not universal  and and so you know because of that they have to be very careful I mean they have it is so easy for instance to violate India's laws against insulting anyone's religion it's very easy and lots of people are in prison right now in India for saying something that we would consider fairly innocent about someone else's religion

Transcript:  so it's a really dangerous thing and Facebook could find itself in some big trouble just by going along with that level of publication you know this reminds me of is the encryption the encryption debate is a very similar debate but these technologies have a tendency once they exist to permeate they run ahead of the societal readiness you know for them but this is also part of you know we can't get away from the fact this is part of this larger trend that I know has been a recurring theme on Twitter out 2016 where we've been talking about  which is this movement of media from these sort of individual platforms their own individual platforms to these larger platforms be it Google be it Twitter be it Facebook be it medium wherever it is that you know these are the places where the users are and so more and more media are being you know sucked into putting their content there so it's related to not just periscope  but it's also related to you know and Google and it's related to Facebook articles instant articles is related to all these things that these platforms themselves are becoming the the the newspaper they're becoming the television channel and so what does that mean that means a lot right it means that more people can become part of the conversation but it also means that you know these safeguards that have been in place these sort of guidelines that have been one in early  turned over a long time right are in some cases thrown out the door in some places have to be rethought and deserve to be rethought but in but in at the same time there are a number of things that we're throwing out that you know don't that that are a problem right editorial policies

Transcript:  you've made this argument Jeff which is that it's not really any different from the days of highly concentrated media power we didn't question the the bias of the New York Times or see or Edward Armour's Tiffany Network so often I was gonna say who didn't well I think you know what I grew up in the 60s I don't think when Walter Cronkite said that the Vietnam War is unwinnable  that carried a huge amount of weight in this country is probably why LBJ did not run for president again oh and you go first you go first now my go first is I heard all that international talk I'm talking about Facebook here well I'm just making the point that we're worried about Facebook's editorial bias in all of this but is it how isn't it better than it was even if we didn't acknowledge it in the 60s there was always there's always been this editorial this is Jeff's always been Jeff's point there's always been this editorial bias and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now it's just out there in the open and clear there's also more opportunity for more people to speak and yes the argument is made that Facebook and company have a level of control that they become the new gatekeepers except my problem with that is that if we call I don't I think social media is a misnomer we in media see the world godlike and think that it because it looks like us it's media Facebook's not a mediator so much as it is an enabler however it does in these in these stories here have a role of mediation and that's an issue and I think back to to what's  what was saying I think what's important is for us in journalism and media and the academic rather than seeing Facebook is the enemy in this case we should be giving them cover and giving them principles and pushing them to operate under principles so that when they do get pressure from anywhere we stand with them behind free speech that's not the way it's working out right now is the worst day at all they're taking over our job they're just technologists they're awful people they're greedy bastards they're hurting our business they're the enemy and we're fighting them well the point  is we can no longer have the hubris to think that everyone is going to come to us as destinations yeah we have to go to where the people are whether that is Facebook or snapchat or wherever it is we have to serve the public where and how the public wants to be served and then when we do use those platforms and they are not aware of these principles and they are immature in this thinking then what we should be doing is helping them they should educate us about business and technology we should educate them about the principles of public information and that is there is a much broader diversity of voices I'm not

Transcript:  yeah so if I could say a few things about Dallas please Siva so I just read just minutes ago and I and I tweeted it a story from the Dallas Morning News in which the chief of police and the mayor discussed why they chose to use the lethal robot to defuse the situation and and kill the the perpetrator and you know as I look through it and I've been thinking a lot about the decision to use the robot  you know what what have we opened up what implications are there are we removing the kind of ethical decision making putting ourselves at such a distance when we as the as as the state decide to use a weapon like this and I haven't come to an answer I don't think anybody could or should come to an answer today but looking through how the police chief and the mayor went through their thought process it seems like they  satisfied what they needed to satisfy at that moment they judged that this man was in no position to surrender he was not interested in surrendering they deemed him to be unwilling to interact at a level that could have yielded a decent outcome he was barricaded and armed to the degree that  an assault by officers would have put officers almost certainly at lethal risk and so it seems to me again total amateur that they thought carefully about the implications and they had standards and protocols for when they would use this weapon and they went by the book so I have no argument with their decision in this particular case  lot of facts in the year and the reddit thread and I will put a link in our show but I would raise here is though that what worries me is the next opportunity yes for a less enlightened less thoughtful police department to make a less informed more gut level decision to send a robot in before exhausting all other possibilities that now of course that possibility exists with nonlethal weapons like grenades and  stun grenades tear gas and so forth but they are nonlethal we're talking about a weapon you said a distance that puts no human at risk it's almost too easy and too tempting a solution to a situation and so I worry about again five days five months from now a police department that is nowhere near as prepared or thoughtful as  Dallas is and by the way I think we can all agree with a little we know about Dallas over the past week that they have an exemplary police force and an outstanding police chief but the rest of America is not so lucky and I'm well and I think it wouldn't be as much of a concern if we weren't already using predator drones to all over the world to anonymously facelessly and you know and again  kill our enemies face was but in at least one case assassinating an American citizen without due process without charges without a trial assassinating which should be and probably is illegal in fact right but we did it and no one's facing any repercussions for it so what I'm afraid is that just like the domestication of body armor the domestication of battle ready vehicles armored vehicles in our streets the domestication  of semi-automatic and automatic weapons the domestication of the remote control kill device is that the sort of technology we want to invite into our communities if we're going to let's have very open strict fervent conversations about the standards of use so we don't have some some unthoughtful untrained decision makers  deciding to use that irresponsibly now one very slippery slope about Dallas though before I went aggressive I mentioned that that article I just tweeted is from the Dallas Morning News the Dallas Morning News which is a newspaper I used to work for did an exemplary job in the 24 hours after that shooting everybody who was available in town drove to the newsroom and and volunteered their time  to make sense of the moment to take stock of their community and each one of those reporters and editors and copy editors every single one of those people felt for their city they were bleeding inside for their city they knew their city had been torn apart and they also knew they had a role to play in the next step in the healing in the in the process of making sense and in defusing the tension and I I am in awe of the staff of the Dallas Morning News the production of the news  production was outstanding their their their speed of production was outstanding and they got every fact right and you might remember that almost no other news organization got everything right in the morning after we had all kinds of stupid posts about how there were multiple shooters and so forth

Transcript:  the Dallas Morning News nailed it because they knew their community they knew their police officers they knew their community activists they had witnesses to interview they got everything right they got it timely and they were brave at every step we um we're working on a story on that we you know we chose not to publish something quickly on the story because it is a story of such import and there are potentially huge implications for this and so we're trying to gather information also to see what other  what other police departments are prepared to use force in this way right because I think one of the biggest surprises with that they were prepared to do this right because they clearly thought about this before and considered you know this scenario playing out and so if they did others have to and so we're looking into you know what other police you know departments are considering this use of force what are the guidelines they're going to put in place to use them as well as

Transcript:  the ones from that that Dallas is used as well as what does the law actually say in terms of what they can do and then how did they extrapolate this from the military because that's obviously where you know this came from the Dallas News and I'm quoting the article Siva says police departments across the country have been training for this particular scenario using a robot remote controlled robot to detonate explosive for years but it's believed to be the first time a chief has ever made the call to use explosives to kill a suspect and to stand off and  the reason this is of concern of course is this short circuit of due process etc etc yes Jeff are you are you down with a robo judge dread to me that's a very sensationalistic way to put that well no it is judge dread that's what it is I guess it is I made a decision it wasn't autonomous no humans made the decision it's just think of it as a bomb on a stick I mean the fact that it's a robot is that's Judge Dredd goes in and does the job the person sitting

Transcript:  there with the controller moves the robot it's still a person controlling the robot is Judge Dredd Jeff what do you think yeah I think I think I think I think it's the bigger question of the militarization there's a picture I put up on the feed about about an amazing photo and and you see basically a lone woman standing calmly against storm troopers and and and and you understand why police right now are wearing body armor after Dallas okay I get that but but what does that what does even that do to their  relationship to the community to their their view of threats to what they do what does it mean to have all this equipment that may have people behind it but is but is clearly overpowering mere citizens you know Tiananmen Square and a man versus a versus a tank and and it's not about the technology it's about the imbalance that's created I'm not trying to suggest that the god knows I'm not gonna make an NRA argument here the citizens as you say this just fuels the NRA this absolutely fuels the NRA right  gotta recognize that that and the mayor and police chief of Dallas talked about this a bit isn't they they have to make decisions about how to go into the community and how to protect themselves at the same time and what they do and they have to recognize the implications of that I did hear police on TV today talk about how they need to have discussions about the ethical standards of the use of this technology same with droid drones could have done the same thing on a local level not just in Afghanistan is it different from

Transcript:  they have cell phones where you can set a bomb in the cell phone deliver the cell phone to the person you want to kill they've got a phone like hello and then you build our brains out so it's also easier to make a robot bulletproof than it is a human right so in that sense but you know so I would actually make and I'm not sure this is an argument I would actually make sincerely but you know I'm a professor and this is the kind of thing we do in the classroom we set up sort of devil's advocate so I'm not convinced I'm right about this but I could make  I could construct an argument that using the robot as they use the robot was a more just more humane more thoughtful way of dealing with an intransigent threat to officers and other people than the standard SWAT and sniper collective because the decision had to be deliberated it had to be made at the top of the chain whereas with a sniper you have discretion by the general  man or gentlewoman whose finger is on the trigger in addition to the discretion of several officers on the way to the police chief so I have to click the button to detonate the robot several right but somebody's not feel that responsibility but that person could be standing next to the chief that person could be is we're in an early enough situation right now where that decision was clearly made at the top that that decision was clearly made actually in a calmer state  with a bulletproof non-harmable robot like even if he the guy blows up the robot somehow no human dies they lose a few hundred thousand dollars but in that sense you the police can actually be at a lower level of anxiety with no officers life at stake then had they burst through this clearly wasn't a sniper situation and it might have just gone with the sniper but had someone the thing is concerning is that we put

That's the the leap that  Once you you know, we get comfortable enough with this technology that comes next and that's where the ultimate  Ethical and you know societal dilemma comes in right when you actually empower the machine to take a human life  On its own and so that's philosophical but that's the logical next step that a lot of people are  Naturally and rightfully afraid of

Transcript:  Well right now we were also when you talk about the guy that there was with the camera shirt and had the gun  I have so many people say oh, you know as a black man  How stupid is he to go out there and do I was like well the thing is in America  There are rights bestowed upon us until they take them away and a person in Minnesota who apparently had a permit and was legally  Firearm was shot. He was shown solidarity with his NRA permit carrying brother and carrying a gun that was  Unloaded out to an event of protest to protest the fact that you can't take our guns away  You can't shoot me for having a gun being a black man. Now was he bold?  Oh lord, this man has brass of steel  but at the same time he was  protesting for the right that he's allowed to have and as much as you know  They put his picture out there if they were some kind of great technology where they could actually circulated that image within the  police force  Officer would have been on the radio say look I got the guy right here already got his gun  What do you want me to do with him because he was are he had already turned in his gun before they put his?  Picture on for the world to see and left it up on their Twitter getting 2,000 retweets an hour until 2 o'clock in the afternoon  I was checking hourly  If they would have some way to communicate they could have gotten that information so technology of bound  We still have a lot of ways to go and hopefully when they're in these kind of crisis they could think about that  Because they already had that man in custody and they're putting his picture out for the world to see and judge and

We'll move on but of course our deepest sympathy to the  Fallen the families of the fallen officers and and the two people who were shot and of course, yes  If sometimes I feel like we're in a war zone  but at the same time I I wonder how much of this is because of the 24-hour news cycle and our  our  Synaptic level connection to every little thing that happens in the world. It's hard for us to escape  The news and it's important to remember that you know what?  90% of what's going on 99% is fine. Yeah, and  And good and in fact, I'm gonna talk about Pokemon go in a little bit and how that's brought some good into the world  And I think you've even said that Owen right you  You can focus on the bad things and they're brought into our living rooms  They're brought into our lives in a way that's unique these days because of how interconnected we are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, I  Don't have a problem with the constant barrage of bad news because I think we needed to be shaken out of our  Complacency a lot of us. Yeah needed to be shaken out of our complacency in our in our sense that  We were living in a kind country  in a kind world I  I  Appreciate not as taxing as it is  If we're going to be responsible citizens and responsible adults  We're gonna have to face the fact that a lot of our neighbors are really horrible people  And do horrible things to each other and and if we're gonna make these things better we're gonna have to confront them  That does also involve though  Figuring out how to put things in perspective  Understanding what risk is versus non risk real risk versus fake risk so for instance having your kid  kidnapped while walking to school is certainly not going to happen for  percent of families in America under any condition, it's not a real problem in America  but  Having a friend an uncle a clergy member a scout leader someone you you trust and know  Hurt your child is a very real possibility not a high probability  But a real one we should be concerned about and yet the media barrage makes us flip our anxieties  so that we worry more about the stranger who doesn't exist than the friend or relative who does and  I don't know a way out of that  given the  Incentive systems for our media right now  But I know that when we come to a situation like we've experienced over the last three days  It actually makes me feel optimistic about the fact that we are confronting a level of violence  Against african-americans that has remained  unabated for 400 years, but largely ignored by people outside of  the collection of people likely to be victims right so most Americans have no idea  What lynching was about and the pervasiveness of it most Americans have no idea about the re-enslavement of african-americans  starting in the late 19th century right up through  Through things like vagrancy laws most Americans have no idea about the violence perpetrated against latino-americans  consistently from about 1900 to about 1970 throughout the southwest including  Being forced labor situations  You know all of those crimes against our neighbors against our fellow citizens have gone  Unacknowledged it's not like putting cell phones in everybody's hands is going to suddenly make us acknowledge those things  But now when we're forced to see the brutality that we're capable of as a society  It opens up that discussion and we're at least allowed to put these things on the table

Transcript:  Though I think that Siva you when you mentioned the the economic  Motivations that are here that remains a problem what I'm thinking about a lot and discussion  I want to have with you at length offline is  What we're witnessing in media is the death of the mass media business model, but it's holding on by the fingernails  Yeah, and and it's seeking  Traffic for traffic sake volume reach frequency for their own sake and the way it does that is by exploiting a baser instincts whether that's  Crime or sex or hatred or or?  Whatever it may be and and it doesn't become an honest view of the world  So I absolutely agree that it's a good thing that we are facing the things we're facing right now  But too much of 24-hour news too much of what we see in media too much  What we see in politics is based around a mass model of just trying to put out something  That's going to attract people back to us rather than  Real value real change real impact and improvement in society at some point  We have to judge media and journalism on whether it improves lives and improve society and right now  I don't think it's doing a very good job of that uncle Leo

They are local. They are distributed. They are  largely  Originally in Arabic right there are lots of arguments against Isis made by the 99% of the Muslim world that has  Nothing to do with Isis and actually despises it. Yes  You know, you can't credit the US with it, but you know, it's good that it's all part of a plan  But look and the other thing is Isis has been on the run for two years  It's been steadily losing territory and unable to build itself out as an actual  functioning state  Consistently, so there are a lot of good reasons that Isis is losing right now.

We have  replaced  What was heavy racial and ethnic segregation and a situation where we really only spoke to our co-workers neighbors?  Fellow churchgoers, etc. We've replaced that with class segregation. It was zip code segregation now. It's class  So it turns out we do actually talk to people of different religious and political affiliations  With some regularity if we are of a class strata that allows for that comfortable level of interaction  But we almost never speak to people who share our ethnic or religious  Affiliations who are of a different socioeconomic class because we've resegregated America so much  Along for instance school district lines

You've got to have a way of getting that data back and you know what's really bad ransomware  And we're seeing this big time 95% of all  Fishing emails these days contain ransomware viruses  That means a virus and we're seeing it on phones too now amazingly a virus that gets on your system  Locks your data and then says pay us if you ever want to see your data again, you know what the curious carbonite  That local backup may not help you because it's gonna back up those encrypted files too  But carbonite has versioning on Windows and that means you can go back to the  Previous version of the file that was unencrypted delete the virus first restore your data  You're good to go and you didn't give 300 bucks to the bad guy. You gave carbonite like five bucks a month  That's that's where carbonite starts five bucks a month for everything on your computer  They buy it by the year, which is nice. So you can set it and forget it  It's backing up whenever you're online. You don't even have to think about it  No downtime carbonite has one and a half million customers at home and small businesses  500 billion files backed up, but the one I really like is 50 billion files restored  That's 50 billion files that would have been lost forever carbonite. You got to try it free  In fact, I really encourage you try it free first pick your pick your plan at carbonite comm  You don't need to give them a credit card  Just our offer code twit and the reason I want you to do that besides the fact that we get credit is then you get  Two months free when you buy  You gotta back it up to get it back do it, right?  with carbonite  Try it free.

Transcript:  Well, that's yeah, so that was an interesting question I remember was it Stacy who brought that up or you Jeff  I don't know what the answer is  Is this zero rating Netflix because Netflix will no longer count against your bandwidth? Yeah true  Yes, that's true. It doesn't count  However, I should point out the Comcast has raised its bandwidth cap to like a terabyte now, so it's not really interesting  It's not it's not there's not much of a cab  Yeah, it's zero rating  The problem was zero rating is very hard to explain to normal people why that's a bad thing because they're getting oh  You mean I can listen like it's free. I can watch all the Netflix. I want a T-mobile Wow, that's awesome  No, it's not. Yeah, but explain go ahead and try to explain it. I've tried. Yeah, I give up

Yeah, we mean well, we're just trying to lift you  We're going to bring you walks the civilized world  Very few people in India fell for that and but the zero rating became  folded into the fact that  India and its tech world is very committed to network neutrality because they are trying to develop  Indigenous platforms, they're the up-and-comers  Right, they want to invent the next Facebook and the next Google and they don't like being told that they have to take hours  so  So it it tapped into nationalism it tapped into which is actually stronger than anti-colonialism  Oh interesting, but but there also was a  a  fundamental concern for  The Indian tech industry and its ability to compete and the fact that in many of those cases those  Particular services that Facebook had chosen  For instance, there was one service chosen to help people find jobs like a job search app  Well, it turns out there are ten major job search app companies in India all competing for that market  So nine of them were really upset that they weren't chosen  And they all mounted the campaign against this and for network neutrality  and that was a that was a big reason Facebook just didn't think this stuff through because they were used to dealing with  launching free basics in  places like Botswana where there isn't a developed tech industry and there isn't widespread concern about network neutrality because  Most people have never heard about the network in places like that  So being real first movers mattered in place of it, but they totally misread India

She called we have we have a system in place where depending on what's going on  She calls her mother or she calls my mother women you've trained her not to call the police  Trained her not to call the police when she's with me. Yes, and that's what my last name is gonna be  I hope to live in a while. I don't have to teach my daughter to do things. Yeah, that's gonna make me cry Wow  I I want to live in a world where it's okay when she's with her mother to call the police  But I fear when she's with me  I've been pulled over 30 times in the last two years and I'm a very quote-unquote friendly  Speakable guy, but in the last four years  I've had three of those cops pull guns on me where I had to deescalate the situation  Because they were just out of control and I fear that if she ever something happened to me and she called the cops and she  Had fear in her voice. They might show up see her  I'm not all the time and people think that I've kidnapped a little white child  So I wouldn't want a cop to show up and her be upset and think that I'm the aggressor and something go wrong  So depending on a situation  She calls her mother or she calls my mother and then they get to make the decision on whether the police are called  Or not and I don't like living in that world. I don't like living in that reality  I just want everybody to be somewhat more responsible and respectable other people's feelings. I want black people to live  I want police to live. I mean I can't say blue lives matter more than black lives, but all lives matter  But right now it's it's a very dangerous time and I just want people to realize that it's also a great time  I'm sitting here uncle Leo  You know  He done saw my inheritance not plan on taking over him in the near future when he retires and things to be positive  My daughter is beautiful and she is healthy and she is driving me crazy and those are all good things for me to be happy  About so, you know, I'm upset.
