Start time: 283.42
End time: 347.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean considering half the market for any phone it should be women  you know the event was very it was just Samsung wanted to put on a big show  and I think actually the most telling thing about it was at one point they said  you know we're gonna launch this phone on you know two billion carriers in  something like a hundred and fifty five countries and that's when I began to  like thinking about it it's like oh that's why this was so terrible because  when you have that many people you can only end up at the lowest common  denominator right and the very sad truth  is that the lowest common denominator is just  stereotypes of people it's everyone is like this right and that's  to me it's you have to be smarter than that  you have to think to yourself well we're talking to this huge audience  but the people who are covering it the people who are gonna  be there and talk about it afterwards are not necessarily the huge audience  there are people sitting in New York and tech fans around the world who are a  little bit more sophisticated than a hundred and fifty five countries on  three hundred carriers and I think that's really I'm not even sure

Start time: 347.64
End time: 367.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I I see what you're saying but that was but they had to know who they were  presenting to because like you said the audience for the actual show that they  put on I'd be very surprised if that was many more people than tech media and  total tech and half a million women no half a million people watched on

Start time: 369.64
End time: 373.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_14

Start time: 374.48
End time: 393.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  than just tech media or enthusiasts I mean it just it was tons of people I  mean my biggest problem as I told me I was like it was more the lack of  wireless than the making fun of women or whatever else was going on the  presentation but I mean I ran into people there that I was like why are you  here and like oh we just got a ticket yeah how did you get a ticket how do

Start time: 393.82

Start time: 434.80
End time: 495.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  mad about not having wireless and there's a guy behind me he was like I flew  in from Germany for this I mean Samsung opened it up I mean they were holding  contest to your fans tickets that's great so all of that is great and I think  what I think ultimately what happens is when a giant corporation decides to  deliver marketing messages to people they forget that people are actually  people and not a collection of demographic information like women you  know like if you just reduce women to like here are the activities women do  with the phone here are concerns we've heard about using a touchscreen phone  from women in surveys you yeah go ahead well I just you immediately lose the  fact that that people are actually people and you start thinking of them is  how can we effectively talk to these like disconnected disembodied concerns  and then you generate this thing and I you know there's a there's like the only  silver lining is like at least at least it wasn't as stupid as some of the other

Start time: 495.50
End time: 518.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  stuff they've done right what have they done that was stupider than that I mean  the sad thing to me is that they were to be to be totally clear I don't think any  of this as I said on CNBC is it gonna affect sales of the phone and really  right phones gonna be absolutely fine right gonna sell like gangbusters gonna  do great if anything they did a disservice to the phone by not just

Start time: 518.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  introducing a new phone and a new phone that is a really great successor to a  really popular phone and then the saddest thing all is that I think they  were actually trying to sell the phone to women and that's why they had so many  examples of context in which women or at least one dimensional cartoon character

Start time: 536.90
End time: 574.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  ladies might want to use it right so I think that's the thing so they're  this is what I'm saying this is where they improved they actually had the  product involved much more so like you know in 2011 at CS they had a whole  presentation and the point that presentation was gonna get this order  wrong they were moving from digital humanism to human digitalism not even  kidding like that I had the kid from Billy Elliot dancing around and saying  insane crap and I don't know why that happened look I still was amazing it was  amazing and I had a lot of fun I can't think of another tech press conference

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  yeah I think it's also interesting that Bitcoin arouses such energy in people  like oh yeah I would think you'd be in favor because it's because it's a  currency like it is private and non-governmental it's not private I

Transcript:  with more of the best of this week in tech including our farewell to Aaron  Schwartz and the announcement that Yahoo is was going to buy a tumbler for 1.1  billion dollars our show today brought to you by pro XP N I know a lot of you  are concerned about privacy online all of you I know a lot of you are worried  about things like the six strikes rules that the American Internet Service  providers have adopted perhaps some of you worried about you know geographic  restrictions it'll keep you from watching the shows you want whenever you  want a good solution for this is something called an open VPN now of  course you can run your own open VPN server and some hardcore geeks I know do  that but it's a lot of trouble and it's easy to get it wrong so most of us use  hosted open VPN my favorite my choice pro XP N comm that's X not V pro XP N  comm if you go to pro XP N comm slash tweet you can learn all about it one of  the things that's unique about pro XP N is that they have servers all over the  world so you understand that a open VPN encrypts the data from your machine to  the open VPN server and at that point it goes on to the public internet they have  the point of that is you know if you're an open access spot at a Wi-Fi you know  open access but at a coffee shop people can't see what you're doing everything  you do is in an encrypted tunnel it's it's you know completely private if you  are worried about your internet service provider at home same thing they cannot  see what you're doing it's a completely blank slate to them but at some point  all traffic has to emerge under the public internet so you can interact with  the sites you want to the one of the advantages that a pro XP N has is that  they are not a US based open VPN provider they have US servers Dallas  Seattle Los Angeles in New York but they're based globally they're in  Singapore they're in Amsterdam they have London servers as well so you can emerge  into the public internet pretty much anywhere you want that is very nice in  eliminating geographic restrictions it also means that they are not under the  oversight or this we might put it a little differently the spying of the NSA  you've got what you what you really deserve anonymous use of the internet  without oversight without snooping very easy to use it works via open VPN some  platforms mobile platforms chiefly don't support open VPN they they can use PPTP  but in almost every case you can use open VPN including on Android and iOS  they've really got great mobile apps for both Android and iOS the Android app  just came out that allow you to use open VPN pro XP N directly on those mobile  platforms that's really nice because frankly when you're on a mobile device  you are often in a public situation and privacy really does become important  they do have a free version if you want to try it out but I think you're gonna  want to use the paid versions very affordable normally $10 a month about  if you buy a year's worth lots more features with the premium version but  here's the special deal if you use our offer code twit to zero you're gonna get  20% off that premium account not just for the first month or the first year  but forever so we're talking less than five bucks a month when you get a yearly  plan that is a very good deal of course you can cancel anytime within the first  seven days for a total refund this is a very good way to do it I want you to  visit pro XP and comm slash twit you can pay for your account if you decide to  buy with visa PayPal or Bitcoin which I love for real anonymity this is a great  service pro XP and comm slash twit and don't forget when you buy use the offer  code twit to zero and you'll get 20% off even if you paying Bitcoin 20% off pro  XP and comm slash twit offer code twit to zero now it's time to return to our  best of episode it was it was a tough I think a tough week for us when news came  out this is really it was at the beginning of the year that internet  activist one of the creators of RSS had passed away due to it seemed undue  government pressure in their prosecution of him as a hacker and it  perhaps not the happiest moment on twit but we I think we owed Aaron a goodbye  and this is this is what we did before we get back to see yes I think we should  mention Aaron Swartz what an interesting fella teen prodigy if you read Cory  Dr. Oh and boing-boing had a very touching heartfelt eulogy for Aaron  Larry Lessig who knew Aaron had a very touching eulogy he everybody seemed to  know this kid starting with the eight around the age of 14 when he started  showing up at computer conferences and trade shows he was a right about that  age when he helped write the specification for RSS which we use  that's how we do podcasts he was wrote some of the early code for reddit and  sold the code to a reddit and if he's sometimes called a founder I don't think  that's quite accurate but he but he certainly wrote much of the code that  reddit's running and he became a political activist in a very interesting  way Larry Lessig wrote he was brilliant and funny a kid genius a soul a  conscience the source of a question I've asked myself a million times what would  Aaron think this is Larry Lessig the Harvard constitutional law professor  unfortunately Aaron committed suicide killed himself on Friday at the age of  26 and Larry Lessig and many others including the family blamed the US  government Larry says that person has gone today driven to the edge by what a  decent society would only call bullying I get wrong but I also get proportionality  and if you don't get both you don't deserve to have the power of the United  States government behind you here's what happened Aaron believed like all hackers  that information wants to be free there's a video of Aaron speaking he  started freeing information early on he it's interesting he liberated the US  legal code so there's a system called pacer that gives you in the United  States gives us access to case law paid access to case law now case law is public  domain case law is what all the courts have ruled about stuff it's what you  would use if you were defending yourself with the precedents with the legal  every lawyer has a law library but then they also go online to pacer and for a  fee they download these judgments but those judgments belong to all of us their  public domain there the US courts so activists built something called recap  and encouraged its users to take their case law downloads after they did it and  post them on recap perfectly legal because it's our stuff and recap was  free and open and anybody can use it well Aaron took some of the money he  made from the sale of reddit and bought 20% of the pacer content and posted it  on recap that's a guy who believes information should be free the the he  got in trouble with the feds the FBI investigated him Corey Doctorow says it  looked like he'd be on the pointy end of some bad legal stuff but he escaped it  all in emerged triumphant because in fact he didn't break any laws there wasn't  anything to do but he did raise the ire of the United States federal law  enforcement he annoyed a lot of people doing he annoyed people he founded a  group called demand progress which was one of the real effective groups of  fighting sopa and people last year so he he might have I don't know he he he did  something that was a little reckless let's say there is another database kind  of like the pacer database it's called J story it's an academic journal database  and it charges money for access to academic journals now these aren't quite  exactly the public domain some of them some of these studies were paid for by  the federal by federal funds some of the studies are academic and paid for by  universities but it's often been a bone of contention that this stuff for  society's sake should be widely available that the scientific journals  should anybody should be able to access them shouldn't have to pay for it he was  associated with Harvard Harvard had an account with J store he used his  legitimate account but he did something J store says you can't do which is  download in bulk he in fact took a laptop snuck it into MIT put it in the

Start time: 2225.98
End time: 2231.10

Transcript:  closet in MIT and had in the closet and and and downloaded the entire database

Start time: 2233.11
End time: 2355.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  20% is it that little I thought it was more anyway it's a lot let's put yes he  took a lot J store when they caught him actually he turned himself in J store  and MIT decided to prosecute the feds of course said yeah we finally got this kid  eventually J store back down in fact an interesting thing J store just a few  weeks ago decided to make all of that information public anyway MIT according  to lessig was a little less a little more equivocal in its backing down giving  the prosecutors the federal prosecutors sufficient reason to continue forward  Aaron was facing 50 years in jail a four million dollar fine the trial was to  come in April now totally disproportionate totally disproportionate  they were treating him like a terrorist they're trying to make them and trying  to make an example how to they implied that he was stealing this data to sell  it which he wasn't he wanted to make it publicly available however he did break  laws although really 50 years worth not 50 yeah now Cory writes Aaron was a  person who had problems with depression for many years he'd written about the  subject publicly talked about it with his friends and of course there are many  things that might cause a person to want to take his own life but his friends his  family and Larry Lessig do think that the unreasonable disproportionate  reaction of the federal government had something to do with it the thought of  being in prison for 50 years might have had something to do with it so our  deepest condolences to all who knew Aaron Swartz to his family to his partner  it is just a horrible tragedy I don't think that it's really appropriate to say  it's all the feds fault but it's certainly appropriate to shine a light  on their inappropriate prosecution and I just I think it's a it's a great loss

Start time: 2356.22
End time: 2399.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  for all of us you know I think I think one of the things we can take away and  there are an interesting couple of things that are happening so academics  are starting to post PDFs of their some of the material and open sourcing it  and put it on Twitter so that it's sort of like a tribute to you know make some  information free but I think one of the other things that we can really take  away from this is you know unlike kind of a serious and slightly grim note is  that mental health and depression is something that affects a lot of people  affects a lot of people in the kind of geek and nerd community many of us kind  of you know you can laugh it off as being a little bit I'm a bit antisocial  because I'm a bit of a geek but I think we all have a little bit of responsibility  just to try and look after the people that are near us and try and say you know  try and get people to get help if they need it now Larry points out that Aaron

Start time: 2399.78
End time: 2454.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  had many friends in San Francisco and he was beloved by many he was not you know  somebody who was cut off from society so and I just we I don't want to even  speculate on on what happened the expert witness who was going to testify  on his behalf Alex Stamos who was a computer security and forensic experts  called the case of vindictive he said that Aaron did not hack the JSTOR website  he just wrote for any reasonable definition of hack he wrote a handful of  basic Python scripts that discovered the URLs of articles then used curl to  request them he did not use parameter tapping champering he did not break a  capture he did not you know do anything sneaky he did not cover his tracks or  hide his activity the government provided no evidence that these downloads  caused a negative effect on either JSTOR or MIT

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  sorry no but beyond the tragedy of losing someone who was so intelligent who  was a visionary who was actually fighting for the free information rights  of anyone who's ever used an electronic resource I think there's a there's  another story here which is how desperate the DOJ and the federal  government is to have some sort of strong case that establishes their  version of copyright and property laws in the digital digital domain we sought  with the defeat of Sopa and Pippa we sought with the bungled prosecution of  Kim dot com and mega upload and we see it here yeah and they're just they're so  desperate for a win that I think that's where that that bully attitude comes  into we want to make an example out of you there's also a fear of technology

Transcript:  assertion in one of my early posts this is like a middle-aged guy hanging out  with young people like trying to look hip so you know if they have to spend a  billion dollars to do it why not but will it work you know I don't know I  think at least it's so it's not as it's not a bad idea for them to do this  though I feel that if they were spending this kind of money they should have gone  after a company like Pinterest which is more more along the lines of Yahoo's  traditional strengths which is like you know more more women use it more more  brand-centric and more wholesome in that in some sense of the way word and  they could have made more money monetizing Pinterest much faster but  you know Tumblr is a good acquisition definitely a great acquisition I'm  happy for for David who I remember him pitching me about Tumblr in 2007  in the early days of Kika Ohm and at a coffee shop near my house and we talked  about how he wanted the whole thing to play out and it has played out as he  had planned interesting in his early days so pretty impressive he saw it  going this way yeah I'm not that he would get acquired by yo he was pretty  clear about why people would share this certain way on the web how old was he  when you talked to him I can't remember man he was like seven years ago yeah so

Transcript:  suspect that Tumblr will play into it if the deal has been done today the the  there is I think a you know someone mentioned the idea of the Exodus and he  was talking about talent but I think you also got to think about an Exodus of  users because if people are freaking out over over the idea of you of Yahoo's  culture versus Tumblr's culture you could promise autonomy but the first  time say that a big media company comes to to Yahoo and says hey you know  they're putting copyrighted material on there can you take it off please you own  it now and Yahoo puts the Bigfoot on some hot meme that that is really gonna  kind of kill off you know immediately will kill off the goodwill that it has  with its users there's already a BuzzFeed item up there about people who  on Tumblr who are already putting tumblogs up about Yahoo and so with such

Dvorak this was a pick from  Jeremy Radwan and David Crowell and Jonathan Ellis they loved these moments  but before we do that let's talk big news stories probably the biggest news  story of all in 2013 the Edward Snowden leaks and what we learned about the NSA  let's watch so welcome everybody nice to have you we got the overflow room  filled up too and a good day to be here because this is a gonna be a very  interesting topic now I know a lot of people say it's a tech show we don't  want you to talk about politics and I don't know if we are talking about  politics there's a lot of tech in this story it broke this week Glenn Greenwald  who is a blogger worked for salon for a while I'm gonna take off the tinfoil hat  if you don't mind my thoughts can now emanate freely it's actually quite hot  it's a very warm device he is a former lawyer do you know Glenn because I don't  know I've been reading him for a while he's kind of focused on security yeah  he wrote for salon for a while now writes for the Guardian broke a very big  story with a PowerPoint presentation for 41 slide PowerPoint presentation that  talked about how the NSA we almost felt like a marketing presentation fact some  people said this doesn't see this couldn't be real it's like it's like a

Start time: 3870.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  marketing presentation yeah that's what it felt like did you go through the 41  slides the 41 slides aren't released there's only like four or five he only  showed a few of them and then there's yeah what's the point of that a few

Start time: 3886.20
End time: 3888.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  that we go through the chronology of the story all right I don't know about that

Start time: 3889.02
End time: 3918.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  so the first thing the first thing that we learned from these slides is that data  collection was happening that the slides implied that Google Microsoft Facebook  and others with the notable exception of Twitter Skype yeah we're well had  giving giving the NSA privileged security their servers mm-hmm direct

Start time: 3918.40
End time: 3923.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  access direct access the key phrase in this entire affair and and frankly I

Start time: 3923.30
End time: 3962.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  think we don't really know what that means I think that there's two ways to  interpret it and in fact it's a litmus test on where your politics lie how you  interpret this so Larry Page of Google's first blog response was a blog post that  said what the dot dot dot we do not allow government access to our servers  we respond to government requests for information right we vet them with our  lawyers we fight as many as we can and when we cannot fight it we give it to  them and we do so on did he say this on a special server that we've arranged with  them no okay face mark Zuckerberg Facebook same thing we don't do this

Start time: 3962.52
End time: 3983.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  very much the same thing and before anybody even we before you even start  talking about this everybody needs to understand that the laws that allow this  say that nobody it's like Fight Club that's what's my rule you don't talk  about it nobody's allowed by law to talk about it so most of the stuff that  we've heard is probably colored by the fact that everybody's trying not to

Start time: 3983.16
End time: 3993.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  break the law a lot of these requests for information come from national  security letters most of which 97% of which has written prevent the recipient

Start time: 3993.48
End time: 4062.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  from saying anything at all well but so the the really important thing that we  don't know about this whole story is that the original story published in the  Guardian by Glenn Greenwald in the Washington Post there were simultaneous  stories basically alleged I believe the last line of the post story I don't  remember if it was Greenwald story the poster the last line was they can watch  you live type your search queries right that's the level of access they have  they have direct access to these servers whatever's on them all of your  information that's there they can see it now that story has been getting softer  and softer and softer and until now we're talking about national security  letters we're talking about you know they have specific cluster and  information the metadata stuff is like it's out there there is also another  story which I think has been conflated somewhat where there's a lawsuit filed  against Verizon and they were ordered to turn over some metadata which is not  part of this FISA stuff so there's a lot going on but the core allegation is the  government has direct and this is the key piece direct access the servers of  these enormous cloud computing companies and they can monitor them in real time

Start time: 4062.80
End time: 4103.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so the way to think about this from a technology point of view as opposed to a  political one is that big data is has come to the security world they're using  big data to do security and what that means is they're they're hoovering up as  they say in the UK all of the all the data all the metadata whatever it is  that they're getting and they're processing it the way Google processes  data in massive huge scale and they're you know slicing and dicing it and  they're filtering it and figuring out what's going on so it's a it's a really  really interesting glimpse into where everything is going everything is going  toward big data and this happens to be a security right and the question I think

Start time: 4105.02
End time: 4170.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  the problem is that's great you kind of you want the law the law enforcement  community to be making use of the tools right you want them to catch the bad  guys the question is what data are they using to catch the bad guys how much of  our data are they using and what are the constraints upon their acquisition and  retention of that data and we don't have any of those answers like not a  single one and right now where the story is and this is why I said I don't know  the rest of the slides are coming out right now the story has landed at the  Guardian the Washington Post made these incredible accusations the industry has  denied them the government has said you know your senators and your lawmakers  they all know about it both parties all the intelligence committees that keep  approving it this is just as the same as ever and there's no evidence on either  side to prove which allegation is true and then the Guardian today pivoted their  story from this pile of evidence they say they have to the person who's  presented the evidence and I think that Edward Snowden this Edward Snowden  whistleblower and I think that's really fascinating and I don't know why you  would if you have this collection of smoking guns why you would suddenly turn

Start time: 4170.80
End time: 4181.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  to the leaker instead of the evidence again we can only say you don't we don't  know I don't know do you suppose that that's because of pressure from the  government to back down or because they realize they didn't have a story I don't

Start time: 4181.30
End time: 4199.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  know I don't know and my my instinct is to be as negative as possible and to say  that the government definitely has this access they can't talk about it because  I don't know why they wouldn't want this access and I don't know why so what in  the culture of secrets secrecy that we have especially around terrorism why  they wouldn't make use of every like legal and political angle to get the

Start time: 4199.72
End time: 4245.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  access they would do it so Claire Kane Miller writing in the New York Times said  in at least two cases Google and Facebook one of the plans discussed was  to build separate secure portals like a digital version of the secure physical  rooms that have long existed for classified information in some instances  on company servers so it would be a Google server for instance through these  online rooms the government's would request data companies would deposit it  the government would retrieve it that seems like a reasonable procedure in fact  probably a more secure procedure than emailing it or sending them a box of  documents I think you'd want nothing wrong with that yeah so the question is  is that what's happening or do they really have this backdoor access and no  one knows and it really comes down to what you believe yeah and I think what

Transcript:  was so interesting is all these statements came out from the tech  companies and they were so similar so similar I mean I sat down I highlighted  them and it was like interesting it was like somebody wrote it for them well or  that they coordinated it or that they were very careful with the language I

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I totally agree with that but what I don't agree with and I think this is  where we're reading these statements these denials and parsing every word is  that there's some hidden meaning there I think that misses the point because the  point is that we need transparency for the government I think that the  companies involved are telling us everything that they can and if they're  not allowed to disclose their participation in some programs I think  they're avoiding saying that but I don't think they're actively colluding with  the government to hide things I think that is one step too far and I think if  the EFF isn't afraid of the Obama administration will file lawsuits to do  things I've no ability to understand why Google would be afraid of the  government if Google could say it and they and they and the worst would  happen them as they would get a lawsuit and David you don't have to send more

So assuming that assuming the general accusation is accurate that they're that they're gobbling up all the metadata to find out who's talking to whom and and then from that they're figuring out what to get a warrant for to go in deep.  That's the accusation and that is clearly unconstitutional.  The fishing expedition is what is really at the bottom.  Because the Fourth Amendment specifically talks about you can't do fishing expeditions they can't go to your house to see if there's anything illegal going on in your house.

The million square foot facility.  Record every phone call you've ever made all in real time and they're going to save it all they're not going to be listening to your calls just like Obama said they're going to save every call and then they'll get a warrant when they think of something that was because you're a terrorist let's say and they'll be able to grab all the old calls.

Transcript:  Working in cooperation with the phone companies so the phone I mean like saying their immunity right they've given them immunity they've I mean if you pick up a landline phone the government has been able to tap that since like the 40s right so.  And there's an expectation I mean it's in popular culture that if you know people are using burner phones on the wire because they know that the landlines are tapped.  I'm what I what I think is interesting is all of many of the companies well they want to all of them but many of them have publicly said we are not cooperating in this way we're only doing what's legally required of us and what the government has not said is what they deem to be legally required of these companies.  And that's that's the only disconnect here is the the Google and Facebook all this coordinated responses there.  They're saying what they have to say they're saying we're doing was legally required of us and we're doing our best to not overstep that.  Now the question is and the accusation is they're doing more and they're not telling you about it and the government is demanding more than you think is reasonable and nobody knows if that's true or not.

I was in London at a PC magazine UK event where we were being shown certain kinds of new technologies  that were being developed by Interpol and Interpol showed this is a network analysis.  They showed here's what we can do.  We can take all these phone calls all these phone calls the metadata who called who how long it  lasted the rest of it and we and then he showed us this this crazy network map.  He says we can spot a crime boss using this data because we can see who's you know just based on  the way they call each other and how long the calls last.

This whole valley around us is prided on weird ideas becoming reality.  And if we are constantly monitoring everyone we will clamp down on that.  There will be a chilling effect.  And you cannot tell me and we have I think we've actually done a disservice to ourselves  as participants in like the tech community.  You can't tell me where the line between your offline life and your online life begins.  And where that boundary should be and where it is for everyone.  We don't talk about it because it's not it's not important quite frankly right.  It's only important now when the government is watching everything you do in one part  of your life and there's an entire set of restrictions and constraints on the other side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It was a very bustling city.  True it's a fact.  Because we were about the northernmost point of the San Francisco Bay so.  Lumber gold food and stuff was brought to this point and then.  It shipped down to San Francisco and point south.  But the real reason for butter and eggs day because we're kind of an agricultural area  is that in the nineteen hundreds.  In Russia Jewish people were being killed in pogroms by the czar.  This is prior communist Russia and do gooders here.  So we need to save these so they were getting Jews out of Russia in the nineteen hundreds.  And the problem was you had all these basically peasants they were agricultural.  Jews and they said what are we going to have them do and it turned out as very capital.  Low capital very easy to set up chicken farms.  So they were sending these Jews up that they brought in from Russia with chicken farms.  And so there this was a huge chicken area and they're still beautiful.  Is this documented anywhere.

Well we had a farm for a while with a chicken coop with two chicken coops.  We were the original nineteen hundred chicken coops.  Big giant chicken coops.  No they're huge they're beautiful.  You should have put some chickens in it.  I refinished the floor we fixed it up it was a beautiful place.  I was thinking that I was going to.  You're going to move in.  To the chicken coop.

Of the city of Petaluma that you cannot no seas and seas no covenants and any.  Any housing project anywhere Petaluma can prevent you from having a chicken.  Yeah.

Start time: 5655.56
End time: 5702.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  Yeah so they sent me a note and they said we can't tell you what's going on just sign.  I was like well and I knew it was Google X so it's got to be cool.  And they've only announced two Google X projects.  You know the self-driving cars and the glasses.  So this must have been cool.  And it was this project Loon.  And it was this audacious ambitious idea to surround the world with internet balloons.  So they wanted me to come along and take some photos and just kind of see what was going on.  It happened to be here in my backyard.  That's totally coincidental.  So I jumped in a car with my family and drove a few hours north from Queenstown up here to the  Christchurch area and joined the team and started taking photos.  It was a blast.

Start time: 5703.12
End time: 5737.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So you actually got to document this and I know there's already one video on StuckInCustoms.com.  We're not looking at that right now.  This is a Google video.  But you shot one video and you have another one coming in a couple of days that is in a lot of  technical detail discussing, you know, talking about what's going on here.  But as soon as that video gets approved it'll be at StuckInCustoms.com.  But they were smart to ask you because here you are documenting.  This is the secret Google warehouse.  So are these first of all they're in the stratosphere.  Yeah.

Start time: 5738.86
End time: 5773.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  So they're twice as high as commercial airlines and there's basically nothing up there.  There's no more weather.  So they get solar power cleanly.  And the big breakthrough about these balloons is that they can move up and down at various  levels through the stratosphere.  And as they move up and down they can catch different air currents so they can sort of  keep this grid or matrix like mesh sort of Cartesian plane.  They're not they're not going around the world.

Start time: 5773.20
End time: 5775.05

Start time: 5778.28
End time: 5791.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  No, they've got a they've got a valve on the bottom.  It's actually a two chamber balloon and the top chamber is filled with helium.  The bottom one is filled with regular air and by pumping air in and out of the bottom chamber  of the balloon.

Start time: 5792.30
End time: 5796.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  They can move them up and down changing the density of the of the helium a little bit.

Start time: 5797.62
End time: 5805.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  But that's that's kind of the same.  But they they change the weight of the balloon by pumping more air into the lower chamber.  I get it.

Start time: 5807.00
End time: 5811.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So that's something you can keep doing kind of for at least until the balloon wears out.

Start time: 5812.54
End time: 5837.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  Yeah.  So that's the big goal is to not fill up the balloon too much so that it pops or that  it has holes in it.  You know, they're they're really trying to figure out a way to keep the balloons up there for a  long time.  But they have had balloons get up there and stay, you know, for months and years.  I mean, this is ballooning is sort of an old science.  It's a tough it's a tough science.  So they're trying to get their balloons to stay up as long as possible.

Start time: 5837.48
End time: 5848.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Can you show this on my screen?  Chad, this is the balloon going up.  So you get a sense of it.  They're doing this on New Zealand over New Zealand as an experiment.  How many balloons do they launch over New Zealand?

Start time: 5850.19
End time: 5867.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  Uh, dozens and dozens.  I don't know the exact number.  They've got this company called Raven Aerostar that they partnered with.  And Raven Aerostar, they're the guys that build all these huge weather balloons for NASA.  They do all kinds of crazy stuff.  So these guys are they're super hardcore.  They know what they're doing.

Start time: 5867.62
End time: 5869.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And how do they get the Internet access to the balloon?

Start time: 5871.46
End time: 5892.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  Well, so they have these big ground stations that are in cities or, you know, in places  where they definitely have a good solid wired Internet connection into the into the backbone.  And so your signal goes up from your house, you know, you have or your car or your little  village or whatever it is.  You have this little antenna that aims up at the sky.

Start time: 5893.03
End time: 5899.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_14

Start time: 5910.56
End time: 5914.04

Start time: 5915.70
End time: 5921.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_24

Start time: 5923.24
End time: 5932.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  The signal goes up.  It goes to one of the balloons and then it gets relayed around to other balloons until  it finds a ground station, goes down, gets the data, then brings it back, you know, right.

Start time: 5934.22
End time: 5945.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And in fact, there's as the balloons move over, there's a handoff.  Just like a cell network.  And so it's an interesting technology.  What kind of speed do people get?

Start time: 5946.56
End time: 6022.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  Well, I went to a couple of testers' homes and we looked at it.  It seemed perfectly broad bandish.  I didn't jump on speedtest.net to see how fast it really was.  But I remember the first time, so I was in there with, this is kind of a funny story.  I shouldn't tell it.  But so I went into the first tester's house and I was there with Stephen Levy from Wired  Magazine who wrote a beautiful piece over there on Wired.  By the way, one of my best photos that I took is going to show up in Wired Magazine.  They got an exclusive on it.  So the world hasn't seen that yet.  Cool.  Be sure to check out Stephen's article when it comes out in print.  So anyway, what happened is we went to this tester's home  and, you know, they're getting internet.  They're on trademe.co.nz, which is sort of the local eBay.  And then, of course, everyone in there, we want to connect and, you know,  connect our cell phones or whatever and start playing with the internet.  And so Stephen Levy is over there.  He's connecting to it or whatever.  Then I went over and saw that, oh, people are connecting to it.  I want to connect too.  So I go over and I asked the Google guys, I said, what's the password I want to get on?  And they said, just a minute, Mr. Levy is on the internet.  I was like, all right, I'll wait till he has a good experience.  I don't know what they thought I was going to do, you know,  BitTorrent, the Game of Thrones.

Start time: 6057.14
End time: 6111.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  I think this will be quite disruptive the same way that fiber has been disrupted.  So when fiber drops into a city, it drives competition crazy.  Suddenly people have to provide unlimited internet or drop their prices.  It is not just the access that I think is exciting here in New Zealand.  Actually, I think this is a pretty good test bed because I noticed this after I came from the US  where I'm used to having unlimited internet.  But people here, they don't really have unlimited internet in their homes.  And I think this is actually very common in Europe and all over the world.  We're quite spoiled in the US.  And so I know that like at home in Queenstown, I happen to have unlimited internet.  I've got to have it, so I pay extra.  But all of my son's friends who are 12 and 13, they come over  and they can't believe that my son can watch limited YouTube videos.  It's inconceivable to them.  And can you imagine being a kid growing up, not being allowed to watch, you know,  maybe 10 or 20 YouTube videos a month?

Start time: 6161.98
End time: 6173.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  Yeah, they just want to get more people on the net.  And I don't think they want to be a giant ISP and make money from like monthly charges.  They just want to get people internet and then they do ad words and this sort of thing.  That's how they make money.

Start time: 6174.32
End time: 6201.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It seems like they have a business model.  I don't know if it's enough to pay for the infrastructure.  Who knows how much these balloons cost.  But the model is pretty straightforward.  The more people that use the internet, the more the world is connected.  Both it's good for the world, but it's also good for Google.  And this is why no nation is going to do this because it's floating all around the world.  The UN isn't going to do this.  I think it's going to be a company like the Google or the NSA.  They might do it.  That's a joke.

Start time: 6202.70

Start time: 6224.04
End time: 6269.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_24
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's great.  It seems on the face of it, goofy.  Well, you know, this Rich Deval is kind of one of the guys behind this.  It's just a huge team, of course.  But he and Mike Cassidy, they know it's an audacious plan and they're serious.  They don't want to waste their time.  They want to do something that's going to work and change the world  and affect a billion plus people.  These are all makers.  They're all kind of Burning Man kind of guys.  They love building stuff and they're having a ball.  They're doing some serious science and they're really iterating in a Google way.  So I think they've got the right approach and the right attitude.  And everyone's super excited about it, especially New Zealand.  We sometimes we feel like the end of the world.  Sure.  So it's exciting to get stuff to launch here.

Start time: 6269.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I thought that was why you moved there.  You want to be at the end of the world.  So the idea, and we'll see what happens,  but the idea is there's five billion people on the planet  who are not connected to the internet right now.  The vast majority.  The idea is to connect as many of them as possible  with hundreds, perhaps thousands of balloons  floating at 60,000 feet above sea level,  getting their internet access from base stations in big cities and passing along.  And because it's so high, you could be in a valley.  You don't have, I mean, you could be really in a very remote area  surrounded by mountains and still be able to get internet access.

No, selfishly, I just want to put one of these little friendly red  things on my truck because I'm driving around to these remote areas  in New Zealand to take photos where there's no cell phone coverage.

Again, you're a somewhat disinterested party in the shit set.  He didn't violate French law.  He violated US law.  Is he a traitor?  Is he a treasonous or is he a whistleblower?

Transcript:  It's very difficult to say, isn't it?  Until we know exactly.  I guess ultimately, we as a society are going to decide whether or not he is a traitor  and whether or not he's just a whistleblower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_27
Transcript:  Exactly.  And that's what I mean by we as a society.  It's the people making laws and judging by these laws.  And obviously, he revealed secrets.  So that's not in question.  The question is, by revealing these secrets, is he a traitor or not?  What I would wish for it to happen is for him to get a fair trial.  And I'm not exactly sure that's possible.  But the best outcome would be for him to get a fair trial.  And if he did commit treason, then he should suffer the consequences, quote unquote.  And if he exposed some serious flaws in the system, then I don't know.  He should go that route.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm kind of free Snowden is kind of where I'm at.  Yeah.  Honestly, I mean, I kind of don't understand what's that different about him and Daniel  Ellsberg with the Pentagon Papers.  Precisely.  I think that you could make the argument that Bradley Manning is a different case.  He was a member of the military.  He revealed things that were of a more sensitive nature that weren't vetted as much.  But in this case, I mean, this was a civilian who happened to have a contract job.  And if what he's saying is true, then I honestly think that the public value of that  information is better than outweighs the, I guess, treasonous implications that they  could have.

Start time: 6516.28
End time: 6524.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And you could make the case that Bradley Manning endangered U.S. citizens abroad with his  leaks.  You can't make that case with Edward Snowden.

Start time: 6525.30
End time: 6576.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think in this case, all it's really doing is the question is, does it endanger  kind of the PR for the NSA and for maybe the FBI?  And that really is of little concern to me.  I'm not sure about, though, I mean, I guess is how much is what he is he saying that is  correct and how much is maybe being inflated for his own gains.  And that's not really clear yet.  But I think that if it is what it seems to be, I mean, honestly, yeah, I'm free Snowden.  I mean, I feel like this is why we have whistleblower laws.  But at the same point, Patrick's point, I don't think it's going to be possible for  him to get a fair trial.  And I mean, I think that the best thing he could hope for is that they somehow violate  his looking up his mental health records or something the same way they did with  Ellsberg.  And that was how he ended up not being prosecuted for the Pentagon Papers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And so, I mean, you almost have to wonder if something like that is not to happen or if  it hadn't happened in Ellsberg's case, what would that have meant for the entire narrative  of what became the Vietnam War and Nixon's second term and for a lot of other things.  And I mean, I think that's why it's not clear to just maybe classify him as someone who's  committing treason because what he's doing could potentially be opening up something  that is vital for the public to know about and certainly vital for us to have a discussion  about what are our real reasonable expectations of privacy and what does it mean for the Fourth  Amendment.

Transcript:  Yes.  So first, I'd like to say I always, you know, we live in a democracy.  So I always don't like when we talk about it in a democracy and we say, you know, oh,  it's the government's fault.  And that the government is always us in a democracy, right?  We are, they are accountable and responsible to us.

Start time: 6638.78
End time: 6653.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So unless they go so far as to not be.  And that's, of course, the great fear of all of this is that when does it go from being  government of the people, by the people, for the people to government by the governing,  for the governing?

Start time: 6654.22
End time: 6689.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_27
Transcript:  And that's actually one of the great concerns here.  And I was saying I would like for him to get a fair trial, but at the same time,  I'm not even sure it's possible because even we've seen at least we suspect that the NSA  has been lying to the different bodies that it's supposed to be answering to or at least  who are supposed to be overseeing their activities.  So when it reaches that level of uncertainty, it becomes very murky.  Even what you're talking about, Jason, which is we are the government.  Are we really in that case deciding what happens when we don't even know what happens?  Right.

Start time: 6689.36
End time: 6751.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  So that's where but we do know now.  And that's why I think Snowden ultimately has done something heroic.  Right.  He found the government doing something that it should not have been doing and he exposed it.  Obviously, there's still a lot like everyone else.  I'd like to read more about the details of what really happened and what else might have been  leaked or whatever.  It does not appear as if he leaked anything that would cause danger to anyone,  any U.S. citizens or military or intelligence.  But he did catch the U.S. government doing something that they should not have done.  And that's why ultimately I think he deserves our support and to stand up for somebody that  has leaked something that we would all like to know about so that we can hold  the government accountable for doing something that is sort of extra legal.

Transcript:  And of course, General James Clapper, who blatantly lied to Congress when asked if the NSA  collected this data, he's going to go scot-free.  No contempt of Congress there.  You know, I think we owe a debt of gratitude to Edward Snowden.  I don't know if he would get a fair trial in the U.S.  I feel like at this point we're all just going, run Snowden, run.  And I don't know if there's anywhere you can run to in this world anymore.  So I feel bad for him.  The Clapper thing though, he was actually, as you're saying, he did blatantly lie.

Start time: 6787.20
End time: 6803.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_27
Transcript:  How come he's not suffering any kind of consequence?  He lied to the Senate, right?  And that's representatives of the people.  He actually lied to the American people where he should actually, according to the law,  have told the truth.

Start time: 6805.48
End time: 6862.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  And that's frankly why I think there's a legitimate argument that Snowden is a whistleblower,  that he is in fact telling us something we wouldn't have known otherwise because our  own government and the director of national intelligence is lying.  So the only way to find this out is for somebody like Snowden to step forward.  You know, it's a tech show and I understand people feel like this is politics, but there  is a very strong angle of technology to this because the real question is can we, are electronic  communications in some way less privileged than snail mail?  There's nobody asserting that the NSA is going through your mail, opening your mail.  There are much better protections, frankly, against that than there are against them opening  your email.  In fact, many courts have held and it's the position of the federal government that after  six months it's not even your email anymore.  It's abandoned.

Transcript:  Absolutely the stuff we should be talking about on a tech show.  We have created as part of a society and as technologists and people working and covering  this industry have created a new set of possibilities, a new set of rules, and as a result we have  to deal with a new set of values in order to live in the society that we're shaping.  So we should be talking about this and I expect we are going to be talking even more about it over  the next decade as sort of data and all of this stuff becomes more and more available  and accessible and things like this are going to happen likely again and again.

Transcript:  Tragedy of another kind for photographers in Chicago.  I'm really curious what you guys are going to say about this.  I've been getting a lot of email and tweets about it.  The Chicago Sun-Times has fired their staff reporters and 28 photographers, they fired  them on Friday and this is where it gets weird.  Apparently the reporters for the writing reporters, the written reporters for the  newspaper are going to be trained in iPhoneography.  They're apparently expected to pick up the slack and take pictures with their cameras.  It's the sign of the times.  This is what intrigued me about this that so many people were up in arms about this and of course  when people get fired it's terrible but this is a measure of the fact that newspapers are just dying.  I don't hear that when 28 reporters get fired.

Start time: 6952.58

So in a way it's just a cost saving measure whether or not you'll get the same level of quality.  Not from an iPhone.

Transcript:  Dave McDean our chat room informs me the Metropolitan Opera fired their entire ballet  company this week.  Not one word in the press but I think it's because we identify with photographers.  Photographers are kind of the new heroes of the geek of new media right.  And so these 28 guys by the way they of all the people who could possibly be fired at a newspaper  the photographers are most likely to find work immediately right.

Transcript:  Oh yeah you would switch topics you wouldn't be shooting a news story.  Shoot a wedding or birthday but there's going to be work for you.  Well you know a lot of work for a compositor.  Well that's the thing is like even some of these photographers probably have some  editing compositing you know post production skills on photos because you cannot survive  especially in today's environment on just being good at one particular aspect of your job.  You want to be able to maybe not be incredibly good at everything but at least competent  because you don't want to be in the position where the company's looking to save a few dollars and  looking so well you know can you edit.  I mean you're a great anchor person but can you edit too because it save us a lot of money and  you know it's you know or that it will hire the the new guy who comes at half the rate.

We have figured out that the the work the production work that used to take millions of  dollars and a huge studio to do we can now do not on the cheap but for you know with a much  different type of crew different type of equipment.  The same thing happens to photography.  They've the newspapers have realized camera phones or you know prosumer cameras have become  so good and amateur photographers get so many different angles that they can essentially get  the same coverage they can get the same material the same content that they need at a much lower  price.  So in essence if you're going to be blaming the newspaper you should be blaming content  creators like us and amateur content creators and Craig change the game.

I mean think about the last three big news stories where most of the content came from  people not associated with the press.  I mean the the the the soldier in London that was hacked to death a lot of those videos.  That was their iPhone videos.  They were iPhone videos.  The Boston bombing those were all captured either by CCTVs or photojournalists are important.

Look at what newspapers are doing and he says you know he's talking about we're in the heyday  of photography.  He says well sarcastically yeah obviously teenagers are clearly reading 300 to 1200 word  articles on newspaper websites on a regular basis.  They're not they're looking at pictures right.  And you look at what the Boston Globe does with the big picture.  I have wonderful.  Clearly they're making money on their photojournalists.

Transcript:  right more of the uh snowden leaks are coming out and now this most recent story is essentially that  the that the national security agency has done a huge amount to bypass privacy on the web to  undermine uh encryption they dedicate uh according to the story as much as 250 million dollars a year  of their secret budget uh to subverting companies like microsoft they they literally are planting  agents within these companies to put back doors in their encryption they've subverted the national  institute for standards and technology which is a standards body in the united states that  among other things protect you know create standards for government encryption  um it seems as if we've got an out of control surveillance state  what is your you know you're not an america american renee you're in montreal um from from  outside of the u.s what is what is your take what do you see going on here and my real concern i  think this is bruce schnire and others have raised this my real concern is that the united  states is in effect undermining the basis of the internet and it's making uh united states products  if at nothing if you if nothing else if you're not worried about privacy it means that no nation  outside the united states should even consider united states product the u.s government told  us last year don't buy phones from huawei and zte because they're made by the chinese government  in effect and they're spying on us well we're doing the same thing yeah it's interesting to

Start time: 8269.60
End time: 8353.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  me because exactly what you say there are a lot of states in which you live under the presumption  of surveillance a lot of people in england say their laws are written in such a way that this  is perfectly legal and they don't understand the outcry in north america we have ceases in canada  and i believe part of their purview is to is domestic surveillance so there's a lot of there's  a lot of countries where you can barely do anything without the oversight of the government  but the difference in the united states is that theoretically this should not be possible and if  it is if their government sorry if agencies want to do this they should go and pass the prerequisite  laws required to make this legal and allow people to the congress and the senate to vote on those  laws and if it's not legal they shouldn't be allowed to do it i mean they should have to go  and make their case in a free society to a republican sorry to a republic society  and make it legal and then go ahead and do it but what it does is exactly what you said about china  you can't have confidence in buying a chinese device because you found spyware on the the  photography frame that you bought at the local cosco or whatever it is and the same thing now  is true i believe that it's so badly broken that i'm just never going to trust any technology  company or any technology product ever again because it's the kind of trust that once broken  you can never get back if they can lie about spying now there's no point in them saying we've  stopped doing it because you'll never believe them and it undermines not only the internet it  undermines your faith in any product you use on any service ever for the rest of time bruce bruce

Transcript:  bruce says it undermines the very fabric of the internet it is doing huge damage now gibson came  on and said look a lot of this is essentially link bait from these news agencies he says understand  what's happening here the and schnire says this too the math is still good strong encryption  has not been cracked there's no reason to think that the nsa has such supercomputer powers in  the basement there that they're able to get through you know 2048 or much less 4096 bit  you know rsa encryption strong encryption still works but the nsa realized before 9 11 and stepped  it up after 9 11 that the internet was rapidly going dark for them and so has created an effort  in which they spend a quarter billion dollars a year at least to get around this and so they  talk about a very commonly used telecom program that has been that the nsa placed a back door  in i'm presuming it's skype you have to presume that any closed source encryption like microsoft's  bit locker or apple's file vault could very well have a back door in it but but steve pointed out  and this is absolutely true if you're using true crypt or open pgp if you're using an open  source solution you're likely still able to send secure messaging go ahead dan well i think

Transcript:  much of what's happening here is is confusing and it can be perceived as clickbait but this is an  incredibly james bamford who who you can find his books on on audible is a security researcher who's  come to many of the same conclusions that you know you have on on security now and that is  what's happened here is far more than simple failings of technology or or  or the ability of technology what's very scary about this is policy decisions that led to  infiltrations within the technology industry in the late 90s and early 2000s it is not simply  difficult to articulate how important this is without seeming hyperbolic and and clickbait  yourself but this is an incredibly important story not just because of the technology components  but because of the duplicity involved in the in the secrecy involved in infiltrating on a human

Transcript:  level the entire industry from pro publica cryptographers have long suspected that the nsa  planted vulnerabilities in a standard adopted in 2006 by the national institute of standards and  technology the u.s encryption standards body and later by ios which has 163 companies countries  as members classified nsa memos memos appear to confirm that the fatal weakness discovered  by microsoft cryptographers by the way in 2007 was engineered by the agency they're actually  subverting nist the nsa wrote the standard and aggressively pushed it on the international group  privately calling the effort in these memos quote a challenge in finesse they created the standard

Transcript:  there's two scary things about this is not only that they created backdoors there's no guarantee  that other people haven't found them and used them i mean just because the nsa is using them  doesn't mean people that you'd be much more worried about than the nsa aren't using them  and also they store this stuff so while the strong encryption is good now who knows how good it'll be  in five years with the advances of computers or 10 years but i do think that it's nice in america at  least that there's a debate about this stuff going on because in a lot of countries it's just  assumed or your government is legally allowed to do this thing and there's no dialogue going on  about it or people are just not aware about it and at least here and i don't know if it's clickbait  or not the level of awareness to a culture that usually doesn't care about anything because  privacy is they'd rather have convenience and privacy i'm really glad the debate at least is
