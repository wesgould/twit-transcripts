In fact, really not even a large portion.  In fact, frankly, we just cover whatever we the hell want to cover.  And despite the administrations of Mr. John C. Dvorak, who tries to keep us moving, tries  to keep us covering tech.  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  John's showing us a picture of his shed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My new house.  What are you a gold miner?  What is my 401K?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's all that's left.  Channeldvorak.com if you want to find out where you're going to blog that.  Why do you have a snapshot of a shanty?  I took this somewhere in Wyoming.  It's a great picture.  It looks like a ghost town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, the after I sent you the Photoshop version is quite nice.  I'm using it as a background for a new thing I'm doing for Mevio called the tech grouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you sit on the porch on a rocking chair with a shotgun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a beard.  I got the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, I'm John C. Dvorak, the tech grouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, I'm not John C. Dvorak.  This is somebody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aren't you tired of being the cranky grouchy guy?  Don't you want to be like.  You?  Yeah, like me, Mr. Nice Guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  I've always wanted to be like you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Also here, Will Harris from Channel Flip.com.  Hi, Will.  How are you today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello, I'm very well.  Thank you.  I've got my glass of port and I'm very happy.  Oh, that looks good.  A little late in the evening for a nice, isn't it?  A little tawny, little tawny 10 year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  10 year tawny port.  It's like show and tell on Twitter today.  And we were supposed to have Frank Barnico on the line and he's, I think, you know, this  happens all the time.  It's people are about to appear on the show and then their internet goes out.  Do you think it's a conspiracy of some kind?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're out to get you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe just, yeah, just like they never use Skype and then as soon as they start using  a lot of bandwidth.  Yeah, the whole internet just goes kabloui.  It's too bad because Frank wrote a blog post that I thought was very interesting why  bloggers and podcasters should be happy about the idea that Comcast might be buying  51% of NBC Universal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'll tell you what, you know, my experience not getting bumped from the  show has been that I watched it live dot twit dot TV and you're talking about me and  nobody picks up tries to I don't know what happens, but he's probably listening right  now and he probably will get back onto the show.  I hope he will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you do?  You think first of all, that this is this rumor, which in fact Comcast is well, maybe  it's one of those non denial denials, but it seems like they've denied it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's a total non denial denial.  You think the first the first story that Ed was that Comcast was buying NBC  Universal 100% and the non denial denial was that story is not accurate.  Right.  Yes.  There's a difference between not accurate and not true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you think it's true that they're going to have a controlling interest?  I think it's true too.  Is this, you know, I mean, my first thought is that this is a way Comcast can keep  companies like they can't buy everybody, but NBC has been very, very active first  with Hulu and then with their own site and putting shows online.  Companies like Comcast hate that because it means people can watch those shows  using cheap internet access instead of expensive premium cable access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're using the internet.  The so-called cheap internet access is actually expensive Comcast internet access.  Well, but you need to get some bandwidth if you want to watch TV on your, through  the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but Comcast, what do they get for internet access?  50 bucks.  But your cable bill is I bet you well over a hundred bucks because of all the,  you know, premium stuff that they use a satellite dish.  Ah, how much is your satellite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Uh, I think the 50 bucks, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just, I, my sense is, and maybe I'm wrong that the cable companies hate the idea  of people just using their bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're not idiots.  They know it's a, it's a done deal.  I guess it is a done deal, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So they got to take defensive measures and I think this is a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I guess if you feel like the entire world is migrating from cable to IPTV as a cable  company, you kind of feel like you need, you need a stake in TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  You and I, you and I, Will are doing IPTV plays basically.  So I, you know, I love the idea.  I think the thing that gives us a, I think a little bit of a leg up is that, and this  is always true when business has changed dramatically like this, that the old, old  line business can't afford to cannibalize their, you know, their business.  And so, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can't, you can't, um, you know, it's, it's a massive opportunity because  for smaller players coming into the market, there's no opportunity cost.  Right.  Right.  Everything, everything is upside.  Whereas if you're an incumbent, then there's a lot of downside to go with a  potential amount of upside.  And there's a lot of people right now talking about, you know, whether it's the  New York times or all the recent paywalls, et cetera, you know, is the internet going  to make up for the shortfall in traditional revenue streams?  Whereas the question for, you know, for people like you is, well, I don't have a  traditional revenue stream to protect the internet, all money, it's all money all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to apologize because, you know, I gave a speech on, uh, Friday.  I thought it was just, you know, a small group of people and they were, a lot of  them were young people or people who were kind of trying to figure out how they  can make this move to the internet.  And so I wanted to reassure them.  I was talking a little bit about tech TV and how it failed because advertisers  really didn't have faith in broadcasting intended for intelligent audiences.  Advertisers thought intelligent people aren't going to watch the ads.  They're just going to decide what to buy because they're intelligent.  We can't influence them.  Uh, and I wanted to make the point to these young people and these, and these  people in transition that in fact, you could do a smart network twits been  nothing but aimed at intelligent people and make a living.  So I told them what we, you know, kind of our revenue situation.  And of course that became a big story all over the internet as if, you know, like  I'm rolling in dough or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You are.  Sounds like it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, there's costs.  There's a taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not, I didn't write myself a million dollar check last month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, it was really, really funny because I did a, um, uh, ironically, I  did a talk at tech crunch, uh, tech crunch event in London a couple of weeks  ago in which I mentioned that it was really, really hard to get a, um, a sense  of the new media world in Britain.  Cause nobody really talked about money.  It was a very British thing about, you know, nobody likes to talk about money.  Nobody likes, you know, mentioned money.  We hear you, Frank, hang on.  And, uh, and, you know, and I mentioned that in America, you know, talking about  money is a much more open thing and everybody tries to help each other and  everybody tries to be free with information in the spirit of entrepreneurship.  And of course this thing came out a week later and I was like, see, I think  that proves the point.  See, by the way, you know, it reminds me of it reminds me of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was talking to somebody from England the other day and they were buying a,  you know, a house around here and I said, so what'd you pay for it?  Oh, uh, I don't know.  So what'd you pay for it?  Oh, by the way, in California, we, I told them, I said, in California, we  tell people what we pay for our houses and what, you know, what we sold them for.  This is what we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right.  We got no, we have no, uh, shame or pride.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know it's gauche to talk about money and I wouldn't normally, I wouldn't  walk up to somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's was beyond it.  Yeah.  It's gauche in an old sense, but that old sense is a structured management style  that was designed to keep people from actually knowing what other people made.  So you could screw them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's really true.  I, every, and I tell my employees this, don't you dare tell anybody else what

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you make because it just caused jealousy and you'll all want more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So your management now.  Yeah.  Management now anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, Frank, we got Frank Barnacco on.  I'm sorry.  Barnacco on.  Thank you, Frank.  I really appreciate it.  I don't know what happened there.  It looked like we lost you.  All it took was a shutdown.  Yeah.  Restarting always helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a kind of laughing because my father-in-law is a windows guy and I, I'm  always tweaking him.  Yeah.  So I'm hoping he's not watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it wasn't a Mac.  You were using a windows seven, right?  Frank?  Yeah.  Too late.  Frank, you've been on Twitter before, but not for a long, long time.  Right.  It's about time we got you back.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was just going to say it was back when there was, I think there was only one show.  And now look at you.  Really?  Is that true?  Now look.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's kind of amazing.  There may have been Mac break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought Twitter was first.  So let's get to that article that Frank wrote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm glad we got you on because we really wanted to talk about this NBC Comcast deal,  which in your absence we've concluded is in fact a real deal despite Comcast's  non-denial denial.  Do you agree, Frank?  This is probably what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that Comcast certainly wants to do it.  They tried to do Disney for what?  X number of billion dollars a few years ago.  Who hasn't tried to do Disney?  The Comcast people clearly want to have content.  And as I put on the blog and as I was thinking about it, you know, all these  folks and, you know, I didn't say you Leo, but clearly you're the archetype out there.  You're the model.  And I think that Comcast is going to want to have more content available to sell to  its subscribers and to other subscribers.  And the best way to generate more dollars is to have content that can't be gotten  anyplace else.  And I think podcasters and blogcasters have a real opportunity here that Comcast  will look for more and more content.  And God knows the internet is producing it right and left in those niches that  each of us cares about, although they are different niches and they add up to a big  audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't think it's a defensive move from Comcast that they're just saying,  boy, we're going to get eaten a lot.  Because really Comcast's business is purely a delivery mechanism.  Although they did have Liberty Media, they have in the past toyed with content  creation.  In fact, they spun it out.  I think that it seems they're a little schizo.  They can't decide if they want to be in content creation or just distribution.  But it seems to me now that it's clear that distribution is not where the money's  going to be.  It's going to be creating content.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe that's true.  That's as a content creator.  I and you both know that distribution is critical to the it's the lifeblood of  anybody who's making content.  And Comcast has that that's a pipe.  They do.  And they avoid ending up being just a pipe if they have extra special content.  Again, I'm thinking about the Roku box and how Netflix is putting itself in the  various places.  So it is a content option.  And I think Comcast is clearly thinking down the road.  Yes, they want to have as many subscribers as they as they can.  They want something like 22 million now.  And I just think the more content they got, the more subscribers they're going to  have and the more content they've got that they can sell.  That should make podcasters a little bit of dollars.  I'd like to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will, you were going to say something?  I mean, you're in this too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, I have to say, I think in the long run, the money is not actually in content.  It's actually in distribution.  Aggregation.  Oh, an aggregation like what Channel Clip does as an aggregator.  Well, I think content, what we're seeing is an explosion of content as you've talked  about. Content has never been there's never been more content and content's never been  cheaper or easier to produce.  And that leads to a proliferation and that leads to a devaluation in the marketplace.  You're already seeing the number of TV commissions go down, the budgets for TV  commissions go down.  That's going to keep going down and keep going down and keep going down.  I think when you look at where value is in this kind of new economy, you have to look  at what's scarce because we're looking at proliferation creates scarcity.  Right. The irony.  The proliferation of media online and the massive amounts of media online creates a  scarcity in terms of large audiences because everybody's watching lots of different  things, which means the audience for each thing is smaller.  So actually the value in this kind of new economy is in the aggregation of large  audiences, not in the production of content, which is kind of becomes a thing of little  value above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's fungible.  It's not.  It's a commodity.  John, you agree.  I mean, you work for you work for Mevio.  Yeah, well, and they're I mean, they're the first podcast aggregator ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and they keep and the model has changed.  I sense since I got there a couple of years ago, I would say that the model has  changed six, seven times.  No, seriously, but I mean, not for the worst.  I mean, every time they look at the model and they say, well, you know, what we  should do is this and what we should do is this and what we should do is this.  And they keep changing.  You got to be nimble in this world because nobody knows what the real what the end  was, what the end model is, because everybody's experimenting.  I mean, you have an operation that is making it up as we go along.  It's a one man show that is extreme, you know, that that will that could go on  forever and may have to change.  It may not.  Or maybe someone would just buy you the folks at Mevio.  Now they have so much aggregation going on and they're doing these split deals with  all these different producers.  Some people are making quite a bit of money, not your kind of money, but they're  making a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They said, in fact, I think Adam Curry said that he had three podcasts making half a  million to a million a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know of a couple making over two hundred thousand.  I don't look at those numbers, but I know at least two that make over two hundred  thousand. I think Callie Lewis makes it.  I'm sure Callie must make that much.  Yeah, I think she makes it.  I think she makes a quarter of a million dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She that's I don't know if that's the money to her.  And I don't know if Adam's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, this would be the money to her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, because I think Adam was probably quoting the.  Yeah, they split it. So she was quoting the revenue, total revenue, and then the  amount of money to her is half that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But and she only does a few shows and she's not the big money winner.  There's a there's two other shows that I've never even heard of that are bigger.  Yeah, but they're not about tech.  They're like, I don't know what they're about.  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I will and go ahead, Frank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Will and John are making the same point I was writing about and thinking  about Comcast is not going to want to have one Z, two Z aggregator, one Z, two Z  podcasts and video shows on a on a long menu.  It is just as you've done with the network.  It's a it's a 24 7 wheel of tech content.  You give me a 24 7 a wheel of digital photography content.  And I'm going to watch that.  I'm going to pay three or four dollars a month for that channel.  So the person who puts together, as you've done, the kind of niche programming  into a format that is easily handled by a cable company, the distributions know they  don't have to worry about whether all the lines are working, whether the shows have  arrived on time. But they in effect, they do just become the distribution.  They become the marketer.  They make a piece selling it to subscribers and that aggregator who's put it all together.  That's the one that has the right opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, here's my I'm going to throw a monkey wrench in this.  I mean, go ahead, go ahead, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I was just going to say, well, actually throw the monkey wrench in it.  I have a David Sparke wrote a really good column about making money as a podcaster  that I want to plug. But he left me out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I felt a little hurt, to be honest.  Did he? Oh, you saw the article?  Yeah, it was a very good article.  And that's where I got that five hundred thousand to a million figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, you know, I think it was he was remiss to leave you out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I that's because you know why he left me.  You go, he's asked me many times to be on Twitter and I don't have him.  He's a PR guy. I don't put PR guys on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Yeah.  Yeah, he probably left you out on purpose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He snubbed you. He snubbed. I'm snubbed.  You know how easy I am to screw you, Sparke.  David's very funny, great comic, old friend, worked together at TechTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm sure anyway, just he has these not the nine models are  and they're the most accurate models I've ever seen put in one article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, it's it's it's an excellent article.  And I highly recommend it. Is that on his blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where does that get posted on social mash or mashups or some mashamania?  Some I don't know what it is, but look up David Sparke  podcasting and you'll probably find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought that was excellent article.  So here's my monkey wrench.  I've been reading Accidental Billionaires, which is the Ben Mesric book.  It's going to be a movie any minute now.  Justin Timberlake playing Mark Zuckerberg.  It's on the story.  The fact it's I think highly fictionalized  story, the founding of Facebook.  But it did kind of a light came on for me.  And I'm sorry if I'm slow to this party, but it's very obvious to me that going  forward, advertisers are no longer going to be satisfied  with scattershot advertising, the kind they get even on this show a little bit.  They're going to want to know more and more about the people they advertise to.  And this is what Google and Facebook offer them.  They can say, I want I want the five best biggest dentists in Muncie.  I want the one person who's going to buy a big screen TV in Petaluma, California.  They can be very, very specific,  which makes their ads incredibly more efficient.  And I think platforms like Facebook and Google are going to be a problem  for even Internet broadcasters because we just can't get that granular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you think?  I think we lost Frank for one thing, but we'll get him back.  I have a I this is the holy grail of advertisers.  Exactly. That's what they.  Yeah. Well, you know, it's not achievable.  I think it's a wishful thinking situation.  That's why you have to do advertising in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, don't Facebook don't Facebook and Google give them exactly that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think Facebook and Google give you  you give you that kind of granularity and they do give you that kind of access.  But they don't give you, you know, either yet or conceivably at all.  Is any kind of nice way of exploiting that?  I mean, advertising advertising is a culture as an industry is about  touchy, feely kind of, you know, reaching into your emotions  and motivating you to do stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's what this is where you're wrong.  That's old school advertising.  That's you know, this coercive advertising.  Here we go.  I think the advertising model is moving away from coercion and tricks  and is moving towards influence.  The most successful. It's about creativity.  Yeah, no, no, no, no, no, no.  Advertising, advertising, starting at the turn of the last century,  when when Freud's theories were used to create the business of advertising and PR,  they went from being, you know, if you look at a Sears catalog,  advertising used to be a list of features and benefits, and that's it.  And then along came what's his name, the father of PR,  Freud's cousin, who said, wait a minute, what? Say again.  I can't think of the guy's name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't remember.  I thought Hille Nolten invented the whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, this guy.  Actually, Hitler used his theories very effectively.  This guy said, no, no, no, no.  What you want to do is tap into Freudian wants and needs.  You want to create a need for a product.  You want to make people think they've got bad breath or B.O.  and that that fear, that terror will make them buy.  And for for almost a century, that's what advertising has been.  It's been to trick people into buying a product by coercion,  by misrepresentation, by fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember the commercial Don't Broadcast B.O.  Exactly. Exactly.  You know, remember that they would honk that horn.  B.O. B.O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That actually haunted me in high school because B.O.  happens to rhyme with Leo.  And they called you B.O. Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They said Leo has B.O.  So thank you, Hille Nolten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought your real pronunciation name was Leo.  It was, but they didn't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They, you know, middle school has no boundaries, no respect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, I have to go.  I have a moment.  That explains everything.  I have to have a moment here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right. So I hate advertising like that.  And so but I believe I truly believe that one of the reasons we succeed  and podcasts succeed is because we don't use coercion or tricks or duplicity.  What we do is we use influence, which is, I think, a much more powerful way  to reach people. It's word of mouth.  It's having somebody it's believe it or not, getting kind of back  to that original features and benefits thing.  That's the kind of ads we do.  We trust our audience to be intelligent.  We explain to them why this is a product they might want to try.  And I think that that's going to be in the long run more effective,  especially when you combine that with much more targeted advertising.  So I don't know if I'm with you, Will.  I don't know if it's about emotion anymore.  I think it's changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think I think, you know, you're you're possibly right.  I think that  it's really hard to say that advertising is I think there's  there's two trends in advertising is what you're saying, the kind of influences  and the kind of features benefits.  And then there's this kind of statistical kind of spreadsheet based advertising,  which is, you know, if you pay X amount of dollars for a banner  on the side of a Web page, it will be viewed X number of times,  which will generate an X number of people clicking through,  which will generate X percentage of leads or which will generate  an X percentage of our position.  Well, it does, but it's it's a it's kind of soul destroying, isn't it?  And it all, you know, and I think the inevitable move from that  is towards, you know, purely  advertising where you're purely getting paid based on acquisitions rather than.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we don't and we don't do that.  And you're right, that is an acknowledgement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a real, real, real problem, because because the because the way  the spreadsheet driven internet advertising industry works is moving  inextricably towards a a model where  where producers, publishers are only paid when a customer or  a customer of theirs does something that doesn't acknowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That doesn't acknowledge.  And in a way, it is kind of a counterargument to what I'm saying.  That doesn't acknowledge the branding and the imaging that comes from advertising

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and the image that comes with it. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so what I'm saying is that the brand and the image that comes with it  is inevitably always going to be here.  And that's why we're not going to ever move to a purely kind of  statistical Facebook's likes and dislikes.  It's also about the power of brand, the power of image, the power of emotion  and advertising. So it's Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, he uses emotion, doesn't he?  Very early.  One very effective. Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really, really great. Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that a funny video?  Isn't that a funny video?  David Sparks article, by the way, was unmashingable.  And it is from October 1st.  And it is it is a good article  that talks about the nine models for revenue, including subscription,  donations and aggregation, which is kind of what we do.  We do kind of mini aggregation.  My theory being that if you are looking for  a certain style and quality that you would come to us  because you know that's what you're going to get.  See, I think Mevio doesn't do that because it aggregates so many podcasts.  You can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not a single channel.  They also don't do what you do, which is to have you actually have more.  You're more like a like a like an international TV station. Right.  Because you have exactly much more like a station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you and you run it like a station.  You're like the station manager.  You're mean to your employees.  Yeah. You know, and you have the this kind of the typical station manager.  You know, you I think you've had a couple operations.  You hit yourself in the head a few times.  So you lower your IQ.  I keep the I keep the I keep the cocaine in the lower left

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  and the bourbon in the lower right drawer.  And the joke is you do have the bourbon there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know where you keep the other stuff, but show them.  Show them. There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got two kinds of bourbon.  I got your single barrel.  Evan Williams.  I like this bourbon because it's named after the founder of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't. You know, what's interesting about that bourbon is not it's  it's rather inexpensive. Really?  Yeah, it's like 20 bucks. It's an outstanding product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, because Kirk Karnak gave me this, I thought it was kind of fancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, I guess the great thing about being your your own  station manager is that you can hide your own boots, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I hide my own boots.  Frank, we got your back.  What's going on, Frank?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got to get Comcast mad at you for that article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I haven't heard a word from them.  No, I guess I'm happy I have Cox.  Oh, you have Cox Cox's manager.  Yeah. Yeah.  And I can't attest for Cox's Internet connectivity today.  Nothing worse than angry Cox.  And seem too good in the comments you were making at ONA.  And you talked about this spark sparks piece.  How's how's begging doing these days?  Not so good.  Is begging here?  And they there was one suggestion.  One of his nine models was you put a PayPal button on the website.  Does that still work? Or is we do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it was my thought, my plan that that would be how we'd fund the network.  I really didn't want to take advertising, but it just isn't  not enough people contribute.  And I'm not I am not I have too much pride to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the public television begging that is Adam and I do that on our No Agenda show.  Are you doing it? How effective is that?  It's actually better than you'd think.  It's still not.  It hasn't turned the corner, but we haven't turned up.  I mean, I used to do public radio a lot, and so I'm used to this model.  And as opposed to just commercial radio.  And I think it works.  And I think I think but you do have to.  But you do have to do what you have to look at the experts.  And the experts are the people that do public TV and public radio.  And they get into massive begging gimmicks, give giveaways.  You can't do that. You can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just don't want to do that.  And frankly, I was hoping that it would be cleaner to do donations.  And certainly I value we do have donations.  We do about 10,000 a month in donations.  That pays for the rent that pays for servers.  It does. I kind of dedicate it towards the fixed costs,  except that salaries now have way outpaced that.  So but for a long time, that's how we ran it.  I now consider it.  It's certainly an important part.  They're the equivalent of an advertiser.  But it's also I consider it a buy in.  And I think that that's one thing you got to really think about is  creating allegiance from with your audience,  creating a community and a buy in from your audience and giving them a way  to buy in for two bucks a month.  Is more than just for financing.  It really is to where that bourbon is coming right to my head.  I think I'll have another.  The it's a can you use a glass, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're on the bourbon and I'm on the port.  I'm sorry. Let's move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are you all excited about Windows seven?  OK. I am having a house party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you know, I signed up for that and they never sent me.  I never I got refused, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How could they refuse John C.  Dvorak? I never got anything of those videos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Real early. Those are not fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You've you've seen on my blog, you've seen elsewhere  the Windows House Party videos that comes from House Party dot com,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  which is in a very and they're not like viral marketing or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, far from it. They may make you sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I showed that to everyone in my office, no, and I'd fire on marketing.  No, it's serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Although the funniest one, this funniest one, there is a Windows  seven house party kind of mashup of this video  that all they did was bleep the word activities.  And it sounds filthy.  You remember the book Memoirs of a Shy Pornographer?  Was it? No, it's a classic book.  And the guy becomes a pornographer by taking his novel,  which he could never publish, and just blanking out random nouns.  And the human mind is so filthy that if you blank out random nouns,  it turns into porno.  It's quite a funny book.  Highly recommended memoirs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you play us a bit of the video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, let me put you want me to play the censored one.  It's pretty funny.  Let me see if I can find  a adland.TV as it you can.  So the premise is, is there's actually a company called House Party dot com  that does.  House parties for businesses.  And so Microsoft went to them and contracted with them and they had a process.  I got selected. You get a copy of Windows seven autographed by Steve Ballmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Autographed by Ballmer? Yeah.  Did you get your copy yet?  It's coming Monday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's take a minute or so to tell you about how great it is to.  Well, the four of us got to have our parties a little ahead of schedule,  try everything out.  So we thought we'd be able to tell you some of the tips that help make our  parties really fun.  Yeah, of course, the first thing you want to do is.  Make sure you do that a couple of days in advance of the party.  You got to play with before the party.  Second, look at the activities you and your guests can try at your party  and choose the ones that seem to you to be the most fun.  There's a video of each activity from one of our parties,  and we have tried them all. Right.  You just look at them all.  It's getting filthier to be the most fun for your guests.  Right. And some of the host notes, they list bonus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You get the idea. It's a great gag.  It's it works very well.  So we're having the party October 22nd.  They send you streamers, napkins, balloons and copy of Windows seven.  Some suggested activities.  It's you know, it's hokey, but I know a lot of people were having these parties,  all of them tongue in cheek.  However, they're still having the parties, right? Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hokey.  And you must think that Microsoft expected to get criticism and comments  and people would say, what the heck is this thing?  But nonetheless, as you say, there are parties and people are talking about  Windows seven and the word of mouth is important.  It's working. It's working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, I'm excited. I like Windows seven.  I know that's kind of so uncool to say you like Windows,  but I really like Windows seven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think it's going to be a you like Vista, too, when it first came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did. And I was wrong about that.  I can't my like turned to hate very quickly.  In fact, John, you said, are you still saying this, that  by the time seven comes out, it's going to be as bad as anything else? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would be clogged up and slow.  I mean, you have the same issues as bad or as good as anything else,  because I don't think Vista is that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but it isn't now.  It kind of had some big compatibility issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's going to be some with the Windows seven.  They obviously the XP compatibility mode is going to have to be downloaded  for people who want to use XP programs, certain ones anyway.  And so you end.  So the download is supposed to be available on the 20 seconds.  Not going to be on the disk.  I guess whatever's on the disk.  If you buy a new computer, you'll get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm waiting. Actually, there's a new Dell that I really like, the Dell Z  Latitude Z is a very thin kind of their Macbook Air.  And it just came out and I'm looking forward to getting it.  But I'm waiting because I want to get Windows seven on it.  All right. We haven't. It's been a while since there's been a tech IPO.  There is a tech IPO.  We're going to talk about that in just a second.  Our guests once again, John C.  Dvorak from channel Dvorak dot com and of course, cranky geeks, angry geeks,  pissed off tech people.  I don't know. What is it? What is the new one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The tech grouch, the tech grouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you're not going to go to tech grouch dot mevio dot com to get a sample.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you're not going to be the tech grouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am the tech grouch. Oh, but it's going to be.  But I'm not really, if you know what I mean, I have to.  It's a. Oh, this sounds good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why? But aren't you worried that you're getting typecast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not. No, because this is a different character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this the first time you've played a character?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't know.  I'm not sure that that's true.  Old Grouch meets technology.  Hey, I understand they're bringing out a PS3 slim.  Who needs it?  I understand they're going to bring out a small we.  And it's going to be called the wee wee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Beatles rock band. Who the heck need.  What are you? Are you like the guy from ZZ Top?  What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the if you follow, if you let the thing play, I have that joke in there.  It's this crap.  Hey, you kids, go learn to play the guitar like I did.  You've seen ZZ Top, haven't you?  Go to Squarespace dot com.  Use the code word tech for 12 percent discount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You even got an ad in there.  Is that going to be how long it is? 30 seconds like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, 30 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty funny.  Yeah. Is it going to is the idea to go viral?  Is that the plan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the idea is to get someone to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's wearing a plaid hunter's shirt, a plaid hunter's cap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That cap, by the way, is the same cap that Carson used to use  when he played that. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right. I remember that.  And my wife got me that cap.  I'm sorry. Where did you get the ZZ Top beard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got it from the local party store.  I actually wanted to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there's the shed behind you. That's the shed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, that's a different shed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It looks the same. How can you tell the difference?  There's a shed.  Shed is shed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, my goodness. I think this is my future here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the fun. Actually, I really like it.  And it's you. It's clearly you. I mean, it's your voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it just looks like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's even wearing he's even wearing the you even take the glasses off.  If you took off the glasses, we wouldn't know.  Yeah, you'd look like Mr.  Potato Head, but now it's pretty obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Giant glasses, though, from the special glasses.  They're big, giant monster glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're the ones you wore on Computer Chronicles when you demonstrated the.  Yeah, yeah, those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I found them. That's what gave me the idea to do the character. Yeah.  We'll be back. What can I say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, you need something to do.  It's good you've got a hobby. That's I'm just I'm just glad.  It could have been woodworking.  But no, it's it's the what is it?  The tech grouch that mevio dot com.  Yeah, I like it.  All right, you get to choice.  We were thinking, you know, I was very jealous.  Dig has this thing where you could thumbs up and thumbs down ads.  And I think it's brilliant.  At first, I thought, what advertisers going to allow people to dig or or or block ads?  And then somebody explained it to me because I'm not so bright.  And somebody said, no, no, this is good because the advertiser knows  that that ad will only be seen by somebody who wants to see it.  They don't pay for the ones that don't want to see it.  And I just can't figure out any way to do that with our ads.  So you're just going to have to listen. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a long intro for what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Go to meeting dot com.  There's no reason to thumbs down this.  This is going to change your life. Go to meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is the online meeting service that saves you money?  Now, you might say, well, how can a forty nine dollar a month service save me money?  Well, have you checked out the cost of business meetings lately?  My goodness. A thousand dollars, according to American Express,  the average cost of a business trip when you add up.  You know, the airplane, airfare, the hotel, the taxi, the Kobe beef.  It can get expensive.  That's why I do as much meaning.  I'm not going to do this for Dubai. I want to go to Dubai.  And boy, talk about an expensive trip. I'm not paying for it, but boy, it's an expensive trip.  Thank you to Ted X for flying me out to Dubai.  That's a thousand bucks.  That wouldn't even buy you like a little bonbon on Emirates.  With GoToMeeting, you have all the meetings you want.  Forty nine dollars a month.  You have free voiceover IP, you have free phone conferencing,  and people are it's more engaging, I think, than, you know, why do you fly out?  You fly out so you can show them the PowerPoint, right?  Hey, show them the PowerPoint and GoToMeeting.  They can engage with it. They can edit it. They can modify it.  They can say, well, what about this? They can search.  You can collaborate. You can train.  GoToMeeting is an amazing service from the folks at Citrix.  So, you know, it's good, it's secure, it's easy to use.  And did I say forty nine dollars a month?  How about free for the next 30 days?  Go to GoToMeeting.com slash twit and you can try it absolutely free.  See, this is what I was talking about.  We talk features, we talk benefits, we let you try it for free.  I'm not trying to trick you. I don't need to. We just let you try it.  And you be the judge.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  Thank you so much for their support this week in tech.  IPO, it hasn't.  When is the last tech IPO? I can't even think of the last one.  It's been ages.  Newegg says they're going to have a public offering.  They hope to raise one hundred seventy five million dollars.  I think this is actually something I would consider.  Do you have new? Can you buy from Newegg in Britain, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, unfortunately not.  It's the one thing as a tech hobbyist,  you know, a model, you know, as is my roots.  I used to read with envy, you know, the Newegg daily deals that were turned up on,  you know, on tech or hard ACP or all these kind of places.  And it'd always be something awesome to buy.  And we'd never be able to buy it.  And over here, it would always be, you know, three months late and twice as expensive.  Yeah. So I have a little new, a little mini chip on my shoulder.  But Newegg, I'll give you an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They the new eggs announced the OEM prices for Windows 7.  And it costs 220 bucks for Windows Home Premium.  But if you buy the OEC, they're smart, they sell the OEM version, right?  And I think you have to buy some sort of piece of hardware  with it to justify that you're building a computer.  So you buy it in a stick of RAM, but it's but it's like 99 bucks.  It's half price. Nice.  And every geek I know uses Newegg.  In fact, I was I've been trying to get them to advertise.  I think they'd be a great advertiser.  Maybe they'll have the money now that they've got this IPO.  They their revenue last year, 2.2 billion with a B.  Isn't that amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was astounding when I saw that. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the model they were that big razor razor thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's very. Yeah, that's revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, that's a good point. That's revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they did 2.1 billion in revenue,  but they only made a one percent margin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How much? 1.4 percent.  1.4 percent margin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Huh? Well, that's tough.  Yeah, you're right. That's how they.  It's the grocery business. Yeah.  Newegg stopped charging New York State sales tax  last year. That's a big story.  I think that's one of the reasons that these online retailers do so well.  And of course, it's very controversial with the states.  They don't you know, you don't pay sales tax.  Amazon, same thing.  Actually, Amazon will charge New York State sales tax.  Newegg will not.  So they want to go public. Would you invest?  John, is this a surprise?  I mean, I thought we'd never see another tech IPO ever again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the problem with the IPO market is largely due to, I think,  Sarbanes-Oxley and the reporting requirements.  That's what we talked about.  Yeah, I talked to Tim Draper, as a matter of fact, about this once.  And he specifically agreed.  He agreed with me and specifically said that it's not worth your while  to roll out an IPO unless you're 400 million dollar company.  And of course, obviously, Newegg is in that range.  It's just too painful.  So nobody wants to do it.  So they either do it on the line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The pain is the reporting requirements of a public company, according to Socks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And it's also it's apparently the stock number is,  is it kills four percent of your bottom line.  Wow. Just all the work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If they're only making one point four percent margin, this could be bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll be losing money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This could be a huge mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if it's a mistake.  Maybe they want to take the money and go somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the actual I mean, their one point four percent margin  results in 28 million in income in 2008.  All right. So can you go to do an IPO on 28 million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's interesting. I don't know.  I have not much money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't want but it doesn't sound like a good idea.  I mean, I think until they change some things and make it  and put them make the market more amenable to IPOs,  I think I think the entire economy is going to stay in the doldrums  because the fact of the matter is, if you have companies that are only being  built up so they can be bought by Google, you're not going to have  any aggressive competition.  It's not going to be very interesting as opposed to if you have a company  that knows it can do an IPO and then maybe take over the world.  You're going to it's a lot more lively.  Things right now are dead in the water because of this situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Frank, you've been you've been covering this at MarketWatch since 1998.  You've seen a lot of IPOs.  You saw the frenzy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  First of all, yeah, yeah, we were one ourselves.  I can't imagine buying shares of this IPO  irrespective of the business's dollars right now.  When do we expect consumer spending is going to come back?  I mean, it's everything I read looks says it's going to be until  it's going to be two years before the consumer gets out there  to start spending again.  So New Egg, I don't know that New Egg's revenues are going to really increase  and revenues are critical in the recovery.  Right now, companies are rising on Wall Street.  I think I read today that 75% of the S&P surprised on the upside  with their bottom line, but they did it through cost cutting.  And the only way to recover now, they've got to start getting revenue increases.  And consumer spending is not something I'd bet on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's interesting, because people have been saying the recession is over.  And the stock market's been doing very well.  But you're saying they're doing well, not on increased sales at all.  Merely cost cutting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  And just look at what happened last Friday when we saw the last month's job  job numbers for the first time in four months, the number of jobs  lost in the economy actually increased.  We'd had a three month gain, and then it just fell off the cliff last month.  And companies are still cutting their way to a positive bottom line.  But you can't you can't cut yourself.  You can't keep cutting and expect to keep making more money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this what I love that the phrase is this a dead cat bounce?  I just wanted to say dead cat.  Sometimes it's called a dead cow to people who love cats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know you love cats.  Well, you know, the best IPO prospect in the tech sector in the next, you know,  year or so has got to be Facebook, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, but they don't need an IP.  There's the irony. They don't need an IPO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They do if they want to walk away.  They don't want to cash in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the exit cash in and cash out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although, you know, a lot of these guys seem to be cashing in on their investors  money, right? I mean, they keep getting more money.  And then the next thing you know, these guys have new cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Twitter is now valued at what it was a billion.  Yeah. Yeah.  Facebook. What is its valuation to 40 billion?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't operate the Microsoft paid was 15, right?  15. I think it's gone up like 30, 40, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really?  I think Facebook's got something ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Whatever it is, you go, what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where is the number of multiple of earnings?  Usually, Frank, is it how do you figure out what you're worth?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the number is what an investor will pay for.  So you get that just like how you get that Twitter valuation based upon,  I think somebody invested 100 million dollars and they grossed it up.  And they said, well, a hundred million dollars and they got X percent of the business.  And so it's right. X, Y, Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a simple calculation.  If you buy a business, if you buy 10 percent of a business for a million dollars  and the business is worth 10 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So then the real question is, where does the investor come up with her number?  That's right. Yeah.  Well, that either is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or more, you know, well, you're breaking up, you're breaking up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what Will's going to say is that they just basically pull it out of their butt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, well, fairly plain spoken there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Will's British, I think he'd probably say derriere or rear or took us.  Bum. Bum.  I just I'm kind of glad that there's an IPO at all, to be honest with you.  It doesn't sound like something I would now that I know the margins,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would run out. Well, I'm not glad about it, because the fact of the matter is,  this thing's going to come out and it's going to have a publicly traded company  worth X amount of money and it's going to end.  And then the share price is going to drop, which is going to discourage further IPOs.  Unless you bring out a hot IPO, that's what you have to have.  Something comes out, comes out at 10 bucks and flies to 150 overnight.  Netscape. Then everybody gets jacked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Microsoft just completed the worst fiscal year in its history,  revenue down 3%, first sales decline ever.  All the top executives had their.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe if they'd advertise in PC magazine once in a while, wouldn't be such a problem for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, this article comes from PC magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting.  No, just saying, just saying.  Balmer's pay dropped from 1.34 million to 1.265.  Robbie Bach. Wow, wait a minute.  This doesn't sound right. The CEO.  Made 1.3 million last year, Robbie Bach, who is the president of the Entertainment  Devices Division, made 6 million.  If I'm bomber, I'm pissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, bomber doesn't need the money, A.  And B, there's probably some sort of bonus or something going on with Bach's salary.  He probably did a really good job of making money for the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess he did Xbox, you know, and.  He made a salary plus bonus, plus stock options, right?  That's this is total compensation numbers.  CFO got 3.5 million compared to 4.8 million a year earlier.  CEO Kevin Turner drops from he was making 8 million, 8.6 million to 5.4.  Poor Balmer, he's like, he's like the poor kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Balmer's got something else going on.  Sorry for him.  He gets it. He gets 10 bucks per autographed copy of Windows 7 for the Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to send him $10.  That's what I'm going to do.  Maybe Balmer should have like a PayPal tip jar in the Microsoft site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Speaking of Microsoft's quarter and the results and Windows 7,  do you think that Windows 7 is going to key off an IT rush?  Lots of upgrades.  I'm reading something on the web today that says  IT managers have been sitting with XP for let's call a 2001 technology.  So they've been sitting with it for almost a decade.  Is it our company is going to really go out there and make the switch now to Windows 7?  And is that going to help Microsoft?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. This is an interesting.  It's a great question.  And, you know, in the past, when a new version of Windows comes out,  it's very good for the PC marketplace.  And boy, the PC marketplace could really use it right now.  They're just struggling.  I think this is going to be one of those times where people say,  XP is fine.  It still runs. It's still supported.  Microsoft has an end of life.  I predict that, in fact, you're not going to see this big buy  and that this is going to be a further bad news in Microsoft's  bottom line.  What do you think, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I've already predicted that it would have a positive impact.  I did this some months ago, so I had I don't change that.  You don't change that.  No, I'm not.  You know, I'm not saying it's not going to have the impact of Windows 95  or even Windows 98 or any of the big, big monster  hits that Microsoft has had in the past.  Or Windows 2000 was a big.  They had a string of hits.  Windows 2000, Windows XP.  These things all did very well.  Then they had a Vista, which was their first flop in terms of hits.  And then they got this coming out.  Everybody seems to like it.  Looks pretty cool.  I don't think it's going to be a mega hit,  but I think it's going to be in line with Windows 98, which is,  you know, was a moderate hit.  And I think it will help their finances a little bit.  And I think they're doing at least they're trying to do some interesting  things with these parties and some other, you know, events and promotions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I notice I notice that all the marketing that I've seen is aimed  at the consumer, that they're trying to sell the consumer.  They want the consumer to buy a new PC.  But really, business is what makes or breaks.  Microsoft makes or breaks PC makers.  And I think business is not swayed by this.  I don't think the the marketing to business has been compelling at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for Windows 7. Well, you know, Microsoft sticks with this theory that  that they can pull it through the consumer part of the business.  They the in other words, I am a consumer.  I say I run a business, but I'm also have a computer at home.  And I get jacked up on Windows 7 or my neighbors do or something.  I see it. I like it.  I start using it.  And then I give the go ahead to the IT department. Go buy it.  I mean, I don't think that's a bad process.  I mean, there's no how they going to market directly to businesses anyway  nowadays. I mean, through computer world, I mean, it's a pamphlet.  I mean, there's no there's no there's no platform anymore.  No, I mean, these companies basically screwed the pooch  by letting all their conduits for information die.  Essentially, and now they don't have any way of talking to the businessman.  I mean, look at Businessweek.  It's a borderline going out of business itself.  And this is the main business publication in the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think, Will?  I think the Wall Street folks are on your side right now.  The stock Microsoft is selling at 25 across 30 or 31,  maybe in the past six months, but the stock is just flat.  I mean, that's it's dead.  Been dead money for five years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's been a pathetic stock, hasn't it?  For a company that is so dominant,  that has so many successful products.  And John and I, we've been talking about this for four years.  What you know, what's wrong with Microsoft stock?  Well, I think the problem with Microsoft's...  Will, I want to ask you, because we asked everybody.  I'd love to get everybody on record on this.  Windows 7, will there will it be a big boost for the PC industry  or will people just go, I'm sticking with XP, particularly in business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not going to be a  a huge boost for the PC industry, because I don't believe  that at the moment, a new operating system is top of people's wish lists  for things in a PC.  I think it will have a much better critical and popular reception,  because I think people will be getting it on, you know, netbooks  and laptops primarily.  And I think that, you know, they will like a lot more than that.  I don't think businesses  are going to be in a hurry to move to it, because again, you know,  I don't think there's the businesses right now aren't crying out  for a new version of Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think I think exactly right.  They're happy with XP.  And unless Microsoft says we're going to kill XP, and I don't think they can.  You know, and by the way, this is no no knock on Windows 7.  I say it again.  I think it's really the best version of Windows probably since.  Ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's certainly a lot faster.  I would agree.  It certainly is.  You know, it's the best version of Windows that Microsoft  have released in the past decade, probably easily.  I mean, I think I think it's great as the late lamented Windows 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how good I think it is.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, Windows 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Windows 2000 is still a great product. Still works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I thought I'd get some laughs out of that instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I get moans of joy and pleasure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People who think it's a tremendous operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It really was.  In fact, I was my go ahead, Frank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I found myself this summer  needing to boot up and run Microsoft money,  which they're taking away from me.  And let me don't get me started on that.  They are they going out of that business.  Yeah. And come on into it.  Where is the conversion program?  I need that. Yeah, that.  But I had a I had a three year old.  Yeah. The laptop is probably five years old.  It had Windows 2000 on it and I booted it up and it ran fine.  Who knows what downloads and updates it took in  when I booted it up after being dormant for three years.  Worked fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  My mom, I put my mom on Windows 2000.  I've moved her to Mac since, but she was on Windows 2000  but all, you know, all by herself without any virus.  You know, just normally secured Windows 2000.  Ran flawlessly perfect.  It's still running. It was on a Dell refurb.  Never got a virus, never got a bug.  You know, I mean, it's it was rock solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say the the mom moved to Mac,  I think is becoming the the must have geek move of 2008, 2009.  It is because I've done the exact I did the exact same thing  the end of last year.  She's using Quicken on the Mac, by the way.  Oh, I used to get a, you know, a phone call every week,  sometimes two a week from, you know, my mother with this is downloaded.  Well, there's a screen that's come up that says this is this the right thing.  I think I've got this virus.  And I went home, I bought her a Mac mini, I connected it up.  I put, you know, Microsoft Word on it so she could, you know, do all the letters  and she uses Hotmail, so she can do still do emails.  And I literally I don't think I've had  I think I probably had one call in the last 12 months  where she couldn't work out something, but no viruses, no spam, no nothing.  It's been like that.  I highly advise anybody whose mother is still on Windows to go and get them a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, you're maligning mothers all over the world.  Many moms, boneheads, many moms are more sophisticated than we are.  Why? I bet you there's moms out there who are writing Haskell code right now  for their for their database on the website.  They're about to take over Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, I just registered MumToMac.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Very wise man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good investment, Frank.  You know what? I've been using Frank in lieu of Quicken or  Microsoft money is Mint.  A quick quick into it, just bought Mint.  But I love Mint.  Now, it's not quite the same because you don't really balance your checkbook.  You just let the bank tell Mint, you know, and all your financial institutions.  Mint, what's going on?  But you get this great dashboard.  Yeah, I it was always too much trouble for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Mint is the one product I wish was available in the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You got Spotify. We got Mint.  Yeah. I wonder why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mint would be more helpful, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem with Microsoft money, Mint's all well and good.  But Microsoft money has all the investment records, all the portfolio.  Right. The transactions, the holdings, the profits gains.  So come tax time. That's what I'm talking about.  Yeah. Yeah. And right now, anybody with Microsoft money and there's  millions of them, remember, Microsoft tried to buy into it.  They really thought that business was going to be something  and they just let it peter away.  So now the situation is you got...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't get Microsoft in some of these things.  They they're almost like a little kid that loses interest.  First, they're all jacked up about buying into it and getting into that industry  and doing all, you know, becoming another big player there.  I'm worried now that if they had bought into it, they'd lose interest  and we wouldn't even have into it.  I mean, these guys are like that.  Why would they drop Microsoft money?  Is it losing tons of dough for them or or is it just marginally profitable?  I mean, what's the problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only service that Microsoft money provides,  and it's critical to somebody who's got a portfolio, is that updating  of stocks on a daily or weekly basis, whatever you want to do.  But that's data that is loaded into the program.  Well, without how much money can that cost to continue to provide that service?  Because the software once done is done.  They haven't updated the software in two or three years.  So it's not a big deal.  It's not a project they have to keep managing and moving along  and to to take care of competition.  And now, didn't we just read this week that Microsoft is talking to,  is it Bank of America about doing a Mint.com kind of product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. You know what I really think is happening at Microsoft?  And I don't think that they're wrong in this, is that they realize that desktop  software is not a there's no future in it, that they see companies like Mint.  They see web based services like that.  And that has really been the future.  I wouldn't be surprised if Microsoft introduces  something similar in its live family.  If I were Yahoo, I mean, Yahoo's got this great finance page.  I start looking, getting some web developers in there and working on that real quick,  because I think that that's where Mint really underscored for me  the value of just letting the software take care of it all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, of course, the irony about Mint was that it didn't actually really  own any of its own software, right?  It was all built on a third party platform.  They made 170 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's a classic story.  They made 170 million dollars for a front end.  And the company was a Yodely that makes the back end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They got squat. They got a new customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hmm. It's not unusual.  I mean, front end is everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So all window dressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all. Well, see, that's what I think.  I have to think, I think Ray Ozzie is some part of this strategy as well,  because, of course, he's very cloud focused.  I think Microsoft is repositioning itself  and really believes that desktop software has no future, that it's all got to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I think that's that's faulty thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you think that's off?  Do you think that's my part or Microsoft's part?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think that this is what Microsoft's thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I agree with everything you say.  I'm just saying I think it's faulty thinking that to think that  desktop software is dead is over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. I think maybe the computer is dead, to be honest.  We do the computer as we know it.  You don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, if let me see, I think you're I think you're onto something with this idea.  And I wanted to mention it to go back and beat the the Windows seven  horse, because if we're moving to the cloud with our software,  we're putting our data up there, we're using it from any computer.  The net is now the computer.  Yes. What do you need a new OS for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't. You just need a good browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, wait until the net goes down and tell me what you think after that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll go get some fresh air. It'll be a good thing.  It won't be down long.  What do you think it's going to be down for more than a minute?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't think it could be just taken down?  Like for how long? A day, a year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A month. This is Adam Curry again. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Month. A month would be look, even as we stand now  with the reliance on desktop software, the net goes down for a month.  It's terrible news.  I don't think it's any worse than if you're all cloud based.  It's bad news in general.  Not if you're Stephen King.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's his deal?  You're typing away, typing away for a month.  So you got a typewriter?  Well, I mean, on this keyboard.  It probably does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, nobody's saying you don't have,  nobody's saying you have no way of typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have. Let's look at some of this cloud stuff.  I have a lot of photos. They're huge.  The file sizes are monstrous because everything I save is in RAW.  So I have a bunch of ways of organizing these these photos.  And if I do it on the cloud, I'll be sitting here forever,  either trying to access these things or uploading them or doing all this  other nonsense that's much better done locally.  And this is the same thing for like I look at the PayPal account that I've got.  And I want to go from page to page to page.  It's like takes forever just to refresh the page.  And this is on a 10 megabit connection.  I mean, come on.  I mean, there's plenty of things that should be locally done.  I mean, this cloud thing is overrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got to play you this video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, Larry Ellison agrees with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got to play you this video.  Larry Ellison hates cloud computing.  Via Dvorak Uncensored, I might add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it won't play, John.  The cloud is dead.  What's wrong? There you go.  The cloud never had a local copy playing as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I'll tell you why you're wrong, John.  I'll tell you exactly why you're wrong, because you're going to you're going to die.  And your poor kids are going to have eight million tons of raw photos  that they're going to they're what are they going to if they're going to delete the data,  they're going to delete the data if that we're in Pekasa,  at least online in a photo album, somebody might look at it someday.  It's you're you're you're creating a data dump for nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm using it's for me.  I don't care about my kids having access to my own.  Are you going to look at those pictures?  Oh, please.  You're never going to look at it.  Cloud thing is a cornball idea.  Larry Ellison is dead right.  Let me play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unfortunately, the audio is not great on the Larry Ellison thing.  But let me let me let me play it anyway.  And you can kind of try to make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I assume it's better to screw that out.  I don't know if we can understand.  I have a judge at the time.  The fact that everyone is cloud computing is not only the future of computing.  It is the present and the entire past of computing is all cloud.  I mean, Salesforce dot com has been around for more than a decade.  And so is NetSuite.  You know, that's what's been around longer than Salesforce.  And it's people are saying, well, that's cloud computing.  You know, Google's now cloud computing.  Everyone's cloud computing.  My objection to cloud computing was everyone's civil looks around.  Oh, like, yeah.  Like, I've always been doing cloud computing.  It's like, yeah, like 10 years ago, the cloud computing, the terms and results.  Yeah, like, yeah, but I can have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's not an objection.  He's just saying it's meaningless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He doesn't like the term.  Now, you people should listen to that whole thing, though, anyway.  So if what he says is true, in other words, it's always been cloud computing  because as long as there's been a net, then why should anything change  in so far as the paradigm of computing?  In other words, why should we stop using packages for the desktop  when they still function very well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, all right, maybe they function well, but I think Microsoft.  And they're more efficient. They're more efficient.  Let's use money. Let's use money.  The idea of money sitting on your desktop kind of ignores the fact  that all the data that money is chewing on is out there.  Why does money need to be on your desktop?  Why not just have a personal website that's secure and safe?  Of course, that might be a question mark. There you go.  Let's assume it's secure and safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big assumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, but nothing's secure and safe even on your desktop.  But I think you can you can make it as secure as your desktop.  Let's put it that way, maybe more secure considering how people treat their desktops.  And it's always updated. It's always available.  Most importantly, you've got a dashboard.  I've got the Mint dashboard on my iPhone.  I can see exactly what's going on with my money here.  I could see it on any computer  because it's cloud computing. It's not tied to a machine.  Why should people don't back up?  They're not always sitting at the computer less and less.  So, in fact, I think more and more we want to have this stuff wherever we are.  We don't want to tie to a single CPU.  That's kind of an old fashioned idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm with John. I wouldn't put my photos online.  They're sitting here in an external hard drive. Absolutely.  And I would never I did not go in and try Mint.  I tried Mint. I looked at it, but I did not go with Mint.  No matter how easy it might be and accessible, it makes everything.  Because I'm concerned about the security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I resisted it too.  I understand that completely.  And I did resist it for a year.  And I'm kicking myself now because I went to it in August.  Once you understand that the back end is the same back end your bank is using.  What's the risk when your bank already has this?  The Yodely knows everything about you anyway. Right.  Yeah, no, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This this argument is is you can't is not arguable.  The Leo argument that we're hearing right now, because the fact of the matter,  it reminds me, let me give you the anecdote that I'm always reminded of,  which is the people that are fearful of putting their orders online for mail order.  Because the fact of the matter is your credit card to a waiter who wanders off.  No, actually, that's the real irony is beyond that is that fact of the matter  is because I've done direct marketing is that nowadays, if you want to set up  a direct marketing 800 number, they bring up that exact same website  because they won't take your order and they won't do the ordering for you  unless you have a website that takes the orders over the Internet.  Right. And they just type in what the person was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's probably a prisoner typing it in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Seriously, I was using for a long time, I used an online bill pay service.  And all my bills are scanned in this mysterious place in South Dakota.  Everything went to South Dakota until and I couldn't figure out why South Dakota  until I realized there was a federal penitentiary there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're paying prisoners 10 cents an hour to scan my bills in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now my concern, again, let's get back to the actual topic at hand,  is not so much about the cloud versus the non cloud versus the security.  It's the efficiency. It sucks.  It's absolutely stinks.  Like I said, I go to PayPal, takes forever to refresh a page.  I got a fast connection.  I'm doing some online writing or something.  It doesn't have half the power of Microsoft Word.  It's just too sluggish. I don't like it.  I don't like uploading photos to these crazy websites.  It takes forever.  You know, and then you have to do this and then they fail to recognize the photo.  I mean, you know, it's ridiculous.  I don't understand. They're bringing out a PS3 slim.  Who needs it?  I understand they're going to bring out a small we and it's going to be called the we we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's the tech grouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry, John, I had to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should never mention the tech grouch.  I have to live with this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right, well, you're the guy under 30 here.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I have to say the thing about cloud computing for me is,  you know, you mentioned sort of having, you know, your photos on the web  and don't necessarily trust your photos on the web and how, you know,  you don't want to get them up there.  For me, like, I would have to say that photos are almost pointless  if they're not on the web.  That's what I think.  Who's looking at them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Who's looking at them? Your kids aren't looking at them.  So you don't have to keep them there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can have them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I shoot eight gigabytes a week, generally, of photos.  I'm not going to be uploading that much.  It takes too long.  I upload every photo I care about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you should first of all, you shouldn't be saving eight gigabytes.  Yeah. So I pick the photos I want to save.  I upload them to Smug Mug and Flickr.  They're there. They're protected. They're safe. They're online.  If somebody wants them, they can see them.  I can I can link to them.  I share them with the world.  I think that that's a good model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is I still got them on Earth, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. But I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  erase them, Leo, erase them.  You don't need them on Earth just to erase everything you got and leave it up in the cloud.  And then when your account is canceled because somebody doesn't like the way you look,  and you can complain about it later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why I do Flickr and Smug Mug.  And you're right. You should save a copy.  But come on, let's face it, how many people have a shoe box full of photos?  I mean, my wife has we've moved four times with 400 pounds of photos.  No one will ever look at.  No one will ever look at those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scan them in and upload them, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. Look at them once.  And there are services that Scott Warren talked about.  There you go. I just had that.  You know, some guys in India took a look at.  You're proving my point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're proving my point.  That's the best way to deal with them.  Not that not I mean, you've got, John, an eight gigabyte a week shoe box  that just happens to be a hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I want to look at it, I can plow through them like there's no tomorrow.  It's very difficult to do when they're online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's too slow.  No, I know you're right.  I use Lightroom on the drive to scan them to look at them and see which I want.  So that's a good point.  All right, let's take a break. This is so much fun.  You guys are great.  Now, Frank, it's it's Barnaco.  Yeah, I've been saying Barnaco, Barnaco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a lot of people. It's OK. It's OK.  Frank, the last time I checked that 49ers were up 35 zip. What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  See, that's what happens when Brett Favre doesn't play for every team in the NFL.  I'm sorry, we I apologize, Will, in advance.  How's the cricket going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ask me how the Redskins are going.  Redskins, how the skins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, we're the Niners.  Niners lost their first game yesterday last week, but just by a little bit.  And I guess they're doing OK this week.  Kevin Rose was on the show and actually announced score.  So this is two weeks running.  I'm personally of the opinion that people who listen to the show  probably are not big football fans.  In fact, probably don't even get out much.  Huh? You think?  It's just a theory.  I could be a kid out.  I'm the Tech Grouch.  I love this character, dude.  This is such a great character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Beatles rock band. Who the heck needs this crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's you. It's finally you finally found your met.  I found myself. You did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, you know, you've got something.  It's you know, this is going to go viral.  I want to talk about something else that really, I think, is when I found audible.com,  my life changed. I know you agree with me, Will.  This is audio books are just fantastic.  Audible.com is the one and only the place to go to get your audio books.  A U D I B L E dot com.  They they have 60,000 at last count, 60,000 books on here.  Every category from business to fiction to nonfiction.  I just I know I always feel like life.  My life is moving so fast.  I just don't get enough time to read.  And audible solves that for me.  They also I really want to recommend the website because it's a great place to go to browse.  People often moan the loss of the bookstore, and I certainly love browsing bookstores,  but audible is just like a bookstore.  It's kind of like an online bookstore where you go and you browse and you look.  You say, that sounds interesting.  Some ways it's even better because you can listen to a sample of the book.  Here's Raymond Chandler's The Big Sleep.  Oh, what a classic that is.  I didn't even know that they had an audio.  Elliot Gould narrates this.  See, that's so cool.  I'm going to make this my audible pick.  And I don't even know about this.  I'm looking for books to listen to.  I've got a 15 hour flight coming up.  Many, many audible books are classics.  This is Unabridged.  Raymond Chandler's first novel from 1939 introduces Philip Marlowe to the world.  It was that great Humphrey Bogart Lauren Bacall movie.  It was kind of an inscrutable movie, I guess, because who wrote it?  Faulkner, I think, wrote the screenplay for it.  Nobody could figure it out.  But it's just a classic.  Ah, this is it.  This is my book pick of the week.  But you see how quickly you just bring it up and you're like, oh, I'm going to read this.

Transcript:  Riley, I said, doghouse Riley.  That's a funny name.  She bit her lip and turned her head a little and looked at me along her eyes.  Then she lowered her lashes until they almost cuddled her cheeks and slowly raised them again like a theater curtain.  I was to get to know that trick that was supposed to make me roll over on my back with all four paws in the air.  Are you a prizefighter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Still reading audio audiobooks, audible books, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to say my I've really been enjoying recently.  I've gotten into a little bit of a Tolkien kick.  Oh, how fun because there's been a couple of new Tolkien books released over here.  But audible has a fantastic a few of sort of Tolkien's lesser known works.  Farmer Jars of Ham, Rover and you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're only major only in audible Britain, I think audible UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I'm looking at it on the on the audible US side seven because they're in dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, good, because we looked for the Lord of the Rings and you could get it, but we couldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so they've got some really good ones.  So Farmer Jars of Ham, Rover and narrated by Derek Jacoby,  who's a fantastic kind of Shakespearean, you know, British actor.  And they're and they're really, really, really fantastic.  Slightly, slightly, you know, less read Tolkien books, but then equally as good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they good? Yeah, very, very good.  That's cool. I'm going to try this.  I'm a big fan of and they're making the movie The Hobbit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you know, I can't wait to see how that turns out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is Jackson doing Peter Jackson's not directing that, though,  the guy who did the other Lord of the Rings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so he's producing it, but it's being directed by Guillermo del Toro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's right. We talked about that.  The last time we were on, didn't we? Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm such a talking geek. It's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Apple announces that there have been there are 85,500 iPhone apps,  two billion downloads.  It's it's just remarkable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What is it? An 85,400 of them a tip calculator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you got your choice. You got your choice.  And flashlights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Palm has decided, I guess, to stop the shooting war with Apple.  Palm pre remember would sync with iTunes and Apple keeps updating iTunes.  So it doesn't work. So Palm kept offering firmware.  Finally, they've they've given up and they say,  I screw it, you're going to let you download from Amazon anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what?  Oh, hey, but no, the exact opposite is yesterday.  There was a new firmware release for the for the pre,  which re enabled thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, man, I thought it was over.  Depends when you read this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's hysterical. It's back.  So now you get both.  You get iTunes and Amazon's MP3 store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, you know, I've never used the Amazon services.  What's the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, the thing about iTunes is, you know, it's kind of encapsulated.  And it's but I don't think iTunes is that good looking or easy to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. I think it's difficult to use.  It takes for every time.  If I don't use it a lot, you forget, you know, this screw.  It's got a lot of weird screw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's it's it's like a lot of programs that are older  and have created a lot of silly UI cruft.  And so as a result, just, you know, no longer makes sense,  except to the people who have been there all along watching the cruft accumulate.  So you go to Amazon.com and you have to you can't search at the beginning  because you'll get CDs as well as MP3s.  You just go to the MP3 download section.  And I think, you know, I know a lot of iTunes fans who said,  oh, this isn't as easy to use. I think it's easier.  There, you know, when iTunes was still copy protected, this wasn't.  It's a great way to search. I was kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's easier because it's the Amazon vernacular, right?  Everyone knows how to use Amazon.  And so it's just making that available through the same kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about the distribution of podcasts?  No, they don't do much owned by iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't do podcasts.  And then that's always been a sore spot for me.  Not that I'm not glad that iTunes came along and made it easier to get podcasts,  but it's still so many clicks.  That's one of the reasons we started doing streaming videos.  So people just go to a website and they could see.  And I'm not going to be here next week because I'm going to Dubai.  But when we come back the week after, I'm going to blog world.  That'll be October 16th.  And I'll talk then about a new platform we have for distributing our video.  Because I.  Oh, so psyched for that, Leo. So psyched.  I did not want to just put it on iTunes because it's, you know,  I think we've plateaued.  And so I thought we got to find a new way to make it easy.  The whole thing is point of access. It has to be,  you could sit down on your TV and do it.  You know what I've mentioned?  We're going to do a deal with media flight.  They're going to put it on the Roku box, which is a great start.  You don't have that in Britain though.  But do you have Yahoo TVs in the UK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, these are the ones that have the new kind of widget stuff integrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think a lot of manufacturers are going to build this into their new TVs.  This will also work on those TVs.  So fantastic.  So the idea is that ultimately it should be no more difficult to watch a  channel flip show or a media show or a Twitch show on your TV than it is to  watch NBC, CBS or ABC. And once we get to that point,  then I think podcasts can take off.  I just don't think they can take off in the ghetto of the iTunes store.  It just doesn't, it's too hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what's kicking off over here with the new kind of BBC joint venture.  What's that? What's going on?  Which is they've got this project where they're basically,  I went to a meeting with the guys running it a couple of weeks ago,  where they're basically building the next generation in Britain,  the primary way of getting TV isn't cable, it's over the air. So it's,  it's terrestrial and they're building the next gen terrestrial spec,  but it's actually replacing terrestrial with IPTV.  So they're basically creating an entire,  the British kind of local standard for IPTV with the idea  that it's as easy to build, you know,  to get any third party content onto the TV as it is  to get anything that's over traditional broadcast.  And the model that they're using very explicitly is the iTunes app store model,  whereby content providers like Channel Flip in the UK,  You'll buy an app that is Channel Flip.  You'll make an app.  You basically make the equivalent of an app that can be browsed on the TV  with its own kind of UE within a certain kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly what Mediafly is doing. That's the way it has to be.  So there's going to be a twit button on the Roku or there'll be a twit button on  your Yahoo or there'll be a Channel Flip button on your Yahoo. And that,  and then that's interesting. The BBC is doing that as well.  Now one of our chatters says he's in Ireland and does have a Yahoo TV.  So I guess, I guess those TVs are coming out worldwide, but that's, that's,  and you know, Sony's making a TV that you plug your ethernet into. I mean,  I think that's really where we need to go.  It has to be that easy or people are just not, it's too much trouble to figure out.  I agree with you.  Thank you. What do you think about that Beatles rock band?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's crap.  Hate it. Crap.  No, what did you, what did you say? What? Who needs that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Learn how to play the, learn the real guitar, not the fake guitar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fake. I agree with you, Tech Grouch.  There you have it.  I think you're absolutely right. That fake guitar, that's, that's crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's going to be called the wee wee Beatles rock band.  Who the heck needs this crap?  We're going to do a few more of those next week.  I want you to do a ton of them. I guess it's not probably very hard, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could probably write that stuff in your sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just gripe about everything. So what else is new? How hard can it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can, there's not a lot of effort that's gone into that, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He says, no, wait a minute. Now, now let's not diminish.  You see, it's easy because John makes it look so easy,  but John's had to live a lifetime of disappointment,  frustration and horror to get to the point where he could make this kind of a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You may have missed it earlier in the show,  but is the Tech Grouch a 30 second spot that's going to play on websites?  Or is it a feature on Mevio that where we're expected to come in,  like a podcast, check on it every day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good question. We have no idea.  Hey you kids go learn to play the guitar like I did.  Well, John, you said this is your future, didn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. Sadly enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what it's come down to.  And I don't like adverbs. So, hey, I have a request by the way.  Mr. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I was thinking about this as I ran it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was editing a piece, somebody had a bunch of pops in it.  And of course I use one of these major screens for it to prevent that a little bit.  And I was thinking, wouldn't it be cool that,  you know the way they do a red eye and a photo thing?  Yes. Pop removal.  You know, they put a little circle around the eyeball, push the button, boom.  So why can't you make an audacity plug-in that essentially highlights the pop area  and then it then it renormalizes the waveform so the pop goes away?  That's a great idea. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm soliciting that from someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know who might be able to do that for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Our friend Doug Kay, who did the Level Leder.  Yeah.  He might be able to do with the pop-a-later.  The pop-a-later. That would be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have, if you use Audition actually, and I think other programs do this too,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  there's besides the wave view, there's this beautiful, Tony uses this.  I don't know exactly how it works, but it's like a spectrogram view.  And you can see stuff. It's different.  And I think you could see pops and just, you just like paint over it.  Like it's like a heel brush, just like a, you know,  heel brush, just like on Photoshop, but it's an audio heel brush.  It's really cool.  It is on what?  Audition, which is the software we were using.  Actually, we're abandoning it now.  We're going to do Final Cut for all the audio and video editing as we move to video.  So the RIAA, this is so sad.  Jami Thomas, Joel Tenenbaum, you know, they fought the IRAA,  they, RIAA, they fought the record industry.  They ended up with hundreds of thousands of dollars in damages.  Maybe they should have just ignored them.  The judge, Nancy Gertner, in the federal court in Massachusetts,  has issued four default judgments against people who were accused by the recording industry of peer-to-peer file sharing.  They never bothered to answer the charges.  So you'd think, well, hundreds of thousands of dollars in fines.  Yeah, now she gave them the minimum $750 a song.  A few thousand bucks.  They walk.  So the damages, if you go to jury,  Jami Thomas damages $80,000 a song.  Joel Tenenbaum's damages $22,500 a song.  Ignoring the lawsuit, eh, $750.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  You're basically encouraging what's essentially racketeering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Kind of.  Is this justice? I don't know.  I guess it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's racketeering is what it is.  They should throw these people in jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  For filing these suits, the RIAA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's just obviously, let's file a suit here, file a suit there.  Just file them all over the place, whether you download it or not.  And then you just give us the money or you have to pay, you know, at least $40,000 to take it to court.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's a surprise.  Two-thirds of Americans object to online tracking.  Why do they even do a poll for that?  And the number rises once they learn the different ways marketers are following their online movements.  University of Pennsylvania and University of California, Berkeley professors doing a survey, a study of marketers  and how people view marketing.  They ask things like, please tell me whether or not you want websites you visit to give you discounts that are tailored to your interests.  That's what Google and Facebook do, right?  66% said, no, we don't want tailored ads.  See, this is wrong.  They don't know they want tailored ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they know they don't want them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wouldn't you wait a minute?  Wouldn't you prefer this is this was my contention earlier on in the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is your contention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wouldn't you prefer if you go to a website that the ad, I guess the problem is they feel like they're being spied on.  But if you could set aside the spying, wouldn't you rather see ads?  I know we know this on TV.  You'd rather see an ad for something you're interested in than for something you're not interested in.  I don't care to see feminine hygiene spray ads on television because I just don't have that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like seeing ads.  At all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  And the question, was that the question?  Was it ads tailored to me or no ads?  And I'll bet it was the former and not the latter.  And so I'd rather not see any ads at all, period.  Ah, well, sorry.  I'd like to see ads tailored to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, I understand.  I don't want to see ads, but come on.  I mean, you also, you know, I also want...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't care if it's tailored to me or not.  I'm not going to pay any attention.  I don't like ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, then what do we do to monetize?  How do you monetize the tech...  I beg for money.  How do you monetize the tech grouch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're using a Squarespace thing that's tailor-made for the people who watch the tech grouch.  So they get a coupon code.  It's a targeted ad for people who are only interested in this sort of thing.  I don't know.  I mean, this is just like, you know, there's nothing else you can do.  You've seen ZZ Top, haven't you?  Go to squarespace.com, use the code word tech for a 12% discount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You get a better discount than we do.  We only get 10%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, stop!  Is there more?  This is a feature.  No, it just repeats.  Oh, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It just plays over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a feature in search of a business model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  I'm friends with the CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google...oh, with Squarespace, you're friends?  Yeah.  I thought I was.  That's a very nice little smug look, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a bigger discount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  That's okay.  It comes out of my pocket.  I actually give back to the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I get it.  The 2% comes from you.  Hey, what was I going to say?  Oh, Wave, Google Wave came out.  We talked a lot about it.  If you're really interested in this on the This Week in Google show, that's the Google  fanboy show.  This is, I think, probably somewhat less than a Google fanboy show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, your show, that show was rated number one by some podcast nutball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nutball?  It was number one on iTunes.  Well, besides that...  It's a very, very popular show.  Why?  Because Google is taking over the world and everybody wants to know when it's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have never heard this show.  I'm going to have to listen to it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's Jeff Jarvis who's great.  It's Gina Trapani.  And then we bring in a fourth.  I'd love to have you on it any time you want.  And we bring in a fourth person who's an expert in some area.  Yesterday was Marshall Kirkpatrick from Read Write Web.  And Kevin Marks of British Telecom, who's the guy who started, you know, created Quicktime  and used to work at Google.  So he's very...  Google Open Social.  So he's very...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you marginalizing this show, the big show, the Twitch show?  Yeah, this show is dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, the last time I say that...  Google is very, very...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, I'm not marginalizing this show.  Are you kidding?  I'm just trying to expand so that I can be a multimillionaire.  It's, hey, you know, it's expensive.  Servants.  Do you know how much a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A good butler is expensive and hard to find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's very expensive.  A hubcap on a Bentley.  You know how much that costs?  It is not easy to live in Northern California.  The pool boy raised the cost of, you know...  Raul?  Raul!  20% more.  He says because we have four pools.  And I don't think that that's fair.  I think it's by hour.  It doesn't matter how many pools you have.  The hourly rate should be the same if it takes...  It doesn't make sense.  Okay?  I'm just, you know, I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Well, I feel for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And have you seen the cost of Jet Fuel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what is this show Google about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's about Google.  But let me ask you about Wave.  What do you think?  Now that we've all seen it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I haven't seen it.  No, I never got my invite.  I never got it running.  I've never seen Wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only you got an invite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right.  I'm going to invite you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll send you invites.  I have three left just in time for you.  How about you, Will?  Have you seen it?  Here's the thing, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can send out the invites, but they're not going out.  No, they're nominations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're not invites.  They're nominations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're all just kind of stuck in some kind of big Google logjam.  Because I've had, you know, I've had people who have sent me, you know, a few and I haven't had any of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Leo, tell us all about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  What do you think of it?  You've been inside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I encourage you to check out our twig show because we did spend an hour talking about it.  You know, Scoble said, what is that?  You know, he finally got in and said, this is like incomprehensible mishmash of stuff.  It's like chat out of control.  And I think your first reaction is, this is kind of crazy.  But I'm going to be, I am going to withhold judgment because I think in time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's it supposed to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they miss, I think they misrepresented it.  The Rasmussen brothers, when they created it, said we want to rethink email.  Email was invented, you know, 30 years ago.  It's how people communicate is different.  And I think that people thought, oh, this is going to be the next email.  And it's not.  It's really for, I think it's a collaborative tool.  It doesn't even have a public face.  It's a collaborative tool.  So if we were, for instance, planning the show, which we've never done, but say we wanted to,  we would get together in a Google Wave and we type up ideas.  We'd paste in articles and video and so forth.  And we could collaborate and make a permanent document that is a record of the collaboration,  including all edits.  It's kind of Wiki like.  You can edit what I wrote.  I can edit what you wrote.  There's a playback so you can go back to the beginning and walk through the changes.  I think it's an interesting tool for that.  I think what's going to make it or break it is what third party developers do for it.  It's got a real API.  There are a number of bots and extensions and gadgets for it already.  And I think that that could really tell us what it could be.  I think we don't know.  Just as we didn't really know what Twitter was going to be until people got to it and  started using it.  And they really used it in ways that were different from what Twitter thought they would  be.  I think we will see Wave develop as its users use it.  I think it's very innovative and very interesting.  I think it has a lot of potential.  Sounds like something to tech grouch.  Is it different from Google documents?  Yeah, it is.  It's much more real time.  What it really is, is playing off of this real fervor for real time web.  Everything happens right now is collaborative and is in the real time.  I guess that's the question.  Much as cloud computing is new, no.  Real time is not new.  We've been doing real time on radio and TV for years.  Anything live is real time.  But the web has not had that until recently.  And now thanks to more modern web technologies and Ajax and things like XMPP, it can be real  time.  And I think that is kind of an interesting use of the web.  I'm excited about it.  We do a lot of real time stuff here.  I have chat rooms going while we're doing the show.  We have a friend feed room that's going while we're doing the show.  I think it's very valuable.  We've had 108 comments in our friend feed conversation as we've been talking.  Johnny Worthington says, Wave is interoffice email.  That may be actually a more apt description of it, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I remember the day when interoffice email used to come in a big manila envelope.  And there was a bunch of names on it.  And when you wrote the name, you read it and then you X'd your name off and sent it to  the next person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I bet you were a hoarder.  Did you hoard those envelopes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I didn't.  Well, maybe.  I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were very useful.  Oh yeah, you could store stuff in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they're a handy envelope.  It's also a good way to route stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is.  And remember they had air holes in them?  So they were really good for storing small animals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did have air holes for some unknown reason.  Nobody understands why they had air holes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's really good for keeping stuff now also?  FedEx envelopes.  Oh yeah.  They're very, very sturdy.  They're tough.  Yeah.  They're Tyvek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Are they Tyvek?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They seem like they're Tyvek.  Yeah, they're Tyvek.  They're very rare.  We tried tearing one.  I've sewn them into jackets and so you can wear them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not that Tyvek is not the same thing as bulletproof material, right?  That's something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's Kevlar.  Dvorak's beard is made out of Tyvek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that beard is definitely nothing natural.  Let's put it that way.  It was never anybody's actual hair.  John C. Dvorak is at ChannelDvorak.com and check out his new Tech Grout show, which I  think we've plugged more than enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't mean to even plug it at all.  I'm glad you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can catch him there and we thank you so much for being here, John.  And boy, that camera's looking good for people who want to see John and his incredible sartorial  excellence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to dye my hair or something.  I'm too blonde.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where'd you get that?  Yeah, you're too blonde, John.  Where'd you get that shirt?  That's just wild.  Taiwan.  Oh, it looks something like Carnival, left over from Rio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Believe it or not, I bought this shirt about almost 20 years ago in Taipei.  I've never worn it because I just saw the fabric.  That would make a great custom shirt.  I bought it at the Lila Sheraton's tailor shop.  And it's been in the closet forever.  And every time I put it on and think I'm going to go outside with it, I put it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't wear it.  It's like impossible.  Mimi says, with me, you're not wearing that shirt.  So I figured this is where the shirt is.  It's perfect for this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  You like to plug that Twitter, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do.  I do.  It's just the, you know, I'm an immensely vain person.  Really, that's all Twitter is good for, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Just like kind of flogging your personal brand.  Pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But also makes a fantastic crowdsourcing resource.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  You know, it's really good.  In fact, that's what John's always said.  It's really good for asking a question and getting an answer.  And he's going to go.

Transcript:  How many days will you be on the ground in Dubai?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to be there.  We fly out Tuesday.  And that means we arrive Wednesday evening.  So I'll be there Wednesday evening, Thursday, Friday.  Saturday I speak.  I'm going to do the radio show from there, which is going to be a lot of fun.  And then we fly back on Monday.  So I get a good five, six days there.  Have you been there, Frank?  I have not, but it is the one place I would like to go.  We were talking about a wedding anniversary trip, and I suggested that.  My wife said no, but I'm going to go with the wedding anniversary trip.  And we're going to do it on Saturday.  We're going to do it on Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to do it on Sunday.  We're going to do it on Saturday.  We're going to do it on Sunday.  We were talking about a wedding anniversary trip, and I suggested that.  My wife said no, but I hope you take a lot of photographs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm going to live blog, photograph, and do the usual crazy media thing that I did last summer in China.  And the iPhone is really a great platform for kind of blogging a trip.  You can just do the whole thing.  And so I hope I don't have the same AT&T bill that I had from China, but I will do that.  And I will fill you in, and maybe I can convince your wife it's worth going.  My wife's very excited.  She's, she, we're going to take a water taxi to the Sooks and buy gold, I'm told.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You better go with the local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, oh yeah, because I can't, I don't know how to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They'll rip you off.  I mean, the gold thing is cool because they actually will sell you these elaborate gold chains,  and they weigh it, and then they see what the current market price for gold is, and you buy it at that price.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Plus 100% or no?  No, no, no markup.  So they, wow.  Well, so then I don't have to haggle there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, there's still, apparently they do say pull some tricks on you if you don't know what you're doing.  Like the old thumb on the scale trick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow, that gold chain weighs 12 pounds.  There's an area in Dubai that every shop is a gold shop.  That's where I want to go, the gold Sooks.  It's blinding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I can't wait, I'm so excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, go with the local.  No, we will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We actually, what's great is I'm being, I mean, Giorgio and the people there are just being great,  and they're going to take us everywhere.  We're going to go out in the desert.  I want to shoot some, do some photography out in the dunes.  I'm really looking forward to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'll report back.  The entire town is the desert, but go ahead, you know, think what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Horrible.  Next week we will still do a twit, but it will be Brian Brushwood and Molly Wood.  We call it Schwudden Wood, and that will be at the same time.  And I'm sure they'll have a blast.  All the other shows will continue on with Alex Lindsay guest hosting for me,  and I will be back, I guess, Tuesday for Mac Break Weekly.  That's a week from Tuesday.  But do follow my, I guess the best place to go probably would be follow my FriendFeed account,  because that will pull in links from Facebook, from my blog, from my Twitter, from everywhere else that I post.  That's friendfeed.com slash leolaport.  Frank, are you on Twitter?  You want to plug your Twitter account?  Frank Barnico is the Twitter account.

Transcript:  Easy enough.

Transcript:  B-A-R-N-A-K-O.  And the real Dvorak.  Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What else would it be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it could be real Dvorak if you're David Pogue.  Did he ever apologize to you?  Yeah, he sent me a note, but he never, you know, he sent me a tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He tweeted you.  At least he tweeted the right account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  David was complaining that John was ripping him on Twitter, and it turns out it wasn't John.  It was somebody pretending to be John.  Doonsurfing.  Doonsurfing. They said I can go doonsurfing.  That'll be fun.  Hey, thanks, guys. Really appreciate your time.  Thank you all for being here.  East Meets West is coming up next.  I'm Leo Laporte.  Another twit.
