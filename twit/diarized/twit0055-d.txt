Transcript:  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is Twitter This Week in Tech, episode 55 for May 21st, 2006.  We are gathered here, ladies and gentlemen, to discuss the week's news in technology and once again, another fantastic Twitter panel. Steve Gibson hasn't been with us in so long, I thought I'd bring him on, especially since there's some security things to talk about.  Hey Leo.  Hi Steve.  Welcome back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Glad to be joining you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Our good friend Robert Heron is here because he had promised to give us a review of some high-def DVD players and we thought we'd get him on to talk about that.  Hey, pleasure.  Welcome back Robert from DLTV.  Thank you.  And from Great Britain, although he can't seem to make up his mind whether he's from England, the UK or Great Britain.  All three actually, Will Harris.  Hey, how's it going Leo?  Good to have you from bit-tech.net and of course the linchpin of the Twitch scene, MrJohnCDevorak.org slash blog.  I'm just going to, every time I say Devorak, I'll just say dot org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I'm going to try to have my name legally changed.  Your honor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not to Jesus Christ, but to Devorak.org slash blog.  Exactly.  That's a great idea.  Maybe I could be Leo Twitt.  I don't know if that's such a good idea.  I thought you already did that one.  I already am that.  I'm living that.  Did you see anybody, nobody flew to New York to see the new Apple store.  But boy, that looks gorgeous.  Fifth Avenue and it's all underground.  I mentioned that to somebody that said, oh yeah, Manhattan real estate is so expensive, they're moving underground.  But that's not why they did it because there's this giant glass cube up top occupying space and it is spectacular.  Anybody see the video?  They are so cool.  Apple is so cool.  John, have you seen the pictures of this Apple store?  I blogged it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you?  Yeah, I got a picture.  John Brockman's offices are right next door, so he sent out a photo.  A couple days ago, I blogged it a day ahead on Thursday before they opened it.  And you know, I made some interesting comments.  You know, this thing is going to be open 24-7.  It looks like a big giant public restroom.  Essentially, and I expect people going in there, you know, to pee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where's the bathroom at?  Why would you have a 24-7 store?  Do people really want to buy Macintosh computers or iPods at 4 in the morning?  Yeah, New York though.  The city that never sleeps.  Never sleeps.  I guess that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, surely it's for students who suddenly get like, you know, half way through an all nighter for an essay and their MacBook dies or something.  And you go, oh, I've got to get a new MacBook before my essay's in tomorrow.  And you can run down the Apple store at like 5 in the morning.  I've got a few thousand left on my credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's buy a new computer.  All right.  I have a major confession to make.  I didn't go to New York to buy it.  But the minute I, I guess it was Monday morning or was it Tuesday?  It was Tuesday morning without a fanfare, without us, you know, no Steve Jobs speech, no mystery invitation to the press.  Apple just kind of put it up on their website, the new MacBook.  And I admit, not only did I buy one, but I paid the $150 premium to get it in black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And how'd you like it?  Am I a sucker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is no, Leo, you have, you are the most unbelievable example of like not beyond early adopter.  Anything that happens.  I mean, we can go on with some of these things we've done like Ventrilo and some of these other things.  It's amazing that you jump on anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have no, I have no impulse control.  Actually, Alex Lindsay is worse.  Alex Lindsay told me that he, he with the last Apple announcement, he actually called the Apple store and said, I don't know what it is, but whatever it is, hold it.  For me, I'll be in to get it.  I want one.  I want one.  I don't know what it, I don't know what it is, but I want one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I can tell them what it is.  Well, in this case, we know it's too much disposable income.  That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think so?  So tell us about, so I haven't got it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's a, you know, I ordered it a BTO because I, that is built to order.  I didn't go to the Mac Apple store.  I actually ordered it online because I want, first of all, I wanted a gig of memory.  In fact, if it hadn't been an extra 500, I probably would have ordered the two gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  They charge you an extra 500 just for going from one to two gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's only a hundred to go to five from 512 to one, which is still overpriced, but that's ridiculous to charge a 500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I went to see it in the Apple store in London.  Actually, they had a bunch of them out.  And?  Well, I mean, the machine itself, the form factor is really, really nice.  The 13 inch widescreen works really well.  That's what I was waiting for is the screen size.  So that's great.  The glossy screen is nice if you like glossy screens.  The major problem with the premium on the black one is that the black is, it doesn't have that kind of polycarbonate coating.  You know, the white one is kind of like shiny.  It's all really tough plastic.  The black one is just like a really matte black paint job.  And the guys in the Apple store were like, oh, this is like never going to survive.  They were saying, the actual, the guys that work there were saying they were really worried that it was going to scratch like crazy  because there's no protective coating over the top.  And it just kind of feels like a powder coating kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was wondering myself.  You could have painted it yourself.  I know, for 150 bucks I could have probably painted it blue.  I know, I feel like such a sucker.  But, you know, and the irony is, IBM HP, every laptop's black.  Why am I paying a premium to get an Apple that looks like every other laptop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that hasn't been an Apple in black for a while, has it?  No, and a white laptop's too girly for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't want a white laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think black is cool.  I wonder if they've made it matte after their experience with the black iPods where people were complaining they were just scratching so easily.  I think that's exactly what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and matte is so much easier when it gets scratched up that it makes it even look worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't buff it out.  Yeah, and it's quite fingerprinty as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just nice to see hardware devotion for a particular, you know, a complete PC.  You have so many people building their own systems and it's just nice to see.  Gee, black, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know I'm a sucker and I still can't resist it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's got a 16 by 9 form factor screen?  Yeah, 1280 by 800.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nice.  So your DVDs will fit, you know, nicely.  1280 by 800 is the screen?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like 16 by 10.  Yeah, it's a little bit bigger than 16 by 9.  What's the problem, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know, that just seems like a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the iBook, the 4 by 3 iBook is 1024 by 768, so it's wider, 1280 instead of 1024.  And a little higher.  And it's slightly higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was thinking you could at least go to 1280 by 1024 or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody seems to be complaining about the resolution, although I have to say that people do seem to not like the glossy.  Do you have experience with glossy screens, Nick?  I mean, Will, who's Nick? I don't know who Nick is.  Will, have you had experience with glossy screens?  Yeah, absolutely.  I think everybody in Britain should be named Nick. It would save me some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's really a matter of personal preference.  Some people really like the extra kind of contrast and brightness that you get from the glossy screen.  And they look really good if you're like in the dark.  But the trouble is they reflect daylight and lights really, really badly.  So it's really hard to work outside with a glossy screen because like the sun gets reflected like crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Robert, PCs come with glossy screens, right? Some?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some. I've been using one from NEC for about two months now and I love it.  But at the same point, it's not pointed toward any windows and there are no lights behind me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to have control of the room lighting for it to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really helps. But the blacks are liquid black and the colors pop a little bit better.  And they're one of my favorite displays, but you're totally right.  Using it outdoors or with any kind of weird lighting, you're just going to see yourself or reflections of what's in the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the deal? I mean, is it just the way the screen is coded, the surface of the screen, or is it actually a different kind of screen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, it's just that top surface coating.  It helps actually trap when it goes to pure black, when you're trying to make black on an LCD and you have that backlight glow,  it helps minimize that glow so the blacks look blacker and actually measure darker too.  But you're trading off that anti-reflective or the diffusion that most LCD screens have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so I guess I will be able to kind of control the lighting so it'll be okay.  We'll see how it looks in a TV studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll just turn the brightness up enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I suppose we'll find out from you in a few weeks here what you actually think about it.  I'll be bitching and moaning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You never tell us what you finally paid for this, Turkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it was almost two grand because I put 120 gig hard drive.  Part of the reason I wanted to get the bigger hard drive and the more memory is I wanted to either run it.  I haven't decided which boot camp so I can dual boot Windows or I think more likely I'm going to run Parallels,  which is the virtualization software that lets you run Windows in a window on OS X.  But I'm figuring this is my Windows and my Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm thinking you should almost go with the lowest memory build you can get in the thing.  And then put your own in.  If you can get just one stick because I imagine that their one gig option is two, five, twelve sticks.  It is.  So if you ever wanted to go beyond that, you're going to have to start over essentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If I had thought about it, I would have bought the low end.  Well, you want the two gigahertz.  So instead of the one, I would have bought the medium range white.  I would have bought it with the stock drive and the stock RAM.  Pulled them because it turns out it's unlike the older iBooks.  It's very easy to put in more memory.  You don't have to take the keyboard out.  It's like a more traditional laptop where there's a port you can open up, get out the memory and the hard drive slides out.  So I would have just done the upgrade myself.  I was stupid.  $500 for a gig of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that outrageous?  That's out. Yeah.  It's DDR2. It's standard RAM.  OK. So at least it's DDR2.  So that is more cutting edge and say they all DDR1 stuff for notebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How much though if I wanted to go out and buy two gigs of DDR2, how much am I going to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For a notebook of a hundred bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK. So I'll save 300 bucks.  I think I'm going to need the two gigs of for parallel for parallels to run Windows because it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's not true.  They've done all kinds of research that shows once you get to a gig, it doesn't do you any good to load up more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But understand I'm running it at the same time as they're running OS 10.  Are you going to run two simultaneously?  Simultaneously. So you need the two gigs because you want to allocate at least 512 to the parallels partition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The memory partition will take as much as you get.  Not to mention the fact that it's got motherboard video.  It's got the 950.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or Leo, you just sit around all day watching television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it doesn't really matter, does it?  Who needs all that RAM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's nice under Linux though.  Who needs another laptop for that matter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's true.  I can't really justify this.  We should get out of the house more.  Come on.  I'm busy.  I got podcasts to do.  I can't.  OK, I'll tell you what.  I'll go to the new Apple store on Fifth Avenue.  That'll get me out of the house.  Now take a camera.  Reminds me a little bit of the Louvre, which has that big glass pyramid above ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's everybody says that's very derivative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, of course, that's what John was saying.  It's very much like a Louvre.  It's a whole.  The Louvre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So doesn't anybody find this story about the RIAA suing XM over it's basically a TiVo-like device?  Yeah, this is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, there's some...  Remember the Sirius 50?  What is it?  The SR50?  The S50?  The S50.  That allows you to record was held back.  And it turns out that the RIAA went to Sirius and said, you can't release this.  It was kind of a portable TiVo for Sirius.  You can't release this unless you hobble it so that it will only record talk and will not record music.  So Sirius did.  They held it back.  It was delayed.  They finally released it and it only records talk.  Now the RIAA is going after XM.  XM, to their credit, is fighting.  As they should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good.  Well, and I have a question.  What about the Dish Network?  And what about the other guys, DirecTV?  I know the Dish Network, for a fact, has all the Sirius stuff available online.  That's right.  Can you record it?  And if you've got a TiVo device, you can record it.  I mean, why don't they sue these guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you're not recording it directly.  You're recording the analog...  That's the analog hole, right?  You're recording the analog version of it.  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a digital recorder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you have the satellite recorder that's integrated in?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and these guys have been doing it a lot longer than the XM radio, so how come they weren't sued?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I love it that the Consumer Electronics Association is now on the other side, you know, facing off against the RIAA.  That's nothing new.  Well, they've had enough.  They don't want the RIAA to control this stuff.  No, this has been going on for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, that's been going on for years.  Gary Shapiro has had nothing good to say about these guys for years.  He represents the guys who make this equipment.  He doesn't represent these copyright holders.  No, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what Vice President of Governmental Affairs for the CEA, Michael Petrkone, says.  Here they go again.  The record industry is returning to the courts in their nonstop efforts to stop new technology, neuter existing products,  frustrate customers, and make illegal long-standing consumer home recording activities.  I guess you're right, John.  They're mad about a lot of stuff.  Their new target is XM Satellite Radio, one of America's top technology success stories of the new millennium.  XM's only offense is providing legal and exciting programming options to millions of Americans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting is that they said that the damages that the record industry was requesting was $150,000 per song recorded by a customer.  Somebody sat down and worked it out and said it was like the amount that the industry was requesting was more than the GDP of France every year,  which was actually greater than the turnover of the industry itself.  Ask for France instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just take the whole country.  The lawsuit says the CEA is another ambush in the label's ongoing wars on innovators and consumers.  It's time to say enough is enough.  So what is the grounds that it is violating copyright because you can make a copy, a recording?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's allowing people to download direct digital versions and then play those digital versions on that player out of order.  It's like a time shifter.  And so the RAA is saying that it's like iTunes.  But what the XM guys and the industry guys are saying is that actually it's not like iTunes because you can't transfer it on.  You can only play it on that device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't take it off the device?  No.  Oh, well, that's ridiculous then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's only like recording off the radio or something.  And in fact, the Home Recording Act supports that.  The Yodo Home Recording Act in the States specifically says that if you can't transfer it off, then it's legal.  And that was that was an act that the RAA like worked to like gestate and approve back in the day.  And now they just they've made no mention at all of that act.  There's no mention of it at all in their lawsuit.  It's like they're just ignoring it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My question is and I we have to get a lawyer on.  I remember that the digital the Home Audio Recording Act was specifically for analog recordings.  And I did they did they not exempt digital recordings or did it strikes me that it was for analog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As far as I know, they didn't exempt digital.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and then we had something called the A HRA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's it.  And it says no action may be brought under this title alleging infringement of copyright based on the manufacturer's importation distribution of a digital audio recording device, a digital audio medium or analog recording device or analog recording device.  Or analog recording medium or based on the noncommercial use by a cost consumer such as a device or medium for making digital music recordings or analog music record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a judge is going to look at this and throw it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  But what they're saying is that it's possibly a negotiating tactic to get XM to pony up more money.  But of course, if XM knows that a judge is going to throw it out based on that, there's no negotiating tactic at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And XM has, I think, been pretty clear that they're not going to they're not going to go for this.  Here's what Mitch Bainwall of the RIA says.  He says XM wants to offer listeners what is essentially a free version of iTunes without paying the music companies for the right to sell their songs.  Don't they pay for the right to put that music on XM?  Of course they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And XM is actually one of the greatest pairs of music royalties in the States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says it's a great deal for XM because it drives subscriptions, but it's fundamentally unfair to songwriters and labels and threatens to puncture the integrity of the digital music marketplace.  Right. Is it growing? Well, let's play.  Let me play the devil's advocate.  Don't artists deserve to be compensated if you're going to be able to record their stuff and listen to it later?  Or not?  As I could do right now over the radio.  It's kind of like that, except it's digital.  It's better quality than the radio.  That's arguable.  Well, yeah, but XM already is compensating the artists under the framework that's being laid out by the American legislature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the Apple argument's a little weak because you have no control over the order of the songs as they come into the player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're at the mercy of XM for their schedules and for what, sure, they break it up by genre, but it's up to the end user to record those things.  So you can't strip these songs out and take them off or put them anywhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All you can do is listen to them in a different order if you want.  Or create analog versions with, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But you could always do that.  Very manual labor.  Yeah, you could do that with anything.  That's the so-called analog whole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, lawsuits are, I mean, this isn't the only lawsuit in the news.  Creative Labs, I guess we don't call them labs anymore.  They're just creative.  Has gotten creative.  They're marketplace dwindling.  They can't sell sound cards.  Nobody needs them.  They can't sell the sound cards.  Do they still sell them?  Don't people get sound cards on their motherboard now and aren't they happy with those?  Do you think creative has a business with selling sound cards?  Yeah, they've got some good stuff.  They sell some good new gaming cards.  The X-FY is pretty cool.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They probably largely are there because of inertia.  You certainly wouldn't create a company that didn't exist today in order to sell sound cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, they've established themselves and there are like, you know, higher end six channel.  Because they want surround or.  Exactly.  All right.  They're sound cards for the PC.  They're sound cards for the PC.  They're sound cards for the PC.  They're sound cards for the PC.  They're sound cards for the PC.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  Their sound cards for the PC are better than anything you can get integrated into a motherboard.  I mean, audio quality to performance with especially some of the newer games that use up to 120 channels of audio simultaneously,  especially some of the massive multiplayer stuff.  There is a reason to have it.  But you're right.  I doubt it.  I doubt there's going to be a new sound card company jumping in to fill that space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Creative had hoped to make a good business out of its.  In fact, they were one of the very early MP3 players, the creative diamond Rio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give them credit for popularizing MP3 because they're the ones that brought the first MP3 player that got enough attention that the RIAA sued them.  And in the process, popularized by way, they would MP3 format would probably be languishing right now if it wasn't for the RIAA suing creative labs for their original players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, creative is back in court suing Apple, saying that Apple stole the user interface for the iPod from creative.  Now, creative's patent was filed in 2001, but they didn't get it to last year.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't that doesn't look like I've seen a lot of the creative players.  I've never seen anything as slick as the iPod interface from anybody but Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't get it. Yeah.  Because the patent is just really for hierarchical menus where you click a category and you go down.  You go into the category and you get a list of songs and so forth.  Ooh, nested subdirectories. Yeah, there there's an invention.  I think the key on the iPod UI is the click wheel.  And yeah, I mean, I think one of the reasons people buy the iPod is because it has such a superior user interface to anything that creative has come up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think all that will come of this is that they'll end up litigating.  Somebody will settle or Apple end up getting creative's bogus patent overturned and that'll be the end of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a classic, though, in American business.  If you can't beat him in the marketplace, take him to court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I was reading that Apple turned around and sued creative today or yesterday.  What was that about? Yeah, that's what I'm curious about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of the question nobody quite knows as far as Engadget says that there's no details actually as to what they've turned around and sued them for.  But apparently it's outside the realm of this kind of interface patent.  It looks like Apple was sort of digging some dirt on creative whilst creative was digging the dirt on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Apple's probably got a few patents in their portfolio that creative violated too, I'm sure.  I mean, that's what the Silicon Valley story is always about.  But you know, the more interesting suit since we're on the topic is the Symantec suit suing Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want to stop Vista. No. This is a classic.  Tell us what happened, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, apparently, you know, somewhere along the lines, Microsoft got hold of some something, I guess, Veritech, I believe.  In fact, let me get the story up. The here it is. Veritas. Oh, it's the Veritas. Veritas.  Veritas designed a file structure of some sort, some way of store, what they call a storage technology.  And Symantec, of course, bought them.  And now there's a debate over whether or not Microsoft got the full rights to use this stuff or not.  And Symantec says they didn't. And Microsoft said they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There may be some merit to this because Microsoft admits they're using it. They licensed it in 1996.  Right. So it really comes down to what that license agreement allows them to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I don't understand how these things get this far. You either have the paperwork or you don't.  I mean, is there paperwork?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Symantec is also saying that Microsoft tricked the patent office into granting patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that Microsoft would ever trick anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think what's good about this or interesting about this story, at least, is the fact that Microsoft, you know,  which is responsible for the BSA and all these, you know, these somewhat nefarious lawsuits that they were, you know,  that make people do these audits and do this all this stuff. I mean, now they're in a position, you know,  and by the way, if you do an audit, you don't have the right paperwork. You know, you have to pay all these fees or fines.  Now Microsoft's not going to have the shoe. You know, they have to deal with this kind of situation with their paperwork,  which, you know, could be lost for all we know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  According to Symantec, Microsoft was so bold as to file fraudulent documents with the U.S. government,  claiming stake to Veritas inventions. There are Microsoft patents.  In other words, Microsoft patented something that Symantec says Veritas actually invented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a pretty interesting trick. Very rarely in today's day and age can you get away with that.  I mean, even a lot of these fraudulent patent suits don't get very far anymore because there's so many people on the internet  that are combing these things over that once these things show up in the literature, as it were, you know,  on the online literature. I mean, everybody gets the word gets out real fast. I think that's what happened.  You know, Microsoft can't do can't pull a stunt like that and get away with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any other lawsuits come? This is the lawsuit happy issue of Twitter.  Oh, yes, actually, there is another lawsuit. ICM, which is the company behind their registrar.  They're the ones behind the triple X domain. They were, you know, and we talked about this last week.  ICANN decided not to allow it mostly because they would have to enforce it and they didn't want to.  ICM is suing the two departments of the U.S. government for access to documents.  It claims showed that the U.S. government pressured ICANN into rejecting the domain.  They're suing the Department of Commerce and the Department of State saying that the government said don't do it.  Somebody told me actually after our show, somebody sent me an email saying, no, the real problem was I can didn't want to be put in the position of enforcing this triple X domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was there to enforce? Well, I guess the theory would be forced to enforce the dot org or the dot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, no, not you. No. Now, would that company make money from the sale of triple X domain? Yes.  OK, so there's the whole reason right there, because nobody was unhappy with that decision.  I mean, the porn industry, the parent teachers, people are the concerned parents group, whatever.  Everybody was happy at the way that went down because ICANN didn't want to be the enforcement agent, like you mentioned.  The triple X folks don't want to.  I mean, the pornography industry didn't want to get into the position of being forced into a domain where.  Or basically, you know, nobody's going to be able to really enforce it.  And then you end up with people who have both the dot com and the triple X domain names and just that complete mess.  So I wanted it. I'm the only one who wanted it, apparently.  I want one, but it's a good idea. I think it's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a great idea. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would make well, and we talked about this last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it would take years before it would ever catch to the point where it would be any of any use.  And maybe it never would. But at least it's a start. Right now, we're doing absolutely nothing about all the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing. Nothing. And one more lawsuit to round out our lawsuit stories.  We need some we do a legal show, not a not a tech show.  A lawyer in Pennsylvania is suing Linden Lab, the publisher of Second Life, saying the company unfairly confiscated his virtual land.  The guy had a technique, a trick for for essentially cheating the auction system in in Second Life.  That's this is the virtual world that we're talking about.  And he was able to, by taking the URL for the auction and substituting the user ID, buy land much more cheaply than it was worth.  And so he's a speculator. And then, of course, he wants to sell it.  Well, Linden Lab found out, they said, under the terms of service, you're you're out of here.  And the guy's now suing say, but wait a minute, I had thousands of dollars sunk into virtual land.  I mean, real thousands of dollars sunk into virtual land.  I want it back. Is I love stories like this.  And I only because I just love it that these virtual worlds are becoming so much like reality.  People take taxes on that land soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You bet. You go, that would end it.  I mean, that'd be all.  I you know, I read these stories that you shake my head like, wow, this is the weirdest thing I've ever read.  Finally, the judge issues a split decision in the AT&T privacy lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a story we've been covering for a while.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation sued AT&T saying they illegally gave the NSA those Internet and telephone records without a court order or a warrant.  The judge kind of split the baby on this one.  He made he made both sides unhappy, I guess.  Let me see what the federal I'm trying to find the quote from the federal judge.  He ordered the EFF not to give the document.  The problem is these documents that the EFF got for its lawsuit, the government says they want them back.  You can't release these documents. This would be for security reasons.  So the government won in the sense that the judge said you got to hold on to those documents.  But the EFF won because the judge said, but the Justice Department can't have them back.  The Justice Department tried to classify the documents as military secrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But in fact, they're now useless because because the EFF can't really do anything.  Nobody can look at them. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The AT&T says they hold sensitive trade secrets.  The government says they they hold military secrets and the Electronic Frontier Foundation says is the only way we could pursue this lawsuit.  The judge said, we'll just hold on to it. We'll figure this out later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it does it strike anyone else is that something something very suspicious is going on and that the response in this particular case is in particular with AT&T and such as that they are trying to hide something clearly.  You just wouldn't be acting that way if you weren't guilty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're trying to hide the fact that if they if they did something wrong, it's going to cost them a fortune and fines.  But who's going to find them, not the government?  Well, I mean, you can always take a class action suit against them.  I'm sure something or some way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no, isn't it? Isn't it precisely the government that would find them though?  Because wasn't there something about one of the regulatory bodies in the state says that if you're a phone company and you illegally release phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, the Telecommunications Act in 1934.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, then you're subject to oodles and oodles of fines.  And if it turns out that the you know, whether it was the government that tried to like induce them to release those phone records doesn't matter.  So one branch of the government is going to find them for doing what another branch of the government asked them to do.  Absolutely. Only in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only in America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there was only in America.  I think there was also a story recently in the New York Times saying that the government was was now processing reporters phone logs in order to.  Yes, in order to to look at the case for suing reporters who were releasing some information that the government wasn't happy with.  I think it was was the the original NSA spying story.  And so this is the real fear of all this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Actually, it was ABC that's been covering this morning on the ABC blogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I mean, and there now it suddenly becomes very frightening because the government has all of the records, apparently from multiple phone companies that allow them to do this massive cross correlation and find out what's going on.  So suddenly, it's no longer terrorists that we're trying to find.  Now it's our own reporting industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they are terrorists because they're revealing what the government's up to.  Yeah.  Undermining the security of this great nation.  And that's exactly why this stuff is problematic, because it doesn't take long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It took two weeks for this to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Didn't take long before the government starts criminalizing its own citizens for revealing the access.  Exactly what happened with the Pentagon Papers and Daniel Ellsberg.  Not to bring back an old story.  That's a dated one.  Steven Levy, writing in Newsweek, said an interesting thing.  He said, you know, the real problem is this information is useless.  It's too massive.  There's too much of it.  This is where he's dead wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's dead wrong.  I mean, this is unbelievably wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said they'd be better off starting with the terrorists and building up a tree.  You run network analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You run network analysis tools on these data sets.  And you can see who's calling who.  You can build networks up.  You can see who hangs out with who.  I mean, I've seen demos of this stuff.  It's astonishing.  And the more data you have, the easier it is.  This is nonsense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know where exactly they want.  They want the largest database possible to really fine tune some of this new software that's out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And you don't need the details.  All you need is the network data.  And you can pinpoint everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A piece of software that AT&T installed purportedly can sustain speeds of what, 10 gigabits per second?  So yeah, that a few times over throughout their ins and outs through their network.  And they could easily be monitoring every single point to point, whatever they want to look at.  And recently on TV, you'll see commercials now touting that variability.  It's like your data could not be any more secure.  We know exactly where it goes and where it comes in, which I would want that too if it were my business data flying across their networks.  But at the same point, if they open that up to government with no checks, no balances, or very, very apparently limited checks and balances, that just gets a little Orwellian to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John, were these techniques, these data mining techniques developed for business first or developed by government?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The ones I saw, which was, and this was a number of years ago.  I mean, this is at least 10 years ago.  I saw the Interpol software demoed and it showed how you can take and analyze just, you know, call it.  You don't have to know what's on the call.  You just need to see who's calling who.  And they were showing how you could see how, you know, an organized crime gang was organized, who was talking to who, who the head guy was.  You could take and the more data you had, the more you could kind of flesh out this information.  And then by the time you're done, you look at a picture, it's like an org chart.  It's unbelievable.  And so that's what's going on.  I don't know what people are thinking if they think that there's too much data here.  Too much is good.  More the merrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, then one of the reasons we have Will on today is because in Britain in a kind of a similar story, the British government is asking to start enforcing Part 3 of RIPA, the Regulation of Investigatory Powers Act, which has been around for some years.  The government hasn't put Part 3 into effect.  Nick, Will, why do I keep calling you Nick?  I don't know why.  Will, do you want to explain what Part 3 is?  Sure.  So Parts 1 and 2 of the Act have been in force since like 2000, and they basically are like a legal framework for how the government can use electronic surveillance and also human surveillance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Part 3 is about extended powers for making people reveal cryptographic keys.  So the idea is that, you know, the government is going to be able to do that.  So the idea is that if you have a, you know, a terrorist sends an encrypted message to somebody else and the message is intercepted by the police and the terrorist is apprehended, but of course they don't know what the terrorist has said.  So they've made it.  They want to make it a criminal offence to refuse to provide the key to decrypt the message that's been sent that the police wants to know about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is basically the sort of gist of it.  That tells you one good thing that at least some of the high-end commercial and encryption available to consumers is strong enough.  Works.  They're scared.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And there's basically, there's been a bit of an outcry in the British press about this.  Well, I think rightly so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if they start forcing, and by the way, you don't, I mean, you don't have to be a terrorist.  You just have to be a suspected terrorist.  And if you say, no, I'm not giving you the keys, they don't have to prove anything else.  They throw you in jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem is that, so there are a number of problems with it.  Number one is the definition of terrorism.  And the definition of terrorism under this act is anybody that seeks to change the opinion of the government and anybody that seeks to challenge state power.  So like the New York Times or anybody.  Any old protester, you know.  So that's number one.  Number two is that there are, there's the civil liberties issue.  And the problem is that there are no firm guidelines actually set out in the laws.  It's all shunted to these kind of namby pamby codes of practice that nobody really looks at.  So that's sort of number two.  Number three is that it's practically really difficult to enforce because number one, if you've got a stream of data, how do you know what's junk and what's crypto?  Number two is that there's nothing to stop someone saying, oh, well, that message you intercepted for me is just like a love letter to my girlfriend.  And she happens to like random data.  Yeah.  And by the way, I lost the key to decrypt it.  So I'm really sorry about that.  And you can't prove that somebody is withholding the key from you.  Well, what about it, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's true.  That's what TrueCrypt does.  For instance, they offer plausible deniability.  Their data is indistinguishable from noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there are lots of technologies, too, that would make it impossible even for the people who participated in the conversation to subsequently decrypt it.  You could randomly change the key as soon as you initiate the connection.  And that gets encrypted and nobody is able to turn back the clock and get the key that's already gone.  I mean, it's called perfect forward security.  And you know, you and I have talked about that, where if a key becomes compromised at some time in the future, nothing that has been done prior to that key compromise can be decrypted.  So I mean, there are technologies that you just can't legislate in this fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's a relief, to be honest, because I was sure that as soon as the U.S.  government was watching this with great interest, if it survived in Britain, that they were going to implement it here in the States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we really have a problem with the way things are moving because we, you know, as you and I have talked in our Security Now podcast, there exists now extremely available, absolutely, you know, for all practical purposes,  unbreakable crypto that everyone can have.  And governments really dislike the idea that they're not able to eavesdrop or pursue for law enforcement purposes, you know, the transactions that are happening over these encrypted channels.  And it's really the case that our government can't crack this.  And I mean, I don't see any logical outcome if the government refuses to allow this to go on other than outlawing cryptography or outlawing classes that they don't have back doors to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have tried to outlaw cryptography a couple of times.  Clipper.  If you remember, about I think the first attempt was about 15 years ago, they tried to do that and then they tried it again.  And they just haven't been successful.  But I mean, they still can attempt to outlaw it.  But I mean, there's also something else we should mention, which is nested encryption, which you have where you have a fake password that releases what looks like an encrypted file.  And then you actually have something else buried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, of course, the problem is that it's the reason no government really wants to completely ban cryptography when they think about it is that it's so bad for business.  You can't have major banks doing business where they don't have strong encryption because money could go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you could have a government back door to that encryption, however.  Well, exactly.  A mandatory back door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the banks don't want that either.  Yeah.  In the UK, one of the major problems was that the thing that really makes a mockery of this law is that the sentence for refusing to give up your cryptography is two years.  Well, of course, if you're a serious criminal doing like serious business, you'll take the two years rather than give up the evidence, which might indict you for life or something.  So on a practical basis, it's kind of stupid.  Don't give them any ideas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to now make it.  I mean, I'll put myself in law enforcement's shoes.  It must be extremely frustrating to them that it's now very easy for anybody to encrypt stuff in such a way that they can't see it.  Although I remember talking to the Secret Service a few years ago and I said, how do you handle that?  And they said, well, you usually give us the password.  He said, you know, almost always a criminal will unencrypt or give you the password if you ask them nicely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they've done some pretty fancy things.  A few years ago, the FBI planted who, what, when, I think, or one of those key loggers.  And there's hardware key loggers now that can't be detected under any circumstances.  You can talk to anybody about this.  You can get them out of New Zealand.  And they plant, they go in and bust into somebody's place and they plant like this.  It's like putting a bug in an office.  And they just wait till the guy types the password a few times and bingo, the guy's busted.  There was a guy at Jersey Mobster that was caught that way.  And I think it probably goes on a lot.  I mean, just, you know, it's, it's, there's ways that there's old fashioned ways of catching crooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't need section three is what you're saying.  No, of course not.  And it's a bad idea anyway.  Businesses are going to like it.  We all agree on that.  Yeah.  Well, it scares me because, and it just makes me want to encrypt everything.  Come and get me, Kappa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, of course, then the other, there's been another new law proposed in the UK, or at least come out in the press this week,  which was, which wants to criminalize sort of system admins and little scripters and things like this.  Yeah, talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought that was hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just, it's just amusing.  It's basically, it would be illegal to write a computer program which, quote, could be used for sort of illegal purposes like hacking, denial of service, et cetera.  And of course, the problem is that almost any tool can be used for any thing.  So if you write something like, you know, Pearl or Nmap, of course, that can be used for nefarious purposes, but it's a legitimate system admin tool.  But under this law, if you wrote Pearl today or tomorrow when it's in force, you'd be subject to time in the clink, which is just one of those examples.  This is not a law yet, is it?  I mean, this is a proposed.  Not yet. It's still proposed.  This was one of those examples of lawmakers just not having a clue about the things that they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, these people just don't know anything about anything.  It's unbelievable.  Yeah, but they're in charge.  Well, I mean, they're usually supposed to have advisors, at least, that can tell them about this stuff and say, hey, this is crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish somebody would.  It's not very clever.  We talked about Blue Security last week.  This is the anti-spam service that had a do not intrude list.  If you subscribed and you became a Blue Security customer and you got spam, Blue Security would politely ask the spammer to cease and desist and get you off the list.  Of course, they were shut down by spammers who were mad about this.  And then not only that, but when Blue Security moved its blog over to TypePad, the spammers shut down TypePad as well and put thousands of blogs off the air.  Now, Blue Security says, you know, we give up.  You win.  We are going out of business because we don't want our anti-spam technology to create an ever escalating cyber war through our continued operations.  I think it's kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it looks like the talent was on the wrong side of that argument.  I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What really probably happened behind the scenes, too, is that they had a relationship with, you know, whatever bandwidth provider where they were having to end up bearing the cost of the denial service attack.  Exactly.  So there was somewhere there was a huge bill involved and they just had to say, finally, OK, we can't continue this.  We can't sustain this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's sad is they had half a million users and the people I've talked to who were Blue Security subscribers are very happy with it.  They said it was very effective in eliminating spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, they can always go to my guy.  I don't get any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get no spam to vorac.  They actually I think that that ultimately really is is is the answer to this is that these kinds of you can't interact with spammers.  That's not the way to stop spam.  If you can't throw them in jail, there's no point in trying to talk them out of it or they'll unleash a, you know, ten thousand bought attack on your system.  Exactly.  All you can do is use technology as your as your guy is doing.  John has used technology to filter the spam out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you can go to my blog and click on I get no spam and you'll find out all about it.  Yeah, not that I'm here to promote things and your blog address would be the work dot org slash blog and it's junk junk.  Junk email filter dot com, which is Mark Perkel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mark's just using some well known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's using a lot of tools to stays on top of it.  That's kind of what makes it work.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let's see.  We've got we've got lawsuits to stop Vista.  By the way, you think they'll that they'll be able to get an injunction against Vista.  Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They won't need one.  Well, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They don't need the lawsuit.  It would be over two years from now.  Just before it comes out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll never ship anyway.  Lawsuits to stop the iPod, put the iPod out of business.  Yes or no?  No, no chance of success.  Everyone hates a winner.  They do, don't they?  The Brits are trying to shut down encryption.  I think that's going to we agree now that's hopeless and useful.  An attorney seals Sue's second life to get his money back.  Hopeless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, you forgot to mention the Blackberry counter suit.  That's another lawsuit that has to be on the list.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I forgot about that.  So Blackberry sue.  What's the deal?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never followed it, but it said, you know, they just are they suing the other guy.  This is this is I followed this early on.  I kept pretty good tabs on and then I just gave up.  Is Blackberry suing NTP now or no, no, there was another company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's suing Visto.  Visto. That's right.  Visto suing.  So NTP sued Blackberry one got a big settlement.  Then Visto comes along and says, oh, yeah, we have patents, too.  And now they're trying to put Blackberry out of business.  You're saying Blackberry is countersuing Visto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what it says in the ZD net story.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, one good thing, I think one thing you can determine from all of this is that it's a good idea to be a lawyer.  Are you regretting now, Will, not, you know, going and getting your finishing your degree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't.  I'd like to sleep at night, you know, and not upset.  And not upside down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is sad on one from one perspective.  It sort of represents the maturation of our industry.  But at the same time, this is all inevitable consequences to a very broken patent system.  I mean, we've known the patent system has not been functioning for 20 years and people said, oh, look, it's bad.  It's broken. It's it, you know, it doesn't work right.  And, you know, now as business begins to turn to to legislation in instead of creativity, this is what happens.  And, you know, people like semantic are suing Microsoft and everybody's suing everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's not just the patents, though.  I mean, we just last week talked about the Beatles and the Apple and the music and then copyright.  Yeah, finally. Or trademark.  That was a trademark issue.  And then finally, you know, Apple finally wins.  And then on top of that, the McCartney's wife, you know, has a sues him or is going to sue him for divorce.  And it's like suits suits. It's unbelievable.  This is like, you know, the beginning of the end of Western civilization.  The way I see it. End of days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the rapture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't they in Britain have a system that reduces the amount of litigation going on?  I know in Canada, they require a losing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little bit here and there.  They make they make an effort to try and stop people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems like something a real hobby in the states, you know, it's although although if they have a system where they're trying not to have so many lawsuits, why are they trying to legislate against cryptography?  Well, there you go. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the one thing that keeps us have our privacy and security on the Internet.  Yes, let's allow that immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, Robert, a couple of weeks ago, you said you were going to be looking at the new HD DVD players.  Yeah. Are you happy with them?  It's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, you know, it's total first gen product, especially the five hundred dollar unit from Toshiba, the low end one below and one.  Isn't that really a Linux box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a gig of RAM from what I understand.  P4 processor.  Can you can you up like a PC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you get a boot Linux?  I mean, put a you know, put some I.O. on it and you do the firmware update for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If one's ever released, you actually have to click OK on the GPL license or whatever.  It's pretty cool, though.  I mean, it's all open source software internally.  So that's actually good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the reasons that the Tivo was so hackable is they couldn't really prevent it because of the GPL.  It was you can't really say, well, you can't modify our kernel because that's kind of the license agreement of the kernel.  So maybe maybe this will be a very hackable device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What sort of content is available now in HD DVD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right now, if I last look on Amazon, I think there are actually about 15 titles available with another 15, 20, 30 coming very soon.  It that's that's strike one for the average person buying it.  There's simply not enough available yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a lot to play for a lot to pay for a player that plays 30 movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They really get those movies memorized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the image quality is stunning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What movies did you look at and what TV did you use and all that stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was using a brand new HP rear projection 1080p DLP set.  Gorgeous, gorgeous TV.  They're 5880.  I believe it is that hooked up.  I did it a couple of different ways.  Actually took the HDD player, went directly into the TV 1080i.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the what's the horizontal on that for the 1080, the 1920 by 1080?  Is it really 1920?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You sure? Yes, it accepts those resolutions.  You know, whether or not your average 1080p display will display the finest details of a 1080i signal or 1080p signal.  That's that's that's you know, that's something else entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're talking about the TV at this point.  What is the output of the HD DVD player?  What's the 1080i?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's that's another limitation.  The format on the disk itself is 1080p content.  And currently, I believe they're all using VC one, which is Microsoft's Media Center nine format.  Oh, they really they are.  Well, there's three different formats that both Blu-ray and HDD will use.  VC one is the one I'm seeing the most of right now.  Then you also have H.264 and oh, the other one just escapes me at the moment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They can they can the manufacturer can choose to encode the DVD in one of those three different codecs.  Totally. And then the player can play any of the three.  Exactly. Does the does the disk tell you I mean, does it tell you on the box how it's encoded?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does not. That's something else.  It was just that it was I believe was a universal whoever handed us some of the first content.  That's how they described it in their press releases.  They told you. But yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is there a reason for consumers to care or are they all equal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. And if anything, it'll just it'll it'll be more about seeing how mature the encoders become squeezing.  Granted, you have so much data to work with in terms of providing the image on the screen, but making it as best as possible.  And also it'll be more about how they what sources they drag this from.  Is it a good film scan? Right. Was it digital to begin with?  And those things will start to pop up.  I'm noticing for some of the film transfers, in particular, Goodfellas, which it is the best looking transfer or best looking version of that movie I think I've ever seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I almost buy that just to watch Goodfellas.  I mean, Goodfellas is a good enough movie that I think that'd be almost worth it to be able to see it as good as it could be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm noticing also for a lot of the film transfer DVDs I look at, you see film grain and I'm not seeing as much in some of the HDVD film transfers, which is kind of interesting.  Because some people, depending on the TV, it can turn into a noisy looking mess for bad TVs.  But for good TV, that film grain almost lends that theater quality to the video itself.  And that's kind of nice in a sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think they're paying more attention to the encoding or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I certainly hope so. Just for the quality alone.  I haven't seen any. The detail is so much better now that they have to.  And if anything, it's just simply going to show off issues of how the movie was put together to begin with, be it a lighting error or somebody's bad makeup or everything is just so much more detailed.  And I mean, they say it is six times the progressive resolution.  But I see with your eye looking at the screen DVD in one hand, HDVD in the other.  You will honestly be able to see two or three times the detail.  No, no doubt about it. And it's just phenomenal.  But this first generation player, again, it only supports the one format.  It doesn't give you true access. If you have a 1080p TV, you're not you're sending 1080i into it.  And I've processed it through a really high end processor into 1080p and then looked at it on the TV.  And it gets really hard for me to say if there's a difference or not without taking a bunch of pictures and comparing A, B.  And that's that's really I think for most people is going to be the only way to really see a difference is looking at it side by side properly set up.  But it'll be an upscaling player. There is no there's no comparison between like an upscale DVD and HDVD, especially on the large TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you take a DVD and you stick it in this thing.  And by the way, I want to sympathize with everybody out there listening to these guys throwing around the fact that they'd pay five hundred dollars for a player just to watch one movie.  Hey, but people out there with three year old laptops.  But anyway, no, no players. You're Leo. You got too much money.  No, no, I wouldn't do that. I'm just thinking it is a good movie.  No, that's what I want to say. I want to ask this question.  Does the thing do line doubling, line tripling, line quadrupling when it runs a regular DVD through it or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It scales up as well. And it appeared to do a pretty good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, remember that it has a gig of memory in it. And that's what Leo paid for his gig.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Five hundred dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't. He could actually gotten less memory.  I didn't buy the two gig of memory. I turned it down because it was too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  I only paid a hundred bucks for the one gig.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The way you just said it, Leo, I was under the impression that you had bought the memory.  No, I'm not that stupid.  I'll spend this kind of money, but I think you suck. And then you busted it up and threw it in their face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's a good idea. Yeah. Yeah, that's what I did, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's it. Exactly. And then lit a hundred dollar bill and walked out the place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there. Take that, Steve Jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Robert, what do you expect the second gen HDTV players to add to this?  1080p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Number one.  I would wait for 1080p, wouldn't you?  You know what? Most people don't have 1080p TVs and large enough screen sizes to really notice the difference.  And I mean, I'm looking at some 40. Anything below, say, 42 inches for 1080p, it almost gets ridiculous because the pixels become so small that it becomes really hard to see a difference between that, say, and something with maybe 720p resolution.  But the other thing, hopefully they'll have a dedicated processor, which will help speed up some of the startup times and the point you actually put the disk in the player and hit the play button to the point you're actually watching the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give us a feeling for that. How long does it take? It sounds to me as though you could drive to the theater in the amount of time it takes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's see. From the point you put the disk in, there has to be a minimum, I'd say, of 30 seconds before it even realizes that it's an HDVD disk.  Give it, say, another 30 seconds. This is not a lot of time, but it's not like my standard DVD player sitting in my living room.  But I'd say at least another 30 seconds after that before you actually get that first pop-ups here, the welcome to HD DVD, yadda, yadda, yadda.  And then finally you get to where you can hit play on the thing.  Also, just the user interface in terms of the remote and everything, there's lots of room for improvement there.  It literally was thrown out. There's actually buttons on the remote that either don't function or have no function or, oh, we didn't have time to fully clean this up.  But if you have to have it and you can and there are some titles out there that you like, once it's playing you really don't care about it. All of that seemed to fade for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The issue with the UI fascinates me because what's wrong with the old UI that the DVD players use? It seemed adequate.  Why do we move to a next generation and the next thing you know the UI falls apart? That makes no sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was more, it has mostly to do with just it's a Linux box and there are certain delays involved.  It's like, well, once it's set up and properly running and the movie finally gets up, it's beautiful.  But the other thing too is that within the, for HD DVD at least and for what we've looked at, it's the menu systems involved now are awesome.  That upgrade alone is really different. You get a translucent lower third basically that'll pop up on all of the disks.  All of this seemed to be processed in a way that gives you thumbnail views of all the chapter titles now, which you can breeze through backwards and forwards.  And potentially with the Ethernet connection that's on the back of the thing, you'll be able to access web content that's related to the movie and things like that.  That's a lot of stuff I don't care about, but some people might. And the user interface in that sense is really nice.  It's just sometimes you get hiccups, pauses, that sort of thing needs to be just massaged out.  And I'm sure a firmware update will take care of that. I have yet to see one.  And I'll be honest with you, though, I don't want to own two different DVD players for this format war that the darn companies have started.  For my money, I'm holding off for one that plays both. It's just I don't see it.  They obviously are not going to come to terms and unify on anything and there will be two formats for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, of course, one of the problems with the PlayStation 3, Sony is touting this ability to play Blu-ray, but it is only Blu-ray and it is only a first generation player.  It's going to have all these teething issues that you're going to see with HD DVD.  And so a lot of people say like, well, I know a lot of people that are holding off for the second generation because like anything you buy into the first generation and you've got all the bugs and problems.  For PS3 customers who are kind of more mainstream, maybe they want a slightly more mature experience, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you wouldn't you're not going to see the first universal player coming from Sony of all people.  They're a Blu-ray house. They're not going to do that.  That directly ties into the price of the of the announced price for the PS3.  It sounds expensive and it is in a sense.  But if you add on the HD DVD drive that Microsoft announced at with with they still haven't announced a price for that drive yet.  But if you paired that with the 360, it would be at least as much money.  But at least Microsoft gives you that option, though.  It's like, look, you know what? I don't care about the HD DVD part.  Just I want to play my game. So, OK, I can not Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Microsoft is actually saying that the HD DVD and the 360 will be cheaper than the PS3.  DVD. They've actually come out to be less than 900 bucks for the DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Sony's to their credit, their game consoles have always been the best DVD players for standard DVD playback compared to anybody else.  I mean, the 360 and the original Xbox are two of the worst DVD players on the planet.  That's just my I mean, but who I wouldn't I wouldn't be looking at my game console.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When you say that Sony's always made a great DVD player with all their what do you mean always?  How many did they have they done? Well, the PS2.  One. One. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do all of these HD DVD players, Blu-ray or HD DVD playback the old style DVDs?  Yeah, that's that's given that has to you don't throw away your old DVDs.  No. And they do a pretty good job of that.  Of course, yeah, they both will. And they do a good job of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although nobody has a Blu-ray player. It's like, you know, technically, he's making it up.  No, not making it up. I mean, this is what's been announced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But no, they have to. They have to. They could not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they don't play each other's format. I can see why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they don't. They're going to be backwards compatible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on, Samsung, put that universal player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Samsung pulled the plug on that and be for a good reason.  Apparently it was a big secret. But now everybody knows that there's a licensing deal with Blu-ray.  If you do Blu-ray, you cannot do the other one.  Is that a combo drive? That's the reason we're not going to see one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I was at HP last week down at the quarters looking at some of their new stuff.  They have they used to be firmly in one camp or the other with the previous generation of recordable DVD media.  They were the they were the big plus group.  I mean, and they were they were bordering on being the mafia about how much they tried to shove that down anybody's throat who would listen.  But this time around, they're they're taking the stance where we will give our customers whatever they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they're not going to do a combo drive. That's the that's the provision in the in the deal.  That that's insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, for now, Serenity is on HD DVD.  Yeah, it is. Oh, beautiful. Serenity or Firefly? Serenity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The movie. Yeah, I like the show better than the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I mean, the movie's serenity, Serenity, Apollo 13, Born Supremacy, Fifth Element, Phantom of the Opera, Doom, U-571.  Doom. Doom. Who's going to buy Doom? I know. HD DVD.  Yeah, so, you know, interesting selection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But on a big TV, I got to say side by side, I mean, I'm talking if you have 50 inches or bigger and 1080p and you've got you're on that cutting edge, you will appreciate the quality.  The quality is fantastic, but the selection is not there. Hardware is a little iffy.  OK, can we talk about my MacBook again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We got to get back to where we go spending the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, actually, I do want to ask Nick because one of the complaints about the MacBook Pro and apparently it's going to be a similar complaint about the MacBook is that these things run really hot and it seems to be pretty well agreed that Apple misapplied the thermal grease.  Have you seen this, Nick? Will? Will? Why do I call you Nick? Who the hell's Nick? Poor Nick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a Jessica Simpson fan. I had a dream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going back and I'm editing this whole podcast and taking out the Knicks. Will, have you heard that story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it looked really interesting. I mean, it was sort of like apparently taking them apart to actually check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just not on our list of stories. Where'd you get this? I just throwing this one out because I got a MacBook and I'm worried it's going to be hot.  Why did you buy it? I don't know, because I lost, I couldn't help it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first thing I think of when you talk about all this heat problem is that's got to be that it's sucked in the battery dry too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's getting good, very big, good battery life. But these are hot chips. I mean, they're apparently it's got better battery life than the MacBook Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apparently there's like five or six hours rather than three or four. But I think I think if the I mean, the MacBook Pro has had the sort of teething issues with the thermal paste.  You've got to imagine that Apple's seen those for the MacBook. I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's actually people there's a guy on something awful who's actually opened the thing up, swabbed away the thermal grease with alcohol and reapplied it.  And it brought it literally brought the temperature down like 15 degrees centigrade. Huge amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, Leo, if we hear of a major house fire in your area, we'll know that there's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's my HD DVD player. It's running too hot.  All right, John, I won't mention that because it's not on the list. John is like the list police.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You've done well, yes, because last week you were throwing these stories out at us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just think of this list. Well, it's OK. They come to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a good story. I never would have thought about the thermal grease being a problem. That's pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently they're being cheesy. They're being cheap with the thermal grease and they're not giving telling them to apply enough.  Well, who's they? I mean, Apple, Apple's China. I know.  I was really surprised when I looked at my FedEx slip. It's from Shenzhou, China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's being shipped. Yeah. From one of those big factories.  It's probably that, you know, they make a Toshiba one minute, a Del the next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And here comes your Apple. And then they go quick hold off on the thermal paste.  And by the way, you got any flake black flake paint?  We did. Did you already buy the MacBook Pro? Yeah, no, I didn't buy a pro. I bought a regular cheap one.  OK, the MacBook, not the pro. I've been waiting because I didn't want to buy the pro. It was too big.  I wanted a little one. OK, so you didn't go first chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So hopefully the heating issues are taken care of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People already have them say they're pretty hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But what about the the new Yahoo homepage that doesn't work in Safari?  So it won't work on your new MacBook? Damn. It doesn't work on Safari?  It works on Firefox. You just get a big fat sign saying your browser is not supported.  Please use IE or Yahoo. What are they? What is Yahoo thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I know Safari is a problem. I think it's just no Safari is no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not true. In fact, Safari is one of two browsers that support the CSS acid test.  I mean, it's you know, Firefox can't do it. Safari can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's actually very compatible. I hear more people complaining about WordPress blogs not being readable.  Well, now that's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you can't read a WordPress blog, which is about as vanilla as you can get,  I mean, it's not like it's got any special technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The trouble is sometimes that IE requires so many dirty hacks to get CSS to work that it kills everything else.  That's right. It's one of the problems that we find constantly designing websites,  which is that the amount of stuff you have to do to get IE to work just breaks everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I'm going to my new my Yahoo. I mean, what's the difference? It doesn't look bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's shorter. The page is shorter.  Interestingly, there's still no like there's no flicker on the front page. There's no delicious.  No, we're not using any of these things that they're not using any of these things.  They've spent, you know, millions of dollars. It's just exactly the same like my Yahoo, my check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I look at this. Yeah, I look at this Yahoo thing and it's starting to look like the old MSN.  It does age. I mean, it just they all look the same with their cramp. They got all kinds of crap.  They're just hoping to God you click on something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Click, click, click and add before you before you leave and discuss, please click an ad or two.  And there's so many ads. I mean, it's just outrageous. I'm just so sick of them.  Well, you know, it's unbelievable to me. Yeah.  That's ugly. Yahoo now has a tech channel. Did you see that? They're doing a video tech channel.  Oh, it's the worst with Robin Raskin as she's the tech mom.  It's awful. It's just a big. It's just a big ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a total ad. I wonder if people are fooled by that.  I really wonder why people watch this stuff. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, fortunately, we are the last podcast still in the top 25 on iTunes.  So clearly somebody likes what we do. God only knows why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's because we're because we're cranky cranky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, you're testing my sorry. You already own cranky. I got cranky. I'm sewing.  I'm sewing. I was cranky before you were cranky.  What do you mean at the last podcast on iTunes on the top 25 last tech podcast in the top 25

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all falling off the boat. They can't keep up. Well, no, because mainstream.  They're as good as ours. That's the reason I think it's mainstream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's called mainstream anyway. It would have made sense that early adopters would have been more techies.  That's right. Exactly. And then now, you know, now everybody else is doing podcasts.  It makes sense. A lot more competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  MTV is launching a Microsoft music service called MTV Urge.  When you get the urge to download, I suppose. Yeah, I saw that.  Interestingly, they're doing both subscription models like Napster and they're also doing download like like paper download like iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is does anybody have this? I think it's going to have the same result as most urges.  And let me just use the word. Does anybody have a rapper maybe involved?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does anybody have the hope of beating iTunes at this point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not until somebody releases like a system that's not just a piece of software, a system that is a hardware thing and an operating system and a music player and a transcoder and all those things that, you know, Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft is trying to do that. I mean, that's a good way. If anybody could do it, it'd be Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's not. Yeah, nobody else is going to do it. You know, creative is not going to beat them. Creative only just they just sell players, you know, they're still stuck with Microsoft software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is that the key? Is that why iTunes is so successful? Because it's an OS, it's hardware and it's the software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. It's just top to bottom. It's simple. You've got no worries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if somebody releases something that doesn't have DRM?  Wait a minute. That's all of it. You'll never get the content. That's all of MP3.  Which, by the way, is not not down. I mean, it's not gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And is apparently more popular than ever based on all the publicity surrounding its downtime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People thought it was good. It was, you know, hounded out of existence. But in fact, they just had server problems.  Yeah. So, wow.  There's a good example. Is it beating iTunes, all of MP3?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It might be too niche to beat iTunes. It's certainly beating iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. But no commercial guy. I mean, MTV. And boy, I mean, if anybody you'd think it's a good thing.  I mean, I think MTV, because of their association with music, has some shot at it.  But that just doesn't seem to be anybody's going to leave iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But those people who watch MTV are not the people who are on their computers.  They're sitting around the TV stoned, you know, watching MTV.  They probably will. That just thing sounds like a flop waiting to happen.  Yeah. That strikes me the same way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they unveiled it actually back at CES. And I thought, well, this speaks volumes about it.  They had Justin Timberlake out to like rap with Bill Gates on the stage.  He's a huge hip. Isn't he with it?  And so you just thought, well, the combination of Bill Gates and Justin Timberlake is not going to sell this service to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they're going to, you know, if they have done some sort of a deal with MySpace, you'd have something.  But, you know, that's where all the music is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, MySpace is selling downloads of stuff now. Did you see that?  No.  Oh, sorry. Well, it's not on the list, but they're selling...  Now, wait a minute. John's going to yell at you.  Hey, wait a minute.  MySpace is now selling episodes of 24 for a buck 99 a go.  And of course, 24 is owned by Fox and Fox is owned by News Corp and MySpace is owned by News Corp.  There's all a bit of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's the juggernaut. There's the one you should be worried about if your Apple is a five.  Yeah, it's News Corp probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. There's something that could... that thing can be leveraged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a synergy. You've got MySpace. You've got all this content.  You've got Fox.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there was an article recently...  Actually, there's an article in Playboy of all places about MySpace this month.  You know, I read it for the pictures, so I missed that.  Which was... Well, I read it for the stories, Leo.  Yeah, I'm sure you do.  But they obviously... they were saying that MySpace is now becoming like so totally like last year.  And that all the teens that thought MySpace were hip are now like heading off somewhere else  because it's becoming too... News Corp is commercializing it too much.  So I don't think that's true because your friends are there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, nobody likes AOL, but they don't leave because that's where their address is.  That's where all their friends is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But how long before something new and cooler with more of an indie vibe starts up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that sucks all your friends away.  I think it's a generational thing. I think the next generation will go to the next thing.  Exactly.  You get stuck in the old model. I mean, people are still on LiveJournal, but they're older.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. No, I think that's exactly right because you stick with your cohort.  And it's so hard to get all your friends to move to something new that they're going to keep using it.  Look at... you know, a good example of this is instant message clients.  We're here in the States. We use AOL. In Canada, it's MSN. I'm sure in Britain, it's MSN.  Yeah.  And you're not going to change because that's where all your friends are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, one good example of that more recently for people our age is when they started these  kind of quasi-social business networking systems like LinkedIn and the one that Google finally invented.  There's still a bunch of these being formed, but I get invites to all these new ones.  And I say, look, I've already joined three of these things. They're turkeys. I'm done.  Do you use LinkedIn?  I maintain an account on LinkedIn. And once in a while, I still get it.  You know, somebody still wants me to put them on their list. But I mean, I don't actively use it, but I check in once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't either, but I continually get invites from LinkedIn.  So it seems to be that's the one that at least, you know, grownups are using.  Friendster's gone. In fact, I talked to a friend who worked at Friendster and he said that all of Friendster's business is in the Far East.  That they've been discovered there. And that makes sense. You know, then it's the new thing there.  Yeah. Yeah.  But so do these social sites have a future? Is there another MySpace waiting in the wings?  I mean, there are there's Tag World. There's a lot of clones of MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there'll be increasingly around and just topic like topic areas and also unlike, you know, not topic areas, but, you know, franchises and stuff like, you know, when the next version of, you know, Pokemon launchers, I mean, there'll be like a sort of Pokemon social network.  That's the kind of way that I see it going, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any other stories anybody has on tip of mind whether or not they're on the list?  God, let's hope. Now look what time it is.  Oh, you want to go? You're done?  Well, I mean, you know, I'm just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let's wrap it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We only we've only it's about an hour long show, believe it or not.  We've got the rootkit and the Poker software, surely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. You want to talk about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know much about it.  Does anybody know anything about it?  I know about it.  It's a it's a the problem is that this poker company that makes software for poker players, online poker players hired a guy they claim who was a bad bad actor.  And he inserted a rootkit. The company is called Check Raise.  The software is a rake back calculator that you use to keep track of commissions that the poker sites are taking from you inside the rake back calculator, a rootkit and a Trojan.  I actually thought this was quite clever.  The way the Trojan works, it it captures your passwords, sends them along to the bad guy.  But then the bad guy logs in with your account and plays badly, losing to his confederates, to shills who take all the money and then they split it later.  Wow, that's great.  Isn't that smart? It's hard for the time for you to defend because you that was your account.  You were you just had a bad night.  It's like, no, it wasn't me. It wasn't me.  Yes, it was. It was your password.  In any event, there is a check raised admits that this happened and they have they have a manual fix and it starts with deleting their rake back calculator.  But I don't think this is the last of these.  I think I'm always amazed by the creativity of some of these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that clever? It's a lot of work, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they have to actually play and lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the only way to prevent something like that from happening to your own business is to hire somebody even smarter or as smart as the programmer to go over everything they did.  It's a good point. Maintain proper documentation.  If you if you're kind of on the low end of it, you're basically just hiring a programmer says yes to you.  Trust him. Yeah.  Yeah. You're leaving yourself open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Programmers have done this for years. They've put back doors.  They've put I mean, a lot of people put time bombs in the code so that if you don't get paid or, you know, you don't get paid a support contract, the program stops working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not at all unusual. I can't believe we've missed this one, guys.  Dell is shipping AMD. You're servers, right? Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah, it's astonishing.  Previously, previously an Intel only operation like forever.  And now they're saying that they're going to do servers with AMD and based on customer demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does that mean does that merely prove that Intel doesn't have the cloud it used to have or that Dell is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, you know, I think, you know, Intel's always had this great relationship with Dell.  But I think at some point the Dell guy said, look, if you guys can't catch up, we can't produce servers that are like second rate.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's ironically, ironically, the new Intel server chip Woodcrest, which is looking spectacular, is shipping like out next month.  And so they've picked like the month before Intel is just about possibly to get the performance crime back to switch to AMD.  It's like the worst time ever.  They can switch back quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's what you find that they they'll switch right back if they can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not the end of the line for the AMD and Intel and Dell.  They're still in bed.  Yeah, I think so. I think this is the way to go.  With the new Intel chips, they're actually quite competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, oh, they're definitely competitive.  We saw in our labs last week one of the one of the new core duo chips.  It's in like the MacBook and we put it on like a desktop board and clocked it up to the same speed as the top end AMD processor and it really whooped it.  Yeah, I think they're pretty good.  It was majorly fast.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you see Apple actually has a like a support page now for the bottom of my laptop gets too hot.  Great.  They've they recommend saying, you know, the bottom of your lap of your MacBook Pro may get too hot.  Do not use it on your lap for extended periods.  Oh, great.  I'm starting to regret this already.  Use it on a table is one of their...  That's their advice.  It's like wow.  It's alright. I don't want to have any more children anyway.
