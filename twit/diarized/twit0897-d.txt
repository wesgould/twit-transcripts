Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, I can tell that that was an edit point.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So this is all in one run.  You said you had a big breaking story.  This was not the first thing that came to mind,  I must say.  Is this, how many times have you,  how long and how many times have you been playing?  I've been playing this game since 1998,

Start time: 332.48
End time: 342.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you, and you've gotta, in order to do this speedrun,  you have to have it completely memorized.  I noticed you're not collecting all the coins.  The idea is to get through.  Nope.  You're not trying to do anything.  You're just trying to get through it.  That's correct.

Start time: 343.10
End time: 359.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  You have to go through it with no health.  You can't stop and get any of the mushrooms.  You break the game and a ton of points.  It's, I literally sit there and play the work fight  at the end for like a few hours at a time,  just playing the same two minutes.  It is absurd.

Start time: 359.50
End time: 379.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you, as you're doing this,  like you get here and you do screw up,  you start over, right?  I mean, you don't.  Yeah, you've got to.  You've got to.  That's to me the, now what,  so you don't wanna fight this guy.  Oh, you knew he'd send you an egg.  He could, you could pop him with the egg.  Oh, you're good.  So this, this works like a bus.

Start time: 380.12
End time: 390.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  This is Birdo.  She throws an egg at you every 128 frames.  So it doesn't matter.  You can like be a little slower on this fight.  It doesn't matter.

Start time: 392.24
End time: 399.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every, she's, it's down to the frames.  It is.  Do you have some special tools that you use to analyze?  How do you know it's under 28 frames?

Start time: 400.68
End time: 410.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh God, you look at it in quick time after you do it.  Oh my God.  And just obsess about it.  You're kidding.  See how you go down here,  so you don't render and she moves faster.

Start time: 411.42
End time: 416.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is kind of a subculture.  Is what this is.  Oh, every 128, every 128 frames,  you're gonna get an egg.  One, two, three.  Do you know like what frame you're at right now?  Like, can you kind of tell?  Like I know when that egg's coming.  You got a sense for,

Start time: 436.46
End time: 441.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You should write a book on this.

Start time: 445.58
End time: 447.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really should.  How many speed run records have you got now?

Start time: 449.24
End time: 456.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  For like number one, only two.  But I've been working on my Jill run for Resident Evil 3.  So I'm gonna be competitive in that soon.

Start time: 457.04
End time: 465.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is, you are at this point,  the fastest person in this game.  In the entire world.  In the entire world.  Do you think this record will be broken?

Start time: 466.56
End time: 491.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  There are a lot of mistakes I made  and one of the things I wanted to encourage people to do  is compete my talent.  Like go to speedrun.com, join the Discord.  This is a lot of fun to play.  One of the reasons the Game Boy version of it  is a lot of fun to play  is it renders really well on the Mac M1.  I use OpenEMU.  The community doesn't frown on emulators.  Oh, you're doing this in an emulator?

Start time: 491.90
End time: 493.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This, you're not, oh.  I don't.

Start time: 493.54
End time: 515.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I play on original hardware.  But you don't have to with this community.  So there's a really low barrier to entry  as opposed to other games  where you've gotta buy a retro tank  and an original NES and something to record it with.  Like there's a really high barrier.  So come join our community.  Speedrun this game with me  and maybe you can beat my princess beach time.  I'd love to see it.

Start time: 516.58
End time: 538.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's so fun.  That's awesome.  Okay, well I'm not gonna watch the whole thing.  Cause, but I'm tempted to.  I'm really enjoying it.  Brianna, if you wanna watch it,  it's on Vimeo on Brianna's channel, Brianna Wu.  Or you go to speedrun.com and learn all about it.  Wow.  That is so interesting.

Start time: 552.42
End time: 557.85

Transcript:  What gets me is everyone there  is like 20 years younger than me.  And they're obsessed with these games  like we were back then.

Start time: 558.44
End time: 570.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can understand why you're obsessed.  You're like a baby duck.  You got imprinted with it cause you were a kid.  But for a young person today to go back in time  and play an old game is interesting.  But I get, are the games not as good these days or?

Start time: 571.66
End time: 578.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it's because it's on a cartridge.  They're just fewer ways to cheat these older NES games.  So there's something magical about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, Daniel.  Now.  No worries.  Let's talk about Microsoft.  This was an interesting week  because First Meta had an event on Tuesday  and then Microsoft had an event on Wednesday.  And Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft,  did not show up for the Microsoft Surface announcement.  It was Panos Panay.  He did show up for Mark Zuckerberg's Meta announcement,  which is a confusing signal to send.  I know Satya was at the Ignite conference  and there were many more talks later in the day,  but it was a weird message to say,  oh, and Mark Zuckerberg's walk us over,  and oh, look, who's here?  Satya Nadella.  But this was, I think, important to their strategy  because they were, Meta announced, of course,  their new pro version of the Quest,  $1,500 pro version of the Quest.  And what was weird is they didn't focus on gaming at all.  They focused on productivity.  And Microsoft was there to announce  that you're gonna be able to use Windows 11  with the new Quest,  and you're gonna be able to use Office with the new Quest.  Does it seem odd to you that Satya was at this event  and not his own?

Start time: 669.56
End time: 757.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think so because Microsoft,  ever since he took his job as CEO,  has taken this position of Microsoft is very open  and willing to work with any other company  that will basically have them.  They're getting away from the closed ecosystem thing.  And while Microsoft is building its own metaverse  and using its own tools and doing its own thing  with HoloLens and whatever comes next  after the recent reorganization,  they want to be where the technology's going.  Maybe Facebook's meta system will take off  and do very well.  And why would they wanna join later on  versus being on the bottom floor?  If it takes off and becomes the next Facebook,  they're right there with their own productivity tools  with Microsoft Teams and everything else.  So I think it's actually a smart move.  We don't know the status of their own hardware,  what they're going to do.  There's rumors, of course,  that they have a partnership with Samsung  to build some kind of headset.  We're not really too sure what that's gonna be.  We don't know the future of HoloLens  in terms of enterprise use.  So I think this is a safe bet for them  in terms of making sure that their software and services  are being continued to be used  no matter who builds the hardware.  I'm pretty positive whatever Apple comes out with,  Microsoft will wanna be there as well  and have all their apps and services  that are relevant to that platform  be right there for their customers.  And I think it makes sense  instead of just being everything focused on Microsoft  and their hardware, they just wanna be open  and be wherever they can.

Start time: 758.98
End time: 782.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It used to be Microsoft's mission statement  that there would be a computer on every desk  in every home running Microsoft software.  Now, Satya Nizhnevich says,  we wanna be where our customers are.  So this is, is it hedging their bets  that HoloLens won't take off or just saying,  we don't care anymore.  We're not a platform company anymore.  We're more of a services company, I guess.

Start time: 782.74
End time: 794.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's because they're a services company, right?  And HoloLens, the mission statement there is a little bit,  we're not really too sure anymore.  HoloLens is augmented reality.  That's an interesting mission statement.  Yeah, but we're not sure, right?

Start time: 795.30
End time: 796.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My word, my nod.

Start time: 797.16
End time: 883.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's augmented reality and it's built,  like I was just said, in Israel with Intel,  they're using it within the boundaries and the fab  to both train people on how to fix the equipment  and also for remote help using equipment.  So someone's tech is having a problem fixing something  so it can remote in, see what they're seeing  and then literally overlay in real time tools  or pointing to things and you wanna do this and that.  So that's an example of how HoloLens  in an industrial use is being used,  but it's future in terms of more enterprise use  for this idea of like being in virtual meetings.  I'm not really sure HoloLens quite has that role as is  because this is more blurring into a virtual reality  where you're actually going to another world.  And Alex Kitman, before he technically left Microsoft,  although he's still there apparently as a consultant,  he did have this idea that eventually HoloLens  would switch over to a virtual reality.  And here's this concept of course of having a clear glass  where you can use AR and then it can change intent  to dark mode.  That's tech is probably still a little bit out.  So instead of what these companies are doing  or just using front-facing cameras to simulate the,  so you can actually see where you are.  And then it's just usually on the inside where it's dark  and you can create a virtual reality.  That's sort of a half step until this other technology  I think becomes reality.

Start time: 884.10
End time: 968.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alex Kitman's keynote last year for HoloLens  was the one that famously kind of descended  into a Burning Man dance festival  in some sort of weird way.  And by the way, there's Guilla Liberté  who is the founder of Cirque du Soleil  about to take Alex on a magic carpet ride into the future.  Interestingly, also in the news right about the same time,  the US Army is starting to report that soldiers  are getting sick in the HoloLens.  Remember that Microsoft did a $22 billion deal  with the Army to provide HoloLens for combat troops.  The devices would have gotten us killed  according to an Army report leaked.  And they also said, this is Bloomberg and Business Insider  saying they saw this story.  They also said that 80% of the soldiers  were nauseated under three hours.  Not ideal for combat missions.  And so with Kitman leaving, the rumors flying  that Microsoft is backing off on HoloLens,  and then this Satya Dadal is showing up at Meta,  you don't think that that's an indicator  that Microsoft maybe has lost confidence in HoloLens?

Start time: 969.56
End time: 1029.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they did split the organization  into hardware and software.  And so what you saw with Facebook and Meta,  I should say, is the software division continuing their work.  In terms of hardware, we don't know.  They do have a hardware division dedicated to this.  There is also this, so there's this contract  with the military, there's also supposed  contract with Samsung, where Samsung is gonna build  the hardware and use some of Microsoft's technology.  We don't know much more about that  in terms of what's the goal.  Is that a consumer device?  Is it more enterprise?  We really don't know.  And we don't know since the reorg  what they're planning on doing.  Are they gonna continue with HoloLens 3,  which was technically scrapped for a while?  Are they gonna try to aim more towards the consumer ends?  So we're gonna have to wait and find out  what their plans are.  I would imagine they still have a lot of tech  that they innovated in this area.  It would be weird that they would just give up  and not use it right now.  But we'll have to kind of see as leaks come out  or Microsoft gives a presentation  on what they are planning next.

Start time: 1030.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new Quest is kind of a classic VR play.  You can't see through it like you can with a HoloLens,  but they do have outward facing cameras  and they say now it's in color.  So it's kind of more like a, I guess, mixed reality  is the term that Microsoft uses  and probably the right term for this.  Neither VR nor AR, but a mixed reality.  But I, and this is, I wanna bring Brianna and Sam  in on this as well.  There's a lot of speculation that Meta has,  somebody said Meta should have made this an R&D project,  not the future, not bet the future of the company on it.  They've spent $15 billion,  they're doing about $10 billion a year on this.  Brianna, do you,  I feel like one of the reasons you're seeing Microsoft  showing up at Meta, probably doing Do It With Apple,  is that no one really knows how this landscape  is gonna play out.  So everybody's kind of hedging their bets until,  once somebody starts to win, then everybody,  then it all changes, of course,  but we've seen that before in our own technologies.  But my question is, is anybody gonna win?  Is this a technology anybody wants at all?

Transcript:  I had a really surreal experience.  And I mean this with all respect to Emily Chang.  I love her, I've been on her show on Bloomberg  many, many times.  Fantastic person, love her.  But something the last time I was on, I noticed,  is it was a few times ago,  was the day that Facebook announced the Meta transformation.  And there was this discussion on Wall Street,  oh, Meta, what is it going to be?  What is, are they going to create?  And it was all these Wall Street people,  like with these, like,  Heinlein-esque visions of the future about what it could be.  And for me as a technologist,  I'm seeing they're listening to it,  just analyzing the news that came out in a very different way.  And the impression I got from that was,  this was more of a move for Wall Street  to present a vision for Facebook in the future.  Just like you were telling us before the show  that you kind of had to be talked out of the surface nine,  Meta comes out with the Oculus.

Transcript:  I did buy the Quest Pro.  Oh, okay, well there it is.  The Quest Pro.  But that's partly because it has a 30-day return policy.  Sure.  I feel like it's important for me to do the due diligence.  Every few, I did the Kickstarter  for the original Oculus Quest.  I want to give it a chance.  I don't want to write it off completely,  but every time I try it, I say,  well, clearly we're not ready for prime time.  It's making me sick.  It made 80% of the Army sick.  Right.  I think that this is a technology  that seems like a good idea,  but we don't have the means yet.  Yeah, if that's 100%.

Start time: 1202.08
End time: 1210.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And that's 100% my point.  That I bought the original.  I have every VR system that exists  because I've done development on this.  Oh, have you?  Okay, okay.

Start time: 1211.50
End time: 1214.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It can, but I have the exact same.  It's like I buy a Quest.  It's a really fun 24 to 48 hours,  and then it lives in the drawer.  Never again.  I bought the Quest 2.  I had a really fun,  seeing how much better Beat Saber was,  and then it lived in a drawer.  And I'm asking myself,  when it comes to these kinds of meetings with people,  do I think there's any chance I'm actually gonna sit down  and ever have a VR meeting with someone?  I just, I don't see that ever happening.  This isn't a new phase for Facebook.  They acquired Oculus in 2014,  when the stories first started coming out.  And now eight years later,  the question is, where's the users?  Where's the use case for this?  Where are people wanting to have this experience?  And it just, it does not exist, unfortunately.

Transcript:  Ben Thompson writing about this in Stratectory,  he got an interview with Zuck and Nadella together,  kind of came out somewhat bullish on this.  He says, VR does have real utility,  but I think utility will be realized  in the enterprise first, in part,  because the value of VR only becomes apparent  when you use it, and you're more likely to use it  if your company pays for it.  He also says, Microsoft is well-placed  to deliver that utility on top of Meta hardware.  Meta is likely to be the catalyst for VR  becoming a widely used technology.  Now he doesn't mention Apple at all.  I also feel like a lot of this was a rush  to get out in front of the market  before Apple announces something early next year.  Sam, do you think that's what's going on?

Transcript:  That wouldn't surprise me.  Meta has been, Facebook's been trying to find something new.  Aside from the things that they've bought and copied,  they've never really created anything new  since the beginning of Facebook.  The news feed was the last copy of the thing.  Yeah, I guess, yeah.  But yeah, when you see a potential competitor,  another potential competitor, one with very deep pockets,  that is potentially doing something  that could be disruptive to your business,  yeah, you may want to jump into that.

Transcript:  A lot of companies said, oh, we should have paid attention  when the iPhone came along.  Microsoft famously, Steve Ballmer said,  ah, it's too expensive, nobody's gonna buy it,  and regretted that, lived to regret that.  Do you think they're worried the same thing will happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's certainly a possibility.  I mean, nobody wants to be left behind  when there's something big.  When you look at the smartphone space,  Google and Samsung are really the only ones  who were able to respond quickly enough to the iPhone  to put up real viable competition.  Windows was too little too late with Windows Phone.  I think like most platforms, there's probably not room  for more than maybe two, at most three platforms.  So whoever gets a foothold early on,  and it won't necessarily be the first one out the door.  I mean, there were lots of companies  that made MP3 players before the iPod came along.  There were lots of smartphones before the iPhone.  So it's not necessarily the first that is going to succeed,  but whoever does it right first,  whoever comes up with a good product first  is gonna have a better chance of success.  And then maybe the second and the third,  but most likely only the second  will really have an opportunity to be competitive  with them because of all the platform lock-in challenges.  But going back to what Brianna and Daniel said,  and you said, this is not something that I want to use,  even in, there are some good applications for this.  Some of the training stuff that's done with systems  like HoloLens is really useful.  I've seen some really good applications for VR,  for example, in design, in product design.  Ford showed us that way back when.  Every automaker does this, yeah.  I mean, when I first saw the Lucid Air in 2016,  I was with their head of design,  and he put an HTC Vive on my head,  and he gave me a design walk around with that,  and it was a great experience.  I mean, I was in the car with him,  and I was using the car before seeing the actual car,  and being able to, and it's not just cars,  but any kind of product design,  it's a great use case for that.  But for things like meeting with people,  I don't want to sit around with a headset on  for four, five, six, eight hours a day.  I mean, I've been to a lot of events.  I did a briefing with an automaker last year  where they sent out Quest headsets  to do this briefing in the Quest environment.  And once you put that headset on,  it's like if I'm in a meeting or in a briefing,  I want to take notes, whether it's handwritten notes  or type, I want to be able to take notes.  Sometimes recording stuff,  you can't do that when you're in a VR headset.  It's just a terrible environment  to spend extended periods of time in for work.

Transcript:  It really makes me ask,  what's the problem it's trying to solve?  I mean, Zoom meetings may be not the best thing  in the world, but neither are in-person meetings,  but they work, and I'm not sure why it would be better  to do Teams in an Oculus Pro.  Daniel, do you agree, disagree?  You think that that's the future of meetings?

Transcript:  Yeah, it's like I see augmented reality  where you still see that your world around you  and holograms and everything there  is the real goal of all this.  And that seems to me, it's gonna be really interesting,  but I feel like that's still so many years off  from being a reality for average people  who can't afford a $3,000 headset.  And even there, the use case,  it's like we still need smarter technology  to make use of it.  This idea of like, and it's kind of scary, right?  Like you're walking around, but you have a camera on there,  visually IDs a person and brings up their info automatically,  or you can ID stuff quickly and look it up.  Almost like being a cyborg, right?  I feel like that's where all this will eventually go.  And that makes sense, but this idea of like a VR headset,  and don't forget, Microsoft years ago showed up  with what they call a holoportation.  Where they used like a room and a bunch of cameras in it  and would scan you, and it would create a hologram  with the person.  And this idea like, in the future,  we may have like little setups in our homes that does that.  Like that's a little bit more realistic in a sense,  because you're still like in your environment.  You could still take notes, you can still do stuff  while you see a hologram of a person.  And I think that makes sense for, but again, limited cases.  And I bet Apple's play here is rumored to be along  the eye message and making video calls.  And I'm sure it's gonna be something along those lines  where it's connecting like FaceTime, a virtual FaceTime.  And I think that might work in this idea of like,  you're making limited calls to people and having that,  but not necessarily meetings.  Yeah, I don't really see a huge use case for it.  Sam mentioned some really good issues, right?  Taking notes, I think is a pretty big limitation  if you're going to be in a meeting all day.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, is this a better way  or is this just another way?  I think there's a group sync mentality.  When everybody in Silicon Valley is going,  yeah, VR, VR, AR, AR, Mixed-R,  that there's this kind of thing like,  oh, well, they must know what they're talking about.  And the more people do it, but is it possible  they just could be completely wrong?  And that Facebook's spent $10 billion a year  and tens of thousands of engineers  on something that is just never gonna take off?  Remember when 3D came back?  Yeah, 3D TV is a really good example.  3D TVs, even 3D is a movie theaters.

Start time: 1726.86
End time: 1891.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sorry, I just wanted to say,  can we go through history here a bit?  What I find really interesting about all of this  is think through the history of the computer industry.  Before word processors and spreadsheets were easy to use,  geeks, people like us, we saw that,  we were early adopters, we were like,  this is such a good experience.  We're willing to put up with the headaches  and we pushed through.  We did that exact same pattern for MP3 players  before it became something like the iPhone.  We did it with personal data assistance  back when it was the Palm Pilot.  We did it on the internet when it was the 2400 mod modem  that you were dialing into.  There's a pattern of us, for all of us here,  that we see the value in these things  and we jump in early and we deal with the headaches  and we put our foot down with all of that.  I think it is so important to this  that everyone on the show today has tried VR.  We've given it a fair shake.  And as we're all saying,  it's something that lives in a drawer eventually.  There is something that's just fundamentally not useful  about any of this.  And even for the case, like you're talking about Daniel,  like the HoloLens presentation a while back,  Zuckerberg had two avatars he put out.  One was a cartoony, silly looking thing.  The other one was like a photo realistic thing  for him to like put his vision forward.  What I saw with that as a game developer  was something that the average consumer  is gonna have to spend $25,000 having a team  of people make with ZBrush and normal mapping  and rigging and texture mapping  and painting wrinkles into the skin  and all this other stuff that no one is ever going to do.  And I just don't see people spending that money.  And I don't think this is a process that can be automated  in a way that looks anywhere remotely real.  Like you'll get to where it just looks like,  do you remember the N64 contest  where they would put your face on a Bond character for you?  We'll get that good, but it's not gonna look like what's...  Well, it was just cheesy.  You can cheat it with displacement maps to a certain extent,  but you're talking about something so high poly  that then you're talking,  the only way to make that data smaller  is to do decimation pass on it, which is a professional,  you can't automate that, that is judgment.  So there's just all these things here.  And it's like, this is not gonna be better than Zoom.  And you're taking a hundred times the processing power  and it's gonna cost more and you're gonna feel sick all day.

Transcript:  You said something interesting.  For instance, the first time you hit the slash key  and visit calc, the first time I saw an Instagram photo,  I always, I think maybe it's editing retroactively,  but I think you knew immediately, this is something.  And you said, yeah, this is, wow, I got it.  This is something.  And I don't feel that way at all about VR.  This is always the challenge for anybody who's covering tech  because there's a lot of stuff tech comes up with  that is a non-starter, is James Bond characters  on your face or vice versa.  And then there's every once in a while,  there's something you go, you look at it and you go,  yeah, that's something, that's it.  That's gonna change the world.  The iPhone when it first came out really was kind of  overpriced and kind of not very, it couldn't cut and paste,  but there was something there.  And the same time we looked at the Newton and it was like,  there's nothing there.  You just kind of, and maybe that's my memory  rather than the facts, but I think you kind of know.  There was a great tweet storm earlier this week  by a guy who's working at Waymo now, Warren Craddock,  but he has worked on a lot of, he tweets,  I worked on a number of high profile failures.  And he talks about the light field camera,  the Google Glass and Google clips,  which is that little box that would take your life story  and pictures.  And he said, every one of them had a fatal flaw.  Everyone working on them saw the flaw,  but the teams that were working on them  purposely ignored the flaw.  And he goes on in this, and I think it's really interesting.  The example of the clips thing, which I had,  was really cool.  It was a little box that would take pictures  of your whole day, then upload them  and you could go through your day.  The problem was it wasn't where your eyes are,  it was where your chest is.  So all the pictures, and he says this,  they were just wrong,  because that's not the point of view we're looking for.  And the teams that make them aren't the best judges,  because they're invested now.  But when end users get Google Glass,  they immediately go, what?  No.  Daniel, do you trust your instinct  when it comes to new products like that?  Do you say, yeah, I can tell?

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, so let me give an example  of something I do think has value,  and I think it's really interesting.  It reminds me of when I was doing  some neuroscience two years ago.  It was always funny, because we do the human brain,  and we've learned a lot about neuroscience over the years,  but we still don't understand how the mind works  on a biological level, just no idea.  And part of it's because we don't understand  fundamentals of neurons yet.  And there was a neurologist years ago,  and he wrote a book, and he said,  we should master how a snail brain works first,  and then work our way up to humans.  Was this Jeff Hawkins?

Start time: 2068.50
End time: 2087.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I'm sure he would agree with that.  Jeff Hawkins wrote a great book about this.  In fact, he started a company,  he said, no von Neumann machine  is ever gonna duplicate the brain,  because it's not massively parallel enough.  So he's trying to create, and I think,  and no success at this point,  but trying to recreate chips that duplicate  that massively parallel brain.  Anyway, I'm sorry to interrupt.

Transcript:  No, it's fine.  And so there's an example here with the VR, AR,  and all that, which is,  like Lenovo just announced a couple weeks ago,  they're called the T1 glasses, I believe they're called.  They're coming out early next year.  And it's a stripped down, simplified, single purpose device.  They're glasses you put on, they have a USB-C cable,  you can plug into your phone,  or you can plug into your computer.  It doesn't require any software.  And all it does is project a second display.  It's just a screen.  And it's just a screen that sits in front of you,  it's got really nice resolution.  You know, I could actually see this working.  Yeah, so if you're on a PC, say you're in public,  you could actually turn your PC's display off  and just use these, which is really good  if you think about for people working on sensitive documents  or anything that they don't want other people  to see around them.  Or you can use it literally as a second display.  So you could just have two displays floating.  And it doesn't require any extra, you know, CPU power,  because they have another pair of glasses  that do require like a massive GPU  that does all the AR stuff, right?  These don't have a front-facing camera.  You can almost wear them sort of like normal glasses,  because you could still see out in the world just fine.  You can plug them into even your iPhone,  you will have an adapter work with your iPhone.  And you can like walk around with your phone in your pocket  and be doing whatever.

Like there's not gonna be like really in between people  like, yeah, but do I really, you know, what does it do?  What problem does it solve?  Well, it solves a simple problem,  which is it just gives you a second virtual display  in front of you.  And if you think like, if, you know,  an Apple Watch is a great example,  and this is something where Apple really has a leg up,  you can use your phone in the pocket,  you can use the Apple Watch someday,  could just become the actual mouse  and then you interact with to control the glasses  and anything you're seeing, right?  There's a lot of opportunity here  for that kind of technology.  I think if we step back and look at this,  I think this, you know, is way more interesting,  way more practical and pragmatic for real world use.

And I kind of wanna tie this into,  so I saw and I'm sure you saw it too, Sam,  an article that said after hundreds of billions of dollars  and 20 years, self-driving cars are no farther along  than they're still not happening.  And I'm wondering if we are in this situation  in tech right now, where we're kind of peak tech  for smartphones and things like Google's,  Pixel 7 is basically a Pixel 6  and Apple's iPhone 14 is basically iPhone 13.  If we're at this stage where our existing technology  is peaked and companies are scrambling  to find the next new thing,  but they're wasting a lot of money on stuff  that isn't gonna go anywhere,  like maybe AR, VR, maybe self-driving cars.  So put a pin in that  because I wanna keep this conversation going.

Transcript:  Very important stuff.  And from Windows Central, the great Daniel Rubino.  It's a good panel today.  Lots more to talk about.  But first, a word from our sponsor.  I'll tell you one thing that when I first encountered it  more than 10 years ago, I went, oh, brilliant.  This is gonna go somewhere.  Stamps.com.  Because you don't have to go to the post office  to get stamps.  Though, okay, that's obvious, that's great.  You don't have to have a postage meter either.  You print them out with your computer and your printer.  In fact, it gets better.  You can do anything you can do at the post office.  You can do it at stamps.com.  Prepare it all, get it ready,  and then a uniformed employee of the federal government  will come and pick it up.  You don't even have to get out of your seat.  Now that's awesome.  But stamps.com keeps getting better and better.  Because now stamps.com has all the services of UPS.  So now, you sit down at stamps.com,  you say, this is what I need to mail.  It will tell you, it has a switch and save feature.  It'll tell you what the rates are with both carriers.  You know that you're getting the best deal you can choose.  It's an amazing tool for anybody who does mailing.  Not just shipping, but mailing.  So even if you're just sending out bills or brochures,  need I remind you, the holidays are coming?  And that is, it's amateur hour at the post office.  That's when everybody's in the post office  getting their Christmas stuff mailed.  You don't need to be there.  Stamps.com can do it all.  A 24 seven post office with no lines, no traffic,  no hassle, right in your office.  Stamps.com has been a partner of our shows  and we've been happy customers since 2012.  So my question is, you've heard me talking about them.  Why haven't you, what are you waiting for?  Why haven't you tried them?  Now with UPS services, every dollar counts  and you can save on USPS and UPS rates up to 86% off.  Discounts you cannot get at the post office or the UPS store.  You can use stamps.com to print postage  wherever you do business.  Just a computer and a printer is all you need.  If you need a package pickup,  you schedule it through the stamps.com dashboard.  You'll always have the latest rates and the latest stamps.  Prices change.  So you can always have the new stamps always ready anytime.  A great way to do an online store  because stamps.com knows about online stores  and will pick up the mailing addresses from your software.  No typing at all on your part.  It'll fill out forms for certified mail and express mail,  all the different kinds of mail you need to do.  Even customs forms if you mail internationally.  It could put your return address on there automatically.  Logos from your company, it'll print right on envelopes,  right on envelopes even.  Print out a sticker for your packages.  Look, this is the time to get stamps.com.  Get ahead of the holiday chaos.  It's just around the corner  and you will be using it all year round.  Stamps.com.  Here's my deal.  I want you to go to stamps.com and click the microphone  in the upper right hand corner.  Use the offer code TWIT.  This is the best deal they offer.  A four week trial, of course.  You get a free digital scale.  So you always have exactly the right amount of postage.  It just makes you look more professional.  You get a huge amount of free postage.  You can use no long-term commitments.  There's no contract.  Just month to month, go to stamps.com,  click the microphone at the top of the page.  Use the code TWIT though for this offer.  Really good bonus offer.  Stamps.com.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  You support us too, by the way,  when you go to stamps.com and use that offer code TWIT.  Google didn't want to be left out by the way of all of this.  They showed The Verge, J. Peters of The Verge,  their project Starline.  We saw this at Google I.O. last year.  I mean, talk about something  that's gotta cost a lot of money.  You get a special booth with all of these cameras and stuff.  However, Jay said it was very realistic.  This is a 3D video chat booth.  He said it was just like I was sitting across  from the person.  And when they showed me an apple,  I felt like I could reach out and touch it.  Obviously, this is not something you're gonna have  in your house anytime soon.  It is a very complicated,  with array microphones and stereo cameras  and infrared projectors.  But it works.  In fact, maybe it's more natural  than putting on a visor and going to a Teams meeting.  I don't know.  I don't know.  Anyway, Google says, well, we think is another way to go.

Transcript:  So I have a little bit of technical insight on this.  So think about video game,  like something like Resident Evil 3, right?  Where you're moving Jill around,  you're using a thumb stick, right?  So where Jill's feet go  or where any 3D character, their feet go  as you're walking is actually a really complicated problem.  Like you can cheat it with IK joints,  inverse kinematic joints in the legs.  But when it comes to like things like walking upstairs,  we have all these like animation tree cheats  that we use where your foot will magnetically snap  to every single step as you go up it.  It's actually a really hard problem,  but one that we've been doing in video games  for really since the PS2 era  and people just generally don't notice it.  So I saw this and thought it was honestly  a really good implementation of something.

Transcript:  Yeah.  This is from the Meta video.  These people, they even have stools,  but there's nothing below the waist for them to...  I could see how it's hard to do.  Even if you have cameras,  I could see how it'd be very hard to do.  That breaks the immersion.  It totally does.  It's creepy and weird.  Okay.  And apparently Meta hasn't solved it  because the whole video that they showed  of Mark and his co-hosts dancing around  with their legs was faked.  So we're not...  Oh my gosh.  You know, they know it's important.

So,  I feel like there's clearly a disconnect here  that these guys have read a lot of science fiction.  So have we.  We've read the Neal Stephenson books.  We know Snow Crash.  We're a long way off.  In those books, they're jacking in.  They're connecting something to the brain.  This is not...  And one of the hardest things that is absolutely vital  to reality is this thing about moving.  Not just showing your legs, just moving.  Like, correct me if I'm wrong, Brianna,  but in all the VR I've done,  you have to have some work around for moving,  like a rubber band that you send with a controller  and then it goes, sucks you over there,  because you can't really move  because you'll walk into your real wall.  Yeah.  Or coffee table.  This is a big problem.

Studies have also shown that women are much more susceptible  to VR sickness as well.  So if you've played these early VR games  where you just hold forward  and you just walk through a level  by pushing on a control stick,  that is like a formula for making women throw up.  It just is.  And a lot of dudes too.  Yeah.

That was just because the bus was going this way  and Quake was going that way.  And it was not a pretty picture.  I still get sick sometimes  if I have a big enough screen on just a regular 2D game.  So maybe I'm the bad example of this.

Transcript:  Well, this past week I was moderating a conference  here in Detroit on simulation  run by a company called VI Grade.  And one of the things we talked about was,  one of the things that this company makes  is these big motion simulators  for driving dynamics development.  So you basically put a vehicle,  almost a full vehicle on there  and it moves around and simulates all the motions.  And we were talking about an example back in the late 90s  when I was still working in engineering.  We built a simulation system using,  it was powered by a Silicon Graphics Iris workstation,  big giant screen, had a driving buck,  but the driving buck had no motion.  And we were using this for ABS and traction control  and stability control development.  And I always found it really hard.  I could not drive this thing for more than a few minutes.  And I do test driving all the time.  Even more so than in those days  and doing all kinds of maneuvers.  And I could not sit in this thing driving it  for more than a few minutes  because you've got this big screen that was quite immersive,  but you had no physical feedback  of the things that your eyes were seeing.  And it was really hard.  And so this is a real issue  when you have that disconnect  between your visual inputs and all of your other senses.

Transcript:  Here we have, by the way, thanks to the Discord chat, Brianna,  the stare animation.  It works perfectly.  It's completely convincing.  Yeah, it's the disconnect between what your eyes  are telling you and what your body is telling you.  Your inner ear is telling you and your eyes are telling you.  And it is the FUD, I think,  the FUD that's spread by the VR industry  that all we have to do is get latency down  and resolution up and you'll be fine.  And I don't think that's it.  I really don't.  I think it's also the disconnect between your focal length  that's being telegraphed by your convergence point  because your eyes are looking at the screen  that's right here.  So you're converging on this screen that's inches from you.  And what your brain is telling you,  the focal point is, which is 10 feet out,  if those don't match, as you know,  your body says, you ate something bad, throw it up now.  That is bad mushrooms.

One of the things they're really promoting here  versus the first version of the Quest  is the pass-through on it.  So it has cameras on it and you can push a button  and it will show you the world around you in color.  And they're trying to promote that as like, AR, right?  But it's not augmented.  It's a camera that's not where your eyesight is.  Oh, that's really bad.  It's almost certainly going to have a certain amount  of latency.  Every time I've used this feature on a Quest  or any VR system before,  it makes me really, really, really nauseous.  And I feel like they're just papering right over that problem  when we're gonna experience this.  Like if you're in the supposed Quest Pro meeting  and you're reaching down at your desk to take notes,  this camera is not gonna solve it.  You're still gonna feel sick using that.

I saw an article that says,  we've spent hundreds of billions of dollars  on self-driving vehicles  and they still aren't self-driving.  Is that a fair categorization, Sam?

End time: 3337.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, the industry as a whole has spent somewhere in the order  of about $100 billion over the last 12, 15 years  on automated driving.  But there is a very big difference here.  And if you take a Tesla and they're fake full self-driving,  I think the guy that wrote this got a lot wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, so this started from actually trying to solve  some very specific problems.  I mean, with the DARPA challenge,  it started with trying to get vehicles  that could go into combat zones  and not have to take people in there.  But once it got into trying to commercialize  the technology, it was trying to solve some real problems  around safety, traffic safety, mobility for people  who can't drive, to provide them with mobility.  And going back to the example of these Lenovo glasses  that Daniel brought up, the rest of the industry,  apart from Tesla, has actually recognized  that doing a more focused approach,  like what Lenovo is doing, having a very specific task  that you're doing with it, not trying to,  recognizing that, okay, this is a really hard problem  to solve, they have actually made tremendous progress  over the last 15 years, but not trying to do everything,  but rather focus it on specific tasks,  like robo taxis in urban environments,  like last mile deliveries, automated trucking,  where you're not trying to do,  you're not trying to solve everything,  but you're trying to do specific things.  It can actually work quite well.  I was just in a couple of vehicles earlier this week  with a company driving around Dearborn,  and it was not Ford, but driving around,  actually riding around Dearborn,  and the system was working really, really well.  I was in San Francisco last month with Cruz,  and the system worked very, very well.  I've seen a tremendous amount of progress.  Early on, these systems were very crude,  but we are getting to the point,  we've got some real world driverless deployments  going on now in San Francisco and Arizona.  We're gonna have quite a few more coming in 2023  from a number of different companies  in places like Austin, Miami, San Diego, Las Vegas,  and it's slowly getting there,  but being more focused rather than trying to solve,  rather than trying to boil the ocean,  as Tesla seems to wanna do,  they're trying to boil a pot of water first,  and then once they get that going,  then move to a bigger pot, and so on.

Forget about profits, what's the combined revenue  of all the RoboTaxi, RoboTruck, Robo whatever companies?  It's like a million dollars, or maybe not even that much,  maybe zero.

Transcript:  George Hotz, back in 2016,  I was chairing a conference in San Francisco.  He was supposed to speak at that conference.  That morning, I was walking into the event space for it,  and I checked my messages,  and I saw a notification on their TechCrunch story  that the day before, or a couple days before,  NHTSA had sent a letter to Comma AI saying,  hey, we would like some more information  about what you're doing.  It wasn't threatening, they just,  was just asking for information about what they were doing.  Hotz immediately pulled the plug on the whole project,  and said, nope, okay, we're not gonna do this,  because he was the scammer.  He, I mean, if anybody knows what a scam is, it's him.  What he was doing was never going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Level five, probably never.  Never.  Or at least a very long time.  Level five is true self-driving, right?  Well, no, so level four and level five  are both true self-driving.  The distinction is level five can do it anywhere, anytime.  Level four means you can do full self-driving  within some limited parameters.  It might be limited to a geographic area,  might be limited based on weather conditions  or specific tasks.  It's just, it just has some kind of limited operating domain.  So, you know, it's still self-driving.  It's still fully automated.  It's just, it can't necessarily do it everywhere.  And you can still get tremendous value  out of doing it even in a limited environment.

I mean, it was, they were really terrible  and made a lot of progress really, really quickly.  A few years later, they were doing the whole challenge.  They had to make it longer and more difficult  because the cars got better.  But isn't this always the case with AI  that the early stuff, the first 80% is relatively easy.  It's that last 10% that kills you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that was a rule of thumb  I learned very early on in my engineering career.  The first 90% of any project takes 10% of the effort.  And then the last 10% requires 90% of the effort.  And, you know, we're still, you know,  very early on in that last 10%.  There's still a long way to go.  But there are real world applications  where this is being used today.  And that will continue to grow over the next several years.

Transcript:  I just, I want to back up what you're saying, Sam.  I mean, I personally, like you can go to my Twitter.  I'm very, very skeptical of Elon and full self-driving.  And I really, I support the efforts of the National Highway  and Traffic Safety Institute  to look at what is happening there.  That said, I would really encourage any of your listeners  or viewers that are skeptical about this,  go out and try GM Super Cruise.  I am not a GM fan.  I would not own one of those cars,  but it's a really, really, really impressive technology.  If I still had a job where like I had to drive  into downtown Boston every single day,  that's gonna take care of 90% of it for you.  And the reason is exactly what you're saying, Sam.  It's a very limited use case.  So I'm trying to drive down 95  and deal with the traffic there.  And yes, I've got to keep my eyes on the road.  I've got to be aware and ready to take over  at every single minute,  but it's gonna do 90% of the work for me.  That work is like, that feature is something  this our industry has been able to deliver at this point.  And it's good.  Porsche has a variation of this.  I almost think like it's like we set our sights too high.  It's not helped by Elon like hyping something  that I just frankly don't think is ever gonna happen  from my point of view.  I think if we had set more attainable smaller goals  and delivered that to people while working  within this regulatory framework to keep the public safe,  I think it would have been a better course of action.

Instead of having members of the public beta testing  safety critical software,  they're doing it internally with professionals.  And only when they are highly confident  that it's going to work reliably, then they release it.

Start time: 3845.40
End time: 3863.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, that's definitely true.  But I'm just gonna say it's also because  they're doing all that work only because Tesla  is like cowboys in the West, right?  They did this, they're putting out in the streets already,  as you say, beta testing it with just regular people.  I mean, it was them that drove this, you know,  whole industry and everybody else is doing this.

Transcript:  We've got eight cameras on Tesla vehicles today,  and the thing is, they're not even configured  the way our human eyes are.  Our human eyes are both looking in the same direction,  and you can take advantage of the parallax  of your two eyes seeing the same object  from slightly different points of view  to do depth perception.  Tesla doesn't even do that.  The cameras are all pointing in different directions,  so you can't even do accurate distance measurement  with the way they have their cameras configured.  All their distance measurement is done by inference,  which is an inherently bad way to do it.  Oh, that's bad.

I mean, I was certainly given that impression,  but it kept hitting Lisa in the head.  She really hated that car.  She called it Christine.  She did not like that car one bit.  Let's take a little break.  Lots more to talk about, including Elon.  We got a couple of Elon stories, so why not?  He's the gift that keeps on giving.  But first, a word from our sponsor,  our show today brought to you by Collide.  This is a solution that every company who uses Slack  should adopt immediately.  It's an endpoint security solution  that instead of treating your users as the enemy,  and so many MDM solutions do that, right?  Oh my God, you got to defend against,  not the bad guys out there, but your users,  those are the ones that, they're,  glue the USB ports shut.  Don't let them do anything.  The problem with that is when you criminalize  your users in a company, your employees in a company,  what do they do?  They go out and they start using their phone  and their laptop, and now you got a real problem.  When you're trying to achieve security goals,  whether for a third party audit  or your own compliance standards,  the conventional wisdom is you treat every device  like Fort Knox, just lock it down.  And that means you start using  old school device management tools like MDMs  to force disruptive agents onto employees' devices.  Problem is, employees know this, it slows performance,  it treats privacy as an afterthought,  and treats them like the bad guys.  That way of doing things turns your IT department  into the enemies of the end users.  It creates its own security problems.  Users turn to shadow IT just to do their jobs.  Collide does it a completely different way.  Collide uses the most powerful untapped resource in IT,  your end users.  Instead of forcing changes on users,  Collide sends them security recommendations via Slack.  Now I know you're waiting to wait about that,  is that all?  But yes, because now your users are on your team.  It'll automatically notify them  when their devices are insecure.  It explains why that's a problem  and gives them step-by-step instructions on how to solve it  and now they're partners, they're doing it with you.  By reaching out to employees via a friendly Slack DM,  educating them about company policies,  Collide helps you build a culture,  a much nicer, better culture  in which everyone contributes to security  because everyone understands how and why to do it.  Your end users want to help.  They want to help.  You're giving them a chance  and now you're basically enrolling an entire army  to help protect the company.  And honestly, by now we all know  that's the only way to do it.  That's the only way to do it.  For IT admins, you're gonna love Collide.  It gives you a single dashboard.  It lets you monitor the security of your entire fleet  and it's by the way, completely cross-platform,  Mac, Windows, and Linux.  You'll be able to see at a glance  which employees have their disks encrypted,  their OS is up to date.  Which ones are using password managers?  Collide, user-centered, cross-platform,  endpoint security for teams that Slack.  That's the one line.  And let me tell you this, I know you might be skeptical.  No, it really works.

Thank you, Collide, for supporting this week in tech.  And you supporters, don't forget,  to your listeners by using that address  so they know you saw it here.  Very important.  I thought, okay, a little more on the Microsoft thing  because there was a lot in there.  The thing that kind of took my breath away  was towards the end of the Panos Panay video  in which they announced that Dolly2  was going to be part of Microsoft's new designer product.  That's their kind of their Figma or their Canva competitor.  And built into Bing Image Creator.  Now, did they explain, first of all,  it's coming next year, right, Daniel?

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not sure about that part.  I know it's just gonna be like,  in part of Bing Search, it's just gonna be like another tab.  It's not wild.  And you can just go right into it.  Yeah, I mean, there've been kind of,  I think they saw this early on as being a big thing.  I remember they partnered with them pretty early.  You can even use a Microsoft account  to register with Dolly2 currently.  But yeah, I'm not sure,  because after 50, I believe it is, with Dolly2,  you only get free ones.  And Dolly2, by the way, is now open to everybody.

Transcript:  It said a big investor, they're putting an investment in,  so maybe they're giving a chunk of change  and letting you use it, which is great.  To me, this is, so, you know,  we're talking about technologies that are slow,  they aren't coming along,  maybe they're never gonna come along.  And then all of a sudden out of nowhere,  AI is interesting, because you get these weird wins.  Like, all of a sudden, AlphaGo  can beat everybody at everything.  It's like, give it a game,  in four hours, it'll kill you.  And then now all of a sudden you get Dolly2  and stable diffusion and mid-journey.  I think stable diffusion really powered it  because it was open source and everybody could run it.  And all of a sudden, AI art is everywhere.  Yep.  Kind of amazing.

Start time: 4429.75

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, AI is like, there's like, again,  bringing it down to just like more realistic things.  I just picked up the Eufy Doorbell Dual,  so it's got two cameras on it, one that looks out,  and then the one that looks down to see  if someone has a package for you.  And it even has a new beta AI experiment  where it'll detect if it's a package  and alert you that a package was given.  And then it can give you another reminder  if you didn't pick it up yet.  And it's been working.  I've only had it for about 48 hours  and already had a couple of Amazon packages.  But as soon as someone puts a package down,  I get an alert, it says,  oh, there's something there for you.  And it's been pretty accurate.  It's a, I mean, I love that these like little usages of AI  to improve life versus these big ideas of robots  and cyborgs and all this kind of stuff  like taking over the world.  But these little examples,  including that using art I think is really, really intriguing  because it's just way more pragmatic and practical.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Well, and to follow up on that  and something that Daniel talked about earlier  with us not really understanding how the human brain works,  applications like this, like for art  or for doing image recognition for your doorbell  and things like that are great ways of starting to get AI  into some real applications  where it's not necessarily safety critical  because the reality is these AI systems,  they don't work the way the human brain does.  There's so much about the brain that we don't understand  about the way we perceive the world.  And for all of our flaws,  we're actually remarkably adaptable  much more so than AI systems are right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, we're just brute forcing it at this point  with microprocessors and machine learning.  You just give it like a billion examples  and then it learns.  Humans don't require a billion examples  to pick up a pattern.  We do it quite easily  and we can break that pattern just as easily.  I think that's maybe the way to go

Start time: 4571.44
End time: 4649.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is to think about we're good at pattern recognition.  Maybe these AI should do the things we're not so good at.  Already, memory is a good example.  Human memory is flawed, not great.  And as I get older, it's worse and worse.  But thank God for Google.  I don't know how people in earlier generations  survived getting older  because I don't have to remember everything.  I just Google it.  And I often will say,  oh, I can't remember what is...  Yesterday, my board up at the radio show  said there was a protest across the street.  It was a flag, it was a green and white flag  with a lion on it.  And we were able with Image Search  to find out what that was.  It was the Iranian flag.  It was an Iranian protest.  I don't know how you'd do it 50 years ago.  You'd go to the library.  Maybe in a week you'd find out.  I don't know.  Here's an example of AI, I guess,  doing voice impersonations.  This is a new podcast from podcast.ai.  In the first episode, they had Bro Jogan,  the famous podcaster, interviewing a guy  they wouldn't say who it was.  Well, here, let me play a little bit  because the voices are pretty good.

You know, it washes over you  and tells you that everything is connected.  You're not here by accident.  You were put here for a purpose.  And if you can figure out what that is,  clearly the AI was trained on actual Steve Jobs quotes.  It's pretty intense.  I mean, it's not a lie.  And then the voice as well.  It doesn't make you feel bad.  So some of these sentences are actual.  If you take LSD a second time,  Joe Rogan stuff is way better  just because he's so prolific.

Transcript:  I do have to say one of the applications  of this exact same tech,  I'm not gonna get into Twitch drama with Twitch streamers,  but there is a very high profile Twitch streamer  who uses this technology on one of his enemies in this  and then has the enemy voicing terrible things  that the chat is saying live on the show.  So, you know, it's almost like we invented technology  and then we find out what the worst ways to use it  to make the worst human beings alive.  Yeah, I just wanna say with Dolly, you know,  going back to that, look, this is a great technology.  I'm really happy Microsoft is doing this.  Like, I love that it's an artistic tool for people  to like have the ideas that they have like brought to life.  But I also think you've got to ask yourself like,  where are these images coming from?  What are the image libraries?  What artists are they basing this work off of  to generate this art that basically takes their style  and emulate it?  And I'm not gonna get into it,  I think there are some really ethically questionable  decisions they made in how they got these large data sets  and people being compensated for it.  Well, we certainly talked about it,

Transcript:  mentioned a couple of weeks ago,  Getty, the stock photo company,  won't allow you to use art generated by these AI  or won't sell it because, and they pointed out,  they've scraped our entire database  so that Getty's watermark shows up, you know,  just randomly when you use some of these,  I think it's StableDiffusion that did it.  Yeah, there's clearly copyright problems.  Greg Gukowski, who's the great illustrator,  is very mad because he's the most commonly used term  in StableDiffusion is, you know,  draw a penguin standing on its head  in the style of Greg Gukowski.  And, you know, on the one hand,  I think a lot of people now know who Greg Gukowski is  that didn't, but on the other hand, you know,  it's his style that's kind of being, you know,  wholesale lifted and I guess the AI scraped,  you know, his entire online database.

It was like, hey, Brianna, I am just out of school.  I am an expert in illustrator.  I need a job doing concept art.  Do you have anything, anything at all?  And these people are fighting the tooth and nail  with these illustration degrees  to just get their foot in the door  and there's nothing for them, right?  Like the people that do that work at Blizzard  have been there for a decade  and, you know, for like a small indie studio,  we'll throw out like a thousand dollar contract here  and there, but it's not something a lot of people  are gonna be able to live with.

Transcript:  I think you could use AI for a lot of this stuff now.  There's a game that came out this week called Score, right?  It's based on H.R. Giger's art style.  So you could type all those things into Dali  and they give me a shredding machine  in the style of H.R. Giger, right?  And it could create something like that.  So I do think this is going to have a very negative impact  on already very limited art jobs.  And I'm not saying it's bad or we shouldn't use it.  I'm just saying there's gonna be a consequence  of the technology.

Transcript:  Yeah, there's an interesting article.  Matt Welsh who worked at Google and Apple as a coder  wrote a piece, the end of programming.  Actually, I should give credit to Jeff Jarvis  who found this and wanted to talk about it on Twig,  but I'll talk about it now.  He says the end of computer science is coming.  Programming will be obsolete  because it'll be replaced by AI systems  that are trained rather than programmed.  And in a way, you are doing a kind of programming now  when you write a prompt for a Dali or stable diffusion,  but it's not in C or C++, it's in English.  And you're just telling the computer  to generate what you want.  He says things like GitHub's copilot  is just scratching the surface.  The future is clear that software will be written by AI,  but controlled by humans.  As a coder, does that make sense to you, Brianna?

Start time: 5014.78
End time: 5056.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's true in some ways.  I also think that,  there's another story that came out this week,  basically talking about how Moore's law  and this constant growth of a processing power  does seem to be coming to an end soon.  And I think that when that happens,  refactoring old code, writing efficient code,  I do think, especially as we have energy crises,  I think that writing efficient code  is gonna be a highly valued skill.  And I don't think that's something AI  is gonna be able to do as well as humans.  So I think it's a little hyperbolic  to say the end of programming.  I do think we're gonna have better tools  to help us write code.

Start time: 5056.22
End time: 5075.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What you will be doing though, more likely,  instead of writing, say, a binary tree search,  is you'll say, give me a binary tree search,  and it will write the underlying code.  And maybe, probably write it better than you and I would.  Let's be honest, so much of programming is stack overflow.

Transcript:  I was just gonna say,  the same predictions have been made for news writing,  in general.  That's happened.  In sports writing, for sure, right?  Yep, because it's just facts, right?  And the idea is you can string it together.  And in theory, you would actually weed out  any kind of bias reporting and word usage,  although that remains to be seen.  But yeah, that's expected to happen, too,  in the next couple years.  So we'll see what happens.

Start time: 5105.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, starting in the late 90s,  up until I left engineering in 2007,  working on electronic control systems for vehicles,  we put a lot of effort into developing  and working with automatic code generation systems  using tools like MATLAB, for example,  that we used for development purposes,  for rapid prototyping,  and then using that and other tools  to generate code from the model.  So we would create models, algorithmic models,  and then auto-generate code from that to run in vehicles.  Now, in those days, the code that it generated  was not nearly efficient enough to fit  in the amount of storage and memory that we had.  So we ended up doing a lot of rewriting by hand.  But I mean, this is not a new phenomenon.  This is something that was started a long time ago,  and it's still ongoing,  this idea of building models  and then generating the code from that.  And that's what a lot of what's being done today is based on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a new startup that is doing videos  in the same way as Dolly does still images.  You give it a couple of images, a script,  it will generate the whole video for you.  So I think that, so, you know,  it's clear that there are some things  humans are gonna have to do.  And I think what's happening is we're starting to see  the landscape of where AI can do a good job  and where humans are needed.  And it isn't as obvious, you might have said,  well, humans have to do the creative work,  but Dolly has shown, stable diffusion has shown  that that isn't necessarily true.  Although AI writing-  I think it's the biggest surprise.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 5223.74
End time: 5264.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because like, I mean, we always thought AI  would do like the menial tasks,  which is still, you know, what's kind of happening.  But I didn't predict this idea of like art.  And like, you know, of course we've all heard the stories  of like AI art being entered into art contests  and actually winning.  It's like, I mean, it's, which calls it to question,  you know, judging of art by humans versus, you know,  what AI is and everything.  But yeah, it's a whole other world  that just quickly came upon us.  And I'm sure it's already happening with music.  You know, music, there are no, especially pop music,  you know, there's kind of a secret sauce to it  in terms of the beats and everything  that the human brain responds to.  So just a matter of time before we start getting  AI generated music.

Start time: 5264.70
End time: 5337.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, don't be fooled by the bad AI music  we've heard so far.  I think you're exactly right.  It just is all of a sudden AI art exploded.  I think AI music is gonna explode.  And I would not wanna be a pop musician right now.  I think that's gonna be a tough world  in the next couple of years.  How about the Nvidia RTX 4090?  How about that?  A $1,600 video card.  Nvidia has a problem because they were making bank  when the video cards were in high demand from Bitcoin miners.  But now that that's collapsed,  and there's all these old highly used GPUs  on the market for pennies on the dollar,  they've had to find some other way to make money.  I think they might've found it with this beast of a GPU.  Devendra Harder, while reviewing it in Gadget,  says it's the fastest consumer GPU we've ever seen.  You could even run it at 8K, but it's also,  you know, as I said, 1,600 bucks.  You know, maybe I'll sell the Oculus Pro,  Quest Pro and buy this instead.  I'd have to get a machine to go in.  Does it take like more than one slot?  It looks like it's...  It's massive.  It's two and a half slots.  It's huge.

I already have not found a game, literally.  I cannot run mixed out at all settings.  No, I have a 3080, frankly,  and the 3080 runs fine at 14.  That's what I got too.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you know, for me, we just, Massachusetts is great.  They have this fantastic program where you can get...  They basically pay the cost of your solar panels  going on your roof.  And they just charge you more for electricity  and that slowly pays off the solar panels.  So yeah, I saw this and I'm like,  well, I don't have to worry so much  about the power usage these days.  But I mean, honestly, it's like if you can run cyberpunk  at max settings in a hundred FPS on a 32 inch monitor,  like running a really good resolution.  That's VR.  What do you need this for?

And if you're a video, if you're, if you're rendering video,  I could see where this will be a big benefit.  Maybe it'll definitely cut your time in half.

You're going to make sure that it will run fine on a 3060  or less, a 1070.  Do game companies then say,  but we're going to have an ultra high resolution frame rate,  infinite distance, the Z goes all the way.  And then say, if you have a 4090, we've got a mode for you.

It's an SOC with 2000 tera ops integer performance  and 2000 tera flops floating point performance,  which is designed to be able to have this one chip power  the entire car, at least in terms of computing performance.  It's still...  It's three years away from production programs,  but this is just...  They haven't said how much,  how many watts this thing consumes,  but as an example,  other automated vehicles that I've seen,  their compute platforms, just the compute,  not including the sensors and everything else,  can consume as much as four kilowatts  just for the compute to do an automated vehicle.  Yeah.

He likens it to a black hole so massive  it warps space time around it.  This is the new standard.  This is like, we're putting that flag way out ahead.  And so you're gonna see,  this is setting the mark in effect.  And I guess that's what they're doing in automotive as well.

Transcript:  Yeah.  And that Thor chip,  last year at the spring GTC,  they announced a chip called Atlan,  which they canceled and replaced with Thor  because they, since Atlan,  they introduced an ARM SOC for data centers,  for servers called Grace,  and then also a new GPU architecture called Hopper.  And so what they did was they realized,  well, we can take the technology we've got in Grace  and Hopper, combine those with a bunch of other stuff  to make this other chip that would give us twice  the performance of what we had already announced.  And those chips,  some of the areas that Nvidia is involved in,  some of the data centers that they're powering,  all kinds of robotics applications,  it does go way beyond GPUs.  GPUs is just one small part of their business now.  And I think there was a story that was further down,  I think on the rundown about American executive,  chip companies,  American chip companies operating in China.  A few weeks back, there was an announcement  from the Biden administration.  Yeah, barring the export of a lot of these high performance  data center chips and server chips to China.  And Nvidia is one of the companies that's impacted by that.  So far, there was something else  that just came out the other day  that I haven't been able to dive into in depth yet,  but it seems like they may be expanding those sanctions  to cover other types of chips as well.  So that might end up impacting both Nvidia and Qualcomm,  which is also selling chips for vehicles.

It's gonna really cripple China's chip industry  and for super chips used for weapons  and the military primarily,  but also for driving, AI, self-driving,  and all this other stuff.  It almost seems, I don't know, a little too much.  They're really serious sanctions.  I mean, it's gonna really, really hobble China.  And you gotta wonder, of course,  what China's gonna do in response to that, right?  Because they're not going to just idly sit by.  I think that's kind of the real big question  that we have to wait now to see what happens.

Transcript:  This is worse than a trade war.  This is a shot across the bow.  And I understand why the US government did it.  There was real concern among the intelligence community,  as you say, that they were using our technology  to power their military and their AI for military uses  so that we were in effect helping build up their military  when they pose a real threat, at least to Taiwan, our ally,  but also to the whole region,  and maybe even the whole world at some point.  So I understand why you'd wanna do something about it,  but it seems like, it almost seems like a warlike action,  especially with Xi, President Xi,  now going for his coronation as the emperor of China  at the party Congress, which is going on now.  And he's been, in order to secure his power and his position,  doing a lot of saber rattling.  And I just worry that we're heating up,  and this is about geopolitics as much as it is tech,  but I agree with you, Daniel.  I worry we're heating up this already volatile space  and maybe gonna have consequences that we will long regret.

I 100% agree.  Yeah, that a war would just be unfeasible  because it would just destroy both economies  and just wouldn't be worth the risk.  But as soon as we start separating ourselves from China  and disengaging, and I get it, we wanna build up Intel,  if something happens to Taiwan,  we wanna make sure we have a fab here and all that.  So I kinda get that, but yeah, I mean,  there is a risk here that the more we go down this route,  the more dangerous it's gonna get.

Transcript:  Here's, for months, administration officials have debated,  this is from the New York Times,  what they could do to hobble China's progress.  China, according to the Times,  was using supercomputing and artificial intelligence  to develop stealth and hypersonic weapons systems,  and maybe even worse, to crack our encryption,  and this is according to intelligence reports.  So you're giving another country the power to become  a real enemy, but then at the same time,  I agree with Brad Mary, it's better to be allies,  even if you're frenemies, because it preserves the peace.  This is not the kind of move that preserves the peace.  Yes, you're taking away an important weapon,  but I also think that the Chinese, given a little time,  it's not, they're not dumb.  They have high, smart people and high technology  and great universities.  I don't know why they couldn't duplicate our efforts.  So I don't know what you're achieving.  It's at best a short-term solution.  It's a short-term solution.

Transcript:  What I wanted to say was, you know,  I think there's a longer-term view to have here.  If you look at the Marshall Plan following World War II,  I really feel like a lot of people on my own side  really underestimate this.  We've had the longest historical period of peace  and prosperity in worldwide history following World War II.  Because of interdependency, because of the Bretton Woods,  because of these alliances to create this,  basically, economic dependency between nations.  This has been good.  On one hand, when I see the United States doing things  like shoring up domestic chip production,  I 100% support that in many ways.  I do think we need redundancies here,  even though it doesn't make sense in some ways,  because we don't have the tools  we actually need to build those chips.  But that's a whole nother discussion.  At the same time, this really strikes me  as being similar to the discussion we had in the 80s  when the fear was Russia was gonna copy American chips  on this and that,  and they were gonna use it in nuclear missiles.  So, I don't think that the answer is for us  to withdraw from the world  and to withdraw our industry from the world.  I think we need to be doubling down  and doing our own development in this area.  That's my take on it, at least.

Start time: 6201.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree that we don't wanna completely withdraw.  A big part of the strategy for the last 50, 60, 70 years  has been the idea that if everybody is engaged  in trade across borders, we become dependent on each other  and we are less likely to go to war.  I mean, that was the whole theory behind the European Union.  On the other hand, one of the downsides  of the way it's been implemented  over the last several decades  is that we ended up with way too much consolidation  with too few companies producing stuff in too few places.  And we got too dependent.  And we ended up with supply chains that became very brittle,  which has led to the situation we've had  over the last couple of years,  where if you have any kind of disruption,  whether it's a pandemic, natural disaster,  geopolitical issues,  you end up disrupting so many things in economies  globally.  And so what we're actually starting to see now  over the last year or so is a lot of companies  moving back, backing away from the consolidation approach  we've had to becoming more diversified  in their supply chains,  getting things from more companies in more locations  so that we're not totally dependent on any one location,  which is actually, I think in the long-term,  gonna be a better thing,  because you don't necessarily wanna have,  be totally self-sufficient.  I mean, it's good to be self-sufficient,  but you wanna have some cross-border trade  to get some dependency,  but you don't wanna be totally dependent  on any one location.

It's estimated in the next few years  that at least half of iPhone production  could be done in Vietnam, India, Brazil,  other countries, not China.  Yeah, that seems a reasonable long-term goal.  Here's an interesting use of AI.  There's a charity called GiveDirectly,  GiveDirectly.org.  The idea is it's an NGO,  but instead of kind of wrapping your gift  into a bunch of administrative costs  and complex charities, you just give directly.  They've been using, they're funded, by the way, by Google,  Google.org, their charitable arm,  as well as USAID and other companies.  One of the things they're doing now  to help in the survivors of Hurricane Ian  is using Google and AI  to figure out where the greatest need is,  and then algorithmically send people money,  which I think is fascinating.  3,500 residents of Collier, Charlotte, and Lee counties  got a push notification on their smartphones  offering them $700 cash, no questions asked,  based on a Google algorithm deployed in partnership  with GiveDirectly.  They used satellite images  to see where the need was greatest.  What do you think?  That's a good use of AI.  I think it's a positive.

Rather than just sending people out into the field,  and trying to find the people that need help,  you could probably do it a lot more quickly,  and hopefully distribute the funds to people,  get money into people's pockets to help them  find some place to stay, get food, whatever,  to help them get through that initial period.

Transcript:  I mean, it's amazing, the transformation.  And you know, you're not the only one.  We have a guy in the chatroom, I don't wanna name names,  but I think the chatroom knows who it is,  who went on our geek cruise.  And I knew he was going on the cruise  and I hadn't seen him in a few months  and I couldn't find him.  And I texted him, I said, where are you?  He said, I'm right next to you, right here.  And he just was, he'd lost 60 pounds on Noom.  He was unrecognizable.  I was like, you're a new man.  He says, it's great, he's kept it off.  My wife Lisa, the same thing.  She didn't look like she needed, as you know,  didn't look like she needed to lose any weight,  but she wanted to lose about 20 pounds, a little less.  She did, I think 18 or 19 pounds.  I've lost 20 pounds on Noom.  It works because it isn't a diet.  There are no restrictions.  There are no foods you can't eat.  It's a psychology first approach.  Noom weight allows you to build more sustainable habits.  Is sustainable so important with weight loss?  Because the worst thing for you  is to lose the weight and gain it back.  With Noom, you get behaviors that last.  3.6 million people have lost weight on Noom.  Now I have to tell you, our weight loss is not typical.  On average, Noom users lose about 15 pounds in 16 weeks,  100 pounds not guaranteed, but I have to say 95%  of customers say Noom weight is a good long-term solution,  and that's what you're looking for.  It's based on scientific principles  like cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT.  So you understand your relationship with food.  Lisa says she was a fog eater, and I am that way too.  I'm an emotional eater, but she was a fog eater.  Well, she would eat and not even know she was eating.  I'm emotional.  I get home and I reduce the stress  by stuffing things in my mouth.  Learning about that has been so valuable.  One of the things we now do is we turn off the TV,  we put away our phones, we sit down to a meal at a table  with napkins, silverware, and we eat thoughtfully,  mindfully, chewing every bite and really enjoying the food.  Sometimes I'll even close my eyes and really taste it.  And it's amazing what a difference that makes  in how you eat.  I'm eating consciously all of a sudden.  Noom doesn't believe in restricting  what you can or can't eat.  So whatever your health goals are,  the flexible non-restrictive program focuses on progress,  not perfection.  And it's not just the lessons, which are great.  You could choose how long those lessons are for you.  It's also a coach, personal coaching.  You choose the level of support.  They have groups as well.  You can participate in them or not, it's up to you.  Five-minute daily checkings, personal coaching,  whatever works for you.  And the thing it's important to understand,  progress is not a straight line.  So Noom, you get off days.  In fact, as you go with Noom, you'll get bonus days.  In fact, my coach would say, okay, bonus day,  eat whatever you want, don't log it, it's fine.  Both Lisa and I love it.  And as you hear from many of our panelists,  they love it too.  Noom has published more than 30 peer-reviewed  scientific articles that inform users, practitioners,  scientists, and the public about their methods  and effectiveness.

I mean, some people say, I wanna support the artists.  That's fine, I wish the artists would sell a print  so I could support them by buying something.  I can hang on my wall, but people buy these  because they think they're gonna be able to resell them  for a lot of money later.  It's an investment and a speculative investment at that.  When the market tanks as it has, all these people,  and you knew it was gonna happen,  are left holding their bored apes.  Just like, well, now what do I do?  There's no market for it.  What are bored apes worth these days?  See, that's the question.  You can say what are they worth  and I can go tell you $300,000,  but is anybody actually paying that?

It's just a stupid drawing of a vaguely racist nature.  I don't understand.

In fact, in this analysis from the news Gazette,  the press Gazette, news publishers have made  nearly $12 million on NFTs since March, 2021.  Yeah, that really casts a lot.

The New York Times raised $560,000 on NFTs  but donated it to charity, I hope, I guess.  Time has earned the most from Web3 initiatives  out of all the publishers.  Here's their marketplace on OpenSea.  Look at the fine things you can buy.  This is crap.  It's crap.  They're selling you crap for thousands of dollars.  I just feel bad for-

You're just being scammed.  It's yet another grift.  Welcome to the land of grift.  All right, well, thank you CNN for shutting it down.  Of course, now all the people who bought those NFTs  are pissed off without the marketplace.  That's it.  All right, one more break.  And then we should talk about whether Apple's  gonna have an event.  I'm curious what you think.  PC shipments, Daniel, have down 20%,  the steepest drop in more than 40 years.  Not a good quarter for PCs, but Mac sales up 40%.

Transcript:  There's an honest response.  Which side?

Start time: 7415.02
End time: 7424.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the problem here is there are actually  three sets of numbers.  There is IDC, Canalysys, and Gartner,  and they all say vastly different things.

Start time: 7424.82
End time: 7430.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because the companies themselves don't say.  Correct.  So you have to figure it out.  And especially Apple's particularly tough.

Start time: 7430.86
End time: 7551.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because Apple does direct sales a lot of times.  So IDC says, yeah, Apple sold 10 million  or shipped 10 million laptops,  which was up from seven million,  so you get 40% growth, which is, that's the headline.  Like, oh my God.  You go to Gartner, they said only 5.8 million were shipped,  which is down from 6.9 million.  So it was a 15.6% drop.  And in between that was Canalysys,  who said it was eight million,  and it was a 1.7% growth.  So they have no idea.  They're making these numbers up.  They have no idea.  Right.  And same with the PC numbers are a little bit closer.  I mean, I think there's definitely a trend here,  which shouldn't be surprising that in general,  laptop sales have dwindled.  And everyone predicted this, right?  Because the pandemic was gonna be a big expansion of it.  But the numbers are still higher than pre-pandemic,  which is the good news.  And now we're entering into, the market has changed, right?  We do have remote workers,  and a lot more people are relying on PCs,  which means within a couple of years,  they're gonna probably, you know, things hold,  and we don't all return to the office in the old ways.  You know, there's gonna be a cycle of companies  buying new laptops and getting into that again,  which benefits enterprise.  In fact, I think it was,  trying to think, oh yeah, it was Canalysys,  who said desktop was actually up 10%.  So desktop sales apparently are doing better  than laptop sales.  So I think the numbers are a little bit all over the place,  but when it comes to the general trends,  they're probably all gonna be going down a little bit.  I think that's not, you know, unheard of,  especially we're entering into a possible recession.  There's inflation right now.  Every company I know of is pulling back,  either on advertising or on purchases,  because everybody's waiting to see what happens.  But they say once the economy, if, you know,  when it recovers, things will probably return  to a better state.  But I think we shouldn't make too much of this,  where macro headwinds right now  aren't very good for laptop sales.

Start time: 7551.80
End time: 7583.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We should also point out that this is a decline in growth.  This is, so they still sold 68 million PCs  in the last three months.  I mean, it's not, it's just that they sold  84 million before, so last year.  So it's still a huge number,  and it's more than before the pandemic.  Right.  I mean, 64 million pieces, or 68 million PCs in three months  is a ton of computers.  People are buying computers like crazy.  It's just not growing maybe as much as it used to.

Start time: 7584.36
End time: 7626.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think the consumer market  will be hit the hardest here, which I think makes sense.  Whereas enterprise is a little bit more resilient,  because they know they're gonna be around  and they need this equipment.  The big question, of course, is does this trend continue  in the sense of do we still need laptops  and PCs and desktop going forward?  Yeah, and I don't see that changing soon.  You know, like this idea was years ago,  we'd have tablets and phones,  we don't need computers anymore.  And now it doesn't seem like the case at all.  We need them all.  Yeah, exactly.  And there's a lot of trends and improvements  in these devices that really make them worth it,  especially when it comes to the cameras  and being able to work remotely and the power.  And of course, the battery efficiency of them  is improving as well.  Yeah.

Start time: 7628.00
End time: 7660.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right.  I think the Apple number there is really interesting.  I mean, Apple, their sales are gonna be up  because the M1 laptops and this entire generation of MacBook  is just absolutely amazing.  Like everyone that owns them, myself included,  thinks it's the best MacBook they've ever owned.  So it's not surprising to me Mac is doing very well.  I'd love to see PC like come up with a way to deliver  that long a battery life and performance  and the stuff they put out because my Razer laptop  has a battery that'll last about 40 minutes.

End time: 7692.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We will talk a little bit about what Apple might be doing  in the future, but I wanna take a little break right now.  I should mention, Daniel, you're right about recession.  And we're seeing this also at Twit  where commitments for next year's ad sales  have basically fallen off the face of the Earth.  Because of the economy, people don't know what's going on.  A lot of companies are not necessarily gonna stop,  but they're just saying, we're putting a hold on it.  Wait and see.  We don't know.

Start time: 7692.68

Start time: 7695.78
End time: 7928.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And the coming World War III in China.  All of this is not good for our economy.  So we're seeing this too.  In fact, it's one of the reasons we mention more than usual.  We've been mentioning Club Twit because it is for us  the key to keeping the operation going,  keeping the lights on, keeping the people we employ employed,  keeping the shows going, keeping the shows growing  if we can.  So I wanna just put in a plug for our Club Twit.  If you're not already a member,  we just got a new corporate member  and we're just really thrilled and grateful.  It is a way of, I think, supporting us,  but also supporting your employees and supporting your brain.  You get ad-free versions of all of the shows.  We thought that was the big pitch.  Turns out, no, not even close.  The big pitch, the big benefit is Discord.  You get access to a very active, very fun Discord  where people are chatting about not just the shows  as they're going on.  We have a This Week in Tech chat going on right now,  just like in our ISC, but about everything else.  I'm always talking and coding with my friends  about programming.  We've got a beer, wine, and cocktail group  pitching new concepts and cocktails.  There is a crypto, DeFi, and NFT group.  There's food, there's gaming, there's hardware,  there's ham radio, there's hacking, there's Linux, and more.  Plus, there are shows in the club  that you don't get in public.  That's where we launched new shows.  That's how This Week in Space happened.  We got together with Rod Pyle from the National Space Society,  Tarek Malek from space.com.  They do a great show called This Week in Space.  The club financed its launch, so to speak,  a little cheaper than a Falcon 9.  They financed the launch, and now that it's off the ground,  we've made it public.  We've got more shows in the club  that we haven't yet made public,  like Micah Sargent's Hands on Mac,  and Paul Therotte's Hands on Windows,  the untitled Linux show,  Stacey's Book Club coming up October 27th.  These are all shows you get as a club member.  I should mention you can buy individual shows ad-free,  including those shows, for $2.99 a month,  but why not just spend the seven bucks,  get access to the Discord, get the ad-free shows,  get the special Twit Plus feed.  I think it's a really worthwhile way to help us,  and I gotta tell you, going forward,  we're looking into the abyss of 2023,  the club we're counting on to keep things going in 2023  as it becomes harder and harder to sell advertising.  I don't just think it's the bad economy.  I think Spotify, Amazon, Microsoft, iHeart,  they're all, Apple, they're all starting to do podcasts,  and they're starting to do exclusive podcasts,  and a lot of the advertising is going to these big companies.  So I have a feeling it's gonna get harder and harder  for an independent network like Twit  to survive without your help.  That's why we started Club Twit, and we appreciate it.  Thank you very much.  Twit.tv slash Club Twit, just a little self-serving plug,  but I really appreciate it.  Now, I also am very grateful for our existing sponsors,  because they're wonderful, and we are very careful.  You might note that we use the products we talk about  in almost every case, we are very careful what we pick.  For example, Mint Mobile.  Sure, I love Ryan Reynolds,  but that's not why I use Mint Mobile.  I use Mint Mobile because I get premium wireless  starting at $15 a month.  Now, what do you pay for your T-Mobile bill, for instance?  Wouldn't it be nice to get the same great 5G service,  unlimited nationwide talk and text,  high-speed data on the nation's largest 5G network  for $15 a month?  And now for the plot twist, there isn't one.

There's not, seriously, Mint Mobile, premium wireless,  starting at $15 a month,  no trapping you into a two-year contract,  no hidden fees.  You open the bill and go, what the heck's this?  There's no luring you in with free subscriptions  or streaming services you'll forget to cancel  and be charged full price for.  There's none of that.  This is clean, this is simple, this is the right way.  For anybody who hates their phone bill,  Mint Mobile offers wireless for just $15 a month.  And of course, you should look at your existing bill,  see how much data you need.  You get four gigabytes a month for $15.  If you need more, you can get more.  They even have an unlimited plan.  But it is the best rate, I guarantee you.  There's no one comes close.  Mint Mobile gives you the best rate  whether you're buying for one or a family.  By the way, all plans come with unlimited talk and text,  high speed data.  Use your own phone if you want.  Mint Mobile will send you a SIM for free.  Or you can buy a phone from Mint Mobile.  I get a great iPhone SE from them.  $15 a month, service $15 a month.  That's $30 a month for a phone and service.  Still a third what I pay the other guys.  Switch to Mint Mobile, get premium wireless service,  just $15 a month.  No unexpected plot twist.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  These guys are really, have now become the disruptors  in this space.  And I think maybe it's a little bit thanks to Ryan Reynolds.  I feel like he's throwing his little bit of his  Deadpool mojo into there.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  You'll make your wallet happy.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  Thank you, Mint Mobile, for your support.  We had a great week this week on twit.  We've got a little mini video.  Why don't you take a look?

And Meta is just a massive company  that has a lot of resources to throw at this.  But Hololens and Magic Leap have also been trying  to identify specific companies that need specific things  and then tailor their devices toward them.  And the Quest Pro seems much more like they just crammed  as much futuristic stuff that they want in their next  headset into this device.  And now they hope that it's good for someone.

Transcript:  Twit, making the world safe for technology.  Yeah, Rod told me that on the scale of their expectations  for the DART program, they moved that asteroid  right at the extreme end of the best case scenario.  It was a huge success.  Which if anybody's worried about an asteroid hitting us,  given Bruce Willis kind of retiring,  I think this is the next best shot that we have,  so to speak, at saving the world.  It was a really interesting week this week,  thanks to Microsoft and Meta.  Will next week be interesting thanks to Apple?  Seems to be a little bit of a debate over,  I think Apple should have an event.  If Microsoft could have an event for those things,  which was interesting, it was similar to Apple's thing,  we're gonna take existing designs,  put more chips, better chips in it, that kind of thing.  I think it's such a great opportunity  to get the attention of the press,  get people listening and talking about it.  It's a big hour long ad, why wouldn't you do it?  But they're apparently, according to Mark Gurman  and others in the know, probably not gonna have an event,  they're just gonna put out a press release.

Start time: 8211.52
End time: 8264.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the only reason Microsoft actually  did an event was because it's its 10th anniversary  of Surface. Oh, okay.  So they kind of wanted to have something there.  And really, the Surface Pro 9 was the only real star  of the show that actually had some interesting things  to talk about it.  Laptop 5 was purely expected,  although the bigger news there was they dropped AMD.  But again, I think that might also have to do  with the fact that they're not anticipating  a lot of laptop sales  So maybe they just didn't wanna have so much inventory  with two chips, it just didn't make sense this time around.  So I think that's probably why Microsoft  actually had the event.  But I can understand with Apple too,  they're just gonna put new processors in there.  And let's be honest, that's usually how Apple does it.  They do even less change than Microsoft does  in its devices. Right.  Well, if you've got a perfect design,

And you could do that for a while,  but eventually it's just gonna be incremental improvements.

Transcript:  Well, that's what I thought.  Maybe they do an event.  So Apple's quarterly results come out the 27th.  Gurman says between now and then probably on the 24th,  they'll release iPad OS 16,  which has been held back along with an announcement  of new iPads.  We're still waiting for the new Mac OS Ventura.  We were waiting because we thought,  well, they'll release it with new Macs.  And they have promised,  they had promised a new Mac Pro this year,  thinking is it probably will announce something  and then offer it for sale next year.  So, we'll find out.  We'll find out.  We passed the opportunity for the 18th.  We would have had some news about it before now.  So now we're gonna look at the 24th or 25th  for an Apple event.  All right, it's time for the Elon Musk segment.  I saved the worst of the best for last,  depending on your point of view.  The information has seen the new proposal Elon has made  to Twitter for ownership.  And according to these documents,  Elon will have absolute control.  He will have sole discretion to decide whether to pursue  the sale of the company, an IPO,  or some other refinancing transaction involving the business.  In other words, the board, no, nothing to say about it.  There won't be any shareholders  because he's buying the company from the shareholders.  So there won't be any shareholders, that's how.

Start time: 8449.40
End time: 8473.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there will be some.  I mean, he's got some other investors.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, investors.  Well, I don't know if the employees will even have shares,  but certainly his other partners,  people like Larry Ellison and Jason Calcan,  and apparently, and Saudi Arabia.  Saudi Arabia, the Saudi sovereign fund.  There'll be a bunch of investors,  but not publicly traded, obviously.

Start time: 8473.32
End time: 8509.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is apparently considering an IPO,  put it back in the public market.  That's one way to try to make your $44 billion back.  By the way, I'm watching Twitter's stock price creep up.  It's over $50 now.  His offer is for 54.20.  As it gets close to that number,  it just means the stock market's starting to believe,  maybe Elon's gonna close.  Musk will have exclusive authority  to appoint and remove members of the board.  See, this should send, if you're an employee at Twitter,  this should send chills up and down your spine.  All minority investors have to agree to vote.  But this is consistent with all his companies, though.

Start time: 8509.26
End time: 8533.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that how he does it?  He has total control.  Yeah, he has total control at Tesla.  I mean, he doesn't, he owns enough of Tesla and SpaceX  that, and he's got, particularly at Tesla,  he's got a very compliant board  that basically just rubber stamps whatever he wants to do.  He is effectively in total control  of all of his enterprises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, can we have an honest discussion  about what this is gonna mean for free speech?  A story that came out last week is,  it was reported that Elon had a talk  with Vladimir Putin.  And Putin.  Exactly before coming out with this poll,  basically advocating,  hey, y'all, do you think Ukraine should forfeit the Crimea  and also have to supply them with water?  Literally coming out directly before that,  he's talking to Putin.  Those are Russian talking points.  That's correct.  Then immediately after that,  they suddenly decide,  oh, well, I think we're gonna cut off access in the Crimea  with Starlink greatly hampering any efforts  to retake that territory.  And now you're talking about Elon Musk being in charge.  And what I believe,  and many in the State Department believe  is our most weaponizable battle space  when it comes to information warfare.  And I have extreme concerns about all of this.  I don't think the sale should go through.  I think for a million different reasons,  I think it's gonna be bad for free speech.  I think it's gonna be bad for women  and black people and gay people.  I think that I'm worried about national security.  And I think if you followed how Elon runs  any of his companies from Tesla to SpaceX,  he pops in with these crazy ideas,  but he's not an engineer.  It doesn't lead to a better product.  There's a lot of hype,  but there are very few promises  that end up being delivered on.  So my concerns here could not be more serious.

Tesla is made in China, right?  And they sell a lot of cars in China.  Right, but the Chinese government owns the land  on which the Shanghai Tesla factory is situated.  And the original loan agreement for that,  the lease agreement, gives them the right  to basically take it back anytime they want.  So, Tesla essentially has to do  whatever the Chinese government wants.

Start time: 8726.70

So really the only question is,  is Tesla just a businessman pretending  to be a free speech advocate,  or is he some sort of bizarre libertarian?  It's kind of hard to figure him out.  When he proposed the peace plan on Twitter,  the outgoing Ukrainian ambassador said, F off.  He said in the most diplomatic way, F off.  At which Elon says, hey, you know what?  We don't wanna pay for those Starlink base stations  in Ukraine.  Wrote a letter to the DOD saying,  it's costing us $400 million over the next year.  Could you pay for this?  And then of course it became-

In a tweet yesterday, he said, okay, the hell with it.  Even though Starlink is still losing money  and other companies are getting billions of taxpayers' dollars,  we'll just continue to fund the Ukraine government for free.  But you're saying that the DOD's already paying

Transcript:  Elon Musk and Kanye West, kinda-  Yeah.  Hand in hand, these billionaires should,  I don't know what, go away.  Billionaires should not be on Twitter.  They shouldn't be on Twitter, that's for sure.  But you know, in a way, I said this about Trump too.  I was glad he was on Twitter,  because we saw his true self.  We see the true Elon Musk.  But it didn't really help, did it?  No, it doesn't help, but at least we know.  We don't have that fantasy anymore  about who Elon Musk is or Kanye West is.  We know, the truth is out there.  And so in a way, I don't, you know,  I think there's a value to having these people be in public.  If I were their advisor, I'd say shut the hell up.  But I know everybody's told Elon to do that 100 times.  He ain't never gonna do it.  He says he talked to Kanye  about the anti-Homelandism thing,  and it's gonna be, you know, he got it, he got it.

Transcript:  I think that he's not as much on the right or the left.  No, I don't think he's political.  I think his text messages that were leaked in this lawsuit  really show he's a billionaire.  It's a reality all of its own, with a concern  and a, honestly, like a victim complex  that is really interesting,  considering the amount of power he wields in this world.  Very troubling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and one of the reasons why he does today,  runs his companies the way he does, in total control,  is he never got over getting pushed out of PayPal.  That was something that, from what I've read  and people I've talked to, has always bothered him,  the way he got pushed out there.  And this is one of the reasons why he's always-  He's always been so interested.  Insisted on maintaining such a large equity stake  in Tesla, in SpaceX in particular,  and then his other ventures.  And he wants to retain control of everything  that he's involved with.  He doesn't want any, the one sort of exception  is at SpaceX, where Gwynne Shotwell, the COO,  runs, basically runs the business day to day,  but she, and that's good.  Is she an engineer, or no?  Or she's a business person?  Yeah, I think she's a, I don't think she's an engineer.  But she does keep Elon at bay somewhat.  Yeah, but she does a good job of running the company.  She knows how to manage the company,  which is something that, for all the capabilities  that Elon's got, I mean, as a marketer, an ideas person,  he's accomplished a lot, but he's a terrible manager.  And if he was just executive chairman or something,  where he was kind of providing the vision for the company  and then letting competent people actually execute on that,  I think all of his companies would probably be  in a lot better shape.  But he always feels like he needs to retain total control.  And you see that, especially with Tesla over the years,  the tweets about sleeping on the floor of the factory  when they were having production problems.  It's like, that's not something a CEO should be doing.  A good CEO hires the right people  to manage those sorts of things,  and then steps back and lets them do their job.  You don't need one individual that does that,  that is going to be hovering in more of a position  be hovering and micromanaging like that.  And I think that's the problem you're gonna see at Twitter,  if he ultimately takes control of Twitter,  is he's going to be micromanaging all kinds of things.  And I think it's just gonna turn into even more of a mess  than it always has been.

Transcript:  When he wants to turn into WeChat,  he says that's the big vision.  This one killer app he calls X.  And some of the ideas actually come from his time at PayPal,  speaking of when it comes to commerce,  that he wants to finally build upon and build into Twitter.  But yes, it's concept, which, if you remember,  Skype even tried this years ago with bots and everything.  A lot of companies have tried this idea  in Western markets to emulate what has happened in China  with building this one app to rule them all.  But really, no one has had that success.  And I don't see how this late in the game,  Twitter is gonna do that, but that's apparently  what he's gonna attempt to do with the service,  which, yeah, it's gonna be almost like what Facebook did,  where it just kept throwing stuff in there,  hoping that people will start to use it,  and it'll be profitable at some point.

Start time: 9161.60
End time: 9255.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm guessing that Elon knows that that's impossible,  that WeChat happened in a climate,  the Chinese government-run climate,  that was very different than anything in the United States.  And he's just saying that because he's trying  to keep the investors quiet and happy.  And in the long run, his hope is an IPO,  if he can trick everybody into investing in Twitter,  will get him out of this,  because he now knows he's stuck paying the $44 billion.  By the way, I want to fully credit Gwen Shotwell.  She has a degree, a Bachelor of Science  in Mechanical Engineering, a Master's of Science  in Applied Mathematics.  She worked at the El Segundo Research Center  of the Aerospace Corporation,  she did technical work on military space research  and development contracts, she worked on STS-39  in thermal analysis, she worked at space systems  engineering and project management positions,  joined SpaceX in 2002, and convinced Elon  that SpaceX needed a dedicated employee  to work on BizDev full-time,  and since has risen to company president.  She is a business person at this point,  with an absolute aerospace background,  so president and CEO of SpaceX.  Probably her number one skill, I would guess,  is keeping Elon at bay, you know.  Although he likes to tweet about how,  yeah, I was just spent all night talking about  how those jets should work on the Falcon.

Transcript:  I think that's the weird, the myth around him is so like,  when you like, if you go into the responses on Twitter  of people who defend him, which is a whole other weird thing,  they all think like he literally invents the stuff.  He designed the rockets.  Yeah, yeah, he's an engineer,  and you're like, he's one of the biggest inventors ever,  like he's never invented anything.  He's told people to invent things,  invested in paid people to do things.

Transcript:  I also think something I really appreciate about Elon,  and this will probably be the only nice thing I say on this episode today,  but I think something I respect about him  is he is presenting an idealistic version of the future  that really is straight from a 50s science fiction novel.  Like he's pushing for automated...  He's Tom Swift. He's not.  Automated, yeah.  He's pushing for automated androids who will do work around the house,  self-driving cars, rockets that go to the moon, you know,  like all these things, it really is amazing what he's pushing for.  I think that his male, like very male younger supporters,  they see that and they feel like they're in on this story  where they can create their own reality.  And I think you have that there.  And then I think you have the press over here  that bought it for like the first five years,  but now there's a lot more skepticism.  So when Elon comes out and says like he did at the AI Tesla event,  oh, well, this robot can't stand up on its own now,  but we'll be walking in a week.  Well, maybe five years ago, the press would have believed him on that.  Today, I don't think anyone does.  And I think that's why you have these competing realities.  Yeah.

I don't know about you.  I am looking at Netflix thinking, is this worth $14.99 a month?  Netflix knows that's that's kind of the thought everybody's going through right now.  There is nothing on Netflix that is as commanding  as some of their previous efforts like Stranger Things, The Queen's Gambit, The Crown.  So they are looking at ad supported Netflix.  They've announced it'll be six dollars ninety nine cents a month launching next month.  Netflix basic will be available in 12 countries.  So now you have three choices.  Quit Netflix, keep it at the high price and hope something good comes on  or or six ninety nine a month and watching ads.

Transcript:  You know, we were actually getting ready to cancel Netflix.  And then I switched to a different T-Mobile plan that was going to save me some money.  Now, now that I'm old enough to get the silver plan. Oh, good.  Yeah. It was the 55 plus Max plan from T-Mobile.  So now we get Netflix for free.  No, you don't get Netflix for free, unfortunately.  Well, I mean, they're actually the reason why I stuck with T-Mobile,  because I was actually thinking about switching away is because they offer a version  of the Google one plan that still has unlimited Google photos.  Original, original resolution.  So for 15 bucks a month, I get two terabytes of storage  plus unlimited Google photo storage on top of that.

Right.  And Netflix for, you know, for obvious reasons.  But all the other streaming services, I mean, we quit cable TV six, seven years ago  and all the other streaming services, we turn them on and off every few months,  depending on what we're watching.

So I'm sitting there on my phone in the afternoon and just doing my job.  And my phone starts blowing up.  And they're like, do you know, Alex Jones is talking about you?  What? At the Alex Jones trial.  And I'm like, what? What?  What's going on?  So I go and I turn on court TV and I go back and I get the clip.  You know, I see the Alex, the Sandy Hook families  have brought up Alex Jones's lawsuit against me  as part of the prosecution of their case.  So just to give a little bit of background on this.

Transcript:  He said I did. I. Congratulations.  So the Connecticut Post put out an article  talking about the factual events that happened.  This is a reputable local paper talking about how when  Alex Jones turned over a bunch of information for discovery  to the Sandy Hook parents, there was a bunch of child porn in that.  So I saw that story.  And I accurately quote the Connecticut Post.  I put none of my own opinion on that.  And I linked to the story below.  Very clear. This is reportage.  Just as neutral as I could possibly be.  And Alex Jones, his lawyer threatens me on Twitter and goes,  I'm going to sue you if you don't take that down.  Wow. Go and I look at that tweet.  I'm like, there's nothing there they could possibly sue me for.  I mean, I'm just quoting.  I'm linking to a reputable paper and quoting a story.  So he sues me. And, you know, one story like the lawsuit itself  is not a mystery to me why Alex Jones has lost so much in court  because the court case is riddled with typos.  It makes no sense.

Transcript:  The young Turks and and Andrew, who was a journalist for BuzzFeed at the time.  So eventually they're just forced to drop the entire suit  because it makes absolutely no sense.  Right. Here's where it gets interesting.  By the way, did it cost you a penny?  Nothing. I have a pro bono lawyer that looked at this and said,  I would love to represent you.  This is third.  And if he kept the case up, we would have brought it to Massachusetts,  where I would have done anti slap and sued him for triple damages.  Awesome. He had no leg to stand on.  So the Sandy Hook families looked at this and they're going, OK.  So in our court case, Alex Jones is saying, you know, free speech.  I need to be able to claim this.  Yeah, I need to be able to report on things.  And then they try to and then they bring up this court case,  which the lawyers work so hard to suppress because they know it destroys  their defense because Alex Jones wants free speech for himself.  But for people like me.  To be able to put my opinion out there, he tried to shut me down.  So obviously, this was a very small variable in a very well argued legal case.  But I had a small role to play in the billion dollar judgment against Alex Jones,  which I am very proud of.

Transcript:  Yeah. No, I love Windows 11.  I don't I think it's fine. Yeah. Yeah.  Nothing wrong with Windows 11.  Thank you, Sam Brianna.  Daniel, you guys are great.  Thanks to all of you for joining us.  If you want to watch live, we do Twitter every Sunday afternoon,  2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern, 2100 UTC.  Right after the Tech Guys show, you can watch us at live dot twit dot TV.  If you're watching live chat with us on our IRC,  I just found out that IRC turned 34 years old yesterday.  I thought it was older than that, to be honest with you,  because we started using IRC just four years later in 1992.  So we've been using IRC for 30 years of those 34 years.  That's kind of amazing.  Love that IRC, IRC dot twit dot TV.  Of course, you also can chat if you're a club member in our discord.  After the fact, you can get shows on demand at twit dot TV.  There's a YouTube channel dedicated to this week in tech.  In fact, all of our shows have their own YouTube channel, which is nice.  Great way to share little clips.  If you want to do that, YouTube's really good for that.  And of course, the easiest, best way to get the show,  any of our shows, I would say, is to get it through a podcast client.  Pocket Cast is very popular, Apple's podcast, Google podcasts,  because then it gets downloaded automatically.  The minute we finished cleaning it up, editing it, taking out the swear words.  And if your podcast client, as many do, allows for reviews,  please leave us a five star review.  The one disadvantage of being the longest running tech podcast in the world  since 2005, almost 18 years now, is that people forget that that you're around.  I get email all the time said, I thought you were dead.  So tell tell the world Leo's not dead.  Tweet lives on.  Leave us a good review and maybe somebody will discover it.  Thanks for joining us, everybody.  We'll see you next time. Another twit is in the clan.  Oh, bye. Bye. Bye. Bye. Bye.
