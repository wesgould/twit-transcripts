Santa Fe.  Santa Fe.  New Mexico.  Thank you.  Exactly right.  Great to have you. He's the creator of the Ed Bott Report on ZDNet.  Actually, some other guy created it.  But once they realized it was called the Ed Bott Report, they said, we better get Bott.  Great to have you, Ed.  Long time friend going back to the early days of Dvorak on computers in the early 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no fingers left behind. I like that.  So it is true, isn't it? I saw this on Slashdot. The Holy Father wrote a line of code with code.org.

Start time: 236.18
End time: 266.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wasn't the most advanced line of code ever?  No, but it did something, which is good.  It did something. It absolutely did something.  We've been pushing this more and more because this Pope is actually amenable to using things from the modern world.  He was the first Pope to really use Twitter. He was the first Pope to really use social media.  He actually uses our app, the app that comes out of our office, Click to Pray.  Click to Pray?  Click to Pray. That's actually a Jesuit thing.  I feel like a movie that took place in Indonesia.

Transcript:  Three young students and Hadi Partovi, who is the head of code.org.  Here's the line of code that the Pope Francis wrote.  Set screen, parenthesis, for the poor, for the peace, end quote, parenthesis.  He didn't forget his semicolon. When he executed it, it showed that text on a commemorative plaque bearing the statement,  Computer science empowers young people to create peace in their communities.  Everyone should learn how to harness technology to use their creative power.  Por la paz.

End time: 386.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would have been really funny. Had he done that, I think the world would have sat up and taken notice.  The world did set up and take notice earlier today when the attorney general sent a letter to Congress summarizing the Mueller reports conclusions.  And I thought the letter was very interesting.  It did acknowledge that, in fact, the Russians had attempted to.  This was what the Mueller investigation was about, is about Russian influence in the election.  They indicted a great number of Russian nationals along with Trump's campaign chairman.  But for other problems, other things.  Or no, was he indicted? Yeah, he was indicted by the Mueller investigation.  But most importantly, according to Attorney General Barr, there is no evidence of the Trump organization, the Trump campaign or the president himself in in any way working with the Russians in the.  They say no evidence.

Start time: 386.28
End time: 407.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me read you the letter because it's a little complicated.  The evidence isn't enough to actually indict on.  No, that was for the obstruction charge, Larry.  Well, no, that's a different story.  But I'm just saying, I don't know if he said no evidence.  So the words there. Yeah, it's actually there's no those of you listening.  Yeah, we're doing this literally as we go.

Start time: 407.56
End time: 446.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So I think a very complete and I think everybody would agree a very thorough investigation over almost two years by Robert Mueller.  As we know, the report does not.  And this is in the attorney general Barr's words does not recommend any further indictments.  There are no sealed indictments yet to be made public.  Barr said that the special counsel's investigation did not find did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with Russia in its efforts to influence the 2016 presidential election.  There was no well in Trump's words, no collusion, although that's not what they found.

Start time: 447.44
End time: 448.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I wonder how they explain the Trump Tower meeting.

Start time: 449.77
End time: 528.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, well, they did. They don't.  And, you know, this is not the full report.  This is a summary that the attorney general sent to Congress, and I'm sure we'll see more.  The special counsel did not draw a conclusion one way or another.  Again, I'm continuing to quote Barr as to whether the examined conduct constituted obstruction.  So they didn't draw a conclusion one way or the other.  He did not exonerate. He specifically said, yeah, this special counsel states that quote, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it does not exonerate him.  However, I think it's pretty clear that the report lets Trump and his campaign off the hook completely and definitely says there was an attempt to influence the election by the Internet Research Agency, the Russian Troll Farm and the Russian government.  But that the Trump administration and the Trump campaign had nothing to do with that.  He said, despite many attempts by the Russians to get in touch, they didn't apparently get in touch.  So I think that's a big deal.  And I think it has something to do with technology, because, of course, it was Facebook that was used.  In fact, honestly, the one company that's not let off the hook in this case is Facebook.  They don't mention Facebook in the Mueller report.

Start time: 528.06
End time: 531.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they might. They don't mention the summary.  In the summary. But you're right. It probably will mention.

Start time: 532.00
End time: 532.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We haven't read the report.

Start time: 533.16
End time: 571.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, this is an important inflection point, because now everyone should reset and listen.  If you've got celebrities, if you've got personalities either saying that this 100 percent exonerates the Trump administration and they should forever put this issue to bed.  Don't listen to them.  It doesn't do that either.  On the other side, if you have people were saying, no, no, no, you have to read between the lines and this is absolutely a conviction and this is an indictment of the Trump administration.  Stop listening to them.  You need to start listening to the centrist position.  So we're actually going to take what's released of the Mueller report.  And hopefully, because it completely exonerates the president of the United States, it will be released in its entirety because there's a lot more.  There will be and we'll see more.  There's so much more out of that report.

Start time: 571.54
End time: 599.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the quote from the bar letter.  The special counsel did not find that the Trump campaign or anyone associated with it conspired or coordinated with the Russian government in these efforts, the efforts to influence the election and hack, by the way, the Clinton campaign, the Democratic Party,  despite multiple offers from Russian affiliated officials, individuals, I should say, to assist the Trump campaign.  So that's a that is a very unequivocal note is worth reading.

Start time: 600.00
End time: 600.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Start time: 601.00
End time: 631.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, Leo, in assessing the footnote right below and assessing potential conspiracy charges, the special counsel also considered whether members of the Trump campaign coordinated with Russian election interference activities.  We know that Manafort is accused of offering polling data to a Russian oligarch.  The special counsel defined coordination as an agreement tacit or express between the Trump campaign and the Russian government on election interference.  So because there was no tacit or implicit agreement.

Start time: 632.12
End time: 641.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he was looking for tit for tat.  And we don't have that.  There is there is no express agreement that the Mueller investigation.  And that frankly doesn't surprise me.  If you do this, I will do that.  That doesn't surprise me.

Start time: 642.00
End time: 649.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Anyway, big, big, big news.  And I'm sure there'll be a lot more to report.  And but I thought we just passed.

Start time: 649.14
End time: 670.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The interesting thing is what how is this going to affect the politics?  Both the potential for impeachment, the hearings that are likely to come up or maybe not.  I mean, I think it's going to be a very interesting political the next few weeks.  The Democrats have got to really sort of rethink their strategy.  In terms of how they go after the president.  There's still plenty of reasons that they can go after the president.  But I think they have to rethink how they go about doing it.

Start time: 671.40
End time: 698.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if you look at the indictments, the indictments that had to do with this all were of Russian nationals.  The special counsel, again, from the bar letter, found that the Russian government  actors successfully hacked into computers and obtained emails from persons affiliated  with the Clinton campaign and Democratic Party organizations and publicly disseminated  those materials through various intermediaries, including WikiLeaks.  And of course, the special counsel brought indictments against a number of Russian military  officers.  It was not a witch hunt because of that.

Start time: 699.72
End time: 735.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The way I read it is there's one uncontrovertible fact that you can take from this summary release,  which is Mother did his job and he did it with integrity.  There was not a single leak out of out of him.  There wasn't a single saber rattle out of his camp.  This was not a witch hunt.  This was not any of the things that it was accused of being.  This was a person who was tasked with the job and he did it to the fullest of his abilities.  So let's put that away because that's also been a huge contention over the last two years.  This this was an investigation that was asked of a man of great honor who has done a great  service for this country and he just did it again.  OK, what's next?

Start time: 736.70
End time: 749.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we know that there's another election coming up in 2020 and that the Russians will  probably not be slowed down by this report in any way.  It will.  We'll all start all over again if it hasn't already started all over.

Start time: 750.04
End time: 779.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's that's the technological side.  That's the technological technology story for us, which is we've spent two years looking at this  and we are no more prepared for information warfare than we were in the 2016 election.  And what are we doing other than holding a hearing every once in a while and bringing a CEO to task  for some privacy invasion?  We should actually be looking at, well, how is this actually affecting the election process?  And it's too late for the next election.  You know, we've only got two years.  We're already within the cycle.  We should have been looking at this two years ago.

Start time: 781.18
End time: 825.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Incidentally, the news lately has been that Facebook did, in fact, talk to Cambridge Analytica  and knew what they were up to long before they talked about it publicly.  Facebook staff, according to the BBC, flagged Cambridge Analytica fears earlier than thought  three months earlier than thought, according to U.S. court documents.  That was in September 2015, more than a year before the election.  Facebook said it discovered this in December 2015, three months later.  And there was even evidence that a Facebook board member had met with Chris Whittle,  who was the whistleblower at Cambridge Analytica in that time frame.  So somebody who is not off the hook by any means is Facebook.  And I think we're going to hear a lot more about that.

Start time: 826.20
End time: 858.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's interesting. I was actually at the event when Facebook announced their app ecosystem.  And if you don't believe me, you can Google this because Kara Swisher actually documented this.  I asked Zuckerberg, aren't you worried that if you open up your ecosystem to independent developers  that there could be some kind of a security breach?  And this was back, I think, in 2010.  And he didn't have a good answer.  He really didn't have an answer to an obvious question, which, you know,  what happens if you open it up to the world?  And Cambridge Analytica certainly proved that.

Start time: 860.04
End time: 874.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Chris Wiley, not Whittle. Chris Whittle is somebody else.  Chris Wiley is the Facebook, I'm sorry, the Cambridge Analytica whistleblower who we now know met with some Facebook investors.

Start time: 875.68
End time: 912.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, I think there was one other development this week that is probably worth noting,  which was that DARPA, the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, I believe that is short for,  released, they're developing a new voting system.  Yeah, wasn't that interesting?  An open source voting system.  Online voting? Yeah.  Well, it's an open source voting system.  And the fact that it's not being done by a for-profit company is, and that it's open source, is, those are both good things.

Start time: 912.34
End time: 935.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not online. I should say it's electronic voting.  But it is intended that companies like Diebold will adapt, adopt this system.  I don't know if they will.  But it does have a paper trail, which is something that computer scientists and security experts have long said has to be included in any voting system.  DARPA has spent a lot of time and money on this.  We talked about it on Security Now.

Start time: 936.58
End time: 941.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, according to the start reading, they spent $10 million, which by government standards, is practically nothing.  I guess it's not a lot. Yeah.

Start time: 942.02
End time: 974.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds like a lot to me.  And one of the things they're going to do is they're going to bring voting machines with this new system to DEF CON, the Hacker Conference.  They have that voting village where they bring voting machines.  And of course, all of the voting machines in current use ended up getting hacked last year.  They're going to be publishing source code online, bring prototypes of the system to voting village this summer and next,  so that hackers and researchers will not only be able to freely examine the systems,  but they'll also be able to conduct pen tests to try to break into it, which is great.

Start time: 975.48
End time: 1016.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was a little skeptical about it until I actually started digging into it.  And I realized the company that's been contracted to do this research, they're not trying to make a product.  They will not bring a product to market that will be sold.  They're making the reference for it.  And that's what I actually really like.  Especially the fact that they're willing to bring it to DEF CON.  That's what generates best practices.  Things like what we discovered last year from the voting machines that we disassembled,  where you have hard-coded credentials in firmware.  You have swappable SD cards that could actually allow you to run a completely different operating system on the hardware.  Little things like that would never have passed peer review.  Well, if you have a company that's willing to bring it to DEF CON, where they know people will break it,  that inspires a lot of confidence.

Start time: 1017.74
End time: 1035.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're going to do two basic voting machine types.  The first will be a ballot marking device that uses a touch screen so that voters can make their selections.  That system won't tabulate the votes, but will print out a paper ballot so that voters can review them  before depositing them into an optical scan machine.

Start time: 1036.00
End time: 1040.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there any explanation of why DARPA?  Are they a defense?

Start time: 1041.04
End time: 1065.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's exactly the kind of thing that DARPA should be doing, right?  It's advanced research.  The optical scan system will print a receipt with a cryptographic representation of the voter's choice.  After the election, the cryptographic values for all ballots will be published online.  So you can go as a voter and verify that your ballot's there and that the vote was correctly tabulated.

Start time: 1065.20
End time: 1071.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Open source, verifiable, and transparent.  I think this is great.  That's what we've been asking for.

Start time: 1071.30
End time: 1087.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The second system is an optical scan system that reads paper ballots.  This is what we do in California. We get a paper ballot.  We mark it by hand, kind of one of those punch cards you've seen.  And that system is going to come to DEF CON next year.  No hanging chads.  No hanging chads anywhere.

Start time: 1087.22
End time: 1094.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me ask the panel, how many of you voted at a polling place this last election?  Oh, I did.  Oh, you did?

Start time: 1095.27
End time: 1098.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good for you, Ed.  I dropped off my absentee ballot at the polling place.

Start time: 1098.10
End time: 1100.96

Start time: 1101.58

Transcript:  I've been absentee ballot for the last, what, seven elections.  I really like going in.

Start time: 1107.54
End time: 1112.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what I do is I mark it at home at my leisure.  And then I go to the polling place.

Start time: 1112.06
End time: 1123.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do that. And just in case I'm traveling and for some reason I want to make sure.  But if I can go to the polling place, I love going there.  I do too.  I love what I used to consider old people, but now they're my age.  They are.  I know.

Start time: 1124.89
End time: 1128.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In New Mexico, we have early voting for almost a month before the election.  So although we can do ballot by mail or we can fill them out and drop them off at the county clerk's office,  or you can fill them out and drop them off at one of the early voting places.  But there's a half a dozen voting, early voting locations around town that you can go to.  So it's pretty convenient.  We just went and voted and then went and had breakfast at one of our favorite restaurants around the corner.  So it became a social thing.  We brought a few friends with us.

Start time: 1166.48
End time: 1173.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello Alto has a ballot drop off at the library.  It kind of looks like big mailboxes.  You just put your ballot right there at the library.  That's secure.  Yeah.

Start time: 1174.04
End time: 1208.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  To answer your question, actually, I'm reading further at Motherboard.  The voting system grew out of a larger program focused on developing generally secure hardware.  The program called System Security Integrated Through Hardware or Firmware or SIF was launched in 2017.  It's apparently hard to do secure hardware.  And so it was aimed at developing secure hardware and design tools to build that hardware so that hardware would be impervious to most of the software attacks prevalent today.  And there's of course-  Sith?  Sith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a blender, which as far as I can tell is very secure.  It's from the Sith?  No, it's very secure.  No internet connection.

Start time: 1224.48
End time: 1253.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently, this is the quote from Sith, software has been the way people try to solve the problems because software is adaptable.  There are some hardware security solutions already, but they don't go far enough and require too much power and performance.  We want to fix this in hardware and then no matter what software vulnerabilities you have, attackers couldn't exploit them.  The problem is most hardware is gullible.  Did you know that?  Most hardware has no way of distinguishing between acceptable and unacceptable behavior.

Transcript:  And that brings us to Pwn to Own.  The Pwn to Own week was a big one.  A lot of hacking going on.  Pretty much everything was cracked.  And a lot of it by one team, the fluoroacetate team, Amat Kama and Richard Ju, who earned I think close to $400,000 out of the $450,000 purse.  Let's see, the Pwn to Own, you know this event that happens in Vancouver every year as part of CanSec West.  The contest started, I love this play by play.  The contest started with a team of fluoroacetate talking in the Apple Safari web browser.  They successfully exploited the browser and escaped the sandbox by using an integer overflow in the browser and a heap overflow to escape the sandbox.  That earned them $55,000.  These guys hoard exploits all year long because they're going to make enough money in three days in Vancouver to fund the rest of the year.  Then they came back to target the Oracle Virtual Box in the virtualization category.  Their first attempt failed, but the second attempt successfully used integer overflow in a race condition to escalate from the virtual client to pop calc at medium integrity.  Whatever that means.  It wasn't the race condition that caused their failed first attempt.  Their memory leak was working, but their code execution failed.  Everything aligned in the second attempt.  Another $35,000 and three more.  Master of Pwn points.

Transcript:  So do you really want to know what pop calc means?  Yeah, what?  Because I can tell you.  What?  Well, the idea is that if you have successfully breached the security on somebody's remote machine, you're able to execute arbitrary code on there.  And the typical way that you prove you executed code on their machine.  You open the calculator.  Is to cause the calculator app to open on their machine.  It pops the calc.  Pop calc.

Transcript:  Floroacetate earned 70 grand and seven points for getting out of the VMware workstation.  So in one day, two guys, $160,000.  Not bad.  And then Phoenix and QWERTY targeted Apple Safari.  Now, there was nobody broken OS 10, but able to get into Safari is probably good enough.  With a kernel elevation, they demonstrated a complete system compromise simply by creating a malicious website  and browsing to it, triggering adjust in time, JIT bug, followed by a heap out of bounds read,  and then pivoted from root to kernel via time of check, time of use bug, TOCTOU to those in the know.  Unfortunately, it was only a partial win since Apple already knew one of the bugs used in the demo.  Well, that should be...  Whomp, whomp.  I'm sorry.  So they got 45 grand.  That was just day one of pwn to own.  Firefox also pwned and yes, Tesla was pwned.  But the pwnage...  The shiny red one.  It was a Model 3.  But they gave them the car.  They gave them the Tesla?

Transcript:  That's great.  In fact, that's why these companies are happy to help pwn to own.  It's worth the cost of a Tesla to get to know where your vulnerability is.  Although I've always worried a little bit, Ed, about the fact that these guys are finding these exploits and sitting on them until the next pwn to own.

Start time: 1586.26
End time: 1632.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's certainly preferable to the alternative, which is to find those exploits, sit on them and then sell them to a nation state that will use them or to one of the variety of hacking companies that exist to serve the needs of usually authoritarian states.  Egypt has been known to buy a lot of these exploits, for example.  To spy on their own people.  So holding on to these things to cash them in at a contest like this is just a hell of a lot better than holding on to them so that you can sell them to someone who's going to use them maliciously.

Transcript:  One comment that's worth making on the whole virtualization focus there.  It's sort of a red herring to think about these as just virtual box and VMware as applications that run on a machine.  The real thing that they're looking for is the hypervisor that is increasingly a part of the security infrastructure of any modern computing device.  The idea is that the hypervisor is the sort of very low layer of computing that isolates a process that's supposed to be secure from your regular desktop processes that you're using.  So the hypervisor is a really core part of modern security design.  And so targeting those is a really effective way of finding the most serious security flaws.

Start time: 1701.08
End time: 1707.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And hypervisor is built into all windows, right?  I mean, this is into into Windows 10 now.

Start time: 1707.12
End time: 1747.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.  And it's a key part of features like the with the new version of Windows that's coming out in the next few weeks.  There's a new feature called Windows Sandbox that is based on the hypervisor.  There's there's a there's an edge application guard feature that allows you to run a completely secure browser session that is managed by the hypervisor.  And so it's it should be completely isolated from the rest of your computing environment.  And there's even new application guard extensions for Chrome and Firefox.  I recall reading I haven't been able to test those.

Start time: 1748.18
End time: 1759.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On that on that edge technology, it doesn't take away the need for VPN in terms of somebody in the middle accessing what you're typing, does it?  No, no, no. It's a this is a completely separate thing.

Start time: 1760.16
End time: 1783.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a basically a way to run an isolated browser session so that, for example, if one of the browser exploits that they came up with here, if they were able to attack if you opened that malicious website in in this scene,  in this secure browser, it wouldn't be able to jump into your system because it's protected by the hypervisor.

Start time: 1783.06
End time: 1790.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. At least it should be, except for the out of bounds exploit allows you to execute outside of the memory that particular virtual.  That brings us to day two of Pondone.

Transcript:  Arthur Kirkus of Exodus Intelligence targeting Microsoft Edge used a double free bug in the renderer, followed by a logic bug to bypass the sandbox.  And that got him $50,000. So, of course, that good news is that'll be fixed.

End time: 1843.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a different sandbox. Oh, OK.  That's not the same. That's the edge sandbox.  That's not the that's not the Windows sandbox feature that hasn't been released yet.  That's the that's the browser sandbox. That's a part of every modern browser that prevents a low integrity process from from jumping to a high integrity process.  You're basically it's you know, nothing is supposed to be able to get out of the browser and into the file system or memory or whatever.  But that's a that's a browser design thing and something different from what I was just talking about.  Got it. Now, you see, I love these events because I'd love to see.

Transcript:  But there's a problem. And the problem is that while these are fascinating to see researchers at the top of their game do things with security features that we never thought they could.  That's not where the biggest threats coming from.  The biggest threat on the edge of the Internet are embedded devices, none of which will ever be patched.  And I say I say that knowing that, you know, some will obviously.  But you've got eight incredible tens, hundreds of millions of devices that are currently on the Internet that are running old firmware that we have known exploits for.  And they will never, ever be patched. And as an attacker, that's where I would be focusing.  I don't need a zero debug in order to cause damage on the Internet.  I just need 10 million webcams that have never changed from their default credentials in the last Pondone in Tokyo in November.

Zerodium is one that maybe is a little sketch, but Hacker One is a little bit more benign  because they end up, I'm pretty sure, giving the exploits to the companies that create  the software for fixing.  They had a, they were the ones that publicized this young guy, young kid from Argentina.  It's like 19 years old, first hacker to make a million dollars in one year with exploits.

You can choose from curated boxes, including a mix of high quality beef,  chicken and pork or customize your own box.

Transcript:  And so the meat, I don't know if you've ever had a grass finished meat, but it is it's it's what meat used to taste like before factory farming.  Meat is frozen at the peak of freshness.  So it comes to you frozen in an individual vacuum packed biodegradable packaging.  I really like how responsible they are with the packaging.  Each box is shipped to the carefully calculated amount of dry ice.  So it will be we had a lot of fun with the dry ice when it came, by the way.  So it'll be frozen. And it was it was frozen solid.  There was no question about that after it reaches your doorstep.  Of course, if there's any problem, you can immediately call butcher box and they'll and they'll trade for you.  Grass fed grass finished beef, free range organic chicken, the pork.  I can also sing its praises because I make a Friday night is a pork night at the LaPorte household.  I usually will make a a kind of I call them because the kid won't eat it unless I talk about vener schnitzel.  But I pound out the pork. I bread it and fry it.  And it's delicious. And it's so much better with a pork from butcher box because again, it's heritage bread pork.  So it's like meat used to taste.  Butcher box believes in a healthier food system where everyone has access to meat the way nature intended.  No antibiotics, no hormones, humanely raised.  You'll cook with peace of mind knowing you're eating healthy, high quality meat.  And look at that bacon. You had me at bacon.  Build your own box. Choose exactly how much you want for the things you love or let them curate it so you get something new every time.  Choose your delivery frequency.  And of course, there's always recipe cards inside to help you cook quality meals.  Lots of tips. We're going to get you $20 off your first box.  My mouth is watering and two pounds of ground beef a month for the life of your membership.  Taco Tuesday never had it so good for free.  20.

And I've never felt it.  August, I killed my Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Tumblr accounts.  And it was the greatest thing I've ever done.  Not that I actually go out and meet people.  I just stay home.  But honestly, I think I was feeling ill from social media.  That the you know, our friend Trey Radcliffe has just written a new book about the malign influence of social influencers on Instagram.  When Instagram first came out, Trey, who's a great photographer, said this is changing.  It's like all of us.  We get these very optimistic looks at what we think is happening.  And then the truth sets in.  He thought Instagram was going to change people's vocabulary.  That the generation was going to grow up with a visual vocabulary instead of a verbal vocabulary.  That people would get used to imagery and expressing themselves through imagery.  And that was so exciting.  And it's been ruined by people selling, you know, models selling sport tea.  And it's really anyway.  So this is an interesting change.

But I mean, I was so optimistic for so long, all the way through the 80s and 90s and the early part of the 2000s.  I just thought this was such a wonderful thing.  And I still see the positive.  But I don't think many of us really fully appreciated the negative of overuse of technology until the last couple of years.

Transcript:  You know, one of the things that was just written in the chat room from Alberto Guru is, oh, this is a first world problem.  But it really isn't.  It really, really isn't.  In fact, this took hold in a lot of what we would call third world countries before it took hold in advanced countries.  Because electronic communications were actually more advanced in parts of Africa before.  They became completely ubiquitous and say the West.  So this idea of being able to communicate, having your primary channel of communication not be face to face is not limited to social media.  Social media really exacerbates it.  But there's something that we need to do in order to look at what kind of relationships do we actually want.  I can communicate, but too often I conflict communication with relationship.  And they're not the same.

Rich people have been doing this forever.  How many buildings on campuses and I'm including some of our universities like Georgetown, Boston College are named after rich benefactors who had legacy children who came through because, well, the building is named after mom or dad.

I think this is probably accurate that this is going to be the day we look back on that Apple pivoted from being a hardware company to being a services company.  At least that is their goal.  You agree, Ed?

Start time: 3355.44
End time: 3385.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I think that's it's probably a good line, a good line of demarcation to have here.  I think what punctuates that is the fact that they announced three products last week on Twitter that normally would have been the kind of products that would have gotten five to ten minutes each on stage at next week's event.  The new iPad, the new line of iPads and new IMAX.  New IMAX.  One other.

Start time: 3388.12
End time: 3401.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they also reduced the price on the extra RAM on an IMAX Pro.  But you're exactly right.  They didn't do these hardware announcements in public.  They just slipped them in.  They've done that before.  The other one was the AirPods.

Start time: 3401.22
End time: 3447.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, the AirPods, which I ordered.  Yeah, the new AirPods.  And so the idea, they've been clearly focusing on the revenue that comes from services from monetizing their base of I think it's 1.4 billion Apple branded devices that are out there.  And, you know, that's a if you can if you can get 10, 15, 20 bucks a year out of each one of those devices, that's not a lot for the owners of those devices.  But that's a tremendous amount of money for for Apple.  And so the idea if now if you go from ten dollars on average to twenty dollars on average, you've just you know, you're up to twenty billion dollars a year in revenue.  And that's staggering.

Start time: 3448.91
End time: 3469.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you're actually probably talking closer to ten dollars a month.  I mean, you know, the revenue potential, if you think about how often do the average person buy a device, probably a computer every three or four years, a phone maybe every two years.  If you can get somebody to subscribe and have a steady stream of revenue, that that's, you know, the difference between selling a razor and selling razor blades.

Start time: 3470.00
End time: 3509.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right, right, right.  The point that I was making, though, is that in a lot of cases, Apple's share of that is only 30 percent.  Right.  And there are a significant there.  I think there are a significant number.  I mean, there's a bell curve.  Right.  Of of the distribution of services income from individual owners.  There are certainly people who, you know, they buy an app every once in a while and that's it.  They don't spend another dime.  On the other hand, there are people who, you know, replace their phone every year and spend one hundred dollars a month on Apple services.  So you get those in there.  But but I'm just talking about the share of revenue that Apple gets to keep.

Start time: 3511.10
End time: 3537.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Revenue in the service business last year, 40 billion dollars.  That's a 33 percent increase year over year, and it's 15 percent of the total revenue.  And I'm sure that it will increase each year.  And it won't be long before it's more than half of the company's revenue, especially since iPhone sales and Mac sales have slowed.  iPad sales have slowed.  They need to do this.  People aren't buying new phones, new computers every two years.  But this is a hard pivot.

Start time: 3538.00
End time: 3558.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a very hard pivot.  I mean, Microsoft made this pivot fantastically successful.  They did, didn't they?  They did. I mean, over the over the past five years, their stock has outpaced Apple by a large margin because they made the commitment to services.  But they already had the infrastructure in there.  They already had Azure.  They already had three sixty five.  And so when they made that pivot, it made sense.  Now, they had a cash cow and dynamics.

Start time: 3559.38
End time: 3622.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the entire Microsoft ecosystem was set for argue that Microsoft on Microsoft had its strengths in that kind of business cloud.  But Apple has a strength that they can base this on, which is in content, consumer content sales.  They've got apps.  They've got music.  What they're going to launch tomorrow, we're pretty sure, is a new subscription program, which will include magazines and newspapers, according to somebody.  The Wall Street Journal will be in that bundle, but not The New York Times or The Washington Post and a TV product that initially won't actually make them much money because it'll just be repackaging content from other people.  But ultimately has the potential to make money because they're making a lot of original content.  And there's also a rumor.  I don't know if this is true.  It's kind of a lesser rumor that they're going to do a game subscription service that will include paid games and that they will pay the game publisher a fee for every minute played so that the Apple will collect a certain amount of money and then distribute it according to which games you play the most.

Start time: 3622.22
End time: 3627.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that gives Apple absolutely a leg up in services.  This is something they already do.  They're terrible.

Start time: 3628.32
End time: 3633.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Frankly, Apple's terrible at cloud services.  And so that's it's smart of them to focus on content.

Start time: 3633.12
End time: 3649.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's smart, but the money that where they actually want the money in services, it's not in the consumer side.  It's on the enterprise side.  You see, that's why you don't want to compete against Amazon, Microsoft and Google.  But that's what the money is.  You have to compete against them if you want that service money.  I don't think Apple's ever going to be big in the enterprise.

Transcript:  And one of the things that always struck me when Apple made the decision to make the iPod available for Windows, remember that the iPod was very controversial.  Steve Jobs fought that.  But it's what made it.  It's what really made the iPod.  And I always wonder why they can't do that with some of their other services.  Why, for example, there isn't Apple Music for Android?  Right.  Because there is.  There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And people thought that Microsoft's done.  But that's what allowed the pivot to work.  Do you think Apple can say, OK, well, you know what?  The iPhone's been big for us.  But we're not.  That's not the first thing we push anymore.

Transcript:  I think it was the inevitable result of something that had started probably five years before such an Adele took over as CEO.  You know, you need to give Steve Ballmer a lot of credit.  Really?  Or for having put absolutely you have to give Steve Ballmer a lot of credit for having for having given such an Adele the executive position and building the cloud based businesses that made it logical for him to be promoted to CEO.  The reason he was promoted to CEO was because he had been given the freedom to to to build those businesses.

Transcript:  I mean, yes, I think that's what happened.  The board said, OK, now we're ready to pivot.  Thank you, Steve, for your service.  Go buy a basketball team.  And and even though they did a very public executive search for the next CEO, as it turned out, they made the exact right choice by promoting from within.

Start time: 3799.92

Start time: 3819.82
End time: 3845.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And and one of the very first things that he did when he came on as CEO was to start the wheels in motion to to unwind virtually all of that.  So that today, you know, there is no Windows Phone software there.  The Nokia is no longer a part of Microsoft.  Microsoft is not building.  There's no surface phone and there and there probably won't be.

No, seriously, this has been one of the few really truly successful business pivots that you can point at in the tech industry.  It's historically a very difficult thing to do and a lot of credit to whoever Ballmer, Nadella, whoever.  But do you think Apple's trying to do something of that magnitude?

Start time: 3894.80
End time: 3998.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They can.  Well, every large company in in Silicon Valley has to eventually face the fact that they have a dominant product that is, you know, both their strength and their potential downfall.  And so, you know, disrupting your own product, disrupting your own key product is really important.  But, you know, Apple doesn't really have any choice.  They've seen the the slowing in sales of their hardware products for a number of years.  And although those businesses are still they are cranking out as much revenue and profit for Apple as Windows and Office were for Microsoft back when Microsoft was preparing to do that pivot.  But the writing was on the wall.  There's no growth there anymore.  And so you have to find another place where you can get some growth.  The company that hasn't been able to do that at all is Google.  That's exactly right.  Which continues to be a company that, you know, they they bought Motorola and then sold it.  They they keep trying to figure out ways to get into the enterprise, but they're not successful at it.  They keep coming up with, frankly, interesting hardware products, but they don't turn into real businesses.  Google Fiber has been, you know, at best a middling business and, you know, by some measures a failure.  And so there's still a company that is, you know, 88 percent advertising.

They want to.  Anyway, we're going to talk about Google's big announcement this week, which is Stadia.  Yeah.  Just a little bit.  But before we move on, I just I want to ask the one question.  I think we do see tomorrow Apple making a pivot from a hardware company to a services company.  We mentioned that the kind of shining difference in what Microsoft's done and what Apple's doing is Microsoft's become more open as a result of this pivot.  They become more agnostic.  You don't have to use windows.  You don't have to be on Microsoft hardware by any means.  Apple, it sounds like, is going to double down on its ecosystem.  The whole point of Apple services, I think you were pointing this out, Larry, is not to support Samsung or Microsoft, but to support Apple and to encourage people to get locked into Apple services.  Is this strategically the right play?  It's very different than what Microsoft did.  We could say Microsoft's been successful opening up.  Apple's not opening up.  Is that the right thing to do?

Start time: 4071.24
End time: 4091.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think globally, it's the wrong play.  I mean, they may be able to do quite well in America and where they are dominant and other parts of the developed world, perhaps.  But if you're thinking about the entire world, you're thinking about the developing world, it's a definitely a bad play.  Samsung owns the rest of the world.  Absolutely.  And also, Samsung has a range of products at a range of price points.  There is no such thing as a cheap iPhone.

Start time: 4091.84
End time: 4105.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ironically, Samsung tried and failed with the ecosystem play.  They had Samsung Milk.  They had Samsung Store.  And it was horrible.  Milk was their music.  In case you didn't know, it wasn't actual dairy products.  It was their music store.

Start time: 4110.82
End time: 4113.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4114.16
End time: 4122.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but they've been able to create a variety of products at a variety of price points.  We only hear about the 10, the high end ones here.  But there are Samsung phones out there that you can buy from.

Start time: 4123.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People call the radio station all the time with questions like, I've got a Samsung J3.  What do you think?  I don't know.  I've never even heard of it.  Right.  Verizon gives it away as a deal.  It's an Android 4 phone that you can get for free.  So there's a lot of Samsung devices out there.

Start time: 4140.00
End time: 4145.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the other problem with Apple is, let's face it, iPhones are great, but so are pixels.  So are Samsungs.  I have to be honest with you.

Start time: 4146.71
End time: 4150.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4151.02
End time: 4165.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the point is that you could argue, is it better or not quite as good as the Apple 10S?  But the fact you have to have that discussion means that Apple's already lost.  There's no clear winner.  In 2007, there was no question.  Yeah.

Start time: 4166.80
End time: 4208.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I bought a phone, of course it was $1,500, which Apple would love to sell me a phone for $1,500.  Actually, I think I did buy a phone from Apple for $1,500.  Come to think of it, my maxed out 10S was in fact the same price as the Samsung maxed out, 10 plus maxed out.  But it has a terabyte of storage.  It has 12 gigabytes of RAM.  My iPhone has four.  And it is a powerhouse.  It's a desktop class processor in my pocket.  Better screen.  Now for me, one of the reasons I like the S10+, is because it's very customizable, which Apple is not.  But I think a lot of consumers don't want all of that.  What do you think, Ed?  Is the Apple ecosystem play a strong play or is it the mistake?  Yeah.

Start time: 4209.54
End time: 4271.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's a very familiar play.  If you look in the telecommunications industry, especially American telecommunications companies,  they have historically been driven by a metric called ARPU, average revenue per user.  And that, I think, is what Apple is going to with, you know, they've been really focusing on their upgrade plans, for example,  which are essentially leasing.  Right.  You essentially wind up leasing your device from Apple, zero down, and then, you know, $35 or $40 a month for the hardware.  And then on top of that, they're going to layer some services on them.  And that has historically been the way that every cell phone provider in the United States, at least, has worked.  And it's also been the way that the cable companies have worked.  You rent the box from them.  People hate it.  They upsell you.

Start time: 4271.33
End time: 4279.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't people hate it?  Didn't Microsoft get a lot of heat because essentially that's what they did with Windows in office, was turn it into a subscription product.  And people hated that.

Start time: 4281.22
End time: 4311.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and the reason that, but, you know, Verizon is a very large company.  They're doing okay.  They're doing okay, yeah.  And but that has historically, but I'm not saying that they're being like that they're trying to become a telecommunications company.  What I'm saying is that they're following what has historically been at various times in the history, recent history of technology, a very successful business model.

Transcript:  You look at the triple play that Comcast has.  Oh my God, I hate that.  I know.  I have somebody else's Internet phone system.  I don't have that.  Yeah.  So apparently this is this.

Start time: 4322.10
End time: 4348.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a perfect example of it because if you've ever, and I'm a Comcast customer, if you've ever priced out their services, you discover that it is typically cheaper to buy the bundle that has all the things in it than it is to try and put them together, you know, a little piece or two at a time.  They price the individual thing so high that they basically say, look, for only $10 more, you get all this stuff.

Start time: 4350.28
End time: 4363.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have their high end.  I have their highest Internet service that I can get where I live.  And it turns out that basic cable is actually not very much more than that.  Exactly.  So I stick with it even though I hate it.  It's incremental.  It's incremental.

Start time: 4364.04
End time: 4388.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's interesting, though, is my impression is that that triple play is not cheaper than if you went to three different providers.  It's only so it's really more a pitch when you go to Comcast.  Hey, add all this for 10 bucks, add this for 10 bucks.  But it's not if you put it all together, any cheaper than using the phone company in Comcast, for instance.  Right. But nobody does that.

Start time: 4389.74
End time: 4395.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's ridiculous.  Yeah. But they've done that.  They've they've slowly boiled that water.  Apparently, this is Tim.  So if you say that the iPod or the iPhone was Steve Jobs crowning jewel services or Tim Cook's crown jewel, he began pushing the Wall Street Journal pushing services hard in late 2017.  And he's been saying that Apple will double service revenue by 2020, according to the Journal at Monthly Sessions.  The 58 year old CEO has peppered the team with detailed questions.  He wanted services team members to tell him which apps are selling well.  How many Apple music subscribers stuck with the service?  How many people were signing up for iCloud?  iCloud, by the way, is not a competitive offering compared to Google Drive or Microsoft's OneDrive.

Start time: 4443.89
End time: 4466.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the problem.  First, I stand by my they need to compete in the enterprise if they actually want to make a lot of money on services.  The second problem is, as Ed brought up, they are an ARPU company.  They sell premium products at a premium price and they always get the largest margin because the hardware is fantastic.  When you go into the service industry, it is a commodity market and you have to sell at scale and they are not set up to do that.

Start time: 4467.00

End time: 4541.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely. And what's amazing too about my, and some of my best friends are Apple users.  And what they do is they live only in that ecosystem.  It wouldn't occur to my Mac friends to buy anything other than an iPhone and to use anything other than, they just cannot escape.

Transcript:  It's a no-brainer. And you know, there are companies like Netflix and Spotify, both of whom have said we're not going to pay the Apple 30% anymore.  We don't want to pay that anymore.

Start time: 4558.22
End time: 4570.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is my skepticism. So you know, for example, that Apple TV does not do as well as Roku.  It's much more expensive.  It's much more expensive. And it's not as good. It's not as versatile.  And the question is...

Start time: 4570.02
End time: 4581.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the other hand, if you're locked into Apple's ecosystem, if you're in iTunes, it's the only device that plays iTunes.  So that's their leverage, right? You're going to get that $200 out of somebody because, well, wait a minute, all my movies are in iTunes.

Start time: 4582.12
End time: 4597.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, if that's the world you're in. But I'm just saying, when competing, just stand alone against Roku, they can't compete as a world.  They can't compete as their price or their quality.  And of course, there was some speculation about whether Apple Music would do well. And it has done well.  There was a lot of concern that it wouldn't be able to compete with Spotify.

Start time: 4598.00
End time: 4624.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's competed quite well. But as Spotify would say, they compete well because they charge us 30% extra.  So we have to tack that on. So we cost $12.99 a month, whereas Apple Music's only $9.90 a month on the iTunes store because there's no 30% VIG.  So that seems, you're right, that seems kind of anti-competitive. They're not a monopoly, so maybe that's not monopolistic behavior. They're only 50% of the market.

Start time: 4624.86
End time: 4630.59

You have to go to your browser, buy it there.  Exactly.  And that's what Spotify has done and that's what Netflix is doing now.  Netflix says we paid, this could save us, what was it, $8 or $9 billion a year.  Yeah.  But not paying the Apple 30%.

Start time: 4672.34
End time: 4715.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. What's fascinating to me is that in this sense, Apple is, they're playing two roles.  One is they're a payments processor. So they're sort of like MasterCard and Visa, although they have MasterCard and Visa as their partners as well.  So they're layered on top of that. And they're also running the, some of the infrastructure for selling and servicing and updating the apps there.  So those are two things that are of value to any provider.  The real problem seems to be the arbitrary nature of the 30% fee and how it's 30% or nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, right. And that's, and that I think is, you know, to bring it back to what tomorrow's thing is going to be.  This is yet another way for them to sort of ease off on the 30%, still make, you know, still make significant revenue on it, but allow some of the other players to, you know, participate more fully in the revenue stream.

Transcript:  Here's the thing I'm going to watch for tomorrow. And it will be a little side note, but it might be the most important thing Apple announces tomorrow.  Apple is doing a credit card with Goldman Sachs. And I think that's the real play here because it's one thing to sell music or rent storage space or offer TV shows.  It's another thing entirely to take a cut of every transaction on the platform. And that's ultimately what Apple's going to do.  In fact, Apple, Goldman Sachs, their partner in this also has a bank, an online bank.  And I would not be at all surprised for Apple to do financial services. And at that point, that really is a walled garden. That is absolute lock-in.

Start time: 4793.52
End time: 4804.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it fits their business model. They're always, they've always been about owning the core technologies behind their products.  And if they are now a financial services company, yeah, I mean, it doesn't make sense for them to be paying that percentage.

Start time: 4805.00
End time: 4813.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If they pay, they get a smaller cut than they would as a credit card, right? They get a bigger cut. Of course, if you get Apple Pay plus the credit card, you get even more.  I think that's the announcement to watch for tomorrow.

No, the idea was that Apple would have insurance. And the reason it would work is because the demographic of people who own Apple equipment are actually probably ones that you could sell the insurance to a little bit cheaper and still make money.  It's a joke. But now you're telling me it may not be a joke.

Like, I used the Apple Watch. What are you making me sign for?  This is not security. What is this?  Yeah, it's fun. And you know, at first I didn't use it because people gave you a funny look.  The clerk would say, what?  But now it's so accepted.  In fact, it's worse when I go to Whole Foods now.  I have to open my phone up and show them the Amazon Prime QR code.  So I get credit there.

Our show today brought to you by Atlassian.  Oh, we are at Atlassian House, and I'm proud to say those words.  It all started for us with Atlassian's Jura, which is an agile development tool.  Developers know it very well.  We use it for projects.  We always know who's working on what stage they're in, what resources they need.  And it's so satisfying when you get to move that project into the completed column.  There's just something that's great about that.  It also works with Confluence, another Atlassian product.  That's really important for us because we use Confluence to document what the team's doing.  So we use it in IT. I think it's a great IT tool. I know it's a great IT tool.  Between Jura and Confluence, we know what's going on, who's doing it.  We know how they did it. We know what the workflow is.  IT, it turns out, is empowering business these days.  Not just a podcast network, but pretty much any business there is.  Atlassian is a collaboration software company that empowers IT teams around the world.  IT's at the center of almost everything going on.  In a cloud-based world, it's IT teams that plan and execute.  And they've got to do it faster and better than ever.  Incidents require open, agile, and smart cooperation between ops and software development teams.  The expectations are high. The stakes are high.  IT's right at the heart of that.  If you're in a business-critical workflow, failure's not an option.  But the great thing about Atlassian is it's not just for developers.  They offer an affordable, reliable suite of tools for IT teams of all sizes,  from DevOps to agile to IT apps to ops to ITSM and whatever's next.  They give you the technology backbone you need for planning service  and supporting the kind of change that propels business.  So I mentioned JIRA. I mentioned Confluence.  If you've got a code base, there's Bitbucket.  If you've got ops, there's Ops Genie and Statuspage that help you better detect incidents,  coordinate response efforts, resolve issues faster,  keep customers or stakeholders updated.  And I love it that Atlassian is always adding new tools.  And they all work together. They all kind of, you know, they're jigsaw puzzle pieces that all fit together.  Things like Trello. And it all integrates seamlessly with JIRA and Confluence.  So your team can stay on one platform and get it all done.  And most importantly, can keep stakeholders, customers, coworkers informed up to date on what's going on.  You want a high performing IT team? You want Atlassian.

It was Tuesday, 10 a.m. at the Game Developers Conference.  We knew that Google was probably going to announce a streaming gaming service.  They'd tried Project Stream. They'd showed people you could play Assassin's Creed Odyssey in a browser on a Chrome device, Chrome OS device.  We thought that was pretty cool. They announced Stadia.  And I have to admit, I bet this happens to you too. Maybe not Ed, because Ed is a hard-headed cynic.  But when I watch these keynotes, I get all excited. Oh, this is going to be the greatest thing ever.  They showed how YouTube will be the hardest. You could stream gameplay on YouTube and there'd be a button on there that said to the viewer, come on, play the game too.  You join the game at the same point. You'd be able to save game states and share them so they could join the game right at the most critical part.  They showed how you could play on devices as dumb as a Chromecast Ultra.  A $75 dongle. You plug into your TV and suddenly you get the Google joystick, which, by the way, brilliantly worked just like Chromecast.  It didn't connect to the dongle. It connected via Wi-Fi to the Stadia cloud.  They showed how they would have backbones. It had custom designed AMD GPUs that were working at 10 teraflops faster than a PlayStation 4 Pro or an Xbox One X.  I got so excited. I said, take my money, Google. And they said, well, no, we don't know what it's going to cost or when it's going to be available. So thank you very much.

Transcript:  It reminded me, I remember when Steve Perlman, who was the founder of Web TV, on live, I'm looking at an article, I guess it died around 2012.  But that was an early example. And I was blown away at the time because that was his pitch as well.  That's the irony of this. This is nothing new. Nothing new at all.

Transcript:  On live failed because they realized that they had enough hardware for the peak times a day, but it would lie fallow almost all the rest of the time.  It's like the electrical grid. Yeah, they couldn't afford it. They sold their IP, I think, to Sony. Sony also bought Gaikai.  Sony has a streaming gaming service. Microsoft is announced next year. They'll do a streaming gaming service.  Shadow does this. Shadow. We have a shadow. That's pretty cool.

Transcript:  It's almost to save YouTube. It's almost like Twitch is eating our lunch.  Although they were quick to point out how many billions of hours people watch gaming on YouTube, but it's different because I know I watched my kid.  He watches Minecraft videos, how-to videos. If he wants to play Overwatch, he'll watch the videos and learn and then play the game.  People watch Twitch to watch live action. I think the name Stadia is also telling because it kind of implies a stadium, like an e-sports kind of thing.

Start time: 5355.04
End time: 5363.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It took me a long time to get my head around the idea that people would actually watch other people play games.  Then it occurred to me, ESPN, sports. We've been doing that all our lives.

Start time: 5364.10
End time: 5415.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know when I turned to the corners of Fortnite, because first of all, Fortnite has a feature that if you get killed, which I did almost instantly every single time,  you can continue to follow the guy who killed you and then the guy who kills him all the way up to the top. And it's fun.  And then I watched, it was a charity thing with Ninja and Marshmello playing.  Oh, the concert?  Yeah, no, no, not the concert. He had a concert in Fortnite. That was another thing in time. But no, I watched them.  It was at E3 last year and it was really engaging and fun to watch. The commentators were good.  They have to work on the biggest problem they had is they don't know as much about this as ESPN does about sports because they would always miss the kill shot.  Like they'd go there, oh, I wish you could have seen that. But they'll get that down.  I thought it was very engaging. So I do think it's fun to watch.  Oh, yeah, it's a huge industry.

Start time: 5416.04
End time: 5422.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's obviously huge already.  People also watch people play poker.  Yeah, poker's fun to watch.  I love to watch other people play games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know why? The whole card camera. It's the single thing that made poker big on TV.  Because you know, you have information the other players don't have. You know what Andy's been.

Start time: 5431.26
End time: 5461.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, it's not gaming per se. It's the same thing with poker or watching anything that's a sport that people don't care about.  They're following the personality. It's the same reason why people like to tweet a lot. They love Leo.  You know, it's when you find someone who you find interesting or hate. Exactly.  But something.  You follow them. On YouTube, it's the same thing. I've watched now hundreds of hours of gaming on YouTube because I made a conscious effort to do that.  Do you watch live gaming on YouTube?  I don't like the live gaming.  Do you watch it on Twitch?  I watch it on Twitch sometimes.

Start time: 5462.04
End time: 5472.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's a community on Twitch because you've got the chat. You've got people giving money.  Twitch, they've made it into something interesting. I think very compelling. What do you think Ed?

Transcript:  Well, you know, I find it fascinating that Google doesn't break out how much money it makes from YouTube.  They never do, do they?  No, they never have. And so you don't know.  But and we're back to the, you know, the thing we were talking about earlier where Google is a company that has historically been driven completely by advertising revenue.  And I think you're right on the money to say that this is an attempt to save YouTube, to transform YouTube, because right now YouTube's reputation is toxic.  Right.  And and but everything in YouTube's business model, which is similar to Facebook's business model, is driven by engagement.  And the things that the things that that that make engagement go up are usually things that are shocking, violent or controversial.

Start time: 5538.02
End time: 5562.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  For example. Yeah, for example.  And we could find, you know, we could find several worse examples than that even.  That's pretty hard to find one worse than that.  And that's saying something. Yeah.  You know, but but, you know, so the idea of turning it into I mean, it's almost like they're trying to turn it into the you know, they've tried to turn YouTube into a TV, a TV network for a while.

Start time: 5563.14
End time: 5581.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the difference is with TV networks, you actually have programmers, you actually have professionals who make editorial decisions.  I know.  For quality content.  So the idea of mixing television and social networking is imagine if NBC sort of turned over its airwaves one day and said, OK, anybody can program whatever they want.  Yeah, we have that.

Start time: 5581.14
End time: 5582.94

Transcript:  And that's the thing that when I figured out that it was about engagement was when I saw streaming of a game called Rust, which is the most boring game ever.  But I'm kind of addicted to it because of the fact that you had some very talented content creators who are turning it into a narrative.  And that's that's why I like YouTube.  It's a bit more finished than a name for a boring game.  Rust. It really is.

Start time: 5609.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not.  I'm not.  I think I'm to the twenty first century.  It's the age of the amateur.  Leo, there are some amazing content on YouTube and there are some a lot of millionaires on YouTube who did very well exploiting that media better than most professional actors and producers and directors have done.  You bet.  You know, doing professional media.

Start time: 5636.06
End time: 5657.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, still the big bucks are in professionally produced television and movies.  Right. But the point is that.  But the kids today are watching the YouTube.  That's right.  In fact, I just saw a stat that there's more YouTube's easily handily beating cable TV in people under 25.  I can't remember the exact numbers, but it's not it's not a competition anymore.  It's not even close.  Not even close.

Start time: 5657.76
End time: 5671.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I'd be curious to know the one metric is how many people are watching it and how much time they're watching it.  But the other metric that matters in terms of it being a sustainable business is how are they monetizing?

Start time: 5672.06
End time: 5676.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and I agree with you, Ed.  I mean, the problem YouTube has reputationally is it's a dung heap.

Start time: 5677.00
End time: 5679.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that was my point.  Ed bringing up the issue of the reputation.

Start time: 5680.00
End time: 5699.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's not the quality of the video as bad as that is.  It's the comments and the and the and the environment that's bad.  And it's bad because advertisers are terrified of having an ad appear next to something disgusting and the recommendation algorithm that leads you into the darkest worst.

Start time: 5701.00
End time: 5718.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a spectacular failure on which is why some of the biggest YouTubers, the ones who are actually making money on this, are no longer really depending on the monetization through YouTube.  They use Patreon.  Yeah, Lilly Singh makes her money selling baskets of goods and precisely because then you can just ignore the comments or even turn them off.

Start time: 5719.32
End time: 5744.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mobile. This is a study from Nielsen.  Their Q3 2018 total audience report mobile time is mobile.  But I think mobile, as you know, is is where all the growth is happening.  Forty percent of all mobile traffic, forty percent of all mobile traffic is YouTube.  That makes sense.  Forty. Let me say that again.  Forty percent.

Start time: 5745.00
End time: 5750.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that measuring in in bytes, hours?  What do they measure again?  Time spent.  Time spent.  OK.

Start time: 5751.02
End time: 5761.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ten percent is Netflix.  Ten percent Facebook.  Forty percent YouTube.  So however we feel about YouTube, clearly it's got people's attention.

Start time: 5762.84
End time: 5791.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But isn't that the way that's the way YouTube is designed?  You watch a video and then boom, the next one is queued up and starts playing automatically.  And then boom, the next one gets you is queued up.  And that's that's the secret of their success, which is people spend a lot of time on it because you start out just watching a picture of, you know, pets in Halloween costumes.  And and pretty soon you're, you know, pretty soon you're watching flat Earth videos.

Start time: 5792.36
End time: 5824.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the real problem. Did you see that?  Almost all the people who believe in the flat Earth today got it from YouTube.  That's from a lot of.  So this is I take it back.  It is I'm gathering this is from Sandvine that it's data because global downstream mobile traffic by app.  So that's YouTube of the of the total.  By the way, YouTube, 37 percent web browsing, four point six percent.  People don't even browse the web on this stuff.  What's app three point seven percent app store and Google Play two point one percent one point nine.

Start time: 5825.00
End time: 5828.58

Start time: 5829.00
End time: 5844.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, that's because everywhere but the US WhatsApp is the choice of messaging app.  So they're spending all day on WhatsApp.  Maybe they're sending pictures.  Instagram five point seven, Snapchat eight point three.  Well, but not relative to YouTube.  YouTube dominates.

Start time: 5845.00
End time: 5869.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I don't understand about that is, OK, let's say that I spend an hour staring at my phone screen as I talk with people.  What have we gained?  WhatsApp.  And then and then I spend an hour, you know, watching one video after another on YouTube.  I mean, those YouTube videos are significantly more data.

Start time: 5870.00
End time: 5873.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5873.12
End time: 5878.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 5879.44
End time: 5887.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're right. I'd rather see how I would rather see time spent viewing than data.  You're absolutely right.  Yeah. Sandvine gets the data.

Start time: 5887.08
End time: 5898.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you could make an app.  You could make a living off of creating an app that just does curated content.  You don't create any content of your own.  You just you promise your viewers that they're only going to get content that's high quality.

Start time: 5898.36
End time: 5903.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Yeah. So Stadia will come out sometime this year for a price unknown.  As Carsten's son, a serious gamer, pointed out, who announces some flaws, some major flaws in the announcement.  First of all, such an Adele comes out and says, I am not a gamer.  OK, who does a game announcement at GDC starting?  I'm not a gamer. That's bad.  Two, literally the only game they announced on it is Doom, which is 30 years old.

Start time: 5946.77
End time: 5950.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5951.00
End time: 5952.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you suggesting that it's doomed?  Exactly. I don't know.

Start time: 5953.00
End time: 5959.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just that they come on without games, there's no point in playing a gaming service.  They had no games to announce.  They had no price.

Start time: 5959.36
End time: 5969.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And look at what Apple does in announcement.  They have the announcement of their developers standing up there showing off the cool things you can do with their product.  They always announced the price.  They always announced the date of availability.

Start time: 5969.00
End time: 5987.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was a little premature.  Of course, it's a game developers conference, so they're trying to get developers to write games for it.  Although, if I'm a developer and Google comes to me and says, we got a new service, are you going to write for Google knowing that they could kill the service two years later?  I mean, who trusts Google for that?  I don't think it was a compelling pitch.

Start time: 5988.38
End time: 6015.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And didn't Microsoft say that they're going to have their response to this at E3?  Yes.  Which is just a little over two months away.  And that will undoubtedly be before the widespread availability of Google Stadia.  So it's a vaporware announcement, really.  The ultimate.  Classic.

Start time: 6016.10
End time: 6063.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Classic.  And then the final point of all this, which I actually find really interesting variety, brings this up.  You could talk about how great your servers are, how you're going to have all sorts of horsepower.  There was a lot of cool things like if you got in a very involved co-op game, each player could have their own hardware instance or even multiple hardware instances per player.  All of that's great.  But it's still got to come down this crappy frayed wire that's provided by Comcast or Verizon or AT&T or Cox or Frontier.  And ultimately, as Variety points out, this is just ripe for exploitation without a net neutrality rule.  It's just a matter of time before Comcast says, you know, if you'd like to play those games on Google, it'll cost you a buck fifty a month.

Start time: 6064.08
End time: 6069.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because they're latency dependent.  And you can destroy a game experience by adding another 10 milliseconds of latency.

Start time: 6069.85
End time: 6100.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We would like to give you the best possible gaming experience.  And for that, it'll be five dollars a month.  And if you don't think the Comcast is capable of doing that, then just look at Comcast Flex.  Xfinity Flex is the latest rent taking scheme from Comcast for five dollars a month.  You can get a Netflix streaming box.  Oh, yeah.  On your Comcast.  But you have to have a high end Comcast X1 system.  Right.  It's a really nice stream you got there.

Start time: 6101.32

Start time: 6104.50
End time: 6110.84

Start time: 6114.06
End time: 6140.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But here's the thing.  But here's the thing.  If something goes wrong with your Roku, you call Comcast and they say, sorry, that's a problem with your hardware.  You call Roku and they say, well, we think it might be a problem with your network and you can't ever get those two people talking to another.  Whereas if you buy it all from one place, you call one support line and they're going to own the problem.

Start time: 6141.00

End time: 6163.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's literally the worst part of my to do list.  It ends up staying on that to do list for months.  Call Comcast about.  It's the thing, isn't it, that you put off the longest?  The last thing.  I'd rather have a tooth pulled.

I think the final thing was the floating bonsai tree.  Which really, I mean, honestly, looked really cool.  So it had a big base with like a heavy magnet.  And then there was this pumice rock with a metal plate in it.  And it would hover.  And then there was a cute little bonsai tree growing out of it.  So it was like, it was really cool.  Except when I got it, bonsai not included.  And when you put the, if you bought a bonsai tree, put it in there,  then you would have to shave the rock so it would be balanced.  Otherwise it would just go, so yeah.  So it was just too much work.

So what made it smart, Leo?  It just came.  Well, it turns out it wasn't so smart.  It has a battery built in,  but I can't check this luggage because it has a battery built in.  Oh, right, right.  The regulations changed between the time they offered it and the time I bought it.  We'll be back with more in just a bit.  But first a word from...  I love this.  DigitalOcean.  I know, Father Robert, you're a DigitalOcean fan, too.  You use it, as I do, because we're amateurs for prototyping web apps, websites.  But it's also used by startups of all sizes for a minimum viable product.  I see people running production servers on it all the time.  DigitalOcean is the simplest, easiest to use cloud platform for developers, for teams.  You can deploy, manage, and scale cloud applications faster and more efficiently with DigitalOcean.  And I'm going to show you.  I have to think back in time.  Let me log in here to when I was first starting out in this business and I wanted to create a Twitter website.  First I had to find a web host.  I went down to SoftLayer in Texas.  They're now IBM.  And then you say, well, I'd like a server.  Yes, sir, what kind of server would you like?  And you have to specify it.  And then they say, OK, we're going to provision that server.  We'll get back to you in a week or two.  And by the way, at this time, this was pretty cool.  Oh, cool.  All right.  A week or two later, then you have to install all the software that you're going to use on that server.  Maybe if there's a problem, another week passes, you finally get it up and running.  And now you've got your website going.  Or you could do what I would do today and go to do.co.co.  DigitalOcean.  Let me just show you.  I'm going to log into my DigitalOcean account.  They call them droplets because get it.  It's a drop in the ocean.  And I'm going to show you how fast it is to set up and provision a server.  I'm going to create a new droplet.  By the way, I'm not going to use.  There's so many cool features.  They've got Kubernetes.  They've got additional volumes.  You can have databases.  They have custom DNS.  We'll start here.  You could choose an image.  Which distribution you want.  Ubuntu, FreeBSD, Fedora, Debian, CentOS.  You could choose a container distribution.  They support Docker and Kubernetes.  Or I like the one button installs.  This is they call it now the marketplace.  Everything from WordPress to Django, Docker, Ghost.  That's a blogging platform.  Let's just set up.  I don't know.  What should we set up today, Father Rowley?  You want to set up just a plain old LAMP stack?  You know what I like to do?  Because I like to have node.js installed as well.  So it'll be a LAMP stack.  But it'll have node pre-installed on Ubuntu 18.04.  So I'm ready to run my node application.  I can have a standard starter or general purpose or CPU optimized.  But let me watch this.  I like to turn down the price all the way to $5 a month.  That's a gigabyte, a CPU, 25 gigs of storage, gigabyte of RAM,  25 gigs of storage, a terabyte of transfer, this per month.  I do like to spend an extra buck to have backups enabled  in case I screw anything up.  If you want to add block storage, you can.  You choose your data center, New York, San Francisco, Amsterdam,  Singapore, London, Frankfurt, Toronto, Bangalore.  I always choose San Francisco.  I also, as you know, Robert, it's very handy to have SSH turned on  so that you can have secure SSH login.  There you go.  Let's just call this Leo's, we'll call it Padres node.  Because this one's for you.  And I'm going to, now watch.  Less than a minute, I'm going to set up and provision a server  with a public IP address that I'll have a console to, I can log into.  It's running a lamp stack.  It's running node.js.  It's all ready for my application.  I can start uploading it, I can start working it.  I can serve it publicly.  They have many more features including custom DNS, load balancers.  They have secure droplets, droplet metrics.  This is, I've never seen anything so easy.  This is transforming the economics of web apps, of web startup.  It's incredible.  MySQL, Ruby on Rails.  They just introduced managed databases for Postgres  so you can launch your database with the push of a button.  Oh, by the way, Padres node is up and ready.  Should we, that fast?  Should we just log in?  Yes, please.  We'll just log into your node.  I get root access.  It's got a public IP address.  There it is, it's booting up.  System D. There it is.  We're logged in.  Well, actually we're not because I'm not going to show you Padres secret password.  It's amazing.  9999 uptime, you get an SLA, cloud firewalls, full DNS management,  free daily backups with point in time recovery,  stand by nodes with automatic failover, end to end security.  So if you've got a Raspberry Pi and you need a web based back end service for it,  this is the place to do it.  It's so affordable, so easy,  and we're going to give you a hundred dollar credit right now at do.co slash twit.  So it's going to be free for you for at least a little while.  do.co slash twit.  I love Digital Ocean.  The sky's the limit.  Anything you want to do,  Padre, I'll just turn off.  Oh, I should show you this part too.  And when you're done,  you destroy the droplet.  I'm destroying your droplet.  Just destroy it.  It's all gone.  Goodbye droplet.  Completely securely erased.  I love it.  There you go.  Boom, gone.  I should destroy that other droplet.  I don't know what that's just hanging around.  By the way, you see my bill in the upper right hand corner?  This month, $3.94.  It's less than a latte, folks.  do.co slash twit.  And when you apply that hundred dollar credit, it's free.  Thank you, Digital Ocean.  Transforming technology, transforming the ecosystem.  It's just marvelous.

Nice.  So we talk about maker projects.  Is it like our chat room, like an IRC room?  Oh, yeah.  But you have different channels, just like we've got different channels in our chat room.  And so you choose the one that is speaking about the topic that you want.  We go back and forth.  And so that's my touchstone to the Twitter army.  Do you run the server at home?

We stored hundreds of millions of your passwords in plain text.  Yeah.  Oh, we could possibly go wrong.  It turned out, as part of a routine security review in January,  we found some user passwords being stored in a readable format  within our internal data storage systems.  This caught our attention because basically 20,000 Facebook employees  would have access to your passwords.  Facebook says they will notify you if your passwords are stored in that way.  The number of people whose passwords are stored that way seems to be going up, as always.  Facebook says it's at least hundreds of millions of Facebook Lite users,  tens of millions of other Facebook users, tens of thousands of Instagram users.

There's three, at least three people that are sued here.  Liz Mere is the named person in it.  And then the other two people, whoever is running those accounts,  those three people are going to have to pay for legal representation.  They're going to have to spend a lot of time and a lot of money  defending themselves here.  He filed the suit weirdly in Virginia.  And one reason for that is that Virginia has really terrible, weak,  anti-slap laws.  So you can't, you know, anti-slap laws punish people for bringing frivolous  lawsuits.  But they're, and usually can wind up turning the tables so that you get  your legal expenses paid and you might even get a judgment out of it.  But they found a jurisdiction to file it in, and they're going to have to  And it's, you know, it's part of a trend that's been going on from that  side of the aisle.  Weaken libel laws, make it easier to harass people for exercising their  free speech rights.  And I think, you know, that's the real story here is that a powerful  member of Congress is taking advantage of the court system to harass  At least one American citizen and probably three, although we don't know  who the cow and the mom are at this point yet.

Transcript:  So Microsoft a number of years ago created some technology called PhotoDNA, which they  gave to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children, whose board I just recently  resigned from, retired from.  And that technology allows them to basically hash specific illegal child exploitation images  so they can't be reposted.  If Facebook could act quickly enough, for example, let's say Facebook, all these services,  for example, and hash that video.  They do.

Start time: 8244.61
End time: 8275.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they had it hashed.  They had it hashed within 20 minutes.  But the trouble is that the people who amplify it are aware of how the hashing works.  And so they've ways to mutate.  They subtly alter the video.  They'll do a, you know, hold up an iPad to your screen and take a picture of it and do  a video of it and then post that.  So the yeah, for every for every way that you have to block it, the people who are determined  to go around the blocks are going to do that.

Start time: 8275.80
End time: 8289.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, with PhotoDNA, at least for still images, you can pretty much defeat that getting around  it because they don't just hash the actual file.  They hash characteristics of the file that can be blocked even if the file has been modified.  I'm not saying there's no way around it.

He nailed it.  Yeah, and nailed it.  And so, you know, anybody who wasn't economically incentivized, who heard that should have gone, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, wait just a second.

And I mean, they could have done a better job than waiting for the New Zealand police to call them 17 minutes later to take that down.  Is that what happened?  Yeah, that's what happened.  You know, on the other hand, and this is no defense of what happened on Facebook, but the real story here is that 50 people died.

I started working at a radio station in San Francisco, KNBR, as the music director.  And I go in the door and I'm expecting, because I had written databases, I had written nice modern PC programs to do the music rotation.  I walk in the door.  There sits on the ground because it's the size of a mini fridge.  A PDP-11 with a giant 8.5 inch floppy.  That's the music generation program.  You stick the floppy in.  You close the door.  The head goes chonk.  And it prints out on a teletype practically the playlist.  They've been using it for probably 20 years.  This is 1984.  And the first thing I did was I don't know how it happened, but somehow that floppy stopped working.  And we had to go out and buy a modern computer to do it.  You know this.  If you work in business, there is some program that's been there for 20 years.  You have to keep running Windows NT because nothing else will run it.  You're using Internet Explorer.  It's time for some modern software.  There is almost certainly a better program out there.  But where do you find it?  Do you Google it?  No.  You go to Captera.  Captera will help you find the perfect tools to make the right decision for software for your business.  Whether it's running a veterinarian office or sending out marketing emails, managing your projects, designing 12-story office towers to managing a yoga studio, Captera's got it.  700 categories of software, thousands of different programs, and best of all, 750,000 reviews of products from people who actually use it.  Captera vets all those reviews and makes sure they're all real users.  So you can go to captera.com slash twit and find exactly the software you need.  The boss says to you, tomorrow I want you to come in with five great programs for running our dental office.  You go to captera.com.  You check the boxes for what you need.  You want to run on the web.  You want to run locally.  Do you want to be able to book clients, patients?  You want to manage the schedule?  Do you want to order products?  What do you need?  You check the boxes.  It gives you all the programs that do that.  Then you can put them in a comparison chart.  Read the reviews.  Go to the websites.  Even find out if there's free trials.  You can get everything you need right there.  It's the best way to find software for your business.  And you know, if you look at this and you say, well, how much would you pay for this?  You'd probably say, oh, I'd pay $10 a month, $15.  I'd pay $20.  It's free.
