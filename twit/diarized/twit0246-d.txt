It's time for TWiT This Week in Tech, the show that covers all the tech news and  joining us some actual real-life tech journalists.  I'm merely a pundit,  but you can't say that about Mr. Dwight Silverman. He is  tech reporter for the Houston Chronicle, the venerable  Houston Chronicle, blogs at blogs.chron.com slash tech blog. Welcome, Dwight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you, it's good to be here. I don't get to be a pundit?  Oh, well, what is there, can you be both?  I think you can.  I always have a piece of paper that says,  actually my journalism degree from  the University of Houston says Bachelor of Journalism, which gives me a BJ.  I'm always proud of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, I'm changing your lower third.  Dwight Silverman, BJ. Very good, congratulations.  That's a promotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They probably call it a JB.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they do not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They call it a BJ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do call it a BJ.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what she said.  All right, joining us also,  he's in the dark, but not because he's at the witness protection program,  but merely because Veronica Belmont's in Japan.  Mr. Ryan Block of Gadget, gdgt.com. Hi, Ryan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, thanks for having me.  I want to lay claim to being the most backlit guest that you ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I swear to God, all we have to do is make your voice so black,  people would think we had Steve Jobs on or something.  I don't know. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And do you have a bow cutter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can make you sound funny.  All right, let's do it.  We could do that probably after the fact.  I don't know if I could do it.  I don't know. I'll have to.  This board does many things, most of which I don't understand.  Also with us, Mr. Mark Millian of the Los Angeles Times.  Hey, Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, I am actually frontlit in front of a bright, sunny window.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You look fantastic, Mark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why, thank you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your beat is new media slash social media, kind of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Social media, general internet type stuff,  but I do cover a little bit of Apple and helped out with the PalmHP thing last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the big story of the week, obviously.  But you know, it's funny because if I'd had Ryan on,  he probably would have known this last Sunday and I should have had you on.  But we missed the big story of the week last week  because it happened, even though it happened Friday, a week ago, Friday,  nobody knew about it till Monday.  And that, of course, is the raid at Jason Chen's house.  This is back to the lost iPhone.  And no, we're not going to spend an hour talking about the lost iPhone on this.  But I thought since we hadn't talked about it on Twitter  because we didn't know about it and because we got such an august panel,  I think it'd be good to talk about it today.  First of all, Ryan, you know, you founded Engadget.  You're well aware of the Gadget blog wars.  What do you what do you know about this?  Do you think Engadget was offered the phone and turned it down and then Gizmodo took it?  What what is your take on this all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, Engadget was offered the phone at the same time  or right around when Gizmodo was offered it.  They had a picture.  And yeah.  And that's that's how Engadget had the photos up first.  The difference was Engadget passed on it.  So they had these photos from the people shopping it around,  but they didn't have the phone itself.  So, you know, Engadget didn't know whether or not it was real.  They suspected that it was.  But it was hard to say because Gizmodo actually had the device by that point.  Engadget had photos.  So it was a little bit different.  But, you know, Engadget, we, you know, we sold we sold it to AOL in 2005.  AOL is obviously a very large publicly traded company.  So from a legal standpoint, they're fairly cautious.  I think that from and I don't want to get into like the ethical moral discussion.  I mean, I think you probably have already hashed that out quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I point people to Mac Break Weekly this week in law,  this week in Google, all of the shows of the past week.  We've probably done five hours on this subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think we need to get into the moral or ethical aspects of that.  But, you know, for whatever reason,  they chose to pass on it more than likely due to, you know, advice from from legal  counsel, AOL legal and and, you know, it tends to be very conservative in terms of,  you know, liability since it's a very large company.  They want to limit as much liability as they can.  And Gizmodo did not pass on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were you offered the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I was not offered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you have bought it if had you been offered the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I wouldn't have bought it, but I probably would have tried  like hell to figure out a way to do it in a way that was not illegal.  Because, you know, when you acquire the phone, that's when it becomes illegal.  It's purchasing stolen property.  Selling the phone that is also legal.  Right.  If you would have just said, hey, I'd love to come over to your house for a couple of  days and maybe rent a room.  And if there should happen to be a phone on the table, then that would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll have to remember that next time.  I would like to rent a room in your home for five thousand dollars.  And if there should happen to be a phone there, I wouldn't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Exactly.  I mean, it's easy to kind of say what you might have done or what you might not have done.  I mean, it's hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hard. You know, somebody asked me that if somebody had shown up at the door of the  Twit Cottage saying, I think this is the next iPhone, I would like you to have it.  I wouldn't have paid five thousand only because I didn't have five thousand.  If he'd say, would you give me five bucks?  I would give him five bucks.  It's just as illegal.  That would be illegal.  Yeah, not a felony unless it's nine hundred plus.  But. Yeah, interesting.  You know, what do you think?  Let me ask Dwight, because presumably, you know, you work for a newspaper.  This kind of thing comes up.  The Houston Chronicle won't pay for a scoop like this, would it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I don't think we would have paid for that.  And particularly, you know, at the time that they were offered the phone,  they didn't know that it wasn't a Chinese knockoff.  It might not necessarily have been a real iPhone.  Do you want to shell out that kind of money on the on the possibility  that it's not real or that it was gotten illegally?  You know, I would have turned it down flat.  But like Ryan said, I would have been at my most persuasive  trying to at least get my hands on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about you? It's it's it's your obligation as a journalist to figure out,  is this real? If it's real, how much can I learn about this without,  you know, without myself breaking the law? Right.  So there's this dance that you have to play in these situations, which, you know,  you want to do the right thing, but you also have an obligation  to your audience to break the story.  I mean, you know, if you're not doing that, you're not doing your job.  So you want to make sure that you can do your job,  but also not be breaking the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's tricky. I understand that line.  And you're walking that line.  That's why we do meta news. I'm not walking that line.  Yeah, me neither. I do meta news.  I do. I only cover what you covered and then you take the fall.  But I get to talk about the Gizmodo story for weeks without any risk at all.  Mark, what would the L.A. Times do?  Do they give you any schooling?  I mean, you came out of college to the Times.  Do they sit you down with a lawyer at some point and say, here's the rules?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I talked to  to one of the editors at Gizmodo right after it went down, and he told me first,  I believe it was the first report that they had actually paid something for the phone.  He confirmed that, yeah, we did pay for it, which was kind of obvious.  But so Wired was also offered the phone in addition to a gadget.  But Gizmodo ended up paying Gawker, ended up paying five thousand for it.  And they didn't come to the L.A. Times.  Would the L.A. Times have paid for it?  It's a little shady, but we have paid for things in the past.  I mean, even something as simple as if we're reviewing the iPad,  we're going to buy an iPad and and pay for that unit to review it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what I do, too, because I don't mostly because I want to owe Apple anything.  I prefer to buy it. I can afford to buy it.  So maybe it's better to buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was also a circumstance a few years ago of of the L.A. Times paying for  what appeared to be a stolen flash drive that was being sold on the black market in Afghanistan.  That now see, that's a good analogy of the U.S. military.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's a perfect analogy.  There's a public's right to know the provenance of this thing is unknown.  So you could be culpable.  Yet it's your job to expose this information.  What did the Times do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's still a bit of a difference between the U.S.  military and Apple's like shady trade secrets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, who wants which one would you prefer to cross?  Steve Jobs or or the Joint Chiefs of Staff?  I'd prefer to cross the Joint Chiefs.  They may they may have nukes, but Jobs got a bad temper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, so with this memory card that the it was this Afghani black market and it was actually  U.S. military secrets that were on this memory stick.  So it's the L.A. Times did end up paying for it.  Really?  It's kind of a good thing they did so that it didn't get in the hands of some terrorist

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  organization.  That's why Gizmodo bought the phone.  They didn't want to get in the hands of the terrorists.  I'm surprised actually that Nick Denton didn't use that excuse.  I think he used every other excuse if he'd only thought of that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he's pulling out like journalism, like roles and shield laws.  And right.  And I ended up digging up this quote Denton talking to the Washington Post, I think it  was a couple of years ago and saying that it's not the institutional intent to be journalists.  They commit journalism at times by accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's been pretty out about their intentions for a very long time.  I mean, they they they've never viewed themselves as Gawker as an organization has never really  viewed themselves as an above board kind of journalistic operation.  And there are people there who I think take their job seriously and who do think of themselves  as journalists.  But Denton, I think that that is that is totally sincere comment from him.  I mean, he doesn't it's not his intention to commit journalism on a daily basis.  He's out for page views.  He's out for money.  And the funny thing is about the situation, I mean, it might have been largely avoided  if he hadn't been, you know, so so aggressive about tub thumping the fact that they paid  money for this phone.  I mean, if they really if they'd never really talked about it, there's a good chance this  all just would have gone away.  Right.  They'd have made the story about the phone and not about how they got the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's where the stink is.  You know, the way that they outed this guy, the way that they published his picture.  I mean, the whole thing, that kind of stinks.  I was not pleased about that.  Well, you know, that's that's Nick Gismodo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's Nick.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gawker and Gismodo want to have it both ways.  You know, they want to be known as kind of an outlaw organization in terms of news.  They don't necessarily want people to think of them as journalists.  But then that's how else do you build your your credibility?  You know, you have a reputation and you build that by by reporting that's true and reporting  that is believable and reporting to a certain extent, that's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they got millions of page views.  I mean, this was a page view.  This was very valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the you know, this is the dilemma of the web.  I think I think every news organization that has the ability to see how many people are  looking at their news and what they're looking at.  You know, as soon as you see what people are looking at, that changes what you write about.  And I think that just because you can count something doesn't mean it's a good idea that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you should. Can you speak about OK, Ryan, can you speak to the competition between  Gismodo and Engadget? It seems like it's it's worse than the Journal and the Times.  It's worse than any competition, worse than the Giants Dodgers.  I mean, it's it's a it seems like it's almost they would do anything to beat.  Gizmo would do anything to beat Engadget to the punch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if it's really about that anymore.  I think actually the competition is largely kind of died down.  There were there were a few. I mean, look, they're they're both the two most prominent  gadget technology publications in the business.  So, of course, they're competing with each other on a day to day basis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they've kind of made it so they don't have to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's exactly what it was.  You know, back in the day when we first started Engadget, you know, it was our only job  to catch up to Gizmodo.  And we did that in about nine months, which we were all kind of shocked by.  And then at that point, our job was to legitimize the publication  because, you know, you got to remember back in 2009, I'm sorry, 2004, 2005,  you know, gadget blogs.  It wasn't it wasn't a thing.  You know, it wasn't the way that it is today.  I mean, most most publications gave preference to publications with.  I'm sorry. Most organizations gave preference to publications  with with with some kind of print, you know, a magazine or newspaper.  Now it's really shifted.  You know, online is the focus and print and and,  you know, magazines, newspapers are, you know, of increasingly less importance.  No, no offense, Mark.  Well, all right.  At this point,  at this point, kind of the fact is both publications have have earned their place  at the table, so to speak, you know, they've they've earned their place in the pantheon.  And and so the competition is not as heated as it once was,  because at the time it was, you know, it was competing with each other  and competing to prove that they could they could actually make,  you know, legitimate publications.  Now it's kind of been shown.  Yeah. Yeah.  Nobody questions the fact that in gadget and gizmodo legitimate publications now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what's the latest?  The last I heard was that the San Mateo  police decided to hold off on their investigation,  pending a ruling on the shield laws, because there's some question  whether their search warrant was legal given California and federal protection laws.  And until they get a ruling for sure, they're not going to look at Jason's stuff.  Meanwhile, Jason doesn't have a computer, doesn't have an iPad,  doesn't have business cards because they took those two.  And he's just kind of floating in space. Poor guy.  Is there an update, Dwight, on that story?  I mean, what they're just we're just in hold right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. The last I've seen is that they're they simply are sitting on it.  I'm not sure who they're asking.  I guess it would maybe be California attorney general  or maybe just the DA.  But at this point, you know, it's the investigation is in limbo.  And I imagine, you know, that somebody at Gizmodo can  can loan Jason maybe an old HP notebook.  You know, something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something. Well, you know, this has made his career in some ways.  If he doesn't go to jail, it's good.  You know, this is a good thing.  If he goes to jail, it's not so good.  Do you think it's Jason that's that's they're investigating?  Who are they investigating?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're I mean, he obviously is at the root  because he's in the video holding the phone.  You know, he's the guy going, this is the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that actually doesn't necessarily mean anything.  No, but I mean, in terms of the criminal prosecution,  if they take this to court, they're not looking.  They don't care who's who's showing the phone.  They're trying to figure out who bought it.  No, but the reason they went to his house is if they're looking for evidence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The chances are that most of the evidence that they need  is the root of it is going to be at Jason's house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why they want. And that's what they said.  They said, no, he's not a suspect.  We're just investigating. Right.  They're looking for evidence.  I'd hate to be that kind of suspect, Mark Millian.  Oh, let's take all your crap.  We're just investigating. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, at my publication, we get a little bit more protection.  And I'm willing to bet we have a lot more lawyers.  Well, that's an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, just because you're an actual newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The kids we wouldn't let we wouldn't let the police in the building.  They wouldn't be able to break into our office  and just lift my computer off of their desk and walk out.  Jason was working out of his home. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He is interesting because the chief counsel, the CEO at Gawker.  Had given him an email saying to hold show show this to the cops when they come.  That says California shield laws prohibit you from searching this premise.  And the cop said, oh, that's interesting.  I'll keep that. We'll have that also as part of the evidence.  Thank you. What else you got?  Because they've been there for two hours when he came home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the question, the debate is to California shield laws  shield journalists from situations where they may have committed a felony.  And that's that's the question here.  There's the investigation is not to find out  who supplied them with the phone and who committed that act.  The investigation is about the felony or supposed felony act  of purchasing stolen merchandise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So he's pointing out that this is like three years ago, Internet time.  It happened. We found out about it on Monday.  And it does feel like old news.  So we're going to wrap it up. But it's a fascinating story.  We've talked to a number of lawyers.  We had Denise Howell on MacBreak Weekly.  We've or was it? Yeah, it was MacBreak Weekly.  We've had, you know, there's the EFF has weighed in.  The New York Times has talked to lawyers and there doesn't seem to be agreement  about exactly what's going on.  Or who exactly, you know, is protected by shield rules.  According to somebody in our chat room, I don't know.  I'd like to find the source of this.  They the police think they found the culprit and he's regretful about it.  The guy who actually stole the phone.  This is a mashable story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His name has come out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The guy who wired out at him.  I'm really surprised that it took this long.  I mean, he shopped this to pretty much every technology publication out there.  Engadget, Gizmodo, Wired, CNET.  Can I say his name? I guess I can say his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twenty one year old Brian Hogan of Redwood City.  Wired uncovered his identity after following a trail of clues  on social media websites, some of which have now been taken down.  He has an attorney, Jeffrey Bornstein, who provided a statement to Wired stating,  quote, Hogan regrets his mistake in not doing more to return the phone.  Apparently, he had a friend try to contact AppleCare to return the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not the best way to. Huh?  You know, of course, we call it tech support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What more can he do? You guys missing a phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, he's got a lawyer and I think if I were him, I'd have a lawyer too.  And if there is a criminal investigation, clearly it's going to center around  whoever they think got the phone originally.  Interesting that the guy at Apple, as far as we know, still has not been fired.  The original engineer, we won't say his name.  I think he should be somewhat protected until he's, you know,  there's some evidence that he's culpable of a crime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it doesn't matter that that guy is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they ought to have him on the stage showing the new version of my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And one more thing, Mr. Gray, there's a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's you know, in that in that story, the Wired story,  one of the funny things is towards the end of it,  the attorney is trying to paint a picture of of Hogan as a guy  who's never been in trouble before and actually pulls out the line that he  that he works with Chinese orphans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's nice.  And that nice. That's sweet.  He obviously must have known what he saw there.  Sorry, it's you know, it's a great story.  I'm sure there'll be more.  We will probably talk more about it.  But as we hadn't covered on Twitter, there you go.  There's the latest.  It'd be easy to find out what's going on with that.  And I did want to ask these three esteemed panelists  what they thought about it.  This has been a week for acquisitions.  HP buys Palm. Apple buys Siri.  There's more.  We will talk about that in just a little bit.  But we're going to take a break right now.  Dwight Silverman is with us from the Houston Chronicle,  Mark Millian from the LA Times and from GDGT.com.  Our good friend Ryan Block.  This is a tweet.  Before I go much further, I want to tell you about something brand new  from the folks at Citrix.  It's called Go To Training.  Wow, this is a great idea.  You know, they do that. Go to my PC, the remote access program.  They do go to meeting, which is great for business.  Go to training takes that backbone.  The great computer sharing backbone that Citrix is known for,  remote access, and it applies it to training.  And I'll tell you, this is something we've needed for a long time.  If you've had to sit through a boring seminar at work  or you've tried some of the online training solutions,  you're going to love Go To Training.  What an improvement. Go to training.  You can have up to 200 people in your training.  You can have your presenters be anywhere in the world.  200 live, but then you can record the training.  So then this is beautiful.  So that after the training's done, you've got an on demand version of it.  There's a training content library to which you can upload any document type  or link to any website so your trainees can review it before,  during and after the training.  Of course, completely customizable training tests, polls, integrated chat.  It is just a fantastic platform.  I want you to try it free for 30 days.  If you're a trainer, this is something you need to know about.  Go to training.com. One month, absolutely free.  If you're not a trainer, but you had to put up with bad training,  which I just had to do, I'm not even going to talk about it.  That's why I'm a big fan of this.  You really ought to tell your trainer about go to training.com.  30 days free from the folks at Citrix.  Go to training.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Please tell your IT department about this.  You don't want to have to suffer any longer. Enough with the suffering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think this is a great story and really deserve to be the lead story.  I wanted to get the iPhone story out of the way.  But really, the big story today is HP buying Palm for $1.2 billion.  Did any of you see that coming?  Mark Millian, did you see that coming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did not, but since it happens, it makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes sense. It's like it's one of those, oh, I should have thought of that.  How about you, Ryan? Did you think that was going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not necessarily HP, but somebody was definitely.  I mean, they made it clear that they were going to sell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We knew when they were for sale.  HTC passed. Lenovo was kind of considered.  But I don't think I would have thought of HP.  Now, HP, $1.2 billion is not a whole lot for HP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And boy, it puts them back in the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it does. And I think that the one thing Apple has kind of proven,  especially if you look at their quarterly results over the last year  and how much of their revenue is now represented by by iPhone specifically,  is that you need to have some skin in this game.  Like you have to be in the mobile space now because the opportunity is just so  massive. And for HP to be able to snap up kind of a premium smartphone  company with its own operating system, with its own intellectual property,  it's a pretty, pretty good move for them.  The question is whether they're going to screw it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As they've known to.  Dwight, do you think it's for the iPhone or do you think the HP slate  will run not Windows 7, but WebOS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think they said during the during the announcement  and the conference call afterwards that they are looking at it for tablets.  Ryan had mentioned in a tweet that the WebOS is an embedded  OS and wouldn't necessarily work in its current form on the slate.  But the WebOS is built around Linux.  And so it should be relatively easy to port it over if they haven't already.  I'm sure somebody at at Palm had been playing around with the idea of tablets.  And I think primarily that's why HP bought it.  Yeah, I think you need to be in the mobile market,  but I don't necessarily know that mobile means smartphone.  And HP in its acquisition of Compaq  got a really nice notebook design group, which is based here in Houston.  All of their HP notebooks are designed here.  And I believe the slate was designed here as well.  And so those guys are probably just drooling to get their hands on this thing.  And and put it to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let's not forget that they're believe it or not.  I was shocked to learn this HP does sell a smartphone.  It's an IPAC, the brand it got from Compaq.  Right. Running Windows Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what's interesting is it's a really it's a very much a  early 2000s design. Oh, yeah.  It's clunky. It's very clunky.  In fact, it looks like the old palm.  It looks like the old, you know, the big fat palm smartphone.  So, you know, they've said that they're going to keep those around,  at least initially.  But my suspicion is that they won't last much longer.  Interestingly, also in that conference call,  they made a lot of soothing sounds to Microsoft and continue to say,  Oh, Microsoft is a great partner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, of course, they're going to smooth those feathers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, right. But I suspect that at Microsoft, you know, particularly since  since Steve Ballmer was on the stage at CES showing off his slate  computer running Windows 7 and now with the rumor that the the slate computer  running Windows 7 is dead, I imagine that Steve Ballmer is not happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oopsies. Yeah, this was a tech crunch room.  I don't know whether to credit or not.  Mike Harrington says the slate is dead.  So let's actually, Ryan, let me ask you, why do you say the WebOS  wouldn't work on the slate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they could design a tablet to run WebOS.  That's fine. It's just WebOS as an embedded operating system doesn't run  on the kind of processors that the slate has.  It's for an ARM processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's for an embedded processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the you know, it's like iPhone OS runs on the iPad  and on the iPhone and on the iPod Touch.  Those all run the same processors.  You can't run desktop OS 10 on that. Right.  It's it's just you can't do it.  I mean, there are ports and you could try, but that's not really the point.  The point is that these are very particular types of processors intended  for low power consumption and high performance  with very particular kinds of operations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So really, it would be just a redesigned slate.  I mean, we saw the slate specs leaked out.  It was an atom processor.  Well, it couldn't be an atom processor for WebOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, the problem with the slate is we saw all the specs.  And I mean, they were really just going after the tablet PC,  the slate PC design. It was very generic.  It has been around for many years.  I mean, it's not a new thing.  You know, there have been NECs and Toshiba's,  there have been all kinds of slate PCs been around for, you know, the last eight, nine years.  They've been crappy, frankly.  Yeah, and they've been they've been terrible.  I mean, you look at this thing, it's got USB ports.  It's got all these ports.  I mean, it's a very small slate style PC.  That's not what you want. You don't really.  I mean, OK, maybe you do want that.  That's not what I want.  I want something that's a little bit more like the iPad, where it's very optimized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want a netbook without a keyboard.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But if I wanted that, I would just get a netbook.  Yeah. Right. If I wanted if I wanted something along those lines, if I wanted a free keyboard  with every exact with every I would get it with the keyboard.  Yeah. So I mean, what they're offering, what they had on offer was a PC without a keyboard.  So what they what they need to do is they really need to rethink the slate and,  and, you know, think about it in terms of not in terms of the desktop  OS metaphor, because that thing is going to run Windows 7.  Right. They need to rethink it and, you know, think about how WebOS  would would be applied to a slate style, you know, portable device.  Mark Millian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know if our port's so bad.  I've heard from a lot of people whose biggest problem with the iPad is that they have to buy  an external dongle to plug in a camera and a separate adapter, which doesn't yet exist to print.  And I mean, this this it could be the best of both worlds.  I agree with with Dwight that Palm OS is going to be absolutely huge for this device.  They need to optimize something for the bigger tablet form factor.  And it would be an absolutely great OS for a tablet.  And the added benefit is being able to plug in your camera if you have it with you  without remembering to bring an extra adapter in order to plug that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess it really comes down to what you think the iPad.  Why? First of all, there's no question the iPad's successful.  Friday, the 3G came out.  It looks like according to Chitika, which is a website that does some interesting IP  address monitoring of iPads, that a couple of hundred thousand 3G's went out the door on Friday.  So they're now up to one point three million, according to again, Apple's not saying,  but according to Chitika, one point three million iPads sold in the first month.  It's clearly a hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There were lines for the 3G. I was surprised.  It's clearly a hit.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So if HP sold a hundred thousand of their slate, I think they'd be very, very excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More iPads were sold probably in the first weekend than tablet PCs were sold in the entire  10 years of tablet PC-dom.  I mean, this is it's a category.  I think that's an exaggeration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's actually probably very accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  However, I think it's very compelling to think of not just iPads, but Android-based  tablets or slates and maybe WebOS tablets or slates.  And I think Google's going to do Android.  Others are going to do Android.  I think HP is clearly thinking along the I mean, isn't that what we're seeing?  Isn't that why they bought WebOS?  I mean, isn't that what they want to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you have used the WebOS, you know that it's really  it's a it's a wonderful operating system.  And I could see using those cards on a tablet,  moving the cards around to multitask, flicking them away.  I think it would make an excellent web tablet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was wrong with the pre?  The only thing wrong with the pre was it was sluggish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The pre was sluggish.  I actually think that the WebOS would do better on a bigger screen.  And it's a good operating system for maybe the five to seven inch,  five to seven inch form factor.  I don't think you necessarily have to get as big as the iPad.  That that one of the problems with windows and all of these other desktop  operating systems is that they're designed for mice and keyboards.  And as Ryan said, that's just, you know, that that doesn't work.  So it's late. It's clunky.  But the WebOS, when you look at it and you back, if you get some mobile  OS, yes, very much so.  And not and actually, again, I think it would do better on a tablet  than it has on the pre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For from those, I'm sure I'll see if you three of you have seen Windows  mobile seven phone windows phone seven mobile.  And that is Microsoft's attempt to leave behind the legacy of desktop  OS crammed into a small device and make something zoom like for a phone.  Is that going to be a credit?  Is that going to be the fourth?  We've got Android WebOS, iPad OS.  Are we going to see where iPhone OS are we going to see  is Windows seven phone phone seven going to be  aside from the bad name going to be the fourth in that. Group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ryan start thinking about tablets, Mark.  I mean, they they they're just now building a decent phone  OS and and manufacturers are now looking to Microsoft for, well,  what do we put on these tablets?  And all Microsoft proved with the slate is that they don't know  that the slate Windows seven optimized tablet OS was hideous.  It's it there are rumors that we talked about that HP just doesn't want it.  We're not we're not going to use this because it's it just doesn't work.  So the that software was one of the two biggest problems with the slate.  The other was battery life.  I think it was it was slated to to have five and a half hours of battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Half the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the thing the one thing to remember here,  and this has been, I think, a popular topic of conversation.  How does phone seven fit into Microsoft's tablet strategy?  Is there going to be a tablet optimized version of phone seven?  And if so, how could they continue to call it phone seven?  The thing to remember here, though, is that tablets are I mean,  this is like the second coming of tablets, right?  Tablets have been around for a long time.  It's actually the fourth coming. But yeah, yeah.  Now they're kind of popular among consumers, but relatively speaking, not so much.  I mean, we're talking about a potential market here of a few million units a year,  which is great, considering how few how few units  tablets have sold over the last decade or so.  But if you compare that to the phone space,  you know, they sell their few million units, a few million phones moved every day.  I mean, there are literally billions of phones sold.  So I mean, no space, no one puts everybody else to shame, really.  Yeah. The mobile space kind of old news, I think, to people like us  and to people who are listening to Twitter.  But the fact is, that's that's where you want to be first.  You know, you got it.  You got to really get your skin in the game in the phone space,  which is, again, I think why HP bought Palm.  And and once you've done that, once you kind of establish yourself as a player,  then you can worry about the tablets.  I'm not saying that they shouldn't worry about that.  But I think they really need to worry a lot more about phones right now,  because that's that's what's selling.  You know, that's what everybody's buying.  Except that it's going to take a while to heat up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But what HP knows is the kind of form factor that  I mean, is closer to the tablet than it is to phones.  The stuff that they've done with phones have been, frankly, awful.  And I think that, you know, they can they can give Palm  the money and the R&D support.  But but in their in their corporate boardroom and in their  in HP's own design group, they're they're drooling over this.  And I think they're going to see if they can get some traction in the smartphone  market. But if they can't, HP has a tendency then to take the  intellectual property and absorb it into other products.  It'll be on printers.  Right. Look at look at what they did with Voodoo.  They bought this really hot game company, game PC company called Voodoo.  And they started out by trying to take the Voodoo model  with really hot souped up machines and HP eyes it.  And it didn't really work.  They wound they tried a couple of different things.  And now they've taken the technology that Voodoo had kind of championed  and moved it back into their into their desktop and some of their notebook machines.  And so I think what HP will do is they'll try to see if they could get  Palm going, give it a second life.  But I wouldn't give it I wouldn't give them much more than a year, a year and a half  before they say to heck with it and wind up focusing on the stuff they know best,  which is tablets and notebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to think, though, I liked WebOS.  I thought it was very impressive.  And you got to think that the one thing Palm lacked was marketing ability, money,  distribution channels, the one thing that like the eight things they lacked.  They you know, those ads with the redhead were bizarre.  They were on Sprint.  And given a company like HP with with marketing, with channels, with plenty of cash,  if WebOS is going to succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the best place for it to be, yes.  Yeah, they do need to get more phones out there.  They're going to do phone.  They're not known as a phone company.  That's for sure. They're not known.  But Palm is. So if they could give you maybe they keep the Palm brand.  Right. They may.  I think you're going to see some things in the pipeline.  It's too good a brand to kill.  Right. Isn't there something called the C40?  That is a next gen pre called the C40 that's rumored to be coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say that when HP made the acquisition, they said,  we're going to double down on WebOS.  They didn't talk about Palm phones particularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They really talked about WebOS. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you think the phones, the phones at this point are almost secondary  to the operating system.  You know, I mean, phones, if you really look at like phone hardware,  it hasn't really changed a whole lot in the past couple of years.  I mean, once 3G is like really kind of become pervasive in the United States,  there's not a whole lot left to do.  I mean, you look at you look at the last gen iPhone, I guess  the current gen iPhone, you know, the 3G as compared to the next iPhone.  You're not going to see a lot of real differences.  I mean, we're just talking about cameras. Right.  It's different cameras and kind of a different look and maybe a faster processor.  But fundamentally, it's the same thing.  So hardware is actually not really the interesting thing anymore.  It's the OS.  The phone hardware has become.  It's not even the OS. It's important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not even the OS. It's the apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's the apps.  It's the apps that the OS has to have those apps. Right.  And that's I think that's where Palm kind of squandered  its biggest opportunity here was they did not do a good enough job  of getting developers to their platform.  And that might have changed their fortunes before they sold HP.  But can HP do that?  You know, I don't think it's a matter of can HP do it or can Palm.  I think Palm could have done it.  I think that they just didn't do it.  They could have pushed harder that that direction.  And I think maybe they underestimated how important it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's fun because really  everybody's guessing and and the future didn't is slowly becoming clear.  And I don't think anybody could have predicted  that the iPad was going to be what the iPad is.  I don't think when I know when Apple said we're going to do a phone,  I thought, oh, God, do they could?  How could they possibly succeed in this space?  Who knew Apple didn't know that the apps would be all it would be all about the apps.  When Apple released the iPhone, they said, no, no, you're going to do  you're going to do it on the web. You don't we don't need apps.  I mean, every step of the way, it's been kind of unfolding  and developing in kind of an unusual and unexpected way, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, you don't think that Apple knew that they were going to put apps on the iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you think Steve Jobs was disingenuous?  Steve Jobs was saying, oh, you just develop web apps and we don't have to.  You think he knew they were going to do an app store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, just just the same way that he was talking about how terrible ebook readers are  and he wants to read ebooks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody wants to watch movies on a little screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody wants to. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, this is a classic classic jobs.  You know, he tells you all the things that you shouldn't be doing with your company  and all the all the technologies you shouldn't be developing at your at your  at your company until he develops them.  I mean, it's just you know, it's it's classic bait and switch.  And and, you know, it's it's it's he's totally diversionary.  And that's fine. I mean, they, you know, they do a really good job that way.  But I mean, that's it's really nothing new the way that he does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know.  Well, I guess, you know, look, it's they've been pretty smart, haven't they?  Whatever they're doing.  Steve Jobs wrote a long letter on Apple dot com about why we're not going with Flash.  I would like to contrast that and compare it to a really great article  by a Scottish blogger named Charlie Strauss.  The real reason why Steve Jobs hates Flash will talk about both of these.  And and a lot more about the tech news.  This is this is a very interesting week.  And we there is there, as I mentioned, Apple and Siri, there's some other stuff  going on, a few other things going on out there.  But before we get too far down that road,  let's talk about one of our great sponsors, the folks at Squarespace dot com.  Dane was out there in New York City  visiting with them in their beautiful offices in Soho.  What a great bunch of people.  Anthony and the other Dean and the gang, they started Squarespace in college  when they were looking for a better blogging platform.  But Squarespace now is so much more than a blogging platform.  If you go to Squarespace dot com,  you're going to see an incredible tool.  It's hosting and a content management.  And everything you need to make a great website, go to Squarespace dot com slash  tweet. You can try it free for a couple of weeks.  And by the way, you can import all your content if you're on a movable type  blog or WordPress or type pad or blogger.  Seamless blog importing means you can just, you know, go there,  set up a beautiful skin because they have some great templates,  import your content and see exactly what your blog would look like  on the Squarespace platform.  You never run out of bandwidth, by the way, their virtual server technology  means that they can throw bandwidth at your site the minute it's needed.  Great website started eight dollars a month.  And if you use Twitter as the coupon code when you sign up for your website,  when you decide to buy one, you'll get 10 percent off forever.  Ten percent off forever.  I like that.  You're Clayton's got a new site. I love Clayton's site on Squarespace.  I think that picture is tongue in cheek.  I hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So he's a good. Oh, I love Clayton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gadget sci fi music sarcasm.  There he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All these great sites.  This is a great way to get an idea of what Squarespace can do is in the example  section, because unlike a lot of other platforms,  there's no Squarespace look.  You can make it look like anything you want.  It's your site. Nobody's going to say, oh, yeah, I've seen that before.  No, no, no. Every site is unique.  Every site is different. Every site is beautiful.  And you don't have to be a designer because the templates you start with  and then the very simple configuration tools  they provide you with make it so easy.  You don't have to be a pro to have a site that looks like a pro designed it.  You just need to go to Squarespace dot com Squarespace dot com slash.  Try it out for two weeks.  And if you're a photographer, you're going to love the galleries  they have here. Just gorgeous.  And if you know CSS, I mean, you can do anything.  There's no limit to what you can do.  JavaScript, CSS, of course, great commenting system, great statistics.  Yes, this guy's a wedding photographer.  Really neat stuff. Squarespace dot com slash.  Do take a look, by the way, at the iPhone application.  I cannot wait till the iPad version comes out.  The best blogging software Squarespace dot com slash.  We thank them so much for their support this week in tech.  Do you think Apple buying Siri says anything about Apple's plans?  Siri is a very cool program  that lets you talk to your iPhone and tell it things in natural language  like book me a table for two tonight at.  You know, French laundry and or what's the score in the Giants game?  And it will give you the answers.  It's really kind of it's not search.  It's kind of the next thing.  I think Apple would love to get beyond search.  They know Google owns that.  Siri is a very interesting acquisition.  Any thoughts on that, Mark Millian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, Siri rocks.  I actually use that quite a bit.  There's two major problems with it in that the design is not very nice.  It's not Apple at all.  Yeah. And one would assume that Apple buys it.  Apple will take it under its wing and and envelop it with its or kill it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  like they just did with Lala.  I was going to say the exact same thing.  I think that you can kiss Siri goodbye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's going away, I guess, with Lala.  They might still do a streaming kind of Lala style iTunes  or they might have just one of the guys.  Maybe they just want to the guys.  That's maybe what they want at Siri.  They just want the guys.  Obviously, there's some smart fellas behind it or gals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I think they're a lot of accu-hires happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They like that voice capability.  The natural language thing.  The natural language.  One of the things that's very cool, if you have an Android 2.1 or 2.2.  I love that.  You do it out yet is the ability to talk to it into any text field.  Right.  Well, what if they put in the next iPhone the ability not just to be  not just to talk text into the fields, but for it to understand what you want.  Which is what Siri is.  So I could see them taking that technology and building it into the iPhone OS  and go and Google what better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I was saying.  That search screen on the iPhone, which isn't very good.  I could see that being just the Siri app built in.  You flip you slide over one one home screen and you get this fully  featured search app that can pull from the Internet and pull from the  contents on your phone and you can use voice to search through it.  And it's like a digital assistant.  I feel like Siri, the concept is good enough to be something that's built  directly into the phone and could replace their search function.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it does seem to me that it's a direct response to Android 2.1.  Has anybody tried the incredible?  I played with one yesterday.  Of course you have one.  I'm sure Ryan, you like it.  I do.  What kind of battery life are you getting on camera?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's a great fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How about the battery life though, guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, it's pretty good.  It suffers from the same Android problems that every Android OS has  suffered from in terms of battery life.  It's just you run things in the background and it starts to suck up.  Suck up a lot of power, especially the Twitter apps.  I'll sometimes forget and I'll have peep going, which is the one that  comes with this particular HTC model made by HTC and the new Twitter app.  I'll have running as well and just forget and it'll be sucking down  background power both at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That Twitter app sucks, by the way.  Twitter's own app.  It's not the best Android app.  Seismic's better.  Twitter made that for them.  Twitter made it.  Well, it spends all this energy having clouds float around.  I don't want clouds.  I want functionality.  You like it?  Is that what you use?  You use peep?  You use that?  Or what do you...  Mark?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've been using peep for the most part, but it's decent.  I mean, there's really not a whole lot that Twitter main Twitter app  developers can do anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess you're right.  It's Twitter's world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We just live in it.  Let Twitter be Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I mean, they're really pushing sort of these for app developers to go into  these alternative spaces.  Like they opened up that annotation feature because they want to see...  I was talking to Jack Dorsey in New York a couple of weeks ago, and he was like,  sometimes developers need a push.  Sometimes we need to say, we're going to create this base app for the phones and  we're going to have it for every platform.  So you guys don't need to worry about that.  Here are all these other cool things to play with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't worry about your revenue, your model, the application you spent six months  writing.  Don't worry about that.  We got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, let's be totally honest and fair.  And I say this with all respect to my friends, like Loic, who he's done a great  job with Seesmic.  But if you have built an entire business around somebody else's platform, you're  not allowed.  I'm telling you, I am demanding that you not be surprised or shocked when something  happens and the platform changes and your business model is messed up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You say there's no whining for parasites, not allowed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not that it's not allowed.  It's just if you're going to put the entire well-being of your business on one  single thing that Twitter could change in a heartbeat or the Facebook could change  in a heartbeat, then you haven't done a very good job with your business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell that to Mr. Farmville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder what they're thinking over there right now because they're making an  ungodly amount of money.  Like half a billion dollars a year.  Yeah, but that could change very quickly.  I mean, what if Facebook tomorrow says, OK, we're kind of we've had enough of these  shady tactics that are going on with some of the games in our platform.  So we're going to say no more games and we're going to have an online game house.  We're going to own it.  We're going to operate it.  We're going to make our own Farmville and sorry, Zynga, maybe within the right to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that. This is the world we live in, by the way, if you're an Apple developer, you  live and die by what Steve Jobs says.  And if heaven for Fenn, you're an Apple gaming platform like OpenFaint or  Plus, and Apple says we're going to do a gaming system, it's like, OK.  Or if you're an ad mob type, you know, mobile ad platform and Apple says we're  going to do ads.  I mean, this seems to be happening more and more, doesn't it?  It used to be in the in my day, Microsoft would do anything to appease developers  because you don't have a platform unless you have people developing for it.  Now it really looks like these companies couldn't care less.  The developers are like, we got you.  You go, you go wherever we say you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know about that. It's been happening for a while.  Like you look at when Microsoft integrated Internet Explorer into Windows and it's  this free browser. So why are you going to pay for Netscape?  And that completely changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Killed Netscape. You know, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And something like Apple did it, what, like four or five years ago when  Confabulator was this awesome widgets platform that Yahoo ends up buying turns  into Yahoo widgets and then dashboard a year later we get dashboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess you're right.  Maybe it's nothing new. You're an old fart like me, Dwight.  Does this seem like it's something new or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I was thinking about AOL that when AOL had businesses that built up around  it plugged into its plugged into its client and then suddenly they said in a  lot of and there was some revenue derived from that for businesses who  contributed to the client.  And then when when AOL said we're going to go free and the client will be free  and everybody can connect all of a sudden, a lot of these businesses, their  value is much less. And now what is AOL?  It's a collection of websites.  AOL just think it think it happens a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AOL just sold a ICQ to a Russian developer for one hundred eighty seven

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  million. I think that's actually a good deal.  I think I take the money and run, although investors were hoping for more

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  digital sky technologies, which, by the way, to tie this all together, has a big  stake in Facebook and Zynga.  Sky Net, it's Sky Net digital Sky Net technologies.  Shares of AOL dropped four dollars on this news.  Well, maybe that's no, I'm sorry, wasn't this news.  It was the fact that their profit fell by 59 percent.  That that was that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not ICQ.  No, we love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How much do they pay for ICQ originally?  Did they? Oh, that's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Terms of like four or five hundred million.  They lost a lot of money. They did.  But not surprisingly, it was one of those, you know, Web one point no  properties clearly clearly is not going to go for what they they bought it at in

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the 90s. Example of how things change.  And, you know, at the time, AOL had aim and it seemed like a sensible thing to  consolidate and own the instant messenger market.  And things went differently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For what it's worth, when you're talking about the instant messenger market,  AOL still does pretty much own it.  If you're talking about the kind of Web based I am market like I guess, yeah,  and Facebook chat. I mean, those are different.  I would I would put those in a different space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's only in the US, though.  I mean, you look at worldwide stats and I don't even think it's in the top five.  It's all about when is messenger and Skype Skype is number one.  And even Yahoo Messenger worldwide has a bigger market share than AIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a real revelation to me when I went to Canada and the dominant, I mean,  totally dominant messengers is MSN messenger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is in a lot of countries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't aim.  It's like what you're on. What they don't know.  Maybe because it's America online.  I don't know. But MSN is huge in Canada and I think in a lot of countries.  And I never used MSN messenger.  So.  I am just I think I I am is a is a cautionary tale to  Twitter and other.  Of these systems that if you if you let it fragment into too many,  you know, you have too many dial tones and people can't talk to one another.  Even it's just not going to nobody's going to succeed.  You need one platform, one standard, preferably in my opinion, open.  Which brings us to Steve Jobs letter about why we're not using Flash.  So I'm just curious, I'm not going to say what I think.  What do you think of this letter?  Let's start with let's go in the upper upper left corner to block Mr.  Dwight Silverman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad Steve Jobs finally wrote in his blog again.  It's been a long time since he blogged.  None of it was new.  You know, the stuff that he wrote, he has said before.  I found it interesting that he chose to write about that now  with all of the other criticism that's been leveled at Apple,  that kind of he out of the blue popped up and wrote about Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But well, it's kind of timely because CS5 just came out  and he had clobbered the cross platform development and the iPads out.  A lot of people saying, oh, well, OK, not not going to have iPad Flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it's a, you know, I guess it's an explainer to to developers.  And and the rest of us kind of just get to sit and and critique it.  But I'm, you know, frankly, there was not much new there.  And the tone and the attitude was was almost condescending.  And I keep thinking about those things that I've been reading on  how he has a grudge against Adobe  because of how Adobe kind of walked away from Apple  when it was in on its in its death throes and embraced Windows.  What do you think, Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you say when you say condescending, condescending to who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he was trying to sound statesmanlike, but it came off  condescending to Adobe, condescending to those folks who support  cross platform development.  I think he was kind of just saying, let me read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My best Alex Trebek voice.  Oh, I'm sorry.  Flash was created during the PC era for PCs and mice.  Flash is a successful business for Adobe.  We can understand why they want to push it beyond PCs.  But the mobile era, it's all about low power devices, touch interfaces  and open web standards, all areas where flash all short.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a condescending.  Nice job. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You got to do the Alex Trebek to really get the condescension in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm going to be squarely not on the side of Steve in particular,  but in my opinion, anyone doing what they can to  diminish the importance and reliance on flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree. I think in the long run, if everybody moves off of flash  and it looks like, you know, iPhone and iPad and iPod  touch is so important that a lot of sites are, that's a good thing in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, you know, Adobe argues that flash is an open standard.  I think that there are a lot of people who would argue against that.  Either way, even if it is an open standard, it's a standard  controlled by one company and it's no longer necessary.  I mean, we're getting to the point now  where the burgeoning H2O5 standards, CSS, JavaScript and H264  completely negate the need for flash.  And there are the very real problems that Steve presented.  And it's not these are not new problems.  These have always been problems with flash.  If you've ever looked at what happens to your computer's resources  when you're running a lot of flash, you know,  you know, the idea that flash does not consume a lot of your CPU,  that it doesn't run down your battery faster.  That it is every bit as, you know, high performing as native web technologies.  I mean, it's it's just completely false.  There's there's you can't really argue with these facts.  So the one thing that you can do is kind of say, well, you know, here,  here are the things that flash is good for.  Here are the things that flash are is needed for right now.  And there are a few things, but the number of those things  that flash is needed for is decreasing almost by the day.  And that is part of the reason why jobs is letters so timely.  And frankly, there's not a lot to argue with in that letter.  Well, it's very accurate overall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he kind of neglected the fact that it's also a really good business for Apple.  To screw Adobe, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in what regard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think you could talk about the fact that Apple doesn't want  cross platform development on its iPhone and iPad, because then somebody  might develop an application for other people besides just Apple.  They want to kind of completely hog the space.  No, that's good for Apple, not necessarily good for users.  Steve says it's good for users, but is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think that no company has ever been able to fill on the promise of right  once, you know, run anywhere in in a way that is actually  as high quality as an app that's been written native for a platform.  And when we're talking about the mobile space, it's not enough for it to just run.  It has to run and do things that are optimized to the experience.  And so, you know, when I'm thinking about the, you know, the mobile apps  that we might do for our site, it had never even occurred to me.  Well, I mean, it occurred to me, but it was never a possibility in my mind  that we would do a, you know, a cross platform kind of, you know,  one of those crappy apps like like PhoneGap or whatever, because  you need to write native to the platform that you're running it in.  And if you're going to be able to take advantage of the technologies of the platform,  you just have to do that.  So for Apple to be beholden to anybody else's technology  when when they're building,  when they're trying to build an app ecosystem on their own on their own  platform is is crazy.  And, you know, I think that anybody else should be taking that stance, too.  I think Microsoft, Palm, Android, they should all be looking at this  in the exact same way, which is, you know, you need to be writing apps  that are meant for this platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You agree, Mark.  What what was your take on this jobs letter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't totally buy the the the like that there's this fear from Apple  that everybody's going to start making games for Flash and not for the iPhone.  Games for Flash just really aren't that good in general.  And for the most part, Ryan's right.  HML five is really catching up to Flash and what it can do.  There are HTML five games that I've played on my iPhone.  I think the site is called Akihabara, and there's this little like.  Oh, yeah, that's a great site. Yeah.  Yeah. And it works on the iPhone. It works on the iPad.  I agree with the underlying principles of moving beyond Flash,  because really, Flash sucks, but it's still everywhere.  And maybe this push from Apple, this is a push that  that that the Internet needs in order to get rid of this proprietary standard.  But I I still am annoyed when I go to like Gawker TV or  New York Times dot com and hit a video that's in Flash and I just can't view it.  What am I going to say? Oh, it's not important because it's made in Flash.  I'm just not going to watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK. Akihabara is a HTML five library that allows you very easily, I guess,  to create eight and 16 bit era games in JavaScript that run in HTML five browsers.  It's KESIEV dot com slash Akihabara.  Um, it's certainly a good demo.  Have you been following the code?  See, one of the things that HTML five is going to have to resolve  is what video codec to use.  And this is suddenly emerging as a huge fight because H dot two sixty four,  which kind of has the inside track on all of this, is not.  Open, it's owned by MPEG LA, which charges five million dollars as its license fee.  So Mozilla, among others, there's the HTML five  conferences coming up is saying we're not going to support H dot two sixty four.  We want to don't want to pay the license fee.  Plus, we believe it should not be a patented technology.  They're going to support Og Theora or maybe a Google's VPA,  which they got when they bought on to.  And there's a there's a there's a real kind of battle going on around H dot two sixty four.  I'll point you to some articles.  Bnet has an article in the mobile video standards fight.  Consumers are poised to lose.  If H dot two sixty four wins.  For instance, I didn't know this.  If you buy a camcorder that supports AVCHD,  which is an H two sixty four standard, you probably know about this, Ryan.  There is in the license fee says you may not use this camcorder for commercial work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's tricky.  And the thing with Og in in this is part of the reason why Google  bought onto in order to get VPA.  Part of the thing with August, although it was developed to be open source,  there's still a lot of debate that that it's still using or I should say,  kind of overlapping some of the intellectual property  that that is, you know, created by the MPEG LA,  which owns H two six four and some of these other things.  It's not it's never intentional, but it's like, you know,  there are only so many ways to skin a cat, so to speak.  And and, you know, there are some times where you may not know  that you're infringing on other people's intellectual property and you are.  So, you know, some companies have actually shied away from Og  because they think that they might get submarine in the in the patent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Much as HTC will talk about this and Microsoft, the Linux issue  because Microsoft. Yeah, exactly.  Now, IE9 says Microsoft says we're going to support H two sixty four only.  Right.  Opera and Firefox says we're not going to support H two sixty four.  So HML five is not in the clear by any means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, this this doesn't relate to HML five directly.  HML five will continue to move ahead with or without these codecs.  But you've got to settle on a standard.  Yeah, but that again, that that standard has nothing to do  with HML five.  HML five is a standard for markup on the web and for displaying this content.  The codec is that's at the browser level and that has to be worked out.  But it's not going to delay the rollout of HML five itself.  It will just delay how long it takes for us to move away from flash.  Video. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve Jobs sent an email out on April 30th.  You know, I love how Steve is talking to people now through email.  This is his new method.  Hugo Roy sent him an email questioning this choice over H.264 over AGG and so forth.  And Jobs said exactly what you said, Ryan, in his response, sent from my iPad, by the way.  All video codecs are covered by patents.  A patent pool is being assembled to go after Theora and other quote open source codecs now.  Unfortunately, just because something is open source doesn't mean or guarantee that it doesn't  infringe on others patents.  An open standard is different from being royalty free or open source.  But that's a long response for Steve.  He usually doesn't type so much on his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He usually just says, nope.  Yep. Nope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a complicated issue, though, you know, I mean, we like to think that just because  something is open source doesn't, you know, means that it's not going to be affected by  these technologies. The thing is, like I said, sometimes you don't know.  You don't know what you don't know.  And so as you're building out AGG, you might be infringing on some obscure MPEG LA IP.  And then, you know, you've gotten away with it so far because it hasn't really been widely  used. But at some point, MPEG LA or other players might decide that they want to go after you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So maybe VP8 is the way to go, because at least, you know, Google wants to keep it open, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they want to, but they haven't made a completely open license yet.  And I think people are assuming that that's what's going to happen.  But we don't know.  That could solve the problem.  Part of what we've been kind of waiting for is to know what the MPEG LA is actually going to do with  H.264. So they've kept it on like a pseudo open license where it doesn't cost anything to  implement, I think, until like 2012 or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on in, the water's fine.  Come on, use that codec.  You're going to love H.264.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's up to adopt it.  And then and then they hit you.  Or not. We don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We don't know. But why take the chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's tricky.  But I mean, you know, this is this is a problem with Flash, too, because Flash is continually  using H.264 as the video codec behind the player.  YouTube has moved to H.264 as the video codec behind all of their videos.  And it's still playing in a Flash player.  But if you swap out the player for an HTML5 player, you still have the IP issues of which codec  you're using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I mentioned Charlie Strauss in his blog, Charlie's Diary.  We tried to get Charlie on the show and he never heard of Twitch.  So he says, I'm busy.  But he's in Scotland.  Why should he bother?  But he wrote, I thought this was very interesting.  Anti Pope dot org, his blog.  I've got a theory and it's this Steve Jobs believes he's gambling Apple's future.  On an all or nothing push into a new market.  HP have woken up and smelled the forest fire two or three years late.  Microsoft are mired in a tar pit, unable to grasp that the inferno heading towards them  is going to burn down the entire ecosystem in which they exist.  There is a smell of panic in the air.  And here's why.  He says, we've known since the 90s that the internet was the future of computing with  increased bandwidth.  Data doesn't need to be trapped in the hard drives of our desktop computers.  Data and interaction could follow us out into the world we live.  He says, mobile is where it's happening.  And the PC industry is dying because margins in the PC industry are so razor thin.  He says, PCs are becoming commodity items.  With margins of typical netbooks or desktop PCs under 10%, Apple survived because they  make a premium product.  But he believes in the long run, it's not going to be the PC that survives.  The iPhone OS, the iPad, isn't just the start of a whole new range of Apple computers.  He says it's a hugely ambitious attempt to keep Apple relevant to the future of computing.  Once Moore's Law tapers off and the personal computer industry craters and turns into a  profitability wasteland.  Steve has realized that ownership of the channel is everything.  The iTunes store, the app store.  He says, even if he's reduced to giving away the machines, as long as he can charge rent  for access to data or apps, he's got a business model.  Does that make sense?  He calls it the Macapopelix.  I can't pronounce it.  The Macapocalypse.  In fact, the Apple Design Awards at the WWDC will only be open, and this was kind of interesting  tea leaves, only open to iPhone and iPad apps.  No OS X apps will be offered a design award.  Shocked silence from the panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, this is not new.  If you look at web OS, if you look at phone 7, even to a certain extent Android, I mean,  everybody wants to kind of own their ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But are we in a post PC era?  I mean, is that why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think it's way too early to make any claims like that.  I don't see the PC coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you're siloing Dwight, if you would do something, something magical.  I don't know what.  It's been exactly one hour.  It's something about this chipset.  After one hour, it starts doing this weird thing and all you have to do is unplug and  plug it in again and suddenly the driver reloads or something.  It's like a memory leak in the thing.  That's a nice chair, by the way, Dwight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There he is, all better.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  So I think this is, I think, I agree with Ryan.  I don't believe that this is new and people have been predicting the end of the PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  I remember asking it was at Comdex.  That's how long ago it was.  Asking the chairman of Intel, is the PC dead?  He said, what are you talking about?  You nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And of course, Apple sees things from its own perspective.  You know, I think that open is good and open wins a lot of times, whether it wins in the  mobile space and in the when you're connecting to to telecom broadband networks, whether  it wins.  I don't know yet.  We'll see what happens with Android.  But I think that Apple is planning on that and that big mysterious data center out in  North Carolina, I think is for iTunes.com and a lot of other services.  The next Lala.  That's where Lala will be.  But I think Apple will always build.  I mean, they have a lot of infrastructure and a lot of design investment in MacBooks,  MacBook Pros, maybe less so now in the in the iMac and the desktops.  But I think that you will see PCs go on for a long, long time.  I mean, look, you know, the the refrigerator market is everybody has a refrigerator, but  you know, there's definitely a refrigerator industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but that's saying it's saturated.  But I don't think it's saturated.  I think that it no longer serves us with lightweight portable devices, ubiquitous, high speed  mobile Internet.  Who needs a PC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think it depends on the work you're doing.  You know, if you are editing high definition video, you don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, some people do that, but that's a small minority of people that small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you want you want the appropriate tool for the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to have a PC to write iPad apps.  People are going to have PCs.  I'm not saying they're gone.  I think normal people, though, may be much less interested in PCs in five years.  That's the point here.  And if you're going to if you are HP, see, don't you think for all the stroking  HP did to Microsoft that really HP is looking past it up to a post Windows time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think every company that deals with Microsoft and has dealt with Microsoft for a long  time would like there to be a post Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's it. I know I know Intel, I know Craig.  No, it was Andy Grove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how long ago it was.  I remember I was talking to him and he was off camera and off the record.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He said, I hate Microsoft.  I hate them.  Kill them.  All right. I think it's an interesting conversation.  Maybe it's premature to ask this, but I wouldn't be surprised if in five or ten  years we're looked back and we say, oh, yeah, this was that was kind of the PC  kind of started to go away.  It's a commodity market.  It's a razor thin margins.  And frankly, consumers want something easier, simpler, portable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. This is a watershed month, I think.  That's what I think.  I think it's I think that the I mean, certainly ten years from now, you can go  back and if if if MP3 files are still supported on the web, you can go back and  listen to this. But I'll I'll do a prediction that the release of the iPad, the  acquisition of Palm, kind of the posturing over Flash and the kind of everything  that you've been seeing right now, right down to Jason Chen's computers being  confiscated because it's all part of the same story, right, is going to be  considered this is going to be a watershed time in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Agreed, Ryan Block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so, but I think people are I mean, you already touched on this, Leo.  I think people are very quick and in almost sometimes a little bit gleeful to  predict the death of the PC.  I don't see it going anywhere.  Now, I see there as being a very possibly being a new third device that people care  about, and that's the tablet.  But even that is yet to be seen.  Yeah, I mean, I would say I would say with with with iPad having used it and  seeing how it fits into my life personally, that I think other people will  find that this is a really great computing experience.  But it I mean, it is not yet proven.  All right.  If you really look at things like, you know, we all kind of take it for granted,  but not everybody who owns a PC has one of these yet, obviously.  And it's going to be years before we know if this is actually just kind of a flash  in the pan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And meanwhile, Lucid Links comes out Ubuntu 10.04.  They march on, they soldier on.  How about you, Mark Millian?  You're a young person.  People of your age.  What do they think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just glad we get to see a lot of the bickering between the big companies  happening out in the open.  I mean, for the most part with HP, they're like, we love you, Microsoft, but  we bought this company and they're direct competitor in many spaces.  But I think I'm glad that the Apple Adobe thing has finally come out in the open.  Like among people who watch that space closely, it was like, yeah, it's obvious.  They hate each other.  There's a dispute there.  And now like Steve Jobs is writing opuses about how much he hates flash and Adobe's  coming out and blasting.  That's what we're the open platform and Apple saying we're the open platform.  Neither of them are open.  It's not a new era.  It's not a post PC era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a new era of CEO bickering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is really entertaining.  It is very entertaining.  We're going to take a break.  When we come back, some interesting acquisition news and more.  Google just acquired Bumptop.  I don't know.  Maybe the desktop isn't dead.  It's just going to be a 3D.  Before we do that, I want to mention audible.com, the great bookstore, 75,000 titles.  I just got the new count in the audible store.  If you love listening, and I know you do, you wouldn't be listening to  twit, you're going to love audible.  Audible is all about audio books.

Listen, when you're in the gym, listen, when you're on your bike or taking a walk,  walking the dog by, by doing this, you suddenly find time.  And I've listened, I've listened to at least two books a month.  Somebody said, you can't call it reading Leo because the brain apprehends  the information in a different form.  Well, every word in the books there, I don't know if it's reading or not, but  boy, you sure get the words in there.  And there's so many great things from the nonfiction history.  I've been, I'm listening right now to the history of the campaign, the 2008  presidential campaign, just fascinating.  Uh, to great fiction stories.  I'm listening to time travelers wife.  I liked it.  I liked to listen to books that were movies before I see the movie to, you  know, stories of things like the Beatles and oral history, volume one, the  formation of the band.  I mean, audio brings things to life.  Movies in your mind.  Now you can go to audible.com slash twit two and get two books free.  You'll sign up for the platinum account.  That's what I have two books a month.  And your first two are free.  You can cancel it anytime.  So there doesn't have to be any cost or obligation to you.

I can't recommend it more highly.  It's just wonderful.  By the way, uh, if, you know, we do this podcast with Rod Savage is rowing  across the Pacific right now.  She's a featured listener at audible.com.  And she's actually put together a list of her favorite books as she rose.  She listens.  She rose like 16 hours a day.  So she goes through a book a day, a book a day.  I had, I gave her many of those books are books.  I gave her thousands of books she's gone through.  And so these are, these are, this is a Ross's list.  It's all at audible.com pick two of these and call me in the morning.  All right.  We're talking twit right now.  Mark million is here from the Los Angeles times, la times.com Mark.  Do you have a personal blog or somewhere you want to point people to too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um, yeah, you could, uh, get my, uh, Twitter and Google buzz stuff at, uh,  Hey, nice blog.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, that's a good name.  It's a little generic.  Hey, nice blog.  You know, Dane, our executive producer here at twit has Hey.com.  You guys should get excellent domain.  Isn't that a good name?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He, oh, he got a forbidden.  It's down.  It's down right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's working on it, but Hey, nice blog is up the iPad cafe.  I love it.  And of course the LA switching from posters to Tumblr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Haven't decided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh no.  Stay.  I like posters, but you know, posters doesn't have any design style, right?  But what you do with posters, I don't, I wouldn't use it as a blog.  I would use it as a platform so that it gets your stuff to your blog.  So you can create a Tumblog on Tumblr that posters feeds to.  Best of both worlds, right?  I should probably set that up.  Yeah.  Cause then, cause I use posters like when I was traveling, um, not, not that we're  doing an ad for it, but when I was traveling, uh, in China, I would just post  stuff via email to, to, to posters and then it would go out to my other blogs.  Tumblr is pretty good too.  They're both good.  Also with us, Ryan Block, GDGT.  That's the place to go.  Ryan's a great website.  He does this with Peter Rojas.  And now you've got news there as well as a, you know, a list of your favorite gadgets.  How's the iPad going?  Is it, is it, what's, what is the hot I have gadget right now on GDGT?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, iPad is not the hot I have gadget.  Um, it's a hot I want not as many people have bought it yet, but I think it's the  most wanted gadget, at least one of the most wanted gadgets.  Uh, actually I think the most owned gadget is the either the 3G or the 3GS.  I think, uh, we have like 20,000 people who have one on the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you go to GDGT.com and you tell, you know, you enter in all the stuff you have  and that's a great way to find out about it and get news and stuff.  And you can put in the stuff you want, which is kind of cool and, uh, and have  conversations with people about it.  And you know, every time I go back here, of course, more gadgets in here.  It's really become the definitive encyclopedia of gadgetry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've got it.  We've got a lot of products on the site now.  Pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, thank you.  I have a great time doing it.  And Ryan, I want to say, I thought a gadget was one of the best ideas for a,  uh, for a website in a long time.  I love it.  Yeah.  You can say, I appreciate your saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it clever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really is.  Yeah.  So we got some good people.  I appreciate that.  It's a little self congratulatory in here right now, but that's  okay.  That's all right.  I could take it.  Uh, we're, we're almost done here.  What are, what are some of the other hot stories?  Have we missed anything you guys want to talk about?  Um,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually talked to Ryan last week for a story I was working on.  That's right.  Um, the unveiling of boy genius behind the boy genius report who just recently  sold his blog, his mobile rumors and news blog for in a multimillion dollar deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Um, so, uh, one blog, one blog TBG for more than a million dollars.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you know, it really bums me out is, uh, you know, I named it and I didn't see  a penny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You knew, you knew this guy.  Did you know he was the boy genius?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, he used, he used to write for me.  Of course you knew.  Yeah.  And I mean, like the boy genius report, the name of his site is the name that I  came up with for his column.  And when he told me that he wanted to, uh, to do his own site, you know, I kind  of gave him my blessing to, to take the name and, and to run with it.  And, uh, man, I should have gotten in writing or something.  I, you know, I couldn't really use a great name.  That's a great name for a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  His real name actually appeared on in gadget and association with that in a  couple of posts, right?  He was actually, you should have known it was obvious.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was kind of an open secret.  I, you know, my favorite thing was for years, people would come up to me and  ask me if I was boy genius.  And it never really made any sense to me because why would I need to  write under a pseudonym?  I was breaking all kinds of stories myself.  Um, but yeah, I mean, you know, he's, uh, John has done a really good job.  Uh, I think it, even though it was kind of an open secret among people who knew  him, uh, at, at, at keeping it from getting out, he looks like Lee Harvey Oswald

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in the picture on the times, but, uh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  is, uh, I thought he looked like Seth MacFarlane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, he does a little bit.  The creator of a family guy.  He does look like Seth MacFarlane.  He's 23.  So he was a teenager when he started working for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As 16 when he went to end gadget.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good for you.  Jonathan Geller, now a millionaire.  And, uh, they're going to re they're going to rename the boy genius  report to TBG.com, right?  BGR BGR.  Oh, BGR.  What am I saying?  TBG.  That's something else.  I just made that up.  TBG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This doesn't happen very often anymore.  You know, it used to happen fairly frequently, but the last one I can  remember that's like this was, um, JK on the run, James Kendrick's blog  getting acquired by a giga ohm.  Right.  Uh, but, uh, this, this is kind of relatively rare now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ooh, they got a little bit of a scoop on a BGR.com, uh, right now.  Adobe to distribute Android handsets to its employees.  That'd be, that'd be kind of a, this is more of that CEO in fighting.  Okay.  Okay.  In that case, we're going to give the Nexus one to our employees.  Wow.  It's great.  Great blog.  Congratulations, Jonathan on a job.  Well done.  Send, you know, send Ryan a buck or two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I could, I could use a couple bucks.  He deserves a little.  I'm living the startup life now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He deserves a little money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't, I don't have that Leo Laporte money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  That money.  Where is that?  My desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Where is that money?  I need that money.  Did you see, um, our good friends, uh, Nitrozac and Snaggy who do all of our  album art, uh, they do the joy of tech comic at geek culture.com.  They did a really fun Steve jobs email generator.  We were talking about the nope and yep.  Yeah.  First you create the letter to Steve jobs.  Hi Steve.  I'm a longtime Apple fan, a long time Apple enemy, new to Apple, new to hating  Apple, you know, there's quite a few, quite a few choices and so you put it all  together, you know, who loves everything you do, can't stop eating potato chips,  has a lot of time to kill, would like to offer advice, can see you now on my magic  iPad, you are insanely great.  My hero, arrogant, pompous, pretentious, rotten, my benevolent dictator, the  wind beneath my wings.  I have a question about my iPhone, iPad, iPad, Mac book, Newton, one button  mouse, no button mouse, my dad's cousins, dentist's, iPod shuffle.  Anyway, once you write the email, here's Steve's reply.  You get some choices.  No, nope.  No big deal.  Nope.  No, sorry.  No, no way.  No chance in hell.  No way.  Explodive, explodive, explodive, not to worry, nada.  Yep.  Okay.  Or if you want porn, get an Android phone, which Steve actually said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, to me, to my question.  It was your question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was he giving you personal advice or was it just a kind of in general?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, the question I asked was, you know, I think a lot of people would like to see  Apple open up the platform.  I mean, obviously it's a very contentious issue for Apple, the closed nature of the  app store, so why not just bury a setting, you know, five levels deep in the settings  like, like Android does that allows you to run unsigned apps.  And and his response that was, well, yeah, we could do that.  But Android has a porn store.  So, you know, if you want to run, if you want to look at porn on your phone, go get Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a way to turn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, you know, it's in by that point, you know, the mic had already gone back to the  PR person and it was onto the next question.  No follow-ups.  I would like to have asked about Safari and maybe we should lock that down.  So you can't view any porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No follow-ups.  What will be interesting is when Steve Jobs appears on the stage at D8 with Kara Swisher  and Walt Mossberg.  And, you know, obviously a lot of these things will still be unresolved by the time he gets  on stage. I think that's in June.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And you know that Kara and Malt will ask tough questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe, maybe, maybe.  But, but also if it's in June and if we have an announcement on the next iPhone, there  may be, you know, mostly a lot of drooling over the hardware and there may not be a whole  lot of a lot of hard balls thrown.  I hope they throw some hard balls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should be interesting.  And we tried to get Kara on today.  She was unavailable.  We'll get her on either before or after that event or maybe both and get her take.  Maybe we can feed her some questions to ask Steve.  One last story before we go.  Just a little word of warning.  May 5th, the Internet might fail.  Just thought you'd like to know.  Keep your eye peeled and perhaps save up some sites in your browser just so you don't have  to go porn free on May 5th.  ICANN will complete the first phase of the rollout of DNSSEC, which is the security  extensions for the broken DNS system.  This is actually very important.  They've been delaying it because there is some risk.  That it would cause your browser to fail.  According to some security experts, older networking equipment might see these larger  requests as a problem, block them under the assumption they represent an anomaly and take  you off the Internet.  Just a word of warning May 5th.  If the Internet goes down, it's going to be okay.  It'll come back one of these days.  The big ones will be all right.  Ryan Block is at gdgtgadget.com.  Thank you for being here, Ryan.  We really appreciate it.  Thanks for having me.  Always a pleasure to have you.  Mr. Mark Millian.  Oh, what?  Something to plug?  I'm sorry.

So the kind of event that we did out in San Francisco, we did one in South by Southwest.  That was fun.  We're also doing one in Chicago.  Yeah.  Sorry, I'm just really excited about it.  I wanted to make sure people knew because Chicago doesn't see a lot of these kinds  of gadgety events come through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gallery 233, that's 233 West Huron, 7 p.m.  A good place to see lots of gadgets.  I'm sure there'll be an incredible there.  Maybe some other new stuff.  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not throwing a party, but if anyone in LA wants to get a beer, send me an email.  But I can vouch for Ryan's parties.  I went to one at CES and it was awesome.  Awesome.  Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The one that we did this year with Lenovo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  We met there actually, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a little bit unusual for us because I've never really done a party at  CES before.  That was pretty fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that was cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We want to do, we're trying to do, I'm waiting to hear from Ford.  I want to do, there's a Maker Faire coming to Detroit in July.  Just like you, I think we should do more stuff kind of in the middle of the country instead  of the left or the right coasts.  So we want to do an event in Detroit in July.  So stay tuned for that.  If we can't, we're going to tie in with Maker Faire out there.  Mr. Continental Airlines merges with United Airlines so now Dwight Silverman lives in  the biggest hub of all.  I'm just, you know, okay, great.  So Houston's the place to live, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Houston's a place to live.  And Ryan, you need to do one of these parties here in Houston.  Come in August when it's really nice and cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know about Houston.  We did one in Austin though for South By.  That was fun.  That one was a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but so you go to Houston, you get the wonderful oil washing up on the shore.  That's in Louisiana.  But aren't you on the Gulf?  I mean, couldn't it come your way too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The placement of the well and the way the current is flowing for now is keeping it  away from us.  They've closed fishing from Louisiana East, but so far we've been okay here.  Thank goodness.  That's a mess.  But seriously, Ryan, consider it.  I know Leo won't come to Houston, but I know you will.  It's too hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe next year.  I think we've got our venues scoped out for this year, but 2011.  I'm going to make sure that our guy who's doing our events knows about Houston.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aren't there some big tech companies in Houston that might sponsor Ryan's visit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't the Space Center there, NASA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  NASA will sponsor you, Ryan.  They got money to burn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those guys have endless amounts of cash.
