I gave a speech.  There's actually a very big conference down there.  There's actually a massive called Futurecom.  And at Futurecom, everybody was there.  I mean, there wasn't one company you can think of that you'd normally see  at like a convex or something that wasn't there. It was huge.

Start time: 321.18
End time: 329.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's funny. I brought that joke up there.  I brought it up a couple of times and I've had more than a few Brazilians say,  you know what you said about Orkut is not quite true.  We've switched over to Facebook.

Start time: 330.34
End time: 333.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just saw a stance that Orkut is now way second to Facebook.

Start time: 333.40
End time: 338.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I told them, don't worry, you got Orkut 2 coming your way,  called Google Plus.  Maybe.

Start time: 339.20
End time: 343.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that'll fail the same way.  You're still negative on Google.  Nessie Scheer and I, we're big Google Plus users.  I'm into it.

Start time: 344.02
End time: 363.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right here, Leo Laporte.  Twitter's live with John Seed of Orkut, Cheryl Lazar,  and it's gone on the Google Plus.  I love Google Plus.  Yeah, I know you do. You don't like it?  It's fine. There's nothing wrong with it.  But it's not the social network that Facebook is.  Facebook is really...  Well, that's a bit more mainstream.  And it's done by guys who are freaky about social networks.  Google guys would not even want to...

Start time: 365.13
End time: 457.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk, because the story, the big story of the week,  obviously, besides the return of Meg Whitman to Silicon Valley,  the big story is Facebook redesign.  They launched a number of products,  or new site features before F8,  and on Thursday announced considerably more.  It is a very different Facebook.  And I'll tell you what, I'll pose you, the panel,  the question I posed on the radio show earlier today.  It seems to me, you know, we talk a lot about tech companies  making a pivot. Twitter, you know, ODO,  Ed Williams made a huge pivot from a podcast company to Twitter.  Flickr was a gaming company before they became a photo sharing company.  These pivots are not unusual in the tech industry,  but they almost always come because, in fact, as far as I know,  they always come because you failed in the first product.  And so you say, well, what else can we do?  We've got money, we've got a team, what else can we do?  This is the first time I can think of that you have a wildly successful site,  a site that, you know, 750 million active users.  In fact, Mark Zuckerberg said on Thursday that they had a half billion user day.  Amazing.  500 million uniques in one day.  There's no website even close. That's an amazing number.  And they pivoted.  They went from being a site that was essentially a private place  where you and your friends would gather and you would show them pictures  and they'd show you pictures and tell you what they're up to,  to all I could think is Twitter envy, to a public site.  Is this not a pivot, Mark?

Start time: 459.68
End time: 463.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it?  Well, I use it that way now, since you're talking about the subscribe button.

Start time: 463.80
End time: 471.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're probably the wrong people to talk to because we're all public.  Yeah, we're all public.  But I have to think of my mom and my sister and my friends who use it as...

Start time: 471.32
End time: 473.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they don't even know that that subscribe button exists.

Start time: 473.80
End time: 480.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't want subscriptions. They don't want...  But everything in here is going public with the timeline, with the profiles.  Isn't that where it's going?

Start time: 481.74
End time: 483.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't think so. I think they're...

Start time: 483.20
End time: 487.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think you could still use Facebook as you used to use it,  as a completely private site?

Start time: 487.74
End time: 520.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In a way. I think it's harder to do now  because a lot of things, they'll turn on the public automatically.  The defaults change automatically.  But I think they're trying to make it slightly more clear  where when you post a status update, it says at the bottom,  this is going to be public or you can switch it to just your friends or close friends.  But I think they're also...  It's not a complete pivot, but they're trying to appease people like us,  people who are using Twitter, using Google Plus and pumping up those networks  because they have very robust public features.  Yeah.

Start time: 521.86
End time: 540.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're trying to compete against every company, it feels like.  They're now becoming a search engine in many ways  because everything's going to be public.  You can search for stories or reactions.  And as a reporter, I do that all the time.  Then they're also becoming kind of like Amazon  and they're becoming like Netflix and they're becoming like every company out there.  They're just trying to own it so that becomes your main hub.

Start time: 540.60
End time: 558.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is motivating this?  I mean, wouldn't you...  World domination.  Yeah, if you had 750 million users, 500 million uniques in one day,  you're selling plenty of ads, you're doing plenty well,  why would you change it and risk confusing and chasing away a less sophisticated audience?

Start time: 558.10
End time: 568.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unless I see evidence that anyone's bailing out.  Well, there's nowhere to go.  Well, there you have it.  Google Plus?  Nah, I don't think Google Plus...  The problem is Google Plus is this.  You heard that.

Start time: 569.16
End time: 570.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, Google Plus is public though.

Start time: 571.26
End time: 574.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But my mom isn't going to use Google Plus, like it's just the interface isn't as easy.

Start time: 574.88
End time: 576.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's nowhere for your mom to go, is there?

Start time: 577.44
End time: 579.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My mom would go on Facebook, if anything.

Start time: 579.40
End time: 583.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, she's not on Facebook.  She's not actually on, but she follows me like a stalker on Twitter.

Start time: 583.36
End time: 584.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but she's a web stalker.

Start time: 584.36
End time: 589.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, pick somebody in your family or friends who's not sophisticated.  My dad's on Twitter.  He's not sophisticated.  Oh, that's...  Okay.

Start time: 590.77
End time: 597.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, so that's not sophisticated.  Well, just Google Plus, it's just too hard.  Like you're going to pick some people to like to post to this group, to that group.

Start time: 597.94
End time: 602.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, if Google Plus is hard, Facebook is a master's degree in complexity.  Now it's a bit too much.

Start time: 602.88
End time: 613.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's too many options.  Like the...  You have, what, the lightweight, then you have the other...  What was the ticker?  And then you have this, that.  It's like too much.  You end up...  You'll just want to post it publicly.

Start time: 613.90
End time: 627.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there's what Mark Zuckerberg calls friction-free sharing, which other people might call on the  internet, where you just...  If I watch, if I listen to a song on Spotify, that song will be played.  Let me go to Spotify.  I like how he said serendipitous discovery.

Start time: 627.92
End time: 629.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like it made it really spirited.  No, it's not serendipity.

Start time: 629.92
End time: 649.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He said serendipity like ten times.  There's no serendipity.  If I listen to a song...  And now, by the way, I set this up, but it's very easy to forget that you set it up or  not notice when you set it up that you were giving permission for...  And this is the thing to look for.  I'm going to listen to You and I, the Metronomy remix.

Start time: 650.71
End time: 651.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And right away it posts your Facebook immediately.

Start time: 652.64
End time: 672.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now let's go to my Facebook and see, because I'm going to go to my Facebook profile and  let's see if it's posted already to Facebook.  Yeah.  Leo, listen to You and I, Metronomy remix.  That's so weird.  You can turn that off.  No, I know I can, but the point...  Well then what are you complaining about?  I wish I could turn Lady Gaga off.  Thank you.  The point is people do this, they forget they did it, they don't look at the preferences.

Start time: 673.88
End time: 681.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then they probably don't care that much about their privacy in any real sense.  So you think it's okay to do this?  Oh, absolutely.  Really?

Start time: 682.53
End time: 686.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's not not care, I think you forget that you need to care.  I think we're just becoming used to it.

Start time: 687.04
End time: 689.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get off Facebook if you feel that way.

Start time: 689.06
End time: 690.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not saying me, I just say the regular person.

Start time: 691.04
End time: 697.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's where the pivot comes in.  We're creating an acceptance.  There's no pivot involved.  That's where the pivot comes in.  If you got on Facebook because you thought this was a private place, you could tell people

Start time: 698.00
End time: 705.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  your age...  Then you were incredibly stupid and naive.  Even back then?  Yeah, I think so.  Even two years ago?  Well, that's who you said this before.  I'm just quoting you.

Start time: 705.20
End time: 711.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What I have said is, if you post anything on the internet, you should assume it is public  or will be public at some point.  Exactly.

Start time: 712.04
End time: 724.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because it's very hard to stop that.  Yeah, it's like putting a blog post up or even a tweet that you want to pull back.  Well, who's that?  Somebody did some tweet recently and then they erased it, but they still got all kinds of  trouble.  Not you.  Well, she did that too.  She did that too.  There was another one.  There was the other example.

Start time: 725.04
End time: 739.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it was actually a Facebook employee who said how much he liked the new streaming  media features of Facebook and his friends could follow him.  And then he realized, oh my God, we haven't released that yet.  Oh, that's hilarious.  Well, that happens all the time.  It happens all the time.  But, okay, I guess you guys are not going to buy into this.  Let's get to the root of this here.

Start time: 740.74
End time: 759.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You actually have a deep-seated hatred.  Let's not make this personal, John.  I'm just trying to...  I'm not making it personal.  I'm giving people an evaluative dimension where they can kind of pinpoint where you're  coming from so they can more honestly evaluate your thoughts on the matter, which are incredibly  bigoted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was a lowly talk show host when you met me.  You're a mogul.  Why don't you just drop it?  You're a journalist.  I am not a mogul.  I am not a mogul.  I had to build this only so that I could talk incessantly to no purpose.  So my point is, and I'm going to say it one more time...  Why can't you call Barry Diller a journalist?  It's not the same.

Start time: 794.22

Start time: 798.90
End time: 811.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because I've had enough of this and I am going to Cabo for the weekend.  Okay.  Okay, so none of you buy this idea that Facebook has made a major and highly risky change?  Oh, no.

Start time: 812.18
End time: 816.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 817.34
End time: 847.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been following this for a couple of months and I was just really curious how they would  end up implementing it because they've made it clear for a long time in talks with Spotify.  Initially, there was talk that this might be just a Spotify-Facebook collaboration,  and then they hugely broadened it over the last few months.  And it was obvious that they were going to bring this idea of scrabbling from last FM to music,  but bringing that to video is a little weird.  Broadcasting everything you watch on Netflix is a little weird.  No, you can't.

Start time: 849.22
End time: 862.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, this is interesting because you can't yet do that in the US because there happens to be a privacy law in the United States,  the Video Rental Privacy Act or something like that, the video that was created because Robert Bork,  remember he got Borked?

Start time: 862.26
End time: 865.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know this, what you're telling me.  This is interesting.

Start time: 865.42
End time: 897.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so when Robert Bork was nominated for the Supreme Court, was he the first nominee or Reagan?  I think he was a Reagan nominee.  Yeah, maybe, or Nixon.  No, no, was it?  No, I think it was Reagan.  In any event, one of the ways they got Bork thrown out was by going to the video rental store  and getting his history of video rentals.  That prompted the Republican Congress, that was very incensed about this, to create a bill,  not a bad bill, the Video Privacy Protection Act that says a video store cannot reveal...

Start time: 897.46

Maybe it's not that weird to scrabble everything you watch, even though you may...  It doesn't bother me.  News is a little weird.  Every article you click on on Yahoo News, every link someone sends you, you click through from an IM...  The other thing is, I don't like that automatic thing where it's just anything you read.

Now, again, Mark Zuckerberg will point out, as will everybody at Facebook,  no, no, no, in fact, there was a response to Weiner's post which said exactly that.  No, no, no, you're giving permission.  You're saying it's okay.  When you go to the new Washington Post social media feed,  Washington Post is doing this, not just Washington Post articles,  but yours and everybody else's articles,  when you go there and say, yes, I give you permission to post as me on Facebook,  you're saying...

In fact, I'm even thinking maybe we should move from Google Plus  because they've got this great ticker that goes by on the right.  If you say, oh, Robert Scoble just listened to something  by Janelle Monae on Spotify,  I can highlight it, I can literally press this button  and listen along with him.  That song is now playing.  It makes me wonder why he's listening to Big Boy, but that's...  You've got to be bored out of your gourd.  Scoble's listening.  Okay, but presumably you follow people on Facebook that...  To listen to their music?  No.  Well, no, I take it back.  I think you're wrong, John.  You're way too old to do that.  You're right.  I really...  I think that in fact,  this is what the young people today do.  Right?  The youngins.  The youngins.  And look here,  Frederick Van Johnson says he likes this nonprofit organization.

Anyway, I think that they've done a good job of managing  what could be a very complex interface.  I think the real issue is here is that Facebook has gone from private  to public-facing very, very clearly.  It is a pivot.  I can't understand the pivot because they're doing fine financially.  I think it's Twitter envy on the part of Microsoft.  It's envy of everything.

They're just running as fast as they can  and they're just assuming somebody's going to be sneaking up behind them  and there's two ways of dealing with the future with these companies.  Microsoft's one way, which is you get something up there,  you kind of get into a monopoly position  and then you sit on it and do nothing and just make money  while everybody sneaks up on you.  Or Adobe, if you take a look at Photoshop, Illustrator, CS55  and all the rest of this stuff, these guys are...  Every year and a half, Photoshop comes out,  you've got to go back to school to catch up again  and nobody's chasing.  They're way ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're a little more than neurotic, don't you think?  I moderated this ad brand social media thing  at Social Media Week in LA  and it's funny because I think brands have just gotten used to  and accepting Facebook pages and fans  and figuring out how to use the likes to their advantage  and now it's like they need to go back  and reintroduce it to all the companies  because now it's like how do we use Facebook?  It's a whole new way to use Facebook now.

Start time: 1257.00
End time: 1269.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's a very good example.  For instance, if you are an individual,  you're not supposed to have a page anymore.  You're supposed to use your Facebook profile  and have people subscribe to it.  And how do brands, how are they going to...  Well, the brands are only pages.

I was like, are you sure?  Are you sure?  And then they always email me things like tips  like how I should be engaging.  Really?  Yeah, because I have friends there.  And so they said to me...  They never tell me anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

End time: 1327.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I used to connect my Twitter to my Facebook  and they didn't like...  I don't think they liked that.  And so they kept on saying you really shouldn't connect the two  because you're not getting as much engagement.  We really recommend that if you want to get more engagement,  you should put it separately on Facebook.  And so I started doing that.  And actually, my subscribers went up 2,000 this week.

We could use it to stream this show.  I think we should.  I think I will.  We're trying to figure out how to use this.  You know what I love?  To step back a little bit,  at least I love it that there's this great competition now  between Google and Facebook  to create more useful, better social sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2163.20
End time: 2167.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.  She was a greeter that HP had hired  and he took her out to dance.

End time: 2173.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that the latest?  I don't keep up with these guys.  I'm way back on escort.

Start time: 2176.69
End time: 2219.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, they fired Mark Hurd  who was arguably able to run this company.  In fact, didn't Mr. Oracle say,  this is the stupidest thing I've ever heard of  and immediately hire Mark Hurd?  He says stuff like that.  But he did hire Hurd.  Leo Apotheker comes in  and proceeds to gut the company.  Says, we're getting out of the PC business.  Says, we're not going to make WebOS.  Oh, yeah, well, we're going to license WebOS  but we're not going to make hardware.  Confusing everybody.  Yeah, he's a software guy.  Sells the tablet for $99 to great success  even though, of course, they lose $300 a tablet  doing so.  After 11 months, Apotheker is out.  He's off the board.  He's resigned as a director.  He's no longer CEO or president.  Bring in Meg Whitman of eBay.

Start time: 2219.62
End time: 2232.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, and my assertion is she's been brought in  because her expertise is in auctioning  and they're going to take the company down  to book value and just sell it off  at bargain basement prices.  Well, a number of people said

Start time: 2232.16
End time: 2239.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Whitman actually is a very good manager,  would be a good CEO,  but she's never run a hardware company.  Right.  She ran eBay.

Start time: 2239.32
End time: 2243.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She ran a website.  She ran a website.  And a political campaign.

Start time: 2243.18
End time: 2247.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This doesn't necessarily mean  they're going to be switching course  from the software focus.

Start time: 2248.30
End time: 2252.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the question.  And she lost, by the way.  Or no.

Start time: 2253.20
End time: 2255.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Unsuccessfully.  An unsuccessful political campaign.

Start time: 2256.26
End time: 2269.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's the question.  Does this mean that we're not going to buy  that British company?  We're not going to divest ourselves  of the PC business?  What does she do?  The course has been set.  And I think the board had a lot to do with that course

Start time: 2270.20
End time: 2292.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and maybe Leo was straying behind the scenes  and they wanted somebody  who would stick to the party lines.  It doesn't make sense to me  that they would announce this whole big hoopla  about killing web OS devices  and maybe spinning off the PC business  and then switch leaders  and then go back on all that.  I don't think that's in the cards.

Start time: 2293.53
End time: 2295.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the course is set.  She's just going to be in there  and be a good manager?

Start time: 2297.28
End time: 2383.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the theory.  A leader.  That's like the, you know,  this theory kind of permeates society  in a lot of different levels.  It happens with journalists  where they think that anyone  who just gets out of J-School from Columbia  can go cover technology  so they send them over to Intel.  And they don't know what questions to ask.  They don't know what to do.  I mean, these are specialties,  these corporations like HP.  This is not something  where you bring in some journeyman,  you know, CEO, cookie cutter person.  That's kind of who Leo Apotheker was.  Well, at least he was in kind of the business,  but I agree with you.  I think Apotheker was a bad choice.  There are people in the company at HP  that could do this better.  Now, some people have asserted  that her political connections  and all she's going to be is a fake CEO  that is going to keep these government contracts alive  because they've got huge contracts with the Air Force.  They have huge contracts with the Army.  Those are valuable assets.  And they're huge.  And she's a celeb.  I asserted this in the Market Watch column.  She is a celebrity CEO.  And so she can get a call  and she can get...  That's a good point.  People will take her call.  If some schmuck  that's just an executive vice president  at HP gets promoted,  nobody takes his call.  So is she the front man?  I believe that the company would be probably run by the COO.  It's like a spokesperson.  It's almost like a publisher in magazines nowadays  who don't do any publishing.  We'll put them back in the news in many ways.

Start time: 2383.74
End time: 2396.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think, you know, a female CEO...  They've been in the news.  This is questionable news also,  but maybe it stops people from talking about their products  and where they're heading.  So they talk about her being a CEO.

Start time: 2396.60
End time: 2402.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They still have a very profitable printer division.  That's not gone.  Maybe it was smart to sell the PC division.

Start time: 2402.42
End time: 2404.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A profitable ink division is what it really is.  Ink, right.

Start time: 2405.62
End time: 2416.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The printers are just ink carriers.  Yeah.  But it's profitable.  Yeah, they're making good money.  It does very well.  I don't know how their professional services division  is doing, but that's...  Well, that's what they hope to become.  That's their future.

Transcript:  It's a good point you bring up about the government contracts.  I was talking to someone in the Army's IT  who's running some programs about getting smartphones  in the hands of soldiers.  And he told me that he got a letter from the people  heading the WebOS division who said they were shocked  that this had happened and that they were apologizing  refusefully that they were going to have to take back  all their device shipments and that they couldn't work together  on this particular partnership  because the powers that be said that we're not going  to be making mobile hardware anymore.  Holy cow.  So I think that's probably a good thought  that they'll want to stay on course  with the government contracts, with the corporate contracts.  How many millions does that cost them?

Start time: 2463.56
End time: 2466.83

Transcript:  Yahoo!  By the way, I gave her an 11 months  and then she's out with $36 million cash.  That's pretty good.  That's what Kopatheco got.  In and out.  You got $36 million?

Start time: 2478.97
End time: 2495.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Holy cow.  That takes some of the sting out of it.  11 months.  Wow.  Okay.  Some said that Mark Hurd should come back.  You don't think that's the case.  No, that's never going to happen.  Well, I knew it wouldn't happen.  And now he shouldn't come back.  Jerry Yang says, Yahoo!  Yeah, we're for sale.

Transcript:  Apparently in a company-wide memo leaked to Nicholas Carlson,  Yahoo! has hired Allen & Company to field inquiries  from multiple parties that have already expressed  an interest in a number of potential options.  That means we're not selling the whole company.  We're going to have a fire sale.  We're going to sell bits and pieces.  Don't you think that's what they're saying?  Multiple options.  What is the option?

Start time: 2519.56
End time: 2528.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they have a bunch of little companies  that they don't do anything with for starters.  They're a very strong content company.  They bought up all these little companies.  Flickr could be put back into play.  But who would buy it?

Start time: 2528.70
End time: 2536.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, someone.  Why would you want a money-loser like Flickr  even though it's got a huge audience?  Google?  Well, why would the YouTube guys buy Delicious?

Start time: 2536.60
End time: 2545.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was an interesting...  Because it was cheap.  It was a million dollars.  Maybe Flickr will be cheap.  Maybe everything will be cheap.  Fire sale.  Maybe I'll buy Flickr.

Start time: 2546.68
End time: 2551.29

We're buying all these shows.  And you're like, why would I want to be in business  and start a show and a whole brand on a site  that just doesn't even know who they are?

Start time: 2649.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anderson and Company is a chop shop.  Yahoo goes to them and says,  here, take the steering column.  Take the wheel covers.  Take the headrests.  Just sell it off.  Bitten pieces.  It's probably worth a lot of money that way.  I don't think it's worth as much as their market cap.

Start time: 2686.80
End time: 2691.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, sure.  We haven't asked you since this happened.  What do you think of the government  intervening on the T-Mobile 18 team merger?  Well, I think they had to for political reasons.

Because already, I don't know about you  and anyone out here who's a T-Mobile customer,  but the service is deteriorating.  It is.  By the minute.

I said, Leslie, we've got to get you on  squarespace.com  You cannot bring Squarespace down  and that's one of the beauties of it.  Squarespace is web hosting,  really good web hosting,  web hosting that is so far ahead  of anything else anybody's using.  For instance, if you get slammed like his site did,  they just turn on more bandwidth automatically.  You cannot shut down a website  from squarespace.com.  But then on top of that,  you get this great content management system.  One of the best in the business...  I'd say the best in the business.  But the best thing to do  is go to squarespace.com,  click that green Try It Free button.  You don't need a credit card,  you need three things.  A name for a site, a password,  and an email address.  And that's it.  You've now got two weeks  to use the full suite of tools  at squarespace.com.  Their great social integration means  it's so simple to use these widgets  to seamlessly include Flickr,  or Twitter, or Facebook,  or any, in fact, any RSS feed.  Boom!  Right there in your site.  And the thing is,  look at this, it's so easy to do.  You've got little drag sliders,  you've got drop-down menus,  you don't need to be a CSS expert  to make an incredible looking website.  Now, I do have to point out,  if you do know CSS,  the sky's the limit.  I mean, you've got these great  point-and-click interfaces,  but you can also use CSS,  JavaScript, any technology  to make your site sing.  So you're never really at the...  in any way,  it's kind of the best of both worlds.  Easy for a novice,  but plenty of scope for the professional.  Take a look at their Android and iOS,  yes, now on Android and iOS apps  that make it easy not only to blog,  but to moderate your website,  to kill spam,  there's, you know, to see your stats.  All of this is here.  Squarespace is a really wonderful host,  a fantastic suite of software services,  and I want you to try it right now.  Go to the Squarespace site,  click that Try It Free button,  if you decide to buy,  and only if you decide to buy,  I want you to use the offer code TWIT9,  T-W-I-T, and the number nine,  because we'll get you 10% off  for the first six months of your site.  It's very affordable.  If you go monthly,  it's as little as $13.33 a month.  If you buy more, of course, it costs less.  And no matter how much time you buy,  you'll get 10% off for the first six months  if you use the offer code TWIT9.  Squarespace, the secret behind Excel,  the secret behind exceptional websites.

A lot of people would just buy it  because they know it would be cooler.  There would be something cooler about it.  It would have more features.  It would do something better.  It would have an Apple logo on it.  It would definitely have an Apple logo on it  and I think it would probably have some things about it  that would be so...  It would probably have this magical buzz.  They could make more money on their TVs  than anybody else could.  They'd take Sony right out of it.  Nobody else can really make money on TVs.

Transcript:  So many reasons why it would be a terrible idea.  The real TV, you think it's a terrible idea?  Oh, yeah.  Why?  Well, as Mark pointed out,  nobody makes money in this.  No, Google TV.  Google TV isn't a TV.  They already have an Apple TV device.  We're talking about a TV set.  A TV set.  The problem is, you know,  you've got to carry it into the genius bar if it breaks.  I mean, Apple...  This is too big.  TVs don't get updated every year like other Apple products.  So it's kind of a strange model for them.  And what do they need it for?  I think your argument's valid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're welcome.  And we do it because,  although there's no evidence to prove otherwise,  we believe that in the long run,  if we can be like the CNN of tech,  by covering breaking news,  more people will watch.  That hasn't been the case.  I think it's super smart.  But we're doing it anyway.

Start time: 3837.28
End time: 3842.18

We didn't cover the Microsoft Build conference  where they talked about Windows 8.  There was a lot of positive buzz from there.  I should have streamed it live.  We didn't, and I will never live it down.  See, they're saying it right there.  Leo dropped the ball on Build.  So I guess we'll be covering this Amazon thing.  At 7 a.m., they're going to hold a press conference.  We don't know what it is,  but we're going to take a wild chance.  Tablet.  Then it might be an Amazon tablet.

Transcript:  Publicly, their terms say they pay developers  20% of the asking price.  See?  Publicly, that's their terms.  But in fact...  Even when they give it away free to both customers  and naive developers alike,  this seems like a big chance to make something rare  in the Android world real money.  But they don't pay developers a single cent.  You get an email saying,  we'd like to do it.  The current price of this placement as a free app  is 0% rev share for the one day.  So in other words, they did...  I wasn't wrong.  They did say they were going to give 20% to the developer,  but they in fact give them nothing.

Transcript:  Quickster.  So they're going to split the DVD portion  off from the streaming portion.  There'll be Quickster, which is DVDs by mail,  which is a business that probably  everybody agrees is going to go away,  because the movie industry isn't going to let them do it  for very long.  Studios have been squeezing the hell out of them.  They say you can have three discs.  They say you can't have it for 28 days  until after it's been in the stores.  They're just really squeezing the hell out of them.  But the streaming business, what do you think?  That's a good business?  The studios are squeezing those, too.  I would think the studios don't mind  the streaming business as much, because it can't be pirated.

It's not like it's going to be live on TV.  It's going to be live outside here.  It's kind of random.  But yeah, they put it up on a Sunday night.  They knew, going into Monday,  everyone would be talking about it.  We spoke about it on our show,  What's Trending, on Tuesday.  And I definitely think it's a response to the studios.

And knowing there was a successful doing so,  by the way, you can go to the DH Unplugged show,  and you can listen to us talk about this.  What's DH Unplugged?  Myself and Andrew Hoare was talking about stocks.  Did you say to short Netflix?  Yeah, right at the top. I nailed it.  You're kidding.  Damn, I got to listen to that show.

You go, you get it, and you got it.  And nobody wants to wait.  Maybe that movie isn't on streaming  because there's such a limited supply on streaming.  If you want a current hot film,  that's how you do it.  30% of those people indicated they would use Redbox  more in the future due to price changes from Netflix.  So the Redbox...  That's not a good sign for Quickster.  No, Redbox may be the winner out of this.

If it's not, we're going to be,  we'll be just sitting there and have some coffee.  Anti-climactic.  It will be boring.  You know what happened? We were doing the F8 conference  and we had, they had told us  that the developer conference, the Facebook  developer conference on Thursday will start at 10.  So I meander in about 9.30  and somebody sitting on the board saying  it's on, it's on, they started already.  So I go running over, I said go live, go live.  Mark Zuckerberg's already on stage,  they're making announcements, I sit down, we start talking.  The chat room says,  Leo, that's last year's announcement.  Ha ha ha.  That's good.  I said, I thought this sounded familiar.  There's no new announcements, I actually did say  I believe Mark's recapping last year.  That's hilarious.  There was nothing going on. Anyway, we did cover that live.  Now have we put that out on the special stream?
