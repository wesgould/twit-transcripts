I thought that's a strange,  it's weird, it's because and then everybody in the chat said,  no, that's a pork pie hat worn by jazz artists and strange people.

Transcript:  So, boy, there's a lot of news.  I'm you know, I'm going to we have such a great panel here.  People who are expert, who follow this.  Really? Who's joining us?  Next week will be.  But let's you know, I wouldn't mind starting.  This was because you were here for this, Tom.  A year ago, October 5th, Steve Jobs passed away.  And it was a very moving day for all of us.  And here we are a year later in the tech industry.  And I'm just wondering if their thoughts a year later about Steve Jobs.

Start time: 448.56
End time: 507.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I liked we talked about this on tech news today this week.  I liked Matt Honan's article.  Why we will never stop talking about Steve Jobs,  because obviously there were a lot of articles,  because some of which were from a place of admiration saying, gosh,  it's been a year and he was so important,  some of which were probably link bait to say,  if we put a Steve Jobs story up, people will click.  And a lot of people were like, gosh, do we really need to drag this out again?  And Matt's point was Steve Jobs changed so many industries, affected  so many industries, even if you hate him, even if you think he gets too much credit.  He had an effect. You can't argue with that.  And so he will be talked about like Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla  and others, not or Henry Ford, not because he's as good as them  or he's even the same as them.  But he had that kind of impact on people.  And just like Thomas Edison, Thomas Edison is criticized by many people saying  he gets too much credit.  He didn't invent all the things people claim he did.  But they're still talking about him.  And the same thing about Steve Jobs.

Start time: 508.50
End time: 559.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's you make an apt point.  And this is the illustration for Matt Honan's article  in Wired.com by Simon Lutron.  And this these are the four right people to pick because Ford was a Nazi  sympathizer.  Well, no, seriously, no, he was.  None of these guys were right were paragons of virtue.  And I think maybe Edison, you know, it turns out Edison became Edison  because he was his his primary job was stealing patents and for people to animals.  He would be. Yeah, he killed an elephant because because of Tesla.  But but but seriously, Edison started by reverse engineering,  patented inventions for money.  You know, he was he was a patent troll.  I don't know. I don't know if you can say anything bad about Tesla,  except he has a terrible hairdo.  But other than that, I mean, he was legitimately crazy.

Start time: 560.04
End time: 565.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I think he was just insane.  Yeah. And that's why he could never get his stuff together to.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 565.80
End time: 576.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it was like a deep, personal, if not romantic relationship with a pigeon.  Is that right? I believe so.  Yeah, it was a bird, some kind of bird.  I'm sure someone's going to have it in the chat room.

Start time: 577.10
End time: 580.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mike Tyson in that way.  Yes, custom of their age.

Start time: 581.26
End time: 583.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I guess throw Mike Tyson in here, too.

Start time: 584.68
End time: 589.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess what you could say is great men are often quirky.

Start time: 589.62
End time: 659.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Certainly so. I mean, as far as jobs, you know, there was just so many elements  to who he was, not only in just kind of the force of personality in an interview,  but also he had this great narrative to his life, which we always revisited  while he was alive and now in its totality is just so immaculately impressive  that we keep referring to it.  But also consider this, you know, you saw in both Mitt Romney  and Barack Obama's speech at their conventions, positively mention Steve Jobs.  Wow. And Apple as an example of, you know, in this very complicated economic time  of, you know, on Mitt Romney's side, how innovation, you know, will will be the  the savior and, you know, sticking to a private business and creating  and innovating is what we need to do.  And on, you know, Barack Obama's side, that things aren't going all that bad  because, look, we've created, you know, the most valuable company,  you know, over this four year period while things have been obviously very complicated.  So, you know, that's the kind of person he is.  I mean, he's almost this post that when nothing is post political, he is post political.  He got, you know, gigantic ovations in both conventions when they mentioned him.

Start time: 660.18
End time: 687.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I think it's important to note, too, that a lot of the concern  when he passed away, other than, of course, just being, you know, sorry.  Very sad for the loss of of of Steve Jobs was about Apple itself  and the continued survival and success of that company.  And I think we've seen over the past year that it has continued to go  on the path that he set out for it.  And, you know, that's that's probably partially what Steve Jobs did.  And also the fact that he left behind a good group of people to run the company.

Start time: 687.86
End time: 702.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I do think we will eventually  and eventually is in deep, bold letters,  get past the what would Steve Jobs have done thing?  I don't think it's going to be any time in the next five years.  We should get rid of that now. It'd be nice.

Start time: 702.78
End time: 724.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I don't know if you read our Jackie Chang's article in Ars Technica,  but she talked with a lot of people inside of Apple and they said,  as much as people try not to do it, it still happens.  I mean, Steve Jobs said, don't talk about what I would do.  Just do what you think is right.  He knew that that was a still do it.  Yeah, he said that's a pitfall.  Steve Jobs wouldn't let this happen for for whatever they're talking about.  Yes, but it's almost unavoidable.

Start time: 725.08
End time: 741.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think anyone really, even when he was alive,  knew what he would have done exactly.  Minute.  So it's very hard to think in that way because it could have changed  at any particular moment in time.  And so that's it's a hard thing to kind of,  you know, go forward on because you never knew.

Start time: 742.04
End time: 748.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And that was a bit of why we loved him,  because he was this kind of oracle, or at least the myth around him  was that he was this kind of oracle.

Start time: 749.24
End time: 755.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do we love him because he was so good at creating the image of Steve Jobs?  Or did he genuinely make a contribution?

Start time: 755.34
End time: 801.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I mean, I think if you and the Honen article does a great job  of just running down all the fields in which he absolutely made  a indelible impact, you know, from, you know,  and I think we might talk about a little bit later of like where, you know,  phones, computers throughout the world, the music industry are going to be phones.  You know, the music industry and my in and I'm a voracious nonfiction reader.  My favorite line of nonfiction writing ever comes from Steve Levy's  The Perfect Thing in describing the jobs, his initial meeting with the five labels.  And he walked into the room with and this is the line for line description.  Ball high jean shorts.  It's just like my favorite description of like, hey, I can see it.

Start time: 803.18
End time: 807.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm Steve Jobs and this is what I got.  Exactly. Nine and a half cents a song, ten dollars an album.

Transcript:  You'll never regret it.  What? Computer sailing music.  What could possibly go wrong?

Start time: 812.56
End time: 816.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you could go out of business or you could do what I want.  Yeah. Which was essentially the attitude.

Start time: 816.44
End time: 848.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, no, he sold them as like, it's a it's a, you know, don't worry.  Nothing for you guys. Don't worry.  This is such a small party. Don't worry.  Yeah, you can get around the Napster thing.  You know, because you guys are all pulling your hair out about that.  Here's just an easy way that people can buy your music.  And then all of a sudden it's affected.  It was so successful that it's almost hampered Apple going forward  with television movies, specifically with the Apple TV.  The industry is terrified of Apple.  The cable companies won't make a deal with Apple.  That's, you know, as there's a little bit of a difference there

Start time: 848.28
End time: 873.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because the cable companies want to own the relationship.  And that's similar to what publications are doing.  But the fear is there.  The fear is coming from like we saw what you did with music.  And if you do that with the actual customer information, we're screwed.  So so it's not just about selling shows.  It's about we were the cable companies.  We manage that that information with the customers and we want to continue that.  And, you know, Apple resists that.  They're like, no, we didn't.  We don't want to give that information.

Start time: 873.46
End time: 880.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's one of the reasons the Facebook deal fell through with Ping.  You said Facebook wanted customer information.  Apple said, no, you're not.

Transcript:  It was just frankly, really hard.

Start time: 899.56
End time: 919.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, sometimes people knock jobs because he was such a good marketer.  But I think about Thomas Edison, who completely,  and especially in later life, marketed the brand Thomas Edison.  I mean, it doesn't it's not a knock against the fact that he invented  the light bulb in the phonograph.  And I mean, he still did those things and he marketed himself.

Start time: 919.58
End time: 924.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But and you'll have people argue that he didn't invent the light bulb  and that he stole the filament idea from this guy.

Start time: 924.48
End time: 940.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there's a whole story about the guy who I think was a Scott inventor  who did, in fact, invent the light bulb.  And people think Edison invented the light bulb because he got the US  government to issue a stamp saying he invented the light bulb.  And talk about good marketing.  That stamp proves it.  It's the federal government said he invented the light bulb.

Start time: 940.98
End time: 956.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But but real quick, to the point of when we will stop talking about  or if we will stop talking about what would Steve Jobs have done.  I mean, like, you know, Frank and Weeney underperformed at the box office.  We're not saying we're not saying you have it in the movie draft.  I must have done.  No, I had taken to it, by the way, made 50 million dollars this weekend.

Transcript:  I'm saying nobody's we're not saying today.  Walt Disney wouldn't have done this. Right.  You know, but we did say that, you know, in fact, it's interesting.

Start time: 990.12
End time: 1014.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You should say that Walter Isaacson, his biography of Steve Jobs mentions,  in fact, that the Disney company for 20 years was hindered,  hampered by the fact that nobody would make a decision without saying  what would Walt do that actually hurt Disney.  And for a long time, Disney went through a bad spell  until it was sold and others started running and didn't ask that question.  So that can be a pitfall.  Oh, yeah. But I mean, I learned not to is what I'm saying.

Start time: 1014.56
End time: 1026.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. And Apple will have to learn, especially if it is an internal meme  that people are knocking down ideas or affecting ideas because of it.  It's too easy to do that. Yeah.  Well, I think what Jackie Chang's Chang's article was saying was

Start time: 1027.02
End time: 1048.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  what what happens is people say no one's coming in and calling BS on stuff.  And that's what jobs used to do.  And that's what's really stoking that mean to continue within is like they.  Tim Cook is is a different style guy.  And there's nobody else who's got the authority to wade in and go, no,  this is crap. Start over.  And that was the role that jobs filled, particularly.

Start time: 1049.22
End time: 1073.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm still very interested to see how the next five years  are going to pan out with Apple, because, as I mentioned earlier, there is  there was a road map in place at the time of Steve Jobs passing.  And we haven't we're not seeing anything deviating really from that plan yet.  So I'm I hate to say I'm curious to see what the future holds.  But in this case, I actually am curious to see what the future holds.  The answer may surprise.  Really be the telling thing.  Sounds legit. Yeah, that seems legit.

Start time: 1074.40
End time: 1088.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I have to say, we're probably at the end of that road map or close to it.  I mean, the iPhone five, everybody said jobs worked on directly.  If there is an Apple TV, which I'm starting to doubt,  presumably, jobs worked on that.  But beyond that, I don't think there's anything else in the pipeline. Right.

And if there's any kind of question about the the veracity of one of the segments,  people go in and fix it and do research for it.  It's a Wikipedia for set top boxes.

To keep something like that up to date.  So people obviously want this to work. Right.  And yet there's no there's nothing in there that makes people go,  I don't need this spreadsheet.

Yeah, but we're going to give you an avenue that's a little different.  If you if you have the HD version on your television to watch,  you're going to choose that over the quad view on the app.  But if you don't have either one, the quad view is going to get you.

Transcript:  For MLB. But this does not solve the overarching problem of, you know,  we don't have an a la carte system in place that would, I think,  still be the most beneficial for users out there.  But the networks will never agree to that kind of stuff.  And Comcast will never agree to that.  And Dish never will.  So we have all these little bits and bobs and ways that we can view  certain shows occasionally.  And it's just it's not user friendly.  It's not conducive to a good experience.  It's it's so archaic at this point.  It's ridiculous.

Start time: 1309.32
End time: 1325.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, in fact, MLB is a perfect example of the fragmentation.  Everybody says, oh, we'll solve it with our particular content.  I mean, we've got a Twitter app. Same thing.  But what do you do? Is there some way?  I mean, how are you going to solve this?  You create some basket with every show gets thrown into it  and then you can play whatever you want.  That's never going to happen.

Start time: 1325.64
End time: 1343.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the problem is that the networks, that entire industry  from the networks on is based on the idea that they are getting  X amount per subscriber, you know, like like networks count on  their entire revenues, at least the majority of the revenues are based  on what they get for the larger cable company.

That will will partner up with Apple  and will give them that customer relationship because it's better  than going out of business if we can be the ones to blaze the trail.  Once that domino falls, my theory is everybody else starts  to fall in line just like everything else. Apple is what if instead of the

He was a touring comedian, you know, that had a lot of people,  you know, including me, go to see him before he did this kind of stuff.  You know, there's I think the lesson of he gets mad when people say that, by the way.  I'm sure he does.  He says no.  About a lot of things. You ever watch this?  He's an angry man.  You know, there's I think that the lesson for Louis CK is there's a lot to learn from it.  But it's not that the gates have broken open.

There are examples of people who did not do it that way.  But that's what your guys are saying.  Oh, you need to be mainstream famous.  No. So that you can then be Internet famous.

I got my SAG after card.  I'm not going to be happy.  But there but but in the long run, who's the the right answer for this  is for content creators to go direct to the audience.  And this kind of dinner, this intermediation is what the Internet has done  already in so many other industries.  And it's going to happen eventually in the entertainment industry.  But it takes a while because, for instance,  I'll give you an example, you said, how much how do we get Game of Thrones made?  It doesn't have to be HBO.  How do you get any app made or any website made?  You have venture capital.  There will there will be there is doesn't exist now.  But eventually there will be the infrastructure so that a content creator,  Justin Robert Young, who has a brilliant idea as a screenwriter,  can go to investors and say, I'd like to put this together.  What's changed is the Internet provides a distribution medium  that no longer requires the big wigs with lots of capital.  You don't. And that's the change.  It's not going to happen overnight, but it will happen.  It'll happen in probably in your lifetime.  And Veronica's lifetime, Tom and I will probably never see it.  I'll be there.  Jesus.

Transcript:  And that's why Google couldn't solve it, because as soon as Google TV came out,  Hulu and CBS said, you ain't going to get to access our stuff.  As long as these stakeholders survive, they're going to be silos  and they're not going to let you search into it.  But that I am optimistic that that's going to go.

I just want to go and say, I want to watch Haven, type in Haven and watch it.  You still use a DVR? You still watch Haven?  We I love Haven. It's the most underrated show on television.

In Scandinavia, where we don't get the benefit of partnership  with cable companies, we're going to market directly to people and see how it works.  They won't do that in the US right now.

Transcript:  The show brought to you by our friends at Citrix, who do the great go to meeting.  If you are not having regular meetings at your company,  I bet you communications are spinning out of control.  We did that. We tried because I hate meetings.  You know, I hate meetings.  Always hated meetings.  And so we didn't have meetings for the first five years at Twit.  And everything fell apart.  It was awesome. It was awesome because we didn't have to go.  Nobody knew what the hell was going on.  So now we have regular meetings.  The problem is, in most businesses, people are spread out.  The company's all over the place.  Clients and colleagues are traveling.  So this is why go to meeting is such a great solution.  In fact, we do meet often.  Almost every day, we use go to meeting to meet with clients or colleagues.  We use go to meeting for screen sharing.  But now with the HD faces, it's also a great way to actually get to know somebody, to build rapport.  Studies have shown that if that the way to trust somebody, you can't do it with your eyes closed.  Is you're looking at nonverbal cues, you're looking at their posture, looking at what they're doing, their arms folded.  They're leaning in, they're leaning back, they're squinting, they're scowling, they're smiling.  All of that's real important.  Go to meeting has added HD video for that very reason.  And now it really is like meeting in person.  Easy to use and very affordable.  If you spent tens of thousands, I know companies spent hundreds of thousands on that, you know, that special teleconferencing room.  You don't need it anymore.  Every computer's got a camera on it.  All you all you have is a click and you're in a meeting and you're seeing each other.  In fact, you can even use the iPad to join a meeting and use the camera on it and the microphone and the earbuds is really is fantastic.  A forty nine dollars a month for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.  I want you to try it free right now.  Visit go to meeting dot com.  Click the try it free button.  You know, we watch all the videos and they have lots of information about GoToMeeting and their sister products.  Go to webinar and go to training.  They all use that great Citrix remote access backbone.  Click the try it free button.  Promo code is twit.  I bet Walter White, if he had only had GoToMeeting, he and Gus might have gotten along better.  There was it was because he had to go to El Pollo Hermanos and wait in line and eat that crappy chicken.  And he was in a bad mood by the time.  See, see what I'm saying?  Sure.

Because if I'm out and about, I don't want to lug around an iPad with me.  Even if it... I mean, I have a small purse.  I'm not going to carry it around in just a case or a backpack just because I want to bring my iPad.  My phone can fit in my pocket.  And if I want to actually get any real work done, like blogging or uploading videos or doing anything like that,  then I need my laptop for that.  The only combination that I can think of would be an iPad with some kind of portable keyboard,  which they do have and which work pretty well.  But still, there's the multitasking that just doesn't work the way I want it to.  It takes too long to get certain things done.  A laptop just makes more sense.

And I think it will be for a very long time unless you're in a field like you're a doctor or you're out in a construction site where it makes sense to have,  you know, your schematics or your information about a patient like on a tablet where you don't need to input a lot of data.

You know, that's if that's a magic, a maggot ism.  Is that right?  So this is just a useful tip for those of you who want to be on television.  There's a company called Frank Maggot that trains pretty much every local  newscaster, but they also do politicians.  And one of the things that they tell them is it's aggressive to point.  Don't ever do that because it looks like you're nagging or you're scolding.  So do this.  This is a friendly gesture.  And you'll notice every freaking politician going back to Bill Clinton.  No, I did not have sex with that woman.  Does that? Yeah. Not this that.

So it just seems like like I don't think Apple's actually involved in this,  but they threw it the word Apple in there because they figured to get better clicks.  I was going to say, yeah.

Start time: 3285.26
End time: 3291.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's OK.  I mean, that's really what he said.  Yeah, it's not ready to release.  It kind of sucks, but it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll never forget interviewing Andy Grove when he was the CEO at Apple.  And we hadn't rolled the cameras yet.  And he basically said the same at Intel.  He basically almost that was for the SEO.  He threw that in.  He basically said the same thing.  Microsoft software sucks.  So it's kind of I think it's a continuing theme at Intel.  And now it turns out  that one of the reasons that these tablets perhaps have been held up is  because Microsoft is waiting for drivers from Intel,  I think particularly on the power management drivers from Intel.

Start time: 3325.65
End time: 3345.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Adelini was speaking in Taiwan and the quote that they leave out  in this Bloomberg story, but I've seen it in a couple of places.  He says PC channels and not PC.  I'm going to get the wrong quote.  But he says, yeah, this is not ready yet.  But he says it's the right thing to do to go ahead and ship it.  We need to have this competitor in the marketplace.  And they can update the drivers later.  Right.  And it'll all be fine.

Start time: 3345.82
End time: 3369.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and but how long has it been since Windows?  What's the last one? Seven came out three years, four years.  Remember, the whole PC industry holds its breath  when there's a new version of Windows coming.  Nobody buys a PC because PC users pretty much don't upgrade their OS.  They just buy a new computer.  Yeah. So I remember this happening with Vista.  I remember Vista was very delayed.  Remember, five years delayed. Oh, yeah.  And then the whole industry got stagnant.

Start time: 3369.56
End time: 3371.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You will roll out with Vista. Right.

Start time: 3371.16
End time: 3386.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where they only put out the business version at first.  And the industry just was stagnant.  And so Intel's not selling as many chips as they'd like.  Manufacturers aren't selling computers.  The whole thing holds its breath.  So that's probably what he's saying is we're all holding our breath.  Could you please release the damn thing?

Start time: 3386.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Windows 7 was 2009, October 22nd.  So it's not that long.  I mean, three years is about right.  Yeah, it's about right.  But then every other Windows release seems to run into this problem. Right.  You know, we XP said Vista seven.  Right. And now eight.  Although eight to me looks much better than Vista did at this point.  But I hear a lot of rumble.

Start time: 3408.26
End time: 3421.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And me was the issue with a I don't I mean, there are people  are reporting bugs. I haven't seen them.  But the issue with it really is going to end up being that it's just so very  different in the user interface and that people it's going to make take people back.

Start time: 3421.54
End time: 3427.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just don't understand why they don't allow you to customize that to boot  right to the desktop. That because Microsoft is all in.

Start time: 3428.42
End time: 3453.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft says we don't want to do that because then people won't use the new  Metro Tile interface and we want everybody to use it.  And if you look at the ads for the Windows 8 phone, Windows RT tablet,  Windows 8 desktop, it's the same start screen on all three of them.  And Microsoft really thinks I think this is important to their business.  We've got to go touch.  We've got to get people used to the idea.  And we want people to buy into our ecosystem of phone, tablet and desktop.

Start time: 3453.62
End time: 3467.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the consumers, though, will not change it.  It's only the power users in the enterprise that will.  And I guess they want that's what they want.  They want the enterprise to not be able to change it either.  So that every worker in America and around the world looks at that tile interface.

Start time: 3467.48
End time: 3483.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's just silly. I want that tile thing.  What is that tile thing?  Finally, tiles.  Meanwhile, we did find out that the Windows  Phone 8 will be coming out October 26th as well.  And and this is weird.  Developers will get an SDK that day.

Start time: 3483.66
End time: 3488.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is up with that?  It's like the 29th for the 29th.

Start time: 3488.78
End time: 3490.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry. So it actually comes down a few days later.

Start time: 3490.54
End time: 3503.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Like typically you want to give developers access to the SDK  so they can develop applications for your platform.  And yet when Microsoft isn't releasing the SDK this time around  or they are to a very, very small number of people, is it?

Start time: 3503.96
End time: 3509.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or maybe the key developers have got it.  In fact, key independent developers are also starting to get it.

Start time: 3510.64
End time: 3530.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But why would they even do that?  I mean, I mean, I understand the idea of wanting to build excitement around the release.  But at the same time and not having feature releases out there in the wild.  But I mean, that's not doing them any good in the end.  I mean, the whole point is to try to catch up with other other platforms  that have a really robust ecosystem already existing.  So it doesn't make sense to me.

Start time: 3531.28
End time: 3550.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so so much of the success of both Android and iOS has been  very small developers.  One dude in his, you know, angry bird in his office.  Yeah, that decides that like, oh, I can solve this problem  in a interesting, elegant way.  And it catches on in a big time way.  So picking the winners and losers on this for Microsoft, I don't really.

Start time: 3550.66
End time: 3561.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It concerns me a little bit because I think now Windows Phone 8 will run  Windows Phone 7 software, but whatever the secret sauce is in it  won't be supported by that.  But it will at least be apps.  There'll be a hundred thousand apps.

Start time: 3561.70
End time: 3571.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They may say we don't want developers spending a lot of time on Windows Phone 8  and abandoning Windows 7, maybe that's it, point five  until we absolutely have to have them do it.  That kind of makes sense.

Start time: 3572.42
End time: 3585.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There the the story that Microsoft's giving out is there, as you said,  their secret features, we don't want them to come out.  But Apple all the time does this and people honor the NDA.  Try and get a developer to tell you about secret features.  And oh, I guess we can. I guess I take.

Start time: 3585.58
End time: 3592.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, now, I mean, with with iOS six, you know, we knew  we knew a lot. Yeah.  There are people that were developing for it and, you know,

Start time: 3592.84
End time: 3596.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3596.74
End time: 3612.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you have a wider group of people that could make really awesome apps  that could drive sales for your phone and could really be a feature  that is constantly evolving for your platform at the price of like,  oh, the secret, the big secret will be especially because it's generally conceded.

Start time: 3612.92
End time: 3620.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 3620.64
End time: 3633.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, even super secretive companies like Apple still give their developers  access to the SDK, you know, under under non-disclosure agreements.  So it's confusing.  I don't understand what would be the impetus for for that. Right.

Start time: 3634.08
End time: 3650.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we'll find out. Maybe there's some.  No, it's provocative.  It's it's talking about it. It's provocative. It is.  Hey, let's talk a little bit about audible speaking and provocative.  We were talking before the show about Cloud Atlas, which comes out this week.  I'm excited about this movie and Sword and Laser.

End time: 3685.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I actually because I have I get I have the platinum plan.  So I get two books a month and I didn't have any credits.  And I bought Cloud Atlas really because I really wanted to read it  or listen to it before the movie came out.  How far into it?  Now, I'm pretty pretty just in the second story.  So it's weird because the stories abruptly stop and the next one starts.  So I'm excited, though, because I love the language.  It's a really interesting book.  And I'm starting to sense something's going on here,  maybe because I saw the trailers for the movie that I understand.

Start time: 3685.68
End time: 3690.84

End time: 3716.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I feel like I kind of know a little bit about the landscape that I'm entering.  In any event, I always liked and I bet you guys agree.  I always like I don't know.  I always like to read the book before I see the movie.  You're the same. I like for the TV show.  You go the other way. Why am I not surprised?  Because you're expanding, because you're expanding.

Transcript:  Yeah, just finish this.  I blazed through it because I loved it.  Republic Lost was put out in 2011  and it's basically identifying the problem with the government  in the United States, and he argues that it's not money  and it's not evil people, it's money in the wrong place,  causing what he calls a gift economy influence.  So there's not a lot of examples of actual graft.  Somebody going and paying for a bill to be passed.  But you feel gratitude to your contributors  and you actually feel like you need to take care of them in advance  because they spend 30 to 70 percent of their time fundraising.  They don't actually have time to read bills.  They don't have time to discuss.  They don't have time to actually fix all these things like education  and government being too big and tax reform.  Because they've got to spend all this time raising money.  And so the voices of contributors are out of whack.  And he says we need to restore confidence in the government  by restoring confidence that the money isn't affecting it.  Even if you can't prove that money is affecting it, we all think it is.  And that's bad. That's just as bad.

Transcript:  It's interesting because Larry, remember, was very big on the commons  and resolving this whole copyright issue.  He created Creative Commons to solve this problem.  And he realized because he knew that we had to have change.  And he was always said, don't steal music.  Let's change the rules. Let's change the law.  And he realized he couldn't.  He was stymied. And he's actually changed his focus  because campaign finance reform has to predate anything,  whether it's SOPA or music or anything else.  You've got to fix this broken system, at least in the US.  I bet you it's true around the world, but at least in the US.

Start time: 3886.28
End time: 3908.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think it's an important read because I think he nails what the problem is.  Now, you can you can debate what the solution is.  He actually gives four solutions.  He says which one he proposes we should try.  He says it's not the only one, though.  We still need to find that solution.  But I think he absolutely pulled the scales off my eyes  in identifying how money is affecting Congress.  Everybody knows it is.

He went back to Harvard.  And a really great guy.  He's been on Twitter before and just a brilliant thinker.  Very one of the most important thinkers of all.  So that's one.

Transcript:  It's called The Storm of War, and it's materials that were released  when the Soviet Union fell, stuff we did not know.  Oh, and it's really very interesting.  But the last chapter is why why Hitler lost.  And it was close.  Could have gone very differently, but ultimately it was in the last sentences.  Hitler lost because he was a Nazi.  The Nazi ideology is what kept them from winning the war.  They had the manpower, the material, the best soldiers in the world.  And they lost because of ideology and no other reason.  Interesting, really interesting.  So I love history.  But now I'm ready for nonfiction.  So and I knew this movie is coming out.  And I have to say, and I'm only on the second chapter.  I don't know. Are those chapters when the second story?  Second story. It's great.  So we've gone from like the 18th century to 1931.  And it's and I'm I know the more is going to happen.  We go in the future, too, right? Yeah. Yeah.  So is this science fiction?  What is what is it? Defies categorization, I think it does.

Start time: 4018.58
End time: 4051.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, there's definitely a fantastical element to it.  It's definitely more in the realm of science fiction than fantasy, perhaps.  But it's six nested stories.  So they're all related to each other and they all take place in different time periods.  And I don't think it's a spoiler to say that you come around  to the second half of the story at the end of the books.  So at the end of the book, rather.  So each story does have a conclusion.  So you won't be don't have to feel like you're just losing the story halfway through.  But it's a very interesting read.  I mean, it really shows how duck and cover.  Oh, it's like the Blue Angels.

But basically talks about how specifically ideas  basically the entire first chapter is how ideas have sex and why.  That is how they combine.  Yeah. Why that separated humans and and this particular era of humanity  and why we should be rationally optimistic going forward.  The fundamental underpinnings.  Why society is I am getting better and better and better.  And even though we have the pressing little things that we focus on,  like campaign finance reform and everything, that ultimately we are on a rocket,  you know, upward as we have been and why we should look at the facts  and the data and can and I want to know that we should be optimistic.

So a total of like twelve dollars.  You get both the Kindle version and the audible version.  And it's cool because as you're listening, as you're reading it, it picks up.  So then you get in the car, right?  You're reading on the paperweight, get in the car.  Now picks up where you left off on the Kindle version and the audio version.  We've been waiting for this forever.  And if you use the audible app, which I highly recommend on Windows  phone, Android or iPhone, it does the same thing.  But with the audio version only.  So when you leave off on my iPhone and I pick it up on my Nexus seven,  it picks up at the same spot.  I do exactly the same thing. It's amazing.  Hallelujah. It works, too. It does work.  I haven't had a chance to try it yet. I can't wait.  Great. So this is Whisper Sync Ready.  When they say that that Whisper Sync for Voice Ready,  that means it'll work with the Kindle version and the audio version.  I think all of the audio audiobooks work now.  Yeah, they all sync.

In a month we'll ask him.  He's been writing really interesting articles for the New York Times about Silicon Valley.  That's become his beat.  That's why he hasn't had time.  Maybe that's it.  So this one is about Dick Costolo who is the CEO of Twitter.

Start time: 4390.98
End time: 4432.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  They discuss how Dorsey, who of course is also the CEO of Square,  has been focusing more on Square lately.  And according to Bilton sources, some of the Twitter employees are not  all that upset to see him less involved.  This is a direct quote from the New York Times story.  Mr. Dorsey's role has since been reduced after employees complained that he was  difficult to work with and repeatedly changed his mind about product directions.  He no longer has anyone directly reporting to him, although he is still involved.  In strategic decisions.  And then he goes on to say, Mr. Costolo says he looks to Mr.  Dorsey for ideas and sometimes has to pull them out of him.  Although Mr. Dorsey is a regular on the media.

Start time: 4433.04

Dick does a good job of saying, Jack, what do you think?  Says Michael Sippy, director of consumer products at Twitter.  Mr. Sippy works with Mr. Dorsey to make sure that new features are, quote unquote, Twittery.  Oh, boy.

Start time: 4457.34
End time: 4472.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Dorsey invented Twitter.  Indeed.  It was his idea when he was at Obvious.  I don't know.  I often wonder how can he be both the product guy at Twitter and run his own company?  Yeah.  So maybe that's part of it.  He's tired.  He's resting at the meetings.  He's closing his eyes.

Start time: 4472.36
End time: 4485.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like he may just not be a good manager.  Fine.  They want his brain and they're like, you go run Square.  Just stay on the payroll here so we can mine your brain for ideas sometimes.  Well, but the problem seems to be his brain.

Start time: 4506.14
End time: 4551.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's not something I want.  Don't even get me started.  All the iOS apps, the new Twitter apps, first of all, they kill the third party apps.  They basically say to third parties, thank you, but no thanks.  You got us to this point, but now we're going to do it ourselves.  Then they take the Apple apps and they trash them.  They take everything that was good out of them and they make them garbage.  Now let me ask you about this.  I did not watch the debates and watch Twitter at the same time,  but it sounds like you with your iPad and your TV.  My Nexus 7.  You're watching the Twitter, right?  Somebody told me that in the Twitter stream, there were paid ads from Milt Romney's...  Milt Larson.  Milt has many different Twitter accounts, apparently.  There's a whole bunch of Milt Romney Twitter accounts  and that you were seeing them in the stream.  Did you see those?

Start time: 4551.80
End time: 4574.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did see that, no.  And I was looking in the app.  It was an official Twitter app and I was following along.  Now I was on tape delay.  You wouldn't have seen them.  And so I'm following along.  I think Obama was too.  And reloading.  And so maybe I avoided them because...  If you're not watching live, live...  But I think they would be cached in...  I mean, because all I was doing was scrolling down 10 minutes  to what people were posting at the point where I was watching.

Start time: 4574.52
End time: 4580.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, let me ask the chat room or Veronica or Justin,  did you guys see ads in the debate during the debates in Twitter?

Start time: 4580.91
End time: 4589.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I didn't.  I was on my phone on Tweetbot and I didn't see anything,  but I don't think I see them on Tweetbot.  That's true.  Yeah.  Ads in general.

Start time: 4590.09
End time: 4616.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same thing.  I had Tweetbot on my phone.  I was following through, but I didn't see any ads in there.  But although I'll tell you what, the political ad controversy...  Did you guys follow this this week?  All the liberal and conservative blogs are furious with the campaigns.  Why?  Because both campaigns have gone to more of the cookie-centric...  You know, like the ads that just show up anywhere  that they'll try to buy the certain kinds of users.  So those ads that follow you around...

Start time: 4616.60
End time: 4618.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 4618.86

Start time: 4624.68
End time: 4648.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't get the big buys directly from the campaign.  So now normally they would look to these seasons like the television networks do.  There are networks in Orlando and Virginia Beach  where it's just a gigantic boon for them that every ad they have is bought out  by a political campaign.  This is normally what happens for sites like,  let's say, Little Green Footballs on the right or the Daily Coast on the left.

Start time: 4657.04
End time: 4670.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  First of all, you don't buy from them because those people have already made up their mind.  All you care about in a presidential election is people who haven't made their mind up.  You want to turn out.  You want to make a good base.  Really?  Oh, turn out.  All right, all right.

This guy...  And during the debate, I'm sure political posts were flying fast and furious.  Anyway.  And it could spit out a bunch of that stuff.  But I think what they were...

Start time: 4734.24
End time: 4755.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The guy who was telling me about this said,  they were is they were...  As Romney would make a point, there were links to further information about that.  Or when Obama would say something and say, now this is well, look at this link.  And it was a really good way of kind of annotating the debate for your candidate.  Sure.  If they didn't do that, they ought to have done that.  Or maybe not.  Maybe people who watch Twitter...

Start time: 4755.72
End time: 4760.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, why can't they just do that on their own Twitter accounts instead of doing ads?  Well, they were, but the problem is you have to follow them.

Start time: 4762.18
End time: 4770.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what they wanted to do is to get to people who weren't following Romney accounts.  You're right.  They're doing it on the Romney accounts, but they want to get it to people who aren't following.

End time: 4775.96

End time: 4814.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's my point though, is that...  That's good.  It shouldn't be showing up there.  It should only be showing up with someone who's actually tweeting about the debates.  Because the way that's brilliance of Twitter's promoted tweet is that  they're supposed to only show up to people who would want to see them.  The algorithm is supposed to look and say,  oh, you're following these people and you're posting about these kinds of topics.  So we'll give you that promoted tweet because you're going to go, oh, that's interesting.  So maybe I wasn't a qualified tweeter.  Maybe.  I guess I was watching on TweetBot.

I think and you just you lose interest after a week.  I was playing SimCity on Facebook for a while, which I love.  I love SimCity.  I love everything they do.  And then after a couple days, I was like,  I'm not going to do this anymore.  It's too complicated.  There was a great article, I think by Lee Alexander about why we get sick of these  games so quickly and why we're not getting as much out of them as we could because they  hook you real early by giving you like, oh, the quests are really easy to complete and  you can build up your farm real fast.  And then all of a sudden, you're not getting stuff as easily as you were.  So then you have to, oh, you have to share with your friends to try to get more materials,  or you have to pay some real world money to accomplish this certain goal.  And then suddenly you're like, I'm just not getting that much out of this,  you know, with what I'm putting in.  So it's hard.  You hit a wall with these kinds of games where suddenly it's not as fun anymore.

Start time: 5355.08

The 2600, they were king of the world.  And then they started to make some crappy games.  I remember them bulldozing games because they had flooded the market with crappy cartridges.  And then eventually just basically went bust.  But that didn't mean it was the end of console gaming by any means.  Right.

And you got to make I think that's what Rovio is trying to balance right now is like, look,  Angry Birds is not going to last forever.  So let's do piggies, but let's do it right.  I like piggies.  And let's make it good.  Do you like bad piggies?  And so far, bad piggies seems to be good.  Do you like bad piggies?  I haven't gotten into big bad piggies yet.  But I think what Rovio is doing is that Rovio is doing the right thing.  Right.  They're saying we're not just going to flood a bunch of stuff out there.  We're going to play this at a nice rhythm and not over inflate.  Zynga got a little too excited and just started throwing everything out there.  Like Atari, it's a great comparison.  Yeah.

Start time: 5436.78

No.  Host of NSFW.  There we go.  And...  Weird things.  Of Weird Things, which we're going to see, oddly enough, in about 45 minutes.  Indeed.  Or less, if I can get through this ad.  I want to talk a little bit about squarespace.com.  See, if Google had been using Squarespace,  we never would have been able to bring Veronica's spreadsheet to its knees.  Everything you need to create an exceptional website.  That means hosting.  That means the best content management system on top of it.  You even get the domain name registration now when you sign up for a year plan.  They throw in the domain name registration, hook it up,  so that it goes right to your site.  And I have to tell you, just take a look at...  Take the tour if you go to squarespace.com.  Take a look at the various sites that they...  I mean...  People use Squarespace.  Nothing looks the same.  No two sites look the same because...  Well, yeah, you start with these great 50 great templates,  but you're going to always, and very easily, modify it to suit you.  So it really looks the way you want it to.  This is really important to creatives.  And one of the groups that Squarespace really reaches out to is  photographers, artists, people who are looking for portfolios.  It is such an easy way.  I know there are service providers who specialize in photography portfolios.  Do it yourself.  Save money and get exactly what you want.  And you want to make a change?  No problem.  It's very easy to do.  All the content just automatically reflows.  And in fact, with their responsive designs now,  you make one site that looks great on any size screen,  whether it's an iPhone all the way up to 27-inch display,  because they're automatically resizing the images.  They do seven different thumbnails to fit the right display.  They reformat.  Every template is designed to look great on mobile.  They just do such great stuff.  Of course, the iPad and iPhone apps, now Android apps too,  make it very easy not only to post, but to moderate comments,  to see the stats.  And of course, it works with all of your favorite services.  They've got plugins for all of them.  A great commenting system.  Let me just show you.  This is the pricing, and this is where you're going to really be blown away.  When you sign up for a year plan, they've got two plans now.  First of all, you can get the free 14-day trial just by clicking Get Started.  You don't need a credit card or anything.  If you decide to buy, that's when we're going to ask you to use the TWIT 10 offer code,  because you'll save 10% off your first purchase.  If you make an annual purchase, you're going to save the most.  And look at the prices.  The basic plan is $8 a month when you buy an annual purchase.  $10 when you just go month to month.  When you buy an annual plan, you get the custom domain, and use the TWIT code,  you'll get 10% off.  But I've got to point you to the unlimited plan.  I've never heard of a web hosting company giving you unlimited bandwidth,  unlimited storage, unlimited pages, galleries, and blogs,  unlimited contributors for $16 a month.  I don't know how they do this.

And they hook it up.  The only limitation that I know of is that you have file sizes limited 20 megabytes.  It's the only limitation on this one I know of.  But this is amazing.  20 megabytes.  What are you going to put on there?  I guess you couldn't put your home movies on there.  Store those on archive.org.

TechCrunch wrote this article saying, yep, they're dead.  Next web responded to that.  But yeah, I mean, the problem is we don't know what an ultrabook really is.  It's just a thin, light laptop.  And Intel is trying to define it so rigidly that certain things that we like, well,  that should be an ultrabook, right?  It's not an ultrabook.  That's foolish.  Also, anything not made with Intel.

It automatically adjusts the heat, depending on the time of day  or the air conditioning, if you have it.  And it works wonderfully.

End time: 6705.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 6711.66
End time: 6768.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They just changed the policy.  I'm waiting for that.  So what does that mean?  Essentially, what they've done is rolled the DMCA into YouTube's policy.  Before, it was all an internal policy.  So they take you down before you post it?  There was no negative to someone posting a takedown claim on you.  It was all internal to YouTube.  There was no, it was not part of the legal DMCA.  What YouTube has done is said, if content ID flags you as infringing,  first of all, we're going to try to do a better job of catching uses that aren't infringing.  Second of all, if you dispute it, the content owner has to file a formal  Digital Millennium Copyright Act notice to get you taken down the second time.  If that's frivolous, then there are damages associated with that.  But if it's not, then you go to jail.  And you can file a counter-takedown notice.  Do I then go to jail?  After that, it goes to court.  And they can build up fines.

Start time: 6768.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So John, did they put us back up?  We filed a counter-claim.  I think they put us back up.

Start time: 6775.24
End time: 6795.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because what it used to be is you'd hit the content ID, your video would go down,  you'd file a dispute, it'd go back up, and then the content owner would go,  no, and it would go right back down.  And that would be it.  You wouldn't have any recourse.  Now, the content owner has to go, well, wait a minute.  I could be legally liable if I'm wrong here.  So let me make sure that this is really an infringing use,  rather than just blanket saying no to everything.

Start time: 6798.14
End time: 6809.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because it was weird, because it was Chipotle, Sony,  and some Brazilian television station.  And I'm pretty sure that we didn't infringe on a Brazilian television station.  Well, that's the other problem with content ID.

Start time: 6810.72
End time: 6821.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you include anything in your video and then you add your video to the content ID,  then now every video that was in your video is now in content ID is owned by you.  Were you doing the segment in Portuguese or wearing a thong?
