Transcript:  This is  This is Twit, this week in tech, episode 118 for October 22nd, 2007. The journalist, not the porn star.  This is Twit, episode 118, an unusual panel today, let me tell you. First of all, let's welcome back a couple of previous Twits.  It's Denise Howell, who is the host of This Week in Law and also an IP attorney and perhaps the best known, certainly one of the best known, law bloggers in existence. Hey, Denise.  Hey Leo, great to be back.  Thank you for joining us again. You put your son aside. Is he watching Nemo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. He's under dad's control and I'm just turning my back and letting them go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Last time you were on, he was in front of Finding Nemo. Then he found Nemo and so the whole thing collapsed in a blob.  We all found Nemo.  Her blog is Bag and Baggage. That's bgbg.blogspot.com. Do you still do the Vox and all the other stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do. The place I sort of write my most substantive legal stuff these days is at ZDNet. I write logarithms there, which is lawgarithms.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Issue spotting the live web.  Jerry Pornell is also back. Mr. Chaos Manor from ChaosManorReviews.com.  The father of us all in many ways. Let's put it this way. Jerry hired Dvorak back when he was an unknown wine writer.  Jerry, it's good to have you on the show.  Thank you.  Jerry's Chaos Manor columns for many years was the inspiration for me. I read it religiously every month in Byte Magazine. It's now online at ChaosManorReviews.com.  And a newbie on the show, Brad Stone is tanned and muscular. He is known for his love.  Oh, wait a minute. That's the wrong Wikipedia. Let me go back to the Brad Stone journalist page.  You probably get that a lot, Brad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I've done more to promote the gay porn star Brad Stone than he did himself during the...  But I just I love that, you know, if you Google my name, about half of the results on the first page are pornographic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nowadays, when people name their kids, and I know you have twins on the way, you might want to keep this in mind. They pick names that are unique on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if only my parents had done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So maybe Sophronia Stone. You might think of something like that, you know, something really odd so that there's no... and you've got to come up with two of them too.  Brad is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are lots of Greek goddesses you could go through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be good. Let's see. What would be good with Stone? Xerxes.  They're chipper-y.  Are they girls though, right?  Yeah, Terpsichore would be good. Start with the muses.  How do you spell that?  Get used to it, because if you name a kid Terpsichore, you'll be hearing a lot of that.  Brad writes about the Internet for the New York Times for many years at Newsweek Magazine.  And he also is married to the mother of his twins, Jennifer Granick, who is executive director of Stanford Law School Center for the Internet and Society and just took a new position at the EFF.  She did.  What's she going to be doing over there?  She'll be working on Fourth Amendment stuff and privacy and helping out on their team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wonderful. That's a great cause and a great thing to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Brad is also maybe best known lately for as the guy who figured out who fake Steve was.  How did you do that? You tracked down his phone records?  No, what I did was, well, after I got an early copy of his book, I guess it was about two or three months ago now, which by the way is fantastic and it's going on sale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh really?  I was thinking to myself, this guy has to be a professional writer or a novelist, an accomplished novelist.  So you didn't use any pretexting at all for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did. I should have, but I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And just long story short, I was calling around publishing circles looking for anyone who had had that book pitched to them.  And I found someone who was at least familiar with the cover letter that the Capo Press, the publishers had sent.  And it had mentioned that he was a novelist and that he worked for a major business publication.  I just sort of went through all the biz pubs, plug in people's names into Amazon.com.  And I did Forbes and I came across Dan Lyons and that was the genesis of it.  And then I kind of tracked him down and compared some of his writings and that all fell into place.  Very interesting.  And he was of course pleased to hear from me.  Was he?  No, actually he's got twins also and they're like two years old and they were on, it was their first day of a vacation.  Oh, jeez.  So it was bad timing, unfortunately.  Was he mad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Was he angry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, he's such a fun, funny guy that he took it pretty well.  Busted, busted, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, speaking of busted, I think my favorite story of the week, it really isn't a tech story,  but anybody who's had to deal with customer service is going to love it.  It's about the Washington Post story about the 75 year old woman who took a hammer to Comcast customer support.  She'd had a pretty bad run around.  Her name is Mona Shaw.  And well, according to her, now Comcast disputes it.  They say, well, we can't release publicly their customer service records, but it isn't as she told the story.  But what she says is she had booked Comcast in to install that triple play thing, you know, the phone and the data and TV.  And they never showed up, showed up two days later, left before it was done.  And then two days after that, the whole thing was disconnected.  So she was mad.  So she was mad.  She went down to the public to the public Comcast office in Manassas.  They said, well, she said, I want to speak to a supervisor.  The representative said, somebody will be right with you.  Just go outside, sit outside.  This is mid-August in Manassas where it's a little bit warm.  And they sat there for two hours.  Nobody showed up.  Finally, the representative sticks her head out the door and says, oh, I'm sorry, the manager's left.  But thanks for coming. See you later.  She gets fed up, gets her husband's hammer, goes down the next Monday and beats up the place.  Doesn't hurt anybody, but damages a computer, a phone, a keyboard.  The police come. She hyperventilates. The ambulance comes.  Everybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this wasn't just a spontaneous helper.  She actually had time to cool off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think premeditated would apply here.  I'm no lawyer, Denise.  Beautiful.  Yeah. And of course, everybody's saying, oh, tsk, tsk.  You can't do this, but right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just Google Mona Shaw.  You get the whole story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She's a hero.  So they'll be the statues built to her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'll send her a donation and I think EFF ought to defend her.  Well, I think she got off pretty lightly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They gave her a suspended sentence to fine her $345 for restitution because she had to replace the keyboard and the phone.  And by the way, she does have her phone service from Verizon.  That's not going back to Comcast.  We're not advocating violence against anybody, but everybody can sympathize, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but if you have to go viral, I could give you a list of places to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Comcast might be right out close to the top of the list.  Comcast is actually getting a little heat from the AP.  I haven't really followed this. Maybe Brad, you can fill us in a little bit better.  But an AP reporter heard a lot of the forums they've been saying, oh, you know, I can't start a BitTorrent seed.  Somehow my BitTorrent stuff seems to be throttled or stopped.  And so this intrepid AP reporter did some experiments and apparently he came up with a result that in fact not only was Comcast blocking BitTorrent traffic,  but they were spoofing the guy who was trying to use it, sending out a message on his behalf, discontinuing the torrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And just to add to that, the EFF has been running some experiments itself and you can look on its Deep Links blog.  I think they were caught a little by surprise by the AP story.  But then yesterday or on Friday last week, they released the results of their own tests,  which showed some interruptions of some BitTorrent seeds and also Nutella they found as being blocked in both in San Francisco and up in Oregon.  You know, Comcast has not given us a good explanation yet for what they're doing.  And I tried last week when the AP story broke and I was thinking about following it up for the New York Times.  I was leaving messages and talking to their communications people.  I don't think they even know what's happening.  And obviously the question is, was this sort of premeditated interference of peer-to-peer networks and piracy?  Or was it some sort of network management, self-preservation kind of technology that they have going on here to balance the load  and fulfill all their promised speeds to their broadband customers?  So I'm waiting for Comcast to come out and give us a technologically sound explanation for what people are seeing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Their only explanation so far is, no, we don't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is at odds with reality.  We're not doing that.  Right. But you know, they were telling me on Friday, even though they couldn't explain it,  they were basically acknowledging that their public statement was at odds with confirmed reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  So it's more than traffic shaping, it sounds like.  Traffic shaping would be an automated system just looking at different kinds of packets and saying,  well, I'm going to slow those down. I'm going to speed those up.  This sounds like it's much more active where it's actually sending a disconnect message on behalf of the user.  That doesn't sound like something automated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't. It sounds like somebody is actually approving doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Does this bring the net neutrality debate into focus?  Until now, we haven't really had a smoking gun. Denise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the lawyer in me is thinking about this and saying, you know,  there's so much legitimate activity that goes on on peer-to-peer networks.  I mean, particularly BitTorrent these days, right?  And if they are actually disconnecting people, I could see somebody coming up and saying, you know what,  I was conducting a very important business transaction and I've been damaged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I needed that Star Wars 3 movie. That was important.  No, you make a good point though.  In fact, I've said this too because we used BitTorrent for a long time for Twitter to distribute our files.  Linux distributions use it. There's a lot of legitimate legal uses of peer-to-peer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, the brilliance of the AP story was that they were in their test. They used the Bible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's not illegal to distribute that unless God has a copyright. I don't know.  It is from the life of the author forward, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, plus almost eternity, but the Bible would be in the public domain at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's pre-Mickey Mouse, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Almost eternity is 90 years, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is, but it keeps getting extended as long as whenever Mickey Mouse's copyright comes up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does look that way, which is ridiculous. You know how the 50 years came about.  No, I don't.  Victor Hugo. The Berne Convention was essentially dictated by Victor Hugo.  It was to be life plus 50 years and no renewals at all.  When the Congress decided to put the United States under the Berne Convention,  we had to go from what we had had, which was 28 plus 28 with a renewal in the 28th year,  to the life plus 50, and they got in the treaty that they could add more to it.  But we can never go under life plus 50 years as long as we're part of the Berne Convention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm just going to make some joke about Les Miserables, but I can't think of anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was Victor Hugo basically single-handedly convinced the Europeans to go that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So he was the Disney of his time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More so than that even, I guess.  You know, Victor Hugo had the largest funeral in the history of the world.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess my US guilt about Disneyland Paris has somewhat evaporated now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Were you there, Jerry, at that funeral? Just teasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not quite.  I couldn't get a boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So getting back to Comcast, and actually really it brings up the net neutrality issue.  Is this going to bring that neutrality back to the fore?  I mean, here we have the major Internet service provider in the US.  I think we've caught them red-handed doing exactly that kind of discrimination that we were talking about.  I know that it happens in Canada.  I know both Sean Rogers have been accused of blocking VoIP traffic.  Does this mean that we'll talk about net neutrality again, or is that just dead, dead, dead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It hasn't seemed to me to be dead.  I mean, maybe it has gotten somewhat more quiet, but I think it's on the minds of the legislators.  It ought to be now.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As you all know, I probably am the lone figure here, but I don't think we ought to be regulating this.  We talked about this last time you were on, Jerry.  That's correct.  That's right.  I do think, though, that we ought to enforce truth in advertising.  Yeah.  If an ISP...  Most of the customers have a legitimate interest in limiting some services.  If 90% of the bandwidth is being used up by people downloading porn, then the other users have some right to say,  wait a minute.  On the other hand, they ought to tell you what limits they place on what you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and Comcast is notorious for not doing that.  They have a kind of secret bandwidth limit that they've never revealed, but they have enforced.  That's correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's correct.  And if they advertise unlimited bandwidth, then it seems to me they ought to provide unlimited bandwidth.  But if they will say that we are going to limit it under certain circumstances, they at least gave you a warning about that.  I don't really believe that all of that dark fiber should be lit up with porn.  No.  I just don't see any reason to, especially if what our conversation right now suddenly dragged because somebody else is coming in using up the bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But at the same time, that's making an assumption about what's going on with BitTorrent that may not be accurate.  I mean, let's face it, probably most BitTorrent traffic, most Nutella, certainly almost all Nutella traffic is copyright materials that are being traded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's intellectual piracy which takes money out of my pocket.  That, as you probably know, is my one real beef with EFF.  And I've been a supporter of EFF for a long time, but they were on the wrong side on that Scribd mess, as an example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's interesting if you look at what happened with the Radiohead album, Rainbows, which they were giving away or they said, come to our site, download it.  It's whatever you want to pay for it.  You could pay nothing and download the album for free.  Nevertheless, people are, it's still being downloaded like crazy from the torrent sites illegally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to take a long time for consumers, for people used to using those file sharing networks to download music to begin to change their habits.  And I mean, the Radiohead step was ambitious and sort of courageous, but it's the first move.  And I don't think you can expect a lot of the people that have been getting their music and their movies in this way to immediately kind of see the light.  Do you think people think it's even know that it's illegal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Do you think it's just kind of automatic? They just do it?  They don't pay any attention to whether they're getting it legitimately or not.  It's just there and they get it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think particularly in this Radiohead instance, I think a lot of people believe that it's legal because they know they can get it for free.  So why not on the site? You know, that's been publicized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So and I already have Nutella running or I've already got my BitTorrent running.  Why not just do it that way? Right. It's a convenience issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, even though people know they could go and watch clips of Saturday Night Live for free at NBC.com, they'd rather get it from YouTube because that's what they're used to doing.  It's convenient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because I want to give you a gray area when the Rome series was on, I managed somehow not to record the last episode where Caesar is killed.  I didn't have it. Oh, you spoiled it.  They killed Caesar. Oh, yeah.  Brutus did it. Oh, but I didn't have it and I wanted to see it.  Well, it was very easy to fire up BitTorrent and get it.  But you pay for HBO. I pay for HBO.  I just forgot to turn on the Bloomin recorder when it came on.  I mean, I am certainly legally entitled to have a copy, including a copy burned off onto a CD or DVD.  So why shouldn't I be able to download a copy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, nobody would argue that. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think they're going to sue me over it.  But here I am admitting I violated the law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you guys ever read Ed Bott's Microsoft report on ZDNet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, he's great. In fact, we're going to have Ed on Security Now next week or Windows Weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He did a great poll on his blog.  I think it was just last week that was like a media ethics poll just asking open ended questions about is it OK to copy a CD?  How about a DVD?  Yes, some really good questions and got a huge response, thousands and thousands of respondents to the poll.  So I think he's just now kind of wading through all the responses and comments and trying to synthesize, you know, the temperature he was able to take of the public on these issues.  But it's really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He says, OK, is it OK to borrow a CD from a friend and rip it to your hard drive?  Thirty four percent yes.  Fifty three percent no.  Now, I guess, is it OK?  Does that mean is it legal or is it OK with you?  Right. Is it?  Yeah, I think he left that pretty open.  Yeah. Is it proper?  Maybe that's a little more clear to buy a CD and make a copy for a friend.  Yes, twenty seven percent, sixty five percent no.  So there you see there by saying, is it proper?  Same question.  But more people said no.  If you ask, is it proper?  I don't know what that means.  I think I think we all know it's wrong or most of us know it's wrong is the wrong word.  Illegal, illegal, illegal even seems strong, but I guess technically it's correct.  Obviously, is it?  I think we all know it's illegal, but I think a vast number of people, and I'll include myself in this, do it anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I think you got like upwards of a ninety seven percent response that it's OK to make backups of things that you own.  Even though some may have a difference of opinion on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do not laws eventually reflect what is actual practice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Eventually is a big word.  Yeah.  In a hundred years they might.  But fairly quickly.  Ask Jami Thomas. I don't know.  Maybe not soon enough for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there are anomalies, but I one of the reasons that I am always concerned with enforcement of electronic intellectual property rights for authors and why I got so angry with EFF over that scrip DMS is that if you don't enforce the rights, eventually it will become just customary to seize them.  And when that happens, it's very hard to get back to the to the point of it again.  It's like trespass.  If if people if a hundred people a day cut across your field in order to go to school, there comes a time when you can't stop them anymore.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's correct.  That's correct.  And I think you're right.  That law does try to reflect societal mores and values over time.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And over the RIA is dead body.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  That's that's the thing is that, you know, it draws these lines in the sand that, you know, the law takes.  Well, decades to catch up with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the RIA is basically the the equivalent of the firehorses, hoses and guard dogs in this Alma civil rights marches, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let me write that one down.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's very interesting.  They are they are legally they are in the right legal right to do something.  Right.  But they are making that legal right.  Look, so despicable.  Yeah.  That.  That's great.  I mean, I think you can acknowledge it.  I mean, Bull Connor was definitely within his rights to use the firehose on Martin Luther King at Selma.  But I am not convinced that he did his cause a very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's great.  That's a wonderful analogy.  Universal Music is saying we're going to we've got a new idea.  In fact, apparently they've signed up BMG, Sony BMG, another big record label.  They're going to give away music.  The idea for their I think really this is mostly to put iTunes out of business, but their idea is to create a new music store called Total Music.  It is a subscription service.  And they what they hope to do is sell this to cell phone handset manufacturers, maybe Microsoft for its own other MP3 players.  When you buy the device, you get the music for free.  It's an entry.  I think what I like to see is that the music industry thinking of different ways to make this work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you mentioned this last week on Twitter, right, Leo?  And John's comeback was, well, if it's just universal, then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's one thing that's changed is now Sony BMG is apparent.  Anyway, according to the this article in Businessweek, Sony BMG has said it might be a partner.  Warner Music says it might be a partner.  All three of them would control the store.  I think the thing is that they hate Apple and they're really scared of what Apple the power Apple has.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what's this going to do to the cost of our electronic devices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's one thing if it's a cell phone because you're already paying a monthly fee.  You could build a couple of bucks into that almost transparently.  I don't know if it's going to work on the Zune.  I don't know if Microsoft would agree to this.  Although, remember, Microsoft is paying Universal some amount.  We don't know how much per Zune to compensate for all the stealing that's going to happen because people on Zunes.  I don't think that's quite been a windfall for Universal at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But isn't certain amount of that built into the cost of CDs and DVDs now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It isn't not here.  It is on some issue.  Remember, they did for that tape, which pretty much killed that tape.  Yeah.  They've done it for the so-called music CDs, but not for data CDs.  It is in Canada, though.  It's built into all recordable media in Canada.  And you know what's happened there is Canadians say, well, and courts have agreed in Canada.  Yeah, great.  That means it's legal for us to share music.  We're paying for it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and if the if the artist gets the money out of it, maybe that's the right way to go.  What concerns me is, well, again, back to the to books, which I do understand,  I don't really mind if you take a copy of one of my books and you even put it on your website and it's free to download.  You don't advertise it.  You're not using it to draw a crowd.  You're not using it to build web traffic.  This is a favor.  You're doing your friend.  You're not really hurting me, Mike.  But if you're an outfit like Scrib D with four million dollars of venture capital and your entire business plan is to get people to come to your website,  what scares me is if somebody wants to buy an electronic copy of my book and he types in the book title in Google, the first hit is the free copy of Scrib D.  Well, I think that's completely legitimate, Jerry.  I mean, that's not Bain Books that will sell it to him for four ninety five.  But this outfit, it'll give it to him for nothing.  I don't know why the Electronic Freedom Foundation is writing nasty letters to the science fiction writers of America threatening us with a lawsuit for trying to stop that.  I don't know either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  From what that sounds like a reasonable I won't speak for the EFF.  There's the dogs, by the way.  Is that the RIA?  I think our dog here is getting angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Scrib D is still up and around.  You've just given them some unnecessary publicity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We cleaned a lot of that stuff up as a result of science fiction writers of America effort, even though Cory Doctorow went out of his mind over it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I saw Scrib D, I thought that was very, you know, look, the laws, I think are pretty good in terms of protecting you against commercial piracy.  The issue is the RIA going against this kind of casual sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Completely agree.  I mean, you know, we're all and interestingly enough, many of the artists agree.  I mean, Courtney Love came out at one point and said, rip off my publisher.  I haven't.  I don't get the money anyway, but authors of books are not in the same category.  I mean, I'd publish her to the class enemy, but I don't hate my public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Brad, you were just you were just at the Web 2.0 conference in San Francisco.  A lot of new websites announced.  Was it an interesting conference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I have to say I was a little mixed.  I think the Web 2.0 conferences have become a sort of nexus for the kooky over exuberance of this latest bubble, if you want to call it a bubble.  You know, I find that I find that the hallway chatter useful meeting people.  You did a lobby con.  You're doing a lobby con.  But in terms of the folks on stage, I mean, the calorie content is frighteningly low.  I mean, you have Mark Zuckerberg up there to kick things off, you know, giving monosyllabic answers.  You know, what passes for news at these things is when he says that Facebook is close to closing a funding round.  I mean, you step back and you say, God, this is what we're all we have our jets in a broil about.  Rupert Murdoch and Krista Wolf from MySpace gave gave one of the evening presentations.  You know, it was it was great to see Rupert Murdoch up there with his folksy way bowing that he's out to kill the New York Times.  You know, everybody got a thrill out of that.  He you know, he he he contributed that that Facebook at 15 billion was absolutely ridiculous.  But again, you know, in terms of the news content, in terms of, you know, enlightening, revealing, thought provoking presentations from the executives, I thought it was a little disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brad, did you go to 10 Crunch 40 by any chance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that was I would say that was almost worse.  I endured, I think, about half a day of 10 Crunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I had to pick this year.  I've I've conventionally gone to Web 2.0 and and have enjoyed it more for the lobby conversations, as you say, than than the content.  Although I do like John Battelle as an interviewer.  You know, he tends to get people to relax and actually have a conversation, which I do enjoy.  But yeah, I went to Tech Crunch 40 this year thinking that that that was going to be the event of the two to go to.  But but you think not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're I mean, they're all packed and there's a lot of energy and activity.  These things at Tech Crunch 40.  I thought, you know, there were it was more focused on new companies and new startups.  Remember, you know, a couple a couple of companies launched like Mint Dotcom, the new kind of Web 2.0 online finance tool that have gotten some traction.  But some of them are just, you know, are just some nutty ideas of crazy names.  So, you know, unbelievably large financing.  But you just, you know, you sort of wonder what the future of some of these companies is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, you sure make me glad I didn't.  You're making us all feel better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I probably lasted about a day and a half at Web 2.0.  So I did miss some stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is it? Is it that it's a bubble?  Is there nothing there? Why is it?  What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's just I mean, the stages have become particularly with the Web 2.0 Summit.  I mean, it's not a stage that sort of lends itself to this kind of thoughtful discussion that you might get at the TED conference or sort of the more newsmaking environments.  I mean, I guess like CES in a way, you sort of count on companies coming and rolling out some new devices and making news, whereas it's not the case.  I mean, you know, you see some executives almost playing defense, you know, going up on stage with John Battelle,  but then sort of sticking to their guns and proving kind of reluctant to say anything.  How much of this is because big bucks are here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, with Google valued it at more than IBM, Facebook, $15 billion.  How much of this is just that it's just out of control?  It's not the reality has left the building.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Talk about out of control.  Look how much they paid for Skype.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And was it worth it?  I think everyone's holding their breath.  I mean, it's lost any logic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the big differences, though, is unlike the previous bubble, there aren't a lot of IPO.  So it's not like it's going to be a lot of little investors are going to lose their shirts here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  The dynamics are totally different.  And you could say the first bubble was sort of motivated by greed.  And this is motivated in large part by the fear, by fear of missing out on the next big thing and the kind of the oligopoly and Google and Yahoo and Microsoft and eBay to some extent competing for these properties, driving the prices up into the stratosphere, not wanting to lose the property to one of their competitors.  But, you know, as we saw with eBay and Skype and to a certain extent Google and YouTube, I mean, the numbers are unjustifiable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think it's wrong to equate something like Facebook with pets.com.  You know, I mean, there's certainly more value involved in what's going on today.  It's less. But how do you quantify it?  Yeah. And how do you quantify that value?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, and how long does Facebook's values last if the kids decide to go to something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  About five minutes.  It's a gambling valuation.  I have a question for you people, because you go to shows I no longer do.  I used to get excited about going to Comdex where we saw new technology and I was involved in awarding the best show and best technology award and things.  Is there any show like that nowadays that's worth going to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Long pause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, you know, I think, you know, maybe you get sort of declining returns after you go to a lot of them.  But I mean, if I was beginning to cover this space, I think I'd get a lot out of conferences like Web 2.0, you know, CES.  I find a couple of days at CES and of course all the Apple events are always worthwhile.  But, you know, as we said earlier, it's kind of meeting people and making those connections.  At conferences, that's always the big value.  And, you know, after you've been doing it for a while, it's just kind of declining returns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, I am the only human being who went to every damn Comdex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And thank God they put it out of business or Jerry would still be going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd still be going.  I'd still be giving the best of show awards.  Oh, Lord.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Shelley's doing okay, though.  He's done very well with himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Sheldon did very well, but he sold out.  Sheldon didn't go to the last four Comdex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, no, he got out just at the right time.  Didn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think he's building a new hotel.  Sheldon got hurt the other day.  Yeah, Sheldon got hurt very badly the other day.  He fell off his wallet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He has the Venetian, the Sands.  He's a billionaire.  I think he's in the list now, the Forbes list.  He's done very well for himself.  Did he start Comdex or just acquire it?  Jerry?  Anybody?  We lost Jerry.  We lost Jerry.  He's going to get him back.  Oh, there he goes.  He fell off his wallet.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was a good part.  I was worried.  I thought, oh my God, Sheldon, something happened to him.  I'm calling him right now.  He fell offline.  We'll keep going and I'll get him back in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to tell him, though, that if he's looking to get back into going to something  that might be worthwhile and interesting for him, I always like Tony Perkins always on  Innovation Summit, which is by no means Comdex.  It doesn't focus on consumer electronics or really hardware at all.  It's much more sort of services oriented.  But it's always interesting and he gets great speakers and again, good hallway vibes.  I think all the video for that for previous years is archived on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do you guys think about the little ones, the anti-conferences, the bar camps, the unconferences?  Love those.  I think to me, that's where the most interesting people are going.  It might be what's happening at the big conferences like TechCrunch and Web 2.0 is that they're  being kind of avoided by the most innovative, most interesting people.  Jerry, can you hear us now?  He's on, but he's not hearing us, I guess.  Brad, you probably have to go to all of these events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they don't want us to stray too far from our desk and from the daily paper.  So I actually have to sort of pick strategically what I do go to.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  There we go.  We've got Jerry back now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They got us blogging now.  So if I go to a conference, I actually have to produce some blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That takes most of the fun out of the conferences when you actually have to work them.  It really does.  You can't really enjoy yourself.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's kind of why I go to conferences.  I love to go to conferences and blog them.  But then again, I'm not working for the New York Times.  Jerry, can you hear us now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I hear you.  Do you hear me?  We do.  I think it's all back to go.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a thing from Vista saying, do you want to know what happened?  Yeah, right.  And Microsoft informed me that Skype was, it was all Skype's fault.  Yeah, of course.  You know, I love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love that thing.  In fact, Vista will come back now.  If it can't, quote, resolve the issue, your resolution, by the way, is see if there's  a newer version.  But if it can't resolve it, it will come back in a few weeks and Vista will say, you know,  you still have some unresolved issues.  Would you like me to check now?  It is the most helpful but completely useless tool I've ever seen.  I have Vista on the machine I'm talking to you with and I really shouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I really should have used XP.  You're a little hot, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If you can, I don't know if you have control of your level, but if you can cut it a little  bit, that would help.  I'll try.  Does that help?  No, it went the wrong way.  Did it?  Yeah.  That's all right.  We can live with it.  It's not awful and I have tools to mix this down later.  So, Kelly, we're not going to go to any more conferences.  That's resolved.  We're just going to stay here in our little rooms.  And the truth is, now this is what Dvorak has said for a while, you don't really need  to anymore.  You could just, you know, watch from afar.  There's so much coverage.  Everything is so over covered nowadays.  You can just watch from afar.  That's what I plan to do from now on.  Yeah, but you were talking about the small participatory tools.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those are fun.  Yeah, those you, I think, really get a lot out of and both as a speaker and as an attendee.  I like the unconference.  I haven't been to one, but I just love the idea that there is no presenters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're all part of the conference.  Hey, I was watching the World Series of Poker the other day and they had a lot of ads for,  surprisingly, poker sites.  And each one of them said, this is not a poker site.  We won't take your money.  The World Trade Organization now says we want billions of dollars in compensation from the  United States because of the ban on Internet gambling.  The WTO is in defense of Internet gambling.  Wow.  Kind of an amazing position they're in.  Yeah.  I guess the legal point they're making is that the U.S. has renamed the World Trade  Organization.  The point they're making is that the U.S. has reneged on commitments to the WTO.  Antigua won a victory when the WTO ruled that the U.S. had violated its treaty obligations  by excluding Antiguan gaming operators while allowing domestic operators to continue gambling.  So what did the Bush administration do?  It just withdrew the whole industry.  It said the whole thing shut down.  And as a result, all 151 WTO members are considering seeking compensation equal to  the size of the entire U.S. land-based and online gaming market of nearly $100 billion.  That's great.  But this is not, we want to point out, a poker podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess the money's not going to stay in Vegas then.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What happens?  What's earned in Vegas stays in Vegas.  You know, it's funny.  I wonder, because I look at these ads and if they're not taking any money and they're  not doing any gambling, then what are these sites doing?  There must be somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, they're all the partner sites of the real gambling sites.  So I forget all the names and there are a lot of them.  Let's say partypoker.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, partypoker.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are they advertising?  Partypoker.net.  That's the free site.  And then of course you make the jump to partypoker.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But how if you're a U.S. citizen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't think, do they block you from partypoker.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but I think you can't use your credit card.  I don't know.  I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  I think you can't use your credit card.  I mean, basically, so traditional gambling interests have forced the government to kind  of outlaw this internet poker.  All the enterprises went overseas.  Well, you know, the media companies are not.  They're all in Antigua apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're not supposed to accept advertising from the poker company.  So you have this ridiculous arrangement.  And then anybody that does want to gamble on these sites will figure out a way to get  around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like Jerry was saying.  The law currently doesn't reflect practice.  Well, the law is there to protect Atlantic City and Las Vegas is what the law is really  there for.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To count out a powerful interest.  And, you know, if they're trying to accomplish something, an anti-gambling, you know, a true  anti-gambling initiative, they're certainly failing on that front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Big week for PC manufacturers, according to I guess it was Gartner.  Maybe it was IDG.  Yeah, I'm sorry.  IDC.  PC sales, the fastest rate in two years.  Sales of portable computers driving much of the increase in global sales, especially  in Europe.  15.5 percent increase.  Dell doing well, but HP pulled ahead.  And Apple, surprisingly, doing very well.  In fact, Apple outpacing both HP and Dell.  Now, Apple, now the number three computer manufacturer in the U.S.  And something like, depending on who you listen to, a 32 percent increase in computer sales  over the last quarter.  Why are so many people buying computers?  Go ahead, Denise.  I'm sorry I interrupted you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to ask if anybody caught Halle Berry on The Tonight Show the other night plugging  her Mac and she was using Photo Booth to take funny pictures of herself, which she  then gave Jay Leno and you know how they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did she actually bring the Mac on stage with her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, but she brought the pictures she had printed that, you know, had distorted her  face in crazy ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Photo Booth has probably sold more Macintoshes than any application since Lotus  123, since VisitCalc.  It's kind of amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  As you were saying this, you know, it just occurs to me that, do you know anybody who  really doesn't even consider buying a Mac for home use if you're going to buy a home  computer?  You know, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nobody I know, but oddly enough, whenever I talk about this, especially on the radio  show, which is kind of a national thing, I get a lot of email from people saying 90 percent,  98 percent of all users not only use Windows, but love Windows.  You're crazy.  What is all this Mac talk?  You drank the Kool-Aid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't get all the all the surge in growth.  I mean, unless everything was kind of on a time bomb and all the old equipment just died.  You know, I mean, there's some of it's Vista.  But I have to say, I think there's a huge backlash against Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Look at I mean, Jerry, look at what you just said.  I mean, every every journalist I talk to is starting to say things like God, I hate Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I wonder, are those Dell and HP sales numbers?  Do they reflect Vista sales?  Well, I know, you know, Dell actually sells XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think they break it down by operating system.  But if if PC sales are up this quarter, it has to be because there was pent up demand before Vista came out  and people were waiting for Vista to come out.  And maybe they were waiting for Vista to be a little more mature.  And now they're buying.  I think some of the success Apple's having, of course, is a halo effect from the iPod and the iPhone.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People get people get used to such a good experience on those devices and they come to expect it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like my iPhone. I like my iPod.  Let's take a look at a Macintosh.  Apple dropped the other shoe on the iPhone.  This was actually big news.  They say in February they're going to release an SDK and third party apps will be allowed on the iPhone.  But if the SDK comes out in February, it's going to take a few months to develop.  It's going to be till June or maybe even this time next year before you start seeing these applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder why it took them so long to.  Their first instinct was obviously to squash that larger developer ecosystem.  But of course, it's great for the iPhone.  Yeah, dumb move.  In just the same way it's been great for Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. I don't understand it.  In fact, if you look at it just on a small scale, if you look at these micro blogging sites,  the ones that do APIs get all this development.  I'm looking at Jaiku and Twitter. Just look what Twitter did.  They had an API and more software is written for Twitter by people who don't even gain anything from it just for fun.  Just because they had an API.  There's a lot of people out there.  If they love you, if they love the iPhone, want to develop for it.  I don't understand why Apple would be so reluctant.  Steve Jobs says it's for security.  He says we want to develop this as a secure platform from the ground up.  He believes that cell phones will be the next big target for hackers.  He doesn't want the iPhone to be a platform for them.  But I have to point out every other smartphone supports third party applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't get the security concern from an app.  I guess it could be a virus.  Well, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Part of the problem, somebody pointed out to me, I think this is true, is that the iPhone,  we're getting a little off tangent here, a little geeky.  I know this panel is not set to talk about this, but the iPhone, you run in root mode,  which is not a good security policy.  That means any application on the iPhone has absolute access to everything else on the iPhone  and can in fact hack it.  So I guess that's, you know, it was written insecure.  My feeling is that the iPhone...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's how it was so readily hacked then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, exactly.  My feeling is the iPhone was rushed to release and it really isn't a finished product.  In fact, the next generation iPhone will be 1.0.  This was a beta test.  And right about when these apps come out, that's when you're going to see the next generation in.  That'll be the real iPhone.  This was just a test, ladies and gentlemen.  Yeah, it's a good test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm still loving mine.  Do you have one?  Yeah, I do.  I'm looking forward to Google getting their hands on the SDK and writing a Gmail app that works as well as their Gmail app for other mobile phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was, by the way, the big story this week was the G phone, the Google phone.  I got a lot of people asking me about that, including a number of business journals, I guess because CTIA,  I guess because CTIA is coming up and there's some thought, I don't think it seems possible, that Google might be announcing a G phone.  Brad, do you think that that's the case?  Do you hear anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think, you know, I don't cover Google, but the paper's written about it a couple of times.  And I think we're going to see something by the end of the year.  You know, it seems, you know, that I guess it's partly a kind of relationship with several handset manufacturers and, of course, an effort to deliver ads to a mobile phone.  Not something I'm personally all that excited about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It seems like location based advertising, though, is a prime place for Google to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, you're walking down the street and it says, hey, there's a pizza.  I know you happen to like pizza a lot and the best pizza in town is just around the corner.  That's an ad that, you know, you'd want to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you're driving at the time and as the ad comes through, you veer your car into the traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Like Michael Scott, you drive into the lake.  But the phone told me to.  Yeah, maybe, maybe not.  Maybe it's not such a good idea.  What do you, we haven't had a chance to talk to either of you.  And by the way, Jerry's falling off again.  Vista probably crashed on him.  We'll get him back as soon as we can.  But Denise and Brad, I'm curious what you think about the spectrum auctions next year and Google's announced intent to participate in those.  What does Google want with the 700 megahertz spectrum?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think they want to crack the stranglehold of the wireless carriers.  They want to be a cell carrier themselves.  I doubt it, but they want to open it up to innovation and let developers play there and create a range of new services and devices.  The kind of innovation we see online now bring that to the cell phone environment.  I think it's just kind of defensive and keeping it out of the hands of the big carriers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wouldn't you, Denise, like an iPhone if you didn't have to pay AT&T, it worked on a wireless network that was ubiquitous and high speed.  It had VoIP on it.  Maybe it had Skype or something like Skype on it.  And maybe even got it for free because Google subsidized it because every once in a while you were going to see an ad.  That seems to me like a reasonable business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what we call in the legal profession a leading question.  And the answer is, of course, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's why I don't, to be honest with you, the reason I ask that, that's my problem with the iPhone is I'm so limited.  I don't want to be with AT&T. I don't want to pay him all this money.  I want to be able to put third party applications.  I want those kind of freedoms.  And the iPhone just begs and screams that kind of freedom.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. And yeah, the edge network is sort of the iPhone's one big downfall.  God awful, yeah.  I think I'm back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jerry's back, ladies and gentlemen.  Yes, hello.  Are you still on Vista?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unfortunately, and you can blame the law.  I had to reset the machine and of course Vista sort of takes a small lifetime to reset.  I hate Vista. I really hate Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now you've used every version of Windows since 1.0 probably, Jerry.  I have.  And would you say this is certainly not the worst version ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, ME was worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's not saying much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Other than ME.  Wow.  The problem with Vista is when it works, it works very well.  And it's really pretty and it's got lots of neat things and I love this moonscape.  But great, heavens.  For instance, this last time I was on, I could hear you, but it kept telling me,  microphone is muted and I couldn't find anything that would let me turn it back on again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Vista seems to have its most trouble with audio and video.  And I have to think, now Ed Bott wrote a, I think a very good and pretty damning article  about Peter Gutman's piece about copy protection in Vista saying,  now Gutman was all wrong.  However, I have to think that the copy protection in Vista has something to do with the fact  that it has miserable time with audio and video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think that's it?  I have to think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that because they locked down stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's just a lot of code going on to accomplish all of that.  Yeah, you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's always stuff going on in the background.  Go ahead, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say digital rights management generally seems to do more harm than good  in the sense that it irritates paying customers without doing a heck of a lot of good to protect you from pirates.  So I point exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The only people at thwarts are people who are honest.  Everybody else just gets right around, goes right around it.  That does seem to be the case.  But good news, the record companies have figured out a way to get you back into the store.  They've decided that the CD is not as cool as it used to be.  Universal, Warner and EMI are going to start selling music on flash drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my.  That's crazy.  I thought you were going to tell me they were going back to vinyl.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I would.  Now I would go for that.  But Universal says the move is aimed at the younger 12 to 24 year olds who apparently still want to own a physical product, but just don't want to own CDs.  It'll be a $10 flash drive.  It'll contain a few songs.  It'll be like a CD single.  Maybe it'll have a wrinkle on it.  That's a CD ringtone and some additional content.  And a USB drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our landfills just won't be able to handle this.  Terrible idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that BRM protected music?  Oh, of course it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's got to be.  You wouldn't give out a flash drive if you could copy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it going to have in the package also all the album cover material?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, maybe.  That's one thing I do miss from vinyl records is those big album covers.  Yeah, they were beautiful.  I love to look at them.  You put your headphones on.  You read the lyrics from the liner notes.  Try that.  We can't even do that with a CD, let alone a download.  Jerry, we're starting to sound like old guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, maybe.  You guys were talking about iPhones a minute ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, you missed that conversation.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I know I didn't miss it.  I heard it.  I just didn't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He missed you.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the next iteration of the iPhone may be the beginning of the end for the paperback book business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Think about it.  Nobody right now or very few people right now go out and buy a book reader to read a book on.  I bought two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, people do, but they don't even...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I know I'm in the minority.  Yeah, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're very much minority.  But if you're already carrying something that is good enough to read a book on, now you're in an airport, you have your choice.  You can Wi-Fi the latest Harry Potter novel or let's be optimistic and say my latest novel, and you can get it by Wi-Fi for $6.95 or something.  Or you can buy a copy there in the airport bookstore for $8.95 as a paperback, right?  Right.  But you're already carrying something.  Why would you carry something else?  I think the paperback book industry is already in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's why I bought the Sony reader.  I bought the first Sony reader and I just bought the new one.  How do you like it?  I actually like it a lot.  What you really want is paper white with black, black text.  The contrast is not quite there, but it's close.  And Jerry, it's getting there.  It's getting there.  It's got like 192 megs of storage built in and you can add an SD card.  So it's based.  I mean, it's hundreds of novels in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're also getting an Amazon Kindle soon.  Oh, Amazon's going to do one?  Yep.  And I think we're going to see it this year.  It's called the Kindle.  It's going to be on Sprint's EVDO network and it's got a little keyboard.  I can't wait to see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the real big deal is going to be when millions of people are routinely already carrying something that is the size of a page of a paperback book anyway.  It's smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, my Sony's even smaller, but you're right.  An iPhone has a good enough screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they can already read a book on it.  It's in their pocket.  And they can just buy another book and put it on its hard drive to read it as opposed to having another physical object to carry.  When that happens, I think paperback book sales are going to start taking a precipitous decline, which is one reason why I worry about protecting electronic book rights.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not a bad thing, though.  Eliminate the paper, eliminate the cost of distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the marketing scheme for paperback books is absurd.  They ship 100,000 books.  They sell 65,000 and 45 and 40 something thousand are pulped.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I swear I'm not trying to give you your lead in for your audible plug with this.  But it strikes me that, you know, I listen to so many more books now than I used to.  And that eats into it as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have the reader because I can carry a lot of books with me.  And by the way, Jerry, it's almost all science fiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's a lot of it's mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is. It will be.  As soon as the new book comes out, it's going to be right on there.  And for some reason, I just like reading science fiction on the science fiction device like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure.  Yes, I think I think a lot of my readers are are.  Sure. They're geeks. You bet.  But I do like.  Larry Niven has never read a Harry Potter book, but he has listened to all of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Now, the question is, did he listen to Stephen Fry or did he listen to the American guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I think he subscribes to books on tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So he got the American guy.  Yeah. I can't remember his name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Stephen Fry would be much better.  Fry was wonderful.  And had he read his book on the technical aspects of poetry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but you know, he just tried.  Just is apparently a big geek because he just his new blog is up, Stephen Fry dot com.  And he did a big long screed on smartphones of all things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you have any interest whatsoever in poetry, Stephen Fry's book, The Ode Not Taken.  Oh, yeah.  It's just wonderful.  It goes into every form of technical poetry ever done.  You know, every rhyming scheme, every every meter scheme, they're all in there with examples and discussions.  And it's just wonderful.  I can't imagine why there is a single poetry class in the country that doesn't use it for a text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's amazing. What a polymath. What an amazing fellow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He really is. He's just wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Big fan. And Stephen, if you're listening, we've been trying to get him on the podcast.  We'd love to get him on the on Twitch just to talk.  So what are you listening to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you get him on, get me on on that one.  Deal.  I'd love to tell him how much I like his stuff.  Deal, Jerry. You got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Denise, what are you listening to?  We actually don't have an audible end in this show, but please tell me what you're listening to right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, actually, I'm listening to something that came out some time ago and it's it's John Stewart's book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love him. In fact, that was one of our picks a few weeks ago.  Right. Yeah.  I think I think Paul Therod picked that. Yeah.  Yeah. Right. Which is hysterical.  Yeah. Of course, we're all listening to the new Stephen Colbert book as well.  Oh, yeah.  I agree with you, Jerry.  I think that the screen on the iPhone is good enough that I would read stuff on there.  In fact, I probably prefer it because it is paper white with black text on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Now think about what happens when authors get used to publishing books in that medium.  Right.  And start including photographs of models with the right costume with the costumes that they have in mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Too bad Heinlein's not still with us.  I think he would have enjoyed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Robert always told me that the cover he always liked best was Friday.  That Friday cover sold more copies of Friday. Friday turned out to sell more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not surprised. I am. I'm looking at my iPhone and I have a pretty girl on the cover.  Always put a pretty girl on the cover. I would put a pretty girl on the cover of the podcast if I could.  Maybe I'll put a lease on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what Mr. Heinlein told me. He said if you can get them to put a pretty girl on the cover, it'll sell a lot more books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm looking at my iPod. I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.  I have about nine audio books on it. I mean, my iPhone, I should say.  So that really is a lot of how I use the iPhone is as a book device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing that the Sony reader does so well with that screen from E Ink is the battery life.  Absolutely.  And E Ink does kind of replicate the experience of reading a book.  And you get what like, I mean, the thing never runs out of batteries. That's what the iPhone will never give you.  I mean, you can't, can you take it on a long flight and read a couple books?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you probably could. You get about seven hours of music listening time.  So I imagine you could do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And don't they not sell battery packs that you can plug in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they don't. And that's one of the things that Apple got a lot of heat for.  Well, I predict that there will be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That'll be a big selling accessory for iPhone.  Charge that sucker up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I like the E Ink when it's static, but in fact, one of the big gripes about the E reader,  and the new one's a little faster, is there is a because of the E Ink technology,  the flash that you get when you turn a page and the slight delay is actually more annoying to me.  I'd prefer a low less battery life and less of that, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be real interesting to see how Amazon has addressed some of those problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. The Kindle is interesting. I'm looking at it right now. It's 800 by 600.  It looks a little clunkier. This new, you've got to see the new.  Do you have the reader yourself, Brad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have the first one, so I haven't gotten the second one yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just got the second one because I left the first one on an airplane.  The new one is actually much sleeker. The buttons are better placed.  The screen is better contrast.  The Engadget picture of the Kindle doesn't look like it's got very good contrast at all, but that's of course just a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've talked to some people that have used it, that have gotten a demo, and they say it's a nifty device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If it's going to really work, it's got to be white background, black text, good contrast.  It's got to look like paper.  But when they get there, I think you're right. I think you're absolutely right, Jerry.  That's the end of the paperback industry.  Ladies and gentlemen, we want to wrap this up.  I do want to mention that I guess your son is working on the X-Core project,  that Jerry wants everybody to know that you can, for a mere $2 million, get your own rocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, go to the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog,  and the most expensive item in it this year is an X-Core racing rocket,  which you can buy and presumably you can learn how to fly it and race it yourself or sponsor it in rocket races.  And it's only $2 million. It's a wonderful present.  Such a deal.  Yeah, my son is the vice president for finance for X-Core,  so I can't pretend to be entirely neutral on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You've always been a big proponent of a civilian space, I know. You've been very much involved in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, very much so. And that's one reason I guess why my kids kind of got into the space business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you must be gratified by the progress we've made. I mean, the X Prize successfully won and so forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but I will tell you, Leo, if the Congress were to say that we will pay a prize of $10 billion  to the first U.S. company to put 30 Americans on the moon and keep them there alive and well for three years.  You think it would happen?  It would certainly, it wouldn't cost anything to try. It would be worth $10 billion if they did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Google's putting up $10 million. Google's putting up some money. Maybe it's not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the prizes are getting there. A $5 billion prize for reusable ships that go to orbit and come back 12 times a year, you know?  I mean, real reusable, not the shuttle, which doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We have so many issues though here on Earth. We've got to solve this file sharing problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but Leo, for heaven's sake, 90% of the resources are available to mankind or in space, not here.  I could build you solar power satellites that would beam power down. Now we're talking about solar 24 hours a day, not eight hours a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now that's something that puts some money into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem with solar is you've got to store the energy to use it nice, right?  Those batteries will kill you, absolutely.  Well, not if you have space power satellites, you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And this is, what is the name of the new book? Are you going to talk about this in the new book?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, the new book we're doing is a sequel to Inferno, the one we're sleeping right now.  Oh good. I love Inferno, by the way.  Inferno 2, Escape from Hell, where Alan Carpenter tries to figure out just what is the point of having a hell.  I can't wait.  The local parish priest says it's Vatican 2 meets Dante.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love it.  Well, before my vista crashes, and it's starting to make some odd looking noises, so I better wrap this up.  I encourage you to go to chaosmannerreviews.com.  That's where Jerry publishes the Chaos Manor column that I won't say grew up reading.  I started in my 20s, but boy, it sure was influential for the last 30 years of my life, and I just love reading Chaos Manor.  It's still there.  Chaosmannerreviews.com or jerrypornell.com.  Thank you so much for being with us, Jerry. We really appreciate it.  Thank you.  Great to talk to you.  Stone is in the New York Times all the time, and the Bit blog, of course, and has his own personal blog, but I think that's slowed down now that the twins are on the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the newspaper has been taking up all my time.  How dare they?  I know.  But yeah, we started, we're old media guys blogging at bits.blogs.nytimes.com.  It's actually been a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's a great, you know, the Times, for being the gray lady, is actually pretty forward thinking.  They've got the video stuff.  They've got these blogs now.  I think it's pretty cool.  I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, and they opened up the archives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, thank goodness.  That's right.  I am a Time, I'm a Time Select guy.  I'm a Time subscriber, so I got Time Select, but I really think that's a great move.  I really do.  Yeah.  Thank you, Brad.  It's great to have you.  Your first time on Twitter.  Please come back and join us soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When are the twins due?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, December 3rd, but twins come early, so it could be soon.  Well, we might have to get you back sooner than that then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why Patrick's not here, by the way.  We congratulate him.  His baby boy, Seamus, was born this week.  Patrick and Sarah Norton and Seamus are all doing really well.  He was a nice, healthy eight pounds some ounces and 19 inches.  And Seamus is a perfect name for somebody who likes the flogging mollies as much as Patrick Norton does.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say they have to get him a little tiny kilt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He'll be wearing a utila kilt, I'm sure, soon.  Denise, great to talk to you again.  Blogarithms is on the ZDNet blog site.  Is there a quick and easy URL to that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's Logarithms, L-A-W-G-A-R.  Blogarithms is actually Doug K's blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Damn him.  How dare he?  L-A-W-G-A-R-I-T-H-M-S.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's easy to remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's great.  And of course, Bag and Baggage and Denise's This Week in Law will be back soon.  I know you have a record session soon, right?  Soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are.  We're recording in just a couple of days.  And Brad, I promise I'll give Jennifer a couple of months to recover and have some good time with the twins before I start hitting her up to be on my show.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure even while she's on maternity leave, if you give her an opportunity to talk about the issue she cares a lot about, she'll love to do it.  That'd be great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We can time it during a nap or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Two words.  Finding Nemo.  Thanks, guys.  We appreciate your time.  Another twit is in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When you search for Brad Stone in Wikipedia, it gives you a little page that says, would you like the journalist or the porn star?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There you go.  I didn't go that far.  Journalist and porn star.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm Brad Stone.
