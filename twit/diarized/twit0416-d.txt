Transcript:  Yeah, it's been a long time. What was your first show?  First show that I did was an interview show called the pipeline.  Still doing it?  Still doing it occasionally. And I did another one called the conversation.  What prompted you to get into MySpace?  What prompted you to get into MySpace?  Into years. You know, I'd been doing podcasts on and off for a while since like maybe 2005, 2006. And I was at a place where I had been like a CTO of some tech startup in San Francisco.  And I didn't like that. But I loved doing the podcast.  It was so much fun.  I always wanted to be in radio and TV. And that was my major for a little while in college.  Oh really? Oh interesting.  I did a lot of it.  It was a wise move.  Yeah, that's what everyone says. So I actually did software development and I did IT and I did that stuff for a long time.  But I always wanted in my heart to do radio. And I read a piece on you in the New York Times that was talking about what you guys were doing and the success that you had coming from leveraging radio and doing it like this.  And I thought, well if he's able to build this whole business, I can pay my mortgage.  So that's what I started out to do. And I brought the sort of separate shows together into one umbrella.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's what happens. You go, I can do a couple more. I'll do a few more.  But you're doing more than I am. We don't do that many. I think we do 35. I'm nervous about doing too many because it's confusing I think.  I look at Revision 3 and they had so many shows. I couldn't figure out what they were doing anymore.

Start time: 241.34
End time: 252.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I mean the problem is people come and they get to the page or they get to the site or they look at it on iTunes and there's so many different shows. Which one are they supposed to go to? So it's kind of an ongoing challenge to figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you. I shut that down when I got to Engadget back in the summer of 2008. And yeah, I haven't had a chance to post anything since then. So yeah, I thought I'd go ahead and post some stuff up there in the interim and then we'll see where the wind takes me from here.  So what happened at Engadget?  There's not a lot that I can or should say at this point, but suffice to say I'm no longer with Engadget. It's been about two weeks now since I stepped away from there.  And yeah, I've been having a lot of good conversations with a lot of people. Thankfully I'm happy to say a lot of interest in what I was able to do there. And so I'm looking forward to seeing what the next chapter is.

Transcript:  Wow. Isn't that awesome? It's nice to have a little free time, I gotta say. I wish somebody would fire me. I cannot wait. Just to take it as he looks around for.  Nobody can fire me. It's terrible. So and I'm not saying you were fired, Tim. I don't know what happened and we're not we're not guessing. And I know you can't probably for legal reasons say what happened. But  I'll just keep smiling.  Their loss. Let's put it that way.  Yeah. Thank you.  So I am really happy. I have two things in my hot little hand that Google announced on Wednesday. This is the Nexus 7 2013 edition. And I didn't even want to I like it so much. I didn't take it off my TV. I have the Chromecast at home.  I wanted to I didn't want to take it off the TV. It was kind of a surprising announcement on Wednesday because well this had leaked out the Nexus 7 had fully leaked out everybody. Everybody knew that's what you know the invitation was breakfast with Sundar Pichai kind of a casual laid back thing.  Not a lot of people were invited. They did stream it. Thank goodness because we weren't invited. But at 9am they we were able to turn on the stream and watch. And nobody was really surprised because it had been a year since the original Nexus 7. It was due for a refresh.  In hindsight we maybe should have paid more attention to this because this Nexus 7 turns out to be a pretty big deal. But then they clobbered us with Chromecast which nobody had. Well I guess we kind of knew there was going to be a Google TV something. But what a shock. So let's start with Chromecast and we'll get back to the Nexus 7. Dan were you surprised by this.

Start time: 434.40
End time: 447.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I mean this is the kind of thing that you know you want Google to kind of come out with something that surprises you at this point because their other offerings have been kind of you know when they did little experiments with a little ball that had the.

Start time: 447.04
End time: 456.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well this is the successor to the queue which was they never even tried to sell it. It was such a horrible idea. But so you've got this thing and this is plugged in you're using this now. Yeah.

Start time: 456.72
End time: 493.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not OK. So let's. So to me it's more potential than reality. Right. So right now Tim do you have a Chromecast. Did you get one. No I did not get one but I've been reading about it closely. And interestingly we actually had pictures adding gadget of this guy about two months ago.  We didn't know what it was and we didn't actually see the port end of it. We only saw the other end of it. So we were trying to figure out what a chrome USB key would be. We're thinking maybe it was like Chrome OS on a USB key that you can plug in and run from anywhere.  But we couldn't we couldn't connect all the dots so we didn't run with it. But now it's interesting to see that's actually an HDMI port on the end. Not a USB port. It looks like a thumb drive with a bulb.

Start time: 495.34
End time: 706.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instead of the USB port though there's an HDMI port on the other end there's a micro USB port. You do need that for power. It is not an MHL. I verified this is not an MHL HDMI port so you can't power it from an MHL port.  But you know that means it works with every HDMI television or monitor. It is in its conception maybe a little confusing. You might look at that and say oh that must be an Android like an Android USB stick. It's not.  Apparently runs Chrome OS and supports a protocol called dial which is not new. As far as I can tell and we were just talking with our system and Bear who's looked kind of into it. It is pretty much open through and through.  They've offered an API and SDK that they really did it in a very interesting way. They slowly revealed how open it was. At first it sounded like oh this is just going to be a Google Play music playing device.  Then they said we've got to deal with Netflix. Oh okay so they had a partnership. And then they said and Pandora's coming. Okay we'll have two partnerships. And it's open and we're going to have an API and SDK and anybody could Chromecast enable anything.  And that's when I thought this could be a deal changer but the biggest story is it's $35. And for about three seconds came with three months of Netflix.  And then a million people bought them and that was the end of that. Yeah I think they must have had a deal with Netflix that said something like we'll give a million. A million is a number that leaps to mind.  We'll give a million people three months free of Netflix. Even if you're an existing customer by the way I was able to extend my subscription by three months. And then they sold a million.  And they said oops. So literally within a couple of days they said no more. That's it. It's still at $35 a good deal but it was an amazing deal when you got $24 worth of Netflix.  So here's why I'm excited about it because on the surface all it really does is and the first thing is it's not a streamer. So Apple TV with AirPlay or even now AirPlay on Mountain Lion going to an Apple TV.  You take what's on your screen, squish it down, send it via Wi-Fi to the Apple TV which then plays it on the device. The Chromecast can do that. They say that's in beta.  It could take any tab from Chrome if you have the extension and play it. So it could be a web page, it could be video. But that's not what it's primarily supposed to do.  What it does is this dial handoff where the device and it could be a laptop running Chrome, Android phone, Android tablet and soon iOS. Not yet but soon iOS. If you run Netflix for instance on an Android.  I was able to get my iPad to work. You were. With Netflix. Oh so Netflix has been updated for iOS. Right. So the key is that the app developer has to update their app.  So what happens when you run Netflix, I'll do it on the Nexus 7, is if there's a Chromecast device on the Wi-Fi network there's a Chromecast button on Netflix.  You go to Netflix, you browse it, you find your movie, then you press the Chromecast button. It says which Chromecast. So you can have multiple Chromecasts in the house.  You say I want the one in the living room. And then when you play the movie on Netflix on your tablet it signals the Chromecast. Okay he wants to play this movie.  The Chromecast does the work. It maintains a connection with the device for control. Playback, rewind, fast forward and volume. But you could turn the.  So it's not streaming from your device. It's not. You could turn the device off.

Start time: 706.04
End time: 727.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this was actually one of the frustrations that we had with the Nexus Q because that device couldn't actually play any content from your local network.  And it seemed like that would be something that people would want to do on that device since it would be a high end, high quality audio device.  But it couldn't actually play from your local network which for a $300 audio streamer was a bit of a bummer. But obviously for $35 definitely willing to overlook that.

Start time: 727.36
End time: 798.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Chad's pressing the Chromecast button there on his Android phone. He sees Chromecast 7207. You can rename that. And it's now going to go to that Chromecast and play.  It does this with YouTube. Right now YouTube, Google Play, two Google properties, Netflix, as soon Pandora. But we've already talked to Houdini7, the developer of the Twitch app for instance.  He says he's enabling it on the Twitch app. So you'd be able to launch the Twitch app, press Chromecast and then play through the Chromecast.  Can you stream from a device though?  You can. You can stream any Chrome tab, which means a webpage or video. But it's got limitations. 720p maximum video.  And you have to compress it a lot and you have to send it through the Wi-Fi. So yes it can do that. But I don't think it's primarily what it is.  What's interesting is that it's an open platform. So what will really determine whether this, I think it's worth $35 just for those things.  But what will really make this a value is if other companies, for instance I'm dying to see Amazon put this on Amazon streaming.  Definitely.  Then that's huge. That single thing would make it huge.

Start time: 799.00
End time: 806.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well just having a device that you could do Amazon and Netflix.  Right. I don't think Apple will make iTunes Chromecast compatible.

Start time: 807.08
End time: 810.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Probably not. Not in the future.  I think we can pretty much bet on that.

Start time: 812.08
End time: 855.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a bit bummed that they didn't add in Miracast support. Google made a big deal about adding Miracast support right into the OS in Android 4.2.  And they said they were going to spread it across their devices. But ultimately we haven't really heard anything about Miracast.  What is Miracast?  Miracast is basically the successor of Wi-Fi director. Basically a rebranding of it. So it's a wireless video over HDMI.  So it's compatible with laptops and with a lot of other devices too. And it would have made this an even more powerful, more useful device.  So you can also connect your laptop to it and stream any video from it. You could run presentations on it. You can do anything you want to.  I hope Google will add that into this. And if it's running Chrome OS they certainly could without too much trouble.  But since Google hasn't really talked about it since they added 4.2 I would have liked to see it added in here.  But again, for 35 bucks I can't complain too much.

Start time: 857.68
End time: 873.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean when you talk about the price then it's such a no-brainer given the price.  For 100 bucks it doesn't compare well with Roku or Apple TV.  It doesn't do what they do. It's not as sophisticated. But 35 bucks it's almost an impulse purchase.  It totally is.  Yeah. And then...

Start time: 874.00
End time: 889.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean there's a few people who are listening to this show who can't come up with 35 bucks to spend to just try something like this.  Now are you saying that this thing is good enough right now? Do you think that somebody who's thinking should I get an Apple TV? Should I get a Roku?  That's a good question.  Should I get this? Is it in line with those as far as...

Start time: 890.00
End time: 896.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would wait and see how third party support is. There's rumors that there's HBO Go is working on it.  That would make sense.

Start time: 897.22
End time: 898.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be huge. And why not?

Start time: 899.10
End time: 918.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why not? Why wouldn't NFL, why wouldn't NBA, Major League Baseball, why wouldn't NBA?  They have to be there.  Of course, if it's easy, and I gather it's fairly easy, it's open. Why wouldn't you do it?  So I've got, and especially since now we know it's sold quite well, it's out of stock everywhere.  They could have had 50,000 units. Who knows?

Start time: 919.06
End time: 921.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is only direct from Google where you were getting this, or could you...

Start time: 921.34
End time: 937.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I got it on Amazon. That's how I got it so fast. They had Amazon overnight. Same thing with the Nexus 7.  Staples, Best Buy, other big box stores had it apparently. But they're all sold out. They're all sold out.  But I think we've seen this before. That doesn't mean anything. That doesn't tell you anything.

Start time: 937.00
End time: 957.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would think that anybody who has an Android app streaming video will probably update their app very soon and ultimately make it compatible with this.  So I would think that anything that's already on Android will be playable through this in the very near future, probably within a few months.  And that right there would be a huge suite of functionality. If you don't have one of the newer smart TVs and you aren't really looking to buy a new TV, this is a great way to add that functionality.

Start time: 958.86
End time: 964.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's in many ways a better experience than a smart TV. I mean, I've tried every smart TV, and they're all clunky.

Start time: 965.04
End time: 981.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they're getting better, but they're still a long way to go. And nothing is as easy to use as Android.  I mean, not that Android is a fantastic experience, but it sure is kind of clicking through menus with your remote control on your TV.  You can swipe through it, especially because you could be watching TV while you're selecting the next thing to watch on your tablet, which right there is a real nice experience.

Start time: 982.02
End time: 1043.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's what I did this morning. I'm lying in bed. I got my Nexus 7. I have an app that communicates with my AV receiver where the Chromecast is plugged in.  Because you have to it will support CEC. So if you have it on a CEC port on your TV, it will automatically change the right input.  Otherwise, you have to change the AV receiver to that input. So I did that. I launched Google Play.  I started a radio stream and I sent it to the stereo and I'm listening to music. It sounds great. It's 1080p on Netflix. Just for those two things alone, I'm happy.  For 35 bucks, I'm happy. And I did get three months on Netflix.  By the way, there's been some question about if you bought more than one. And many people did, apparently. I bought five. Sorry. I bought yours.  I didn't know it would run out so fast. But I gathered when I applied the first code and I tried to apply the second and said, you can't have consecutive codes running.  But I gathered that I could probably wait three months and apply the second one. So I think I'm going to have 15 months free on Netflix.

Start time: 1046.35
End time: 1074.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see that? There's already been an exploit on this thing. No, they hacked it. Yeah, there's a link that I found on Engadget.  This is only took a couple days. And that's surprising. It's open, right? Yes.  But if you want, there's a site called GTV Hacker that explains how to do it. And it confirms the software within is not Chrome OS.  It's described as a modified Google TV release, but with all of the Bionic Dalvik stripped out and replaced with a single binary for Chromecast.

Start time: 1074.16
End time: 1090.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. They kind of implied it was Chrome OS. Yeah, I thought that's what it was.  So very interesting. When you say hacked, do they mean maliciously or just set other streams to it?

Transcript:  I think you can get a root shell on port 23 and now you can investigate what it's actually doing.

Start time: 1098.04
End time: 1130.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right, I'm doing it. I've got a shell open on my TV. GTV Hacker.com.  Yeah, yeah. I think this is a big product from Google. I mean, somebody pointed out that, of course, this means Google can watch everything you watch.  But what I don't really care. And I guess if you don't, you shouldn't use it. If you do, you shouldn't use it.  But presumably can see most of the stuff we watch and Amazon can see most of the stuff. I mean, everybody can. So cares, right?

Start time: 1132.28
End time: 1152.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People really care about that. They do. They really don't want anyone knowing what movie they watched on Friday night.  Like it really bothers people for some reason. I don't know why. Is that because they're learning our habits?  Well, so they're watching everything we search for. You're using the Internet. So everyone knows everything. Yeah. No secrets anymore.

Start time: 1153.90
End time: 1172.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google says they're going to continue to do a Google TV. They say this is not Google TV and they're going to continue to do Google TV, which nobody buys anyway.  So who cares? I don't know what this replaces. I don't know if it replaces Roku. Eventually it could.  I doubt it replaces Apple TV because that's going to be the only way you can watch iTunes forever. Yeah. Forever.

End time: 1207.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There were quite a few of these HDMI stick devices coming out running Android or running some simple OS just to provide the same kind of functionality.  So if anything, this is pretty much Google kind of wiping out that entire market and taking it over themselves.  The low cost HDMI stick. It is a bit of a bummer that it isn't self powered. That's the only drawback I've seen compared to some of the other ones.  But I don't think there was a lot of money getting made in that market yet. But ultimately none of them had the exposure that this one certainly will.  So it's an interesting play. I don't think Google is going to make a lot of money on this. But again, if Google is looking to sell more content, this is a really great way to do it.

Start time: 1207.00
End time: 1240.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and isn't that, and this is where I find most interesting in the long run in terms of the markets.  That's one of the advantages both Google and Amazon have. They don't need to make money on their hardware.  Apple, Asus, other companies need to, they're hardware companies. Microsoft, they've got to make money on their products.  But Google and Amazon can sell for cost because they make all their money downstream later.  And if Google could sell you a device at cost that gives them lots of information about what you watch on TV so they can then put ads in your email or whatever, it's worth it for them.

Start time: 1241.16

Transcript:  Do you think they're taking a loss on this or is it break even? Or do you think they're making a...

Transcript:  Well, you know what immediately I leapt to is what is a Raspberry Pi cost? Just about the same.  Yeah.  Like a fully configured Raspberry Pi, I would, you know, we'll have to see the teardowns.  It's a Marvell chip inside. It's an ARM 7 Marvell. Micron flash NAND. There's two gigs of flash NAND. 512 megs of Micron RAM.  Probably the most expensive part would be the radio, 802.11BGN Bluetooth Azure Wave radio.

Start time: 1276.73
End time: 1280.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it makes its own little Wi-Fi hotspot.  Yeah.  I can connect to you.  Isn't that cool?

Start time: 1281.00
End time: 1338.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very cool.  But that's somewhat like a Raspberry Pi. So I'm guessing it's somewhere in that, you know, they might make a few bucks on it.  So I doubt that they're making any money on it, but I don't think they need to. Similarly, I don't think Amazon makes money particularly on the Kindle, but they don't need to.  They even said that. They said that the business is not making money on the Kindle. The business is making money every time you use the Kindle.  All right. So that's part one of the Google announcement. They also announced Android 4.3 and a new tablet.  And we're going to talk about that in just a little bit. Dan Benjamin's here. 5x5.tv, the great network. Tim Stevens, former editor-in-chief at Engadget.  He's now blogging at Digital. I'm sorry. I shouldn't have said that. The haha wasn't good.  You can just say I'm a creation.  Oh, he's a blogger.

Transcript:  That's good. Pinstripe jammies. DigitalDisplacement.com. More to come in just a bit, but first a word from our friends at Citrix.  GoToMeeting.com. Summer is here. This is the time when it's so hard to get together, people you work with or potential clients.  And yet, you know, business does not stop just because we're in the middle of the dog days of summer.  GoToMeeting lets you meet with those people, get the job done, break through the log jams, pitch.  And it's great because even though you may be on vacation or you're out by the pool or you're at the ballgame, you can use your iPad to present.  You can listen to the headphones, use the microphone.  You can see people face to face because they've got now built in HD video conferencing. You're sharing screens.  It really is great. Meetings are shorter, but more productive, more efficient.  You can get back to the fun.  And the best part about GoToMeeting is one flat rate for as many meetings as you want, as often as you want, as long as you want.  I know teams that actually keep GoToMeeting running because they're in different locations.  It's kind of their back channel to one another.  We're working on using it. We're going to do a programming show.  I think it's a perfect way to do a programming show where you can see the screen, you can see the hosts, but you can see what they're typing directly.  It's fabulous. I want you to try it free.  Visit GoToMeeting.com. Click the orange Try It Free button. Use our promo code TWIT. You get 30 days free.  GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting.com.  Promo code is TWIT. We don't do conference calls anymore.  We do GoToMeeting. Even if we're not going to be sharing screen, we're going to be on the phone.  It's just the easiest way to do it. Set it up.  So anything to say about Android 4.3?  I think aiming at an education market, they've added multi-users, which is great. Something iPad does not have.

Transcript:  That right there, for people like me, if you have kids, you have to dedicate an entire device to the child.  Each child has to have their own device. Otherwise, you completely lose control of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's kids' safety locks. So they showed in the presentation some game where you could buy more fish.  And instead of just... And I guess if the game is aware of the safety lock, it would have to be.  Instead of showing the fish that you could buy and saying, but you can't buy it, kid, they don't even show it.  Which is great. So it's kid-friendly, school-friendly. You can have one tablet or two tablets in a class and individual logins.  They've also apparently added Trim to the OS, which is big because the last Nexus 7, I noticed this.  A lot of people reported it. It got slower and slower.  Turns out it was because the NAND memory starts to, as you use it, become less than optimal.  It slows down quite a bit. Putting Trim in cleans it up.  And apparently when it's asleep and on the charger, it secretly goes in and trims it.  And I noticed almost immediately the old Nexus 7 was back to full speed.  There are some other features in 4.3. It's not a huge...  It's still a Jelly Bean. It's not a huge upgrade.  But it does seem faster in some ways.  To me, though, to me, at first I ignored it because we'd heard it all.  But when I actually got a Nexus 7, I'm excited about this.  This is... Okay, here's the deal.  Apple said, and when Apple released the iPad mini, they didn't say anything, but everybody...  I said, well, I'm disappointed. It's 1024 by 768. I don't want it.  I ended up buying it and using it all the time. But I was mad.  I said, why can't you do a retina?  And everybody told me, oh, Leo, don't be stupid.  You can't have a retina on a device like this and make it $339 and the battery life would be terrible.  Don't be dumb.  It's always a battery life.  Yeah, battery life, which suffer... Don't be dumb.  Apple couldn't do it.  And then we're hearing rumors that Apple's not even going to update the iPad mini till next year.  Right, next year.  Because you can't do it.  So along comes Google with the highest resolution 7-inch display ever, 323 dots per inch.  That's retina, baby.  It's beautiful. Battery life has not taken a hit.  In fact, it might even be arguably a little bit longer.  It's 9 or 10 hours than it used to be.  This is not slow.  They're using, I think, a S4 Pro chip in here.  It's great. It's beautiful.  It's got a 5 megapixel camera just like the iPad mini?  The only reason at this point I could even tell people to buy a $110 more expensive mini is if you're already, I guess, in the Apple ecosystem or there's apps you have to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For people who are in that, they just have to wait for Apple.  And I know so many people who, they really are invested in a really, really big way in the Apple ecosystem.  All of their movies are there. All of their music is in the cloud.  They've already got an investment in apps and this is the space that they live in.  So it's almost, it's not yet to the point where you could show them an Android device no matter how fast it is, no matter how great, and the screen does look great on this.  It's gorgeous.  No matter how great the screen looks and show it to them and say, oh, this is a selling point for you because look at the screen, battery life, it's still a none.  They're still not going to talk to you about it because they've got that investment.  I know lots of people like that. I know lots of people who are invested in the Android ecosystem as well.

I actually just got my mother her first tablet and I got her the old Nexus 7, unfortunately, just a couple of months ago, but that's the way things go.  But, you know, it's a great tablet.  The right size for a casual tablet user.  It's really easy to carry around.  It's easy to read on.  You know, it's comfortable and light and the battery life is great for sure.  The only slight reservation I have with this is that they did raise the price a bit up to $229.  But $229 for this.  I know it's still cheap, but crossing over that $200 barrier, I think does take it out of the kind of impulse, obvious buy territory just a little bit.  I wish that they hadn't bothered with the camera on the back and drop the price a bit because of that, because I think it's a great tablet.  I don't think that I'm going to be using it that much.  I don't know about you guys.

Transcript:  Make it cheap.  I actually think that iOS 7 is as much as people in the Apple community are talking about it being a really great opportunity for iOS developers to kind of come out with a new app and maybe knock out some of the deeply entrenched apps that are there.  And by saying, well, I have a brand new iOS 7 app that's really amazing, that's better than this other one that hasn't been updated for iOS 7 yet.  In the same way that that's an opportunity, I think this is also an opportunity for people to maybe consider Android people who are saying, I don't know if I really like iOS 7 or if I'm going to switch to something different, maybe I should look at an Android device.  I don't know.  I think a lot of people.  This is going to be huge for them.  And I always go back to my mom, who's number one thing she's like, she doesn't spend too much money.  Right.  She does.  You know, she what what tablet should I get?  And I'll say, well, you know, it's too expensive.  You know what?  Yeah, it's too expensive.  It's a Macintosh.

And, you know, but that's the thing.  Like for her, she'll go to like she'll go to like an office depot and she'll look at what they have.  And like that's where she would consider that.  And I'd say, well, you know, have you looked at the Apple Store, too?  And she's yeah, but it's it's fifty dollars more.  It's one hundred dollars more.  And that for many, many people is they're comparing two devices that seem very similar.  Right.  Why would they do that if they're not already invested?

Start time: 1854.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would argue at this point I'm against.  By the way, I'm very sympathetic because I get that call a lot on the radio show.  I want a computer and I don't want to spend more than three hundred dollars.  It's like, don't stop.  Just don't throw your throwing your money away.  Don't.  And people just don't understand that.  Well, it's a computer.  I see it. It's on the screen.  It's on the store.  It's the same as what is the difference to that an eight hundred dollar computer?  I don't understand.  It's going to break.  It's a piece of crap.  But you can't explain that to them.  It's five hundred bucks.  Makes a big difference.  This is I would argue a little bit different situation.  This is actually better than an iPad Mini in every respect.  And I think, frankly, Apple's going to have a very hard time if they don't update the Mini this year.

Start time: 1928.80
End time: 1942.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, we buy all of it, like, especially with my kids, we buy everything through iTunes.  Every movie, like every.  You own them. You don't rent them.  Right. I mean, we'll use Netflix for like the crap, you know, kid movies.  And then like when a newer one comes out that they want, we get it in iTunes.

I have plenty of iPads, but I just don't want to be tied into that.  What do you think, Tim?  For a on the conversation about people don't spend enough, they think they really see these low priced products and they say, well, that's good enough.

Start time: 1964.69
End time: 2029.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's definitely a concern.  But you're absolutely right. In this case, this I mean, this is a fantastic device for a fantastic value.  The Nexus 7 last year was a great device for $200.  And in a lot of ways back then was was better than the iPad Mini or certain certainly comparable.  You can make the case that it was a better choice for a lot of people.  But now with the high resolution screen and better performance and the other features that are coming in Android 4.3, especially if you've got kids at home, like you mentioned before, it's definitely a great buy.  And I don't see why anybody would really if you're a casual user again and you don't really need a 10 inch tablet, I don't see why anybody would really think about going with much of anything else at this point.  Except again, if you've got the content tie in and I'm kind of in the same boat, but I definitely have shifted more away from from purchasing content toward renting content just because I'm really afraid of anything that I buy at this point.  Is it going to be playable in even three or four years, regardless of which course I pick?  I think going with Amazon is probably the safer bet in the long run.  I agree with you there, Leo. But but iTunes and Google Play, I don't really know that, you know, I don't know where those guys are going to be in three years.  I know where my Blu-ray collection is going to be in three years, but I don't know necessarily where my iTunes downloads will be.

Transcript:  That's a good question because I looked at I was going to buy the complete Sopranos.  And I thought, well, I looked at the Blu-ray, it's about 200 bucks for the complete DVD, not for Blu-ray, but complete DVD.  Maybe it's 200 bucks for the Blu-ray too. And I looked on Amazon streaming 200 bucks for all six seasons.  Now, on the one hand, the convenience of having this and not having a physical media is great.  I don't want to buy any more Blu-ray discs. But you're right.  I mean, what is that? What are the what are the rights that I have to this? They're going to go away at some point.  Yeah. If I die, I can't hand my Amazon account over to my heirs.

Transcript:  And there is, of course, Ultraviolet, which hopefully will make things a little bit easier in that regard.  But again, it's really tied to kind of traditional media and the traditional means of buying things.  I just got the Bond 50th anniversary collection out that line.  I got that on DVD. Yeah. Which is fantastic. Yeah.  But again, it's something that I can see myself wanting to watch in a couple of years.  And, you know, whether or not I'm going to want to have a Blu-ray player hooked up in a couple of years, who knows?  But certainly I do right now still feel a little bit safer in physical media, which is which is, you know, a little bit weird for me to say.  I even feel a bit uncomfortable saying that, to be honest.

And both of these guys, they're old school comic collectors like I used to be.  And they were telling me, oh, man, you know, we're both all digital.  Everything that we do within the comic space is all digital.  And I was like, you guys are crazy. Don't bag and board anymore.  And they're like, no, what are you doing? That's ancient history.

Transcript:  But you know what? Like I made that transition myself away from doing that.  So I but I love the fact that, you know, I can be in a hotel room and I can say, OK, what movie am I going to watch when I go back to, you know, on the flight back and I can just rent it or download it.  You can do that with any device. But the idea of like, oh, I have a physical DVD.  I need to handbrake it now and I need to get it over here and I need to remember to sync.  And now that's an hour of my time additional on the trip that I need to set aside just to be able to watch a movie or I can download it.  Like I'm going to download it. And that's where Netflix and Amazon instant are just out of the question is that I'm on a plane scenario.  So you've got to rent or buy in that. But you've got we've got options now.  I just still I mean, I really wish and everybody wishes this that that there is there wasn't this marriage between the device and the content.  And that's the scary part, regardless of, you know, which device you're using, especially in the case of maybe we have to rethink our relationship to content.

Start time: 2192.34
End time: 2209.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, we certainly are tied in from years of experience to the notion that if you buy a book, you've got it.  It's on your bookshelf. You're going to hand it down.  But maybe that isn't really the way content needs to live in the future.  Maybe it's more ephemeral than that. Maybe that's an old fashioned way of thinking of content.

Start time: 2210.28
End time: 2224.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like if the content somehow becomes cheap enough that instead of paying 10 or 20 or 30 bucks for a book or DVD, if it's a buck, rent it when you need it.  Rent it when you need it. And then it goes away.  And if you don't have to hand it down to your kid, your kid spends a buck when they want to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wish we could buy content directly from publishers and then it would basically be up to them to find ways for us to get that content on our new devices down the road.  But we always had to buy it from publishers through some other means, whether it be iTunes or watch it through Netflix or something like that.  If I could just go directly to the music label or directly to the movie house or directly to whoever actually owns the content itself and buy a license directly from them  and then, you know, effectively trust that they would then manage that license and allow me to get that content down the road.  That to me would be a much better solution. Or, you know, ideally I would just go and pay, you know, pay so many twenty dollars a month to have unlimited access to every movie and every everything that they've ever made.  And then just keep paying them 20 bucks a month until the, you know, until the end of time. That would be pretty nice to me.  I'm honestly ready to move away from ownership altogether because ultimately, you know, the concept that you own something on a CD is obviously wrong.  You didn't actually own anything except for the plastic disc. Now we've gotten rid of the plastic disc and it's getting harder to get that content as you go from device to device.  If we could just get away from ownership altogether and have much better plans for leasing or renting this stuff, that for me would be a bunch better solution.

I edited out the scene where, there's no spoilers here, but there's some bad stuff happens to Bambi's mother.  You edited that out.  I literally edited that out and then put it back on a VHS cassette because I didn't want my kids to be traumatized.  It made the movie a little strange. Like, where'd Bambi's mother go? She's like, what happened?  But they were young. They didn't know any better. I never understood why Walt put that in that movie.  That was a horrible moment.

Transcript:  Responsive.  We have never been able to bring a Squarespace site down.  And we've done it. We've sent the twit army off.  Oh, you bring... Yeah.  We bring sites down routinely.  Squarespace, I think it's because the CMS, the software,  is very tightly integrated to the server software.  It's all running on a Java platform, I believe.  And they can turn on more bandwidth faster than you can blink at them.  Yeah. You never bring down a site.  There's no way you're going to bring down a site.  Try. Go to... You know what?  Inside.twit.tv, our blog.  Try to... Go ahead. Just everybody...  If everybody goes there right now, and let's see if we can just bring it down.  Inside... I'm going to go there. You go there.  Everybody watching at home, go there.  It's still up.  Inside.twit.tv. Let's see if we can bring it down.  We can. I know we can. We've done this before.  So here's the deal. If you want to try it, you can.  The other thing I really like about Squarespace...  I love it when our sponsors say, just try it.  No credit card needed.  That shows confidence, right?  Yes.  All you've got to do is name your site, give us an email in case you forget your password,  make up a password, you've got two weeks, run of the place.  You can do anything you want. Even import your existing content.  They have blog importers from all the major APIs.  Oh, yeah. That's very cool.  Even comments and images, all the SEO and links are preserved, the whole thing.  Play with it for two weeks.  In fact, they even told me, they said, you know what?  If you've got like a wedding coming up in two weeks,  and you wanted a blog just for people going to the wedding,  but you don't want to pay for it, just do it for two weeks, and then that's it.  And you don't have to ever pay us.  But if you decide you want to keep it around longer than two weeks,  we've got some very good deals for you.  Visit squarespace.com and take a look at the different plans  so you know what you're going for.  If you want to do e-commerce, it's $24 a month.  They don't take a cut, by the way.  It's not like, you know, you have unlimited digital or physical assets.  You can, yeah, sell a book and an e-book, a CD or an MP3.  They will do things like inventory tracking for you.  They calculate the tax, the shipping.  You can have arbitrary number of coupons.  You know, if you're on Twitter, you say, I want to give Twitter listeners a coupon.  Easy to do, just a couple of clicks.  $24 a month, and that includes unlimited bandwidth, storage, pages, galleries, and blogs.  $16 a month if you don't want the e-commerce, that's for the yearly plan.  By the way, when you get a yearly plan, they also hook up the custom domain name for free.  I'm just a big fan.  Give it a try. We will give you a little break.  You can use our offer code TWIT7.  We want to check out some of the sites you've built with Squarespace.  So send us a tweet with your Squarespace website, hashtag it,  TWITSQUARESPACE.  And a little later on the show, we'll just look at some of those.  That's a good idea.  So tweet, you don't have to tweet at Leo Laporte or anything like that.  Just use the hashtag TWITSQUARESPACE, and I'll do a search.

But they've got the big ones for all the social networks.  But if you're a developer and you have like, you have a GitHub account, you can integrate that.  If you're a Dropbox user...  Just a quick GitHub?  Yeah.  Wow.  And if you're a Dropbox user and you have like galleries set up when you upload an image to a Dropbox image gallery,  it can show up as an image gallery on Squarespace, all that stuff.

Transcript:  Excuse me, Mr. Prime Minister.  I would like to watch porn.  Could you just flip that switch for me?  Mr. Cameron, sir.  Do you have to go walk in the town square and say, I am a porn watcher to get the porn turned on?  Just unbelievable.  People just...  How do they block it for the whole country all at one time?  Well, they're going through the ISPs.  So the way it works...  By the way, one of the ISPs uses a filter system made by Huawei, which is owned by the Chinese military.  So I think that's a nice nexus.  They go together.  The Chinese military is determining what's porn in the UK.  By the way, the ISPs are not thrilled about this, of course, the British ISPs, but they've always had this.  Apparently, this has always been the case that there is a switch.  You could turn on that this is by law or at least by agreement with the ISPs.  There is a filter and people could turn it on.  What's changing is it's going to be on by default now.  So you have to explicitly say, no, no, no porn.  We're British or something like that.  And of course, it's going to block stuff that is not porn.  Furthermore, David Cameron, the prime minister himself said, oh, but that doesn't include page three, the topless girls.  The newspaper in the newspaper.  Oh, no, no, we're not going to block that.  So I don't know.  This is the problem is a slippery slope.  What is porn? I don't know.  Leo's porn.  OK, block him.  He's advocating porn, which I am because it's a fun thing to watch.  No, I'm not.  I don't care.  I'm going down the rabbit hole and I can't stop myself from falling.  We're number nine.  The US is now, ladies and gentlemen, something to be proud of.  Number nine in Internet connection rankings.  So maybe if you're curious, would you like to move to a country with a better ranking than the Internet?  As soon as this site comes up, I'll give you the list.  There it is.  Mine is just I apparently my Internet is down.  They blocked it.  Why yours came right up?

They had really fast HSP and really fast connectivity pretty much throughout the entire country, which is amazing.  Much faster than we have through much of our, you know, through much of the Middle States anyway.  So that was a little bit disappointing to see, honestly.  And I think that's exactly what's going on here, too.  Newer networks are faster than our aging ones.

Transcript:  I'm going to stop buying that damn Canadian stuff and start buying Vermont maple syrup.  I always did get Vermont maple syrup, actually, because we live in Rhode Island.  That's what you learned today.  Yeah.  We had a maple tree out front.  We tapped it once.  Didn't make good maple syrup, though.  I guess it's a sugar maple.  It's a particular kind of maple.  Do you know about this, Tim?  Or am I just looking at you for no reason?

Start time: 3265.18
End time: 3296.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know all about it.  You can get syrup from all sorts of maples.  You can make it from pine trees, too.  But maples have the highest sugar content within their sap.  So you need the least sap to actually do it.  I think it's 30 gallons from a sugar maple.  And from other maples, it's closer to 50 or 60 gallons per gallon of maple syrup.  It's like a 30 to 1 ratio.  You boil it down?  Is that what you do?  You boil it down?  Yeah, you boil it for days and days and days and days and days.  Have you done this?  And it's been rising.  I have done this, yes.  I'm a Vermonter.  Everyone's done this.  It's pretty much part of your education.

Transcript:  How many gallons do you get out of a tree?

Start time: 3315.85
End time: 3334.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Obviously, it depends on the size of the tree.  Not a whole lot, honestly.  These big, big farms that make a lot of syrup have hundreds and hundreds of acres of trees.  So one tree you can maybe get a couple of gallons of maple syrup out of at the end of the season  if you're constantly tapping it and clearing those buckets.  It's a lot of work.  I haven't done it since I was a kid just because it takes a lot of work.

Start time: 3336.18
End time: 3359.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It takes a mighty big tree to make gallons of maple syrup.  That it does.  Yeah.  Google serves 25, as long as we're talking numbers, Google serves 25% of North American internet traffic.  When you combine that to what, the 30% of Netflix, between Google and Netflix,  it's like half of the internet in the US is Google or Netflix.  Yeah, that's crazy numbers.

Start time: 3362.23
End time: 3385.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That must be YouTube when they say Google, right?  I think that includes YouTube and all of their properties,  but what they're saying here in this great article is that it explains why Google is building so many data centers  and why you keep seeing these things going up.  Three years ago, it says they were 6% of the internet traffic, and that's insane.  What?  In three years.

Start time: 3386.02
End time: 3413.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They've quadrupled in three years?  Isn't that crazy?  I'm saying it must be YouTube, because YouTube has seen that kind of growth, right?  I mean, I don't think search engine traffic is a huge, maybe it is, I don't know.  Google's been building data centers on four continents,  and pretty soon every town will have a Google data center.  Yeah, that's exactly what they want.  Actually, Google has more data centers than the NSA, really, if you think about it.

Start time: 3413.60
End time: 3418.41

Start time: 3419.18
End time: 3440.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're right about the YouTube, but I think they also do,  when you think about their web apps, when you think about Gmail and things like that,  and people who are, I wonder if they count that, like if you're a Gmail user, if they're including that.  Right.  Because if they are, you think about that, you think about all the email, all the attachments,  those are big numbers too.  And there's Google Drive too.  That's a good point, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't, Google doesn't, for some reason, it doesn't scare me, but maybe you guys are smarter.  Does Google, does that worry you, the size that Google is becoming?  People often used to say, oh, it's Skynet.  Right.

Start time: 3458.33
End time: 3498.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's getting close.  When they start building robots and...  They are.  Especially those with laser eyes and gums that can fly and step on skulls and things,  then I'll get a little bit worried.  But no, I mean, ultimately, you know, someone's going to have all your information,  whether it's, I'm almost happier that it's with one person rather than a scattershot across  a million different startups with varying levels of security.  I tend to trust Google more than, you know, startup X.  And so if Google continues to innovate and do interesting things,  I'm reasonably comfortable having them have my data.  It is a little bit worrying that they can connect a lot more dots than anybody else on the internet at this point.  But as long as they stay secure, and so far, you know, knock on wood here, so far, so far so good on that point.

Start time: 3499.94
End time: 3537.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still think that Google's goal is just to get as much information about us as possible.  And that...  Then what?  That's, I don't know.  That's the big question is then what.  But I feel like all of the things that Google is doing right now is to get information.  And I'm not in the conspiracy theory group saying Google's trying to build, you know,  like a personality record on every single person as much as they're trying to understand what people do in general.  Not so much what did Leo look at today, but what do people like Leo or what do people in general want to do?  What are they all trying to do?  But that wouldn't scare you, would it?  It doesn't scare me.

Start time: 3538.00

Start time: 3541.48
End time: 3589.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's if we go the route of saying Google is not necessarily evil and that they're just one of...  Because if they understand these kinds of trends, it's like the Twitter thing where they can show you Twitter advertisements now  or will be showing you Twitter advertisements based on the ad that you just saw on TV where it's that kind of connected thing.  Google wants to see these trends.  They want to see what people are doing and what consumers are buying.  And I think there's individual targeting for sure in there.  But I think the real value for Google is to just understand us as a people and what we're doing and where we're going and what we want to focus on.  And if they can understand that, then they can get ahead of it.  And then what are they going to do?  I don't know.  Everything that they do is to learn our habits and to mine that data.  That's what I think.  So why don't necessarily think they're doing it for evil?

Start time: 3591.24
End time: 3611.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it doesn't bother me.  I don't know why, but it doesn't bother me.  It's...  But then I start saying, oh, but look, now I have the Google phone and I have the Google tablet and I have the Google on my TV.  And I like it.  Now I'm wondering if I've been co-opted, you know?  Well, I love Google now.  It doesn't scare me.  It's great.  I get to the airport.  It shows me my ticket.

Start time: 3613.92
End time: 3622.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think I think there's a whole group of people.  I understand.  And maybe this group is kind of large who are they're very worried about people knowing...  So they shouldn't use Google.

Start time: 3622.38

Now they've got everything.  That's why they're doing it.  This is what the people say.  I'm not the people.  This is not...  I'm not saying this.  No, no.  I understand that.  Thank you for channeling the people.  I do that.  You're a man of the people.  A man of the people.  The upstream and downstream now, everything that I do is going through Google.  Right?  And I'm using Gmail and I'm using Google Apps for work.  Right?  And I have the Google Play on the Android and I'm renting movies from...

I think there's one guy who has like the big base.  Oh yeah, you don't want to...  It goes to him.  It goes to the worst.  But no doorman.  And of course, the gawker part of this is so he can sneak girlfriends in or whatever.  But I don't...  Regardless of that, he wants privacy and he can afford privacy.  He doesn't fly commercial.

You know, you have to think also about what it takes to be able to go online right now, like you did with your Chromecast thing.  Order that and have it to your house the next day.  Forget what has to happen after it leaves Amazon's facility.  But all of the...  You probably remember those videos.  It's kind of amazing, really.  How it's all organized.  Staffing those and having...  Those are 24-hour a day, seven-day a week operations that are just...  It's just crazy how they do that.  And so I think a lot of it is the physical people in the warehouses, because they're not building that much new stuff.  They don't have that much new software.  They have their divisions through the Kindle, and they have the software there, and streaming and things.  I'm sure that's quite a few people.  But I don't think this kind of growth is...  But they are poised to surpass Microsoft now in direct employment.  They will be bigger than Microsoft within another quarter.  It's kind of amazing.

But ultimately, you know, factory workers and that kind of thing.  Look at the balance sheet.  That would be a better way to compare.  But that number may be a little bit harder to get.

I can't talk about it because I've seen it played with it and was ND8.  I hate it, but I will be able to talk August 1st.  So you guys just have a conversation amongst yourselves.  I'm very excited.  I think it's going to be grand.  It looks good in Eric Schmidt's hand.  This is the first phone from Motorola that Google did not, since Google bought them.

Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix.  I mentioned earlier their fabulous GoToMeeting program.  Here's another one that really does change the way you do business.  I use this every week to send audio to the radio stations.  I used to use one of those commercial consumer-grade file sharing things.  I used to send email attachments.  Neither were good solutions.  They broke all the time.  There were all sorts of issues.  I can get files now out to people in my business that I know they got it.  I have absolute control.  I can password protect it.  I can say how long they can download it for, a day, a week, a month, a year, forever.  I can say how many copies they can download.  It couldn't be easier with ShareFile.com.  It is built for business.  Do not send patient records through email.  That's illegal.  If you're a medical professional, this is HIPAA compliant.  It's compliant with regulations in a great number of industries.  That's one of the reasons that when you sign up, we ask you...  And by the way, to do that, click that link at the top that says radio listeners.  Click here.  Use our offer code TWIT.  When you sign up, they're going to ask you what industry you're in.  And that's because it could be customized for a variety of industries from accountants  to legal.  That always cracks me up when you see an attorney, you get an email from an attorney and it says,  if you're not the intended recipient, destroy this email immediately.  That doesn't work.  That makes me want to read it.  That makes you want to read it and print it.

Transcript:  In fact, the lawsuit that you and I, we don't want to go into detail because our lawyers  have told us not to talk about anything.  But it would be in Marshall, Texas.  Oh, right.  That's the one.  And the judge in Marshall thinks he's doing God's work.  And this is why it's hard.  Because, well, in this case, this patent was created by a guy named Michael Doyle, the  EOLAS patent.  He was working at the University of California.  So, they have part of this patent.  And he says that he was the first pre-Tim Berners-Lee or the World Wide Web to include  music clips, search features, maps, and embedded applications on a web page.  He took the web, he says, from a primitive and static world to today's seamlessly interactive  environment.  He did it.  He did that.  And he sued everybody.  Adobe, Apple, Amazon, Frito, Lay, GoDaddy, Google, JCPenney, JP Morgan, Play, and many  others.  JP Morgan, Playboy, Office Depot, everybody.  Oracle, Texas Instruments, everybody.  Almost everybody caved and paid him.  The patent he gris-granted was in 1994.  You know, Tim Berners-Lee invented the web in 1989.  So, it was five years later.  What happens is these patents are written very broadly.  And so, he sued Microsoft.  They gave him $100 million.  Go away.  He sued JCPenney, Amazon, and Google.  And that was his mistake because they didn't give in.  They went to court.  The judge in Tyler, Texas, I think the judge threw it out.  Eolis appealed.  They were ordered to pay their costs.  They appealed.  The appeal court has now thrown this out.  But the reason it's tough is because, you know, this guy can  make the claim that, well, I did invent this, and I deserve  to be compensated for this.  And so, it's very difficult.

Start time: 4789.85
End time: 4803.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's tough to prove it, I guess.  It's tough to prove that he did or that he didn't.  And so many of the things that he's claiming that he created  or that he invented are things that we just take for granted.  It's the web.  The way the web works, yeah.

Start time: 4804.89
End time: 4868.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The jury, by the way, is a jury trial, as it often is.  The jury was apparently swayed by the fact that Tim Berners-Lee,  the guy who invented the web, testified.  He went to Tyler, Texas, and testified.  And even I haven't been to Tyler, Texas.  Yeah.  Tyler's, I think I've been there.  I hope I don't ever have to go to Marshall, Texas.  Yeah.  But apparently the judge there, and there's one judge, and this is  what happens, is very pro-plaintiff.  He really believes that these guys are the little guy trying to  protect their rights against big corporations like Oracle  and Google who are just robbing them.  And of course, he probably saw the movie about the windshield  wiper guy, right?  Right.  And that's a true story.  The guy invented intermittent windshield wipers.  Ford or whatever used them, GM, I can't remember who,  without licensing them.  He practically killed the guy.  I mean, he was getting his money out of them.  Was it Jeff Bridges?  He invented them?

And that's how these guys work, because what they try to do is  make the amount of money they're asking low enough that it's  cheaper to just give them the money than it is to fight it,  even though you know they're in the wrong.  And so for Microsoft, what's 100 million to Microsoft, right?  Lunch money.  Lunch money.  And Microsoft did fight him for a while.  Jeff Bridges did not patent BridgeMix.  That was his mistake.  That was not his thing.  Not his thing.  OK.  We actually have, we've run out of stories.  I have fewer stories than I have commercials.  This has never happened before on Twitter.  It's got the Apple stuff.  Oh, what's the Apple stuff?  Thank you.  Dan Benjamin, God bless you.  One billion podcasts.  Are you happy?  Yes, I think this is excellent.

They said a billion subscriptions and they listed some of the...  We were...  Twitter was one of the classic podcasts.  This means I'm old.  The originals.  Yeah.  Original podcast.  Again, my internet is not...  If you look at when podcasting first started out in iTunes,

Start time: 5028.00

Transcript:  Yeah, not a bad day actually in retrospect.  But I remember that and that opened everything up for people who  wanted to say, how do I get the show that I'm recording,  which used to be just linked to on my website,  which if it wasn't that popular, how would anyone ever find it,  which is my problem, getting it out there and making it something  that was more accessible to people and that they could download.  And now, I don't think there's a bigger marketplace,  if I can use that word, for podcasts than iTunes right now.

End time: 5169.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, if you tune in at midnight, there'll be reruns.  But it's all video all the time.  And the reason is my thinking of late is that it's kind of like physical media.  The downloading and storing a bunch of shows is OK for certain,  you know, like you're going to get on a plane, OK.  But most of the time, that's too much trouble.  And if you could just go to a place, go to twit.tv on the web  and there's like people sitting around talking about stuff you're interested in,  that's probably better.  Yeah.  It's like the Today Show is always on.

Start time: 5196.06
End time: 5238.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the thing about that is...  and what we find whenever we interview the audience by doing listeners,  you know, listener polls and things, is that they're not...  I wish we had more live listeners.  I really wish we do.  Me too. I think that's the future.  But so many of them are listening, you know, as a podcast  when they are at the gym or when they're driving on their commute  or, you know... and the show that they want to hear  is recorded at a time that they can't listen,  but they don't want to miss it, so they come back to it.  So that's the... I think really the largest aspect of our audience.  I've started trying to...  You have so many live listeners.  It's thousands tune into every show, which is crazy.

Start time: 5238.00
End time: 5264.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's probably... how many... Bear, how many people are listening right now?  Bear.  Anyway, he's not... I think he's asleep.  But...  I don't know.  But, yeah, it's, you know, five to ten thousand.  And then when there's a live event, like last week's Google event,  it's in the hundreds of thousands.  That's crazy.  But we can't monetize it because it's hard to demonstrate that number.  A download, you can say, hey, this is how many we downloaded.  You can show the server log.  But...

Start time: 5266.22
End time: 5278.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the goal is to make live.  But I feel like live is what you want.  Yeah, yeah.  It is for you too.  Yeah, I mean, I would love nothing more than to know that we had shows going on,  even if it's eight hours a day, you know, that people could tune into and then listen.  No, that's about what we do, eight or nine hours a day.

Start time: 5279.00
End time: 5303.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that'd be great.  And what I say is the download is the on-demand.  If you missed it, it's on-demand.  Or it's more convenient for you to listen to it another time.  Because if we have global listeners, if it's the middle of the night somewhere,  then obviously, download would be better for you.  Eventually, I'd love to be 24-7, live 24-7.  You're getting close.  Tim, are you still doing any audio or video on the Internet?  You did stuff with Engadget, I know.

Start time: 5304.08
End time: 5325.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I was on the Engadget podcast and the Engadget show, of course, back then.  And certainly, our numbers kind of match yours in terms of percentages.  You know, a huge percentage came from iTunes or from other RSS subscriptions versus live.  You know, live podcasts would have maybe a couple hundred people,  but downloads would be tens of thousands.  So it was a huge difference.  But no, right now, this is it for the moment, actually.

We should have Tim on all the time now because he's got some free time when he's not racing.  I would love to.  Good.  Well, we love having you on.  So iTunes.  Now, this is interesting because Apple's always said iTunes is not a profit center,  or for a long time they said, we break even, we do it because it sells computers.  I don't think you can say that anymore.  iTunes brought in $3.9 billion in the quarter.  Am I crazy?  That's a lot of money.  Now, that's revenue.  Did they say what the profit is?  No, they'll never say that.  They don't break it down.

Start time: 5361.42
End time: 5391.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But that's certainly not a number that even Apple can ignore at this point.  And I've made that case before too, that ultimately, you know, Apple can get closer to the point  where they can start making less margins on their devices because they've got all this  profit coming in.  And it just keeps increasing.  This is a huge number, again, just for Apple.  And I wonder if they could, you know, start to think about maybe moving toward the Amazon  model.  I don't think they would.  I mean, strong margins on their devices is a big part of what's made Apple as successful  as they are.  But ultimately, you know, maybe this points to some future devices that maybe have slimmer  margins.

Start time: 5393.45
End time: 5398.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5401.42
End time: 5426.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or do what they're doing right now, which is make money the whole time.  Yeah.  Everything.  Make money on the front and on the back.  Yeah.  Front, back, up, down, left, right.  It's all profit.  Last quarter it was $4.1 billion.  This quarter $3.9 billion.  Total of $8 billion in six months.  That's revenue.  That's insane.  But they've got to be, even if it's 10% margin, they're making...

Transcript:  Wow.  Forget app sales and things like that.  And it's got to drive the record industry crazy because basically there's nothing they can  do about it.  They'd love to shut Apple down.  They sold 31.2 million iPhones, more than anybody expected last quarter.  14.6 million iPads.  So it's up 20% for iPhones, but down 14% for iPads.

Start time: 5452.83
End time: 5463.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's because they need a new one.  They need a new one.  And the other thing that's really interesting to point out that you're probably about to  point out is how many of the iPhones they're selling are the old iPhones.  Yeah.

Start time: 5464.08

Transcript:  Well...  Yeah, 18% in June 2013.  It's your mom's fault.  It is her fault.  But this shows that I think that people are ready for some kind of cheaper iPhone.  And this is why we keep...  Oh, it's going to have a plastic case.  So it's going to have other...  And this is because it seems weird because the perception is that the iPhone 4s or the  4 is the old phone.  That's the old phone.  And people don't want to buy something that's old.  They don't want an old...  But they are.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But if Apple were to give them something that could play a little bit better down market...  More modern, but free.  Yeah.  That was free or that was cheap...

Start time: 5528.22
End time: 5563.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe humble in fund sellers.  But it's your mom, again, because she thinks that a $50 iPhone is significantly cheaper  than a $200 iPhone.  It's not.  Because the cost of the iPhone either way is the monthly cost over two years, which  is thousands.  So she's saving a few percentage points over the total cost.  Right.  But to her...  And this is the problem.  It's not just her.  It's everybody.  The issue is what do I pay out the door is more important to them than the total cost  of the phone, which is thousands.  I don't know how you convince people of that.

Transcript:  And Ken from Chicago is saying, when has Apple gone for the low priced demographic?  They haven't.  When have they ever gone?  But I think in this space, this may be the time when they do it.  I'll give you the example.

Start time: 5576.46
End time: 5601.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's your main is what they did with the iPod.  They put out the iPod, one iPod, owned the space.  And as soon as they own this space, then they said, okay, let's fill in the nooks and crannies.  Let's do the shuffle.  Let's do the nano.  And they became very, very big sellers.  Let's do the iPod touch.  They completely sewed up every category of that market and basically owned all music  players.  And I think that that's potentially what they'd like to do.  I don't think it's possible at this point with...

Start time: 5601.36
End time: 5638.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other parallel there too is that those devices weren't really pitched as being made  to a cost.  And they certainly didn't look or feel like they were made to a cost either.  They just happened to be cheaper because they had simpler functionality.  And I think that's definitely what we'll see from, you know, if there is a new iPhone coming  this fall, this lower cost, I think it'll be played up as a kind of fun looking, maybe  smaller, cooler looking device for people who want something a little bit more exciting  looking maybe that also happens to be at a lower cost.  And I would bet that that cost message is actually going to kind of get lost in the  shuffle compared to everything else, at least from the Apple standpoint.  Everybody else though will pick up on the cost as the main selling point of whatever  this new device is.  Right.

Start time: 5639.02
End time: 5695.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tim makes a really good point I think.  And to extend that a little bit is that if we think of it as a cheap iPhone, that's kind  of like boring and that's Apple.  Yeah, I don't want a cheap iPhone.  If we think of it as the same way you pointed out, the nano, the shuffle, these are very  different devices.  If there's a way for Apple to come out with a device that is a phone that's very different  from the five that differentiates itself somehow in the same way that I think the iPad mini  differentiates itself from the full size iPad, it's a different device.  Yes, you can do many of the same things with it, but they're different.  If they were to come out with a phone that was lower cost point, but had other features  and maybe it's more fun, maybe it's colors.  I mean, little things like that, like people really care about.  iPhone shuffle.  Yeah.  Colors, like that's a big deal to people getting a phone that's a color.  That could be the thing that, oh, it's cheaper, but it's a color and it's whatever.  I'd get that one for my kids instead of the full price one.  It's plastic instead of them.  You use an iPhone?

Transcript:  Unfortunately, a lot of stuff didn't really work very well.  I think it was a lot of great concepts and a lot of interesting ideas of moving the way  that you interact with your phone forward in a very different sort of conceptual way.  But the problem is a lot of it doesn't really work very well.  The motion gestures are okay, but scrolling with your eyes is clunky.  And if you're on a train that's bumping around, it doesn't really work at all.  It's a great idea, I think, but it just doesn't work quite so well.

Transcript:  As I use this Nexus 7, you know, I don't have a Nexus 4.  A lot of phone people, Android people, love the Nexus 4, which is a pure Google phone.  I used the early pure Google phones and I came to love things like TouchWiz, Samsung's  edition, because it made it more usable.  But now as I use the Nexus 7, which is back to a pure Google experience, I think Android  is improved and mature to the degree now that you don't want that carrier stuff on top of it.  That a pure Google, that I think more and more people want the pure, uniform Google experience.  And I think somebody would be very smart to make a phone.  I think they could compete successfully against Samsung and even HTC.  I love the HTC One, but it's so weird and non-standard and the buttons are odd that  if somebody made a pure Google experience phone that was modern and had all the features,  I think they might do very well.

Start time: 5798.26
End time: 5814.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with you, but the carriers in them and specifically more the manufacturers,  that's how they want to do it.  They want to, oh, we have a different thing here that's better and the buttons over here.  And like that's appealing to some users, I guess, because it looks different.  But that's the only way because they're all having to use the same operating system.

Transcript:  I think Samsung went too far with it.  And they've gone down the road and now they've really junked up.  And I agree with you, Tim.  I loved the Note 2 and I'm very curious about the Note 3.  But if it's loaded up with all that Samsung stuff.

Start time: 5827.26
End time: 5852.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it will be. I think it's pretty inevitable.  And ultimately we could see even more stuff as they try to make the S Pen, the stylus, more of a useful feature.  I use the stylus quite a bit.  Do you?  I don't really need anything fancy or any more smarts added to it.  I really just need to sign stuff and maybe do the occasional doodle on there too, which doesn't hurt.  But yeah, I think we'll probably see some more smarts, some more gestures, some more eye recognition and things like that.  And hopefully it'll be a little bit better implemented than it was on the GS4.

Start time: 5855.81

Transcript:  In a way, I'm rooting against Samsung because they're so dominant.  They are now. It's really the market is split iPhone and Samsung with a lot of also rands.  And I don't want to see anyone become that dominant.  So I'm kind of hoping that somebody can compete against them strongly.  And I feel like that because they're so dominant, they're coasting.  And that's what worries me.  And you're right, though, the S Pen is a unique feature that both on the tablets and on the phones is a differentiator.  That's that's see, I never used it, but I'm not an artist.  So you really use it.

Start time: 5887.74

Transcript:  Yeah, I've actually started using it for if I'm doing an interview, taking notes, for example.  I used to carry a Moleskine around with me wherever I go and I used to carry a voice recorder around with me too.  But now I just use my note to record the voice on there and I take notes right on there too.  So that's two less things that I have to pack, which which if you travel as much as I do is a pretty valuable improvement.  So that right there was was a really strong buying point for the note to but our life on that is fantastic.  Right. That also was a huge huge one for me.

I think the first two really were somebody blew it and there was typing in what they  thought was one window or like some intern couldn't figure out how to exit the content  management system that posted to Twitter and typed Mittens13 password leave and then end  Twitter and then gasped and said, oh my God, these were tweeted.  And then somebody came over and said, no, no, I'll take care of it.  We'll just pretend that that was all intentional and we'll start typing.  Typing about avocados in Arvada.  So I think it's both.

And I went to the doctor and he said, oh, you should you should eat less red meat.  I said, I don't eat any red meat.  More red meat.  No, he said eat less.  Because he didn't know.  He didn't know.

Start time: 6872.00
End time: 6990.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a huge problem.  Friday it came back.  So developer.apple.com.  And then if you clicked on the iOS Dev Center.  Yeah, like Member Center.  Yeah, or any of those.  You'd get a thing that said, sorry, we're down because we were hacked.  Eight days, apparently they rewrote the software, rejiggered the database.  There was a massive flaw, apparently.  I have seen, and I don't know if it's true.  I remember the guy who first exposed this Turkish guy, Balakhan, to the internet.  I have seen logs that show that whoever hacked this got certificates.  Interesting.  That's the concern.  And I think Apple must have this concern because you are about to ship iOS 7, like in the next  few weeks.  The Dev Center is down for eight days.  You only do that if it's absolute crisis mode, right?  Oh, yeah.  Can only imagine what that data center and those things.  It has to be.  It has to be.  It has to be.  It has to be.  It has to be.  It has to be.  Oh, yeah.  Can only imagine what that data center and those things look like.  It has to have been really bad.  Bad.  So the greatest fear is, you know, Apple, the way Apple works, if you want to have an  app on the App Store on OS X or in the App Store on iPhone, you have to have a developer  certificate that certifies that you are the developer who wrote this.  Apple kind of, by doing that, Apple is protecting end users.  In fact, you can set your machine that it cannot open or install an app that isn't certified  by Apple.  Most people have the default setting, which is Apple will warn you and say, hey, you know,  this isn't certified.  You just downloaded this from the web.  We don't know who this is.  You can override that by right clicking.  But if these certificates leaked out, that means malware could then pose as a legitimate  program.  That would be very bad.  It would be extremely bad.  Apple's not talking.  They were a little bit forthright, at least saying, yeah, we got hacked.  I'm actually somewhat concerned that this is a larger issue, but we may never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We won't know.  That's for sure.  We won't know.  It's, you know, I know a lot of Apple developers, both iOS and Mac developers, and these people  have been in some cases just completely derailed.  They can't update their app if there's a problem.  They can't do anything.  They can't get into numbers.  That's a lot when you're literally just a few weeks away from release.  Yeah.  And then you also have certificates expiring and things like that, developer certificates  that could expire, as you explained, identifiers, profiles, all of this stuff.  And of course, even things like being able to submit bugs, that was all gone.  Being able to go in and download a beta that might have come out, you couldn't download  betas of Mavericks or of iOS 7.

Start time: 7045.59
End time: 7078.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't think it'll hold up the iPhone.  I think this was as much an issue on the desktop as it was on mobile.  And I don't think, you know, unless they had to rip a lot of developers away from other  projects, which I'm sure they did to some degree, I don't think it would have derailed  things so badly that they'd have to push things back.  And even if they did, it would only be by one week, which at this point I'm sure they  can float if they need to.  So, you know, maybe things will come in a week later than Apple had wanted them to be.  But no, I don't think they'll miss the fall shipping season by any means for either iOS  7 or for the new iPhone or iPhones.  I hope not.

Remember Robert De Niro gained weight for Raging Bull like 60 pounds.  Sylvester Stallone learned English for Rocky.  So it's really something that people really didn't not well, but he learned it.  It's something that people really take seriously.  Apparently Ashton Kutcher spent three months learning to walk like Steve Jobs.

Yeah, that's coming out August 16th.  But watch, I'm just saying when Ashton Kutcher walks, notice how he lifts his feet.  And apparently, no, this is, this is, Kutcher said this.  I see that.  He walked funny because he used to walk barefoot a lot and he didn't want to stub his toes.  So he got very good at lifting his feet off the ground.  And Ashton Kutcher really brings that to life.
