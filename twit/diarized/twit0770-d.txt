He's actually suing them  He has been very vocal about  Covid 19 being I don't know if he thinks it's a hoax doesn't quite go that far  But he really wants his factory  Tesla factory in Alameda in Fremont to be open  The county shut it down. He kept it open  After the shelter-in-place orders the county said no, you're not essential shut it down  He now seats seeks injunctive and declaratory relief against the county. He wants to  Bring back about 30% of the workers  To get them working on cars.

Start time: 742.74
End time: 794.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's funny you had that reaction because I expected more robots  The factory when I went down to pick up my model X I toured the factory  They have giant German robots that do very strange things for instance at one point two of them pick up the half assembled  Car and flip it over and raise it up to put it on a second raised  Assembly line so the workers can work on the  underneath the chassis but  Honestly, there's still people doing most assembly  It's not like the well for instance the Lexus plant which is almost entirely robotic a lot. There are cars that are made  Entirely robotically, but there are still a lot of assembly line workers and that's a dangerous job  Especially in the any time we he's also 10,000 people work in that factory and he also is threatening or he said he's gonna take

I think we've got I think we've got it all  Done the thing I do like about Elon is he doesn't make any bones about you know  Look, I want to get the factory started up. So screw covid but then there's people like Jeff Bezos  Running Amazon who seems to care about his workers  And yet, I don't know. Are you guys let me ask you all are you so let's ask rich  Are you shopping at Amazon these days?

Start time: 1204.85
End time: 1257.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am actually so I  It's funny because you know with Amazon it's like the complete failure of the system when this whole kovat thing first started  You couldn't get anything, you know, you look on the ordering and it'd be four weeks out  So everyone kind of started looking for other place. I did the whole Best Buy thing where I picked up something at the store  You know the drive-thru thing  But Amazon I mean, it's it does raise the question of you know, is Amazon an essential business which a lot of people order stuff there  But why are they any different than what Elon wants to do at his factory? I mean, it's not like he is  Going to run a factory and put people at risk  You know and and it's it's a tough thing  I'm not saying I have the answer to it, but I would think that if anyone Elon is a very smart guy  And so is Jeff Bezos Bezos. Yeah, and so is well, so is Bezos  I mean, I'm just saying it's like they're both they both have there also which is advanced capitalists

Start time: 1265.96
End time: 1288.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's even more dangerous for me as a regular person to go into any store that I can around a 20 block radius of my house  You know the Walmart's of the world the targets the best, you know, not Best Buy but you know, the Ralph's Costco  So yeah, I mean  There's no control there versus a factory where they're gonna take your temperature. They're gonna make sure that you're not sick  They're gonna have rapid testing. So

Start time: 1289.72
End time: 1294.80

Start time: 1295.46
End time: 1303.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Considering my risk. I'm just considering should we but you're right anything else  We choose to use instead of Amazon is gonna have exactly those same risks

Start time: 1303.86
End time: 1319.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm a little thoughtful as to what I order I try not to order things that I don't need  I mean which would make sense in in general anyway  But I'm a little less of a shopper than I normally am but I've bought many essentials on Amazon  Including some sweatpants, which is essentially all I wear these days

Start time: 1321.60

He says in his blog post by Amazon  I quit and dismay at Amazon firing whistleblowers who are making noise about warehouse employees frightened of co vid  What with big tech salaries and share vestings this will cost me over a million dollars pre-tax dollars  Not to mention the best job I've ever had working with awfully good people. So I'm pretty blue  He felt like he couldn't keep working at Amazon after Amazon fired people who tried to organize  smeared people who tried to organize  He said I just I I just don't think that's right and I don't want to be working in a company that does it

I don't to me. I don't see it as any different than you know  You're running these factories. You're running a warehouse. You're running a supermarket. There is no safe place  There's nothing that's any safer than anywhere else right now except in your home

Because if I order pizza then not only am I potentially risking myself  I feel like that's a relatively safe thing to do  But maybe I'm risking the people making the pizza the people delivering the pizza. We all have to make that decision. There is no  perfect decision though

Yeah, because we know those are safe  But the bottom line is that you've got to eat whether it's pizza or whatever you order from the supermarket and  People are making a living but I do agree that they should have the utmost  Support from their employers and I don't mind paying more money during this period  And in fact, we do typically if you get things delivered you're paying a premium  but I want them to have PPE and you know, and at least six to eight feet apart from fellow workers and  You know all the normal things  Are you gonna give up pork?

Transcript:  Aren't you glad you're young rich no old technology  This is something. This is you rich. You're seeing yourself in about 20 years  Just get ready. This is your life coming up coming strong  All right  Our show today brought to you by Express VPN one thing I know if you're working at home  You need to protect yourself protect your security protect your privacy and do it with the software  I use I looked into this is really there's a lot of VPNs out there  But one thing we know about inexpensive or free VPNs is  The only way they monetize is by using you as the product. That's not what you got a VPN for  You got a VPN so you wouldn't have to worry about snoops  And when you're home without your IT department over  Looking you and taking care of you. You've got to protect yourself against online threats. You got to protect your privacy. I  Think Express VPN is a great choice for a couple of reasons. First of all, I love Express VPN because they're fast  You know, you know, I think you all know VPN protects you by encrypting the content by by emerging into the public  Internet via a VPN server somewhere out there and I think a lot of us think and I did for a long time  I can't use a VPN because it's gonna slow me down too much. First of all, they're in almost 100 countries  There's a server near you and that server is fast enough to deliver your VPN  And that server is fast enough to deliver ht content without buffering  It's several times and I've accidentally left the VPN on and not even noticed. It's that fast  So you won't pay a penalty using Express VPN your data will be  encrypted  Uh, you won't have to worry about people seeing what you're doing  Whether it's you know a bad guy or your internet service provider snooping on your traffic because i'll tell you even in incognito mode  Your isp sees everywhere you go on the internet unless you're using express VPN  Now it's very important that you use a VPN provider that also respects your privacy. That's express VPN  And it's not just me who says that they have had been audited by third parties independent third parties  They have a server technology. They went the extra mile. They created something called trusted server  When you use express VPN you click that single button on your phone or your laptop that that connects you to the VPN  It spins up something called a trusted server that runs only in ram  You're going through that that trusted server is sandboxed. It can't write to the hard drive  It cannot write to the hard drive and the minute you log off that server disappears every bit every trace  Everything you did disappears as well. There is no record of your visit. That's pretty amazing  That's the trusted server technology. And as I said, it's been audited express VPN does no logging  They know nothing about you and that's what you want. You want your privacy you want your security  There's some nice features too. You can emerge in any one of 94 countries  That means you can watch netflix in those countries if you're in the mood for some doctor who you've watched all the netflix at home  Just fire up netflix press the button on express vpn to go to london  Now suddenly you can see all those doctor who episodes as part of your netflix subscription. That's pretty nice too and with hd speed  No buffering it comes in. It's just like you're there  So my only question is why aren't you using express vpn at home on the road at work?  It's the best way to secure your connection  Right now you get an extra three months free of express vpn in a one-year package when you go to expressvpn.com  Twit we thank expressvpn for their support  And we thank you for supporting us by using that address  expressvpn.com  slash twit  Rich demurrow doc serles the great larry maggots great to have as always great to have you all on  Uh the show, let's see  Here's an interesting surprising story. Remember there was a bit of a controversy. I don't know if you've been following this in toronto  There's a part a part of the toronto  Lakeside that is not developed. It's just basically a warehouse district and the city was partnering with  Sidewalk labs, which is an alphabet company one of the google  Properties to create a smart city  It was they were going to build a whole new development there  The data was going to be collected about traffic about people moving around. It was going to be a high tech city within a city  They got a lot of nimby  criticism  And now as of this week, they're walking away from it  Was it going to be a billion dollar project that had been underdeveloped for over two years?  Local residents didn't like the idea  Uh, and so they tweeted sidewalk toronto with great sadness and disappointment. This was uh yesterday  No two days ago. We announced sidewalk labs will no longer pursue pursue the keyside project  in toronto  This has always been my fear is that um  Uh people who are strong privacy advocates  might also  Impact the rest of us who say I don't care. I want a safe secure data-driven city  And yeah, but if nobody else, you know people don't like it. Well, we're not going to do it  Uh, is this a loss to toronto or is this a good thing larry without taking a side?  Okay, i'll get larry first then you doc. I know it just reminds me the whole amazon thing in new york, right?

Start time: 2033.82
End time: 2110.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a good thing for for a reason quite aside from  The privacy risk one which is the one that most people bring up or just becoming too dependent on a single company  It's that google's history here is not great what they did with google fiber  Um is is kind of I mean, it's still operating in kansas city and a couple other places but  Um, they came in with great promise. Um,  And it didn't work out the way they wanted to and and go look them up online google graveyard, you know  There's a zillion things that they have stopped at this one in the graveyard. They do not have a great record here  I think that they're I think when when stuff is close to home for them or if they're buying an already successful  Operation like they did famously with youtube or something like that. They're fine  But in in trying to get a new thing like that going I think it's  It's way too abstract in the way they approach it. Um  You know, I mean with the google  Google fiber, for example, I have a friend who's in the in the fiber business and he said, you know  What do you need if you're going to do fiber?  You know, he said you need two things you need customer support and you'd accrue  And and google like jobbed it out. I don't know to who to to to um, yes defense contractors and stuff. I mean  so and then it failed more or less and and you know, so  I just I feel better for toronto

Start time: 2110.96
End time: 2214.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's let's look at who google was up against with the fiber and you're talking  at&t  Comcast all these companies that owned the right of ways and what google did  And I agree with you doc. I totally agree that google their their track record of starting a project and just giving up on it is is  It's unsurpassed. Nobody else is like that except them  but with fiber, I think I I don't know if fiber is the best example because  You're up against the biggest telecoms in the world and google has always tried to  You know with unlocked phones remember when the pixel was unlocked they tried to do it or sorry before the pixel the nexus  They tried to do unlocked phones and nobody would sell them then they had to go to at&t to be the carrier  Uh, and it's little things like that now they have to do verizon with the pixel  so I don't know if fiber is the best example with this because I remember doing a story where he flew to austin texas  And at&t wanted to install fiber and it's a whole big thing these companies they fight tooth and nail  To basically make it impossible for you to lay any sort of new lines  And that's why you look at all these companies have given up you go to a house you have  Exactly one choice for your high-speed internet. That's wired and now all these new companies are looking towards wireless  But anyway as a as an observer, I totally want the smart city because you don't have to live there if you're worried about privacy  It's the same thing as going into a mall except it's more of a public area  I mean the mall you go in they're tracking you on bluetooth and all that kind of stuff  And this would have been really cool  It's like a disneyland but in real life and I think it would have attracted tourism  I think it would have been a fun place to check out to see how a city that's totally planned  Operates and yeah google could have given up on it, but uh, I don't know if that's the reason why it's a bad idea  the

Start time: 2216.50

Transcript:  Let me just describe this because you can see if this is something you'd like sidewalks labs  Plan was to spend 1.3 billion dollars on mass timber housing have been made of wood heated and illuminated sidewalks  Public wi-fi and of course a host of cameras and other sensors to monitor traffic and street life  In theory the monitoring would be to improve the quality of life  In sidewalk you make a great point though doc  It would be really sad if they built this and then after a couple of years ago. Yeah, and then who's going to run it

Start time: 2247.32

Do you guys remember that project?  In in florida it was like celebration or something. Yeah, disney disney city the planned disney, which they banned it by the way  So, I mean, I don't know. I just I feel like you know, it'd be kind of fun to see  Someone plan something that in america or you know in this case canada  um just to see I mean why not think outside the box you look at these big cities in america and  You know, they're not the best quality of life for people and it would be it would be interesting to see how technology could make life  Better maybe the roads adjust when you know traffic is high or low or whatever.

Why companies die and cities live and companies tend to be closed systems and cities tend to be open systems  And the bigger they get the more diverse they get  I mean look at los angeles. I mean, it's it's it's the most possibly the most diverse city in the world has the largest  Expatriate population for like 44 countries and that's part of the charm of it  But then again, it was stupid to kill off the trolleys which they did, you know a long time ago  And it made a movie about it

Transcript:  Just playing devil's advocate here on the flip side as we move more to voice  And if you look at what google has done, I mean I agree I think that  You know, it's like me posting a video from ces on instagram and all of a sudden it's regrammed by you know  A dozen of these random other random technology instagrams and of course i'm like, ah, it kind of sucks  What does that do for me? It does give you a little exposure. Does every one of those people end up following you probably not  So you see the good and the bad but you know as we move towards voice a lot of these results with google are sort of  Given in a verbal way. So it's like according to connect safely  Uh, here's what you do to be safe on the internet and it'll tell you  Right. I don't know. Did that do anything for you? I don't know

Transcript:  Probably did more good than harm is my sense  I mean, I suppose if if I was charging access to my site and people weren't paying because they could get it free  Sure, but I don't think there are that many look I I see I happen to have a subscription to the wall street journal  But i'm constantly seeing snippets of stuff from there  and often going ahead and reading the entire article and sometimes not  But would I cancel my subscription to the wall street journal because I don't need it  I mean for example, I don't have an la times subscription  I'm thinking about getting one because google has been showing me lately that they're doing a lot of great coverage and i'm  Probably going to go ahead and subscribe

Start time: 2960.30
End time: 3005.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And see that's interesting because on the flip side  Two things I see the la times articles as well  They're always coming through to my google news  And I click on them and now i've been trained to know that like oh i'm not going to be able to read that because  I don't have a subscription to that and so it's and in google news i'll be even more devil's advocate  You can actually block access to a provider so if the la times serves you up three articles that you can't read  Now you're finally like, all right  Let me just block la times and and here's the other side of things a blog in almost every circumstance  Re-blogs what someone has reported?  um, and so that's almost I think the bigger issue more so than google because I think google probably does a better idea with  Their algorithms of sending you to the original article right like the source. Yeah, that's the goal

Transcript:  But are you not though?  I think you are because um, I saw someone tweeted about that article earlier  And you know, they tweeted about it and they kind of summarized it a little bit and then I went and read it  And so I mean  I think it all comes back to that whole like, you know  It's there it's better to be there than to not be there and I think that that just makes more sense now  If someone's just stealing your stuff if it's a copy clone of the wall street journal and you're just going there every day  And reading the whole thing without a subscription. That's a little bit different  That's not in the same spirit of what google's trying to do right according to what I think right?

They started building it about a decade ago  And it has grown like crazy  It's a testing lab. It's a research lab. It's where  WWTs engineers  Create pilots proofs of concept they set up technologies before they show them to clients. They let clients come in and try  technologies more than half a billion dollars  Of equipment at the advanced technology center from hundreds of oems and key partners  I mean everybody's in their high tech heavyweights  like cisco  like vmware  ai disruptors like invidia  The point is that wwt is a trusted partner stays with you over the years  Many of their customers have been with them for decades.

We're protecting the network against the bandwidth hogs. Of course during the crisis  They've for good reason lifted the bandwidth caps as more and more as I was working from home.

I mean they have bent over backwards and done some results  In response to all the problems they had early on during the pandemic to the point now  Where they are annoying me by forcing me to use passwords when I don't want to use it. Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's easy, you know, yeah, you don't want that  So let's talk a little bit about zoom because this is of course a great success story  Of quarantine has been zoom. Well, first of all  Why zoom there are hundreds of ways to do this  Most people have a variety of things already on their system including for apple users facetime for facebook users facebook or whatsapp  There's google meeting  There's I mean it goes on and on and on what was it about zoom?  Which I don't think most home users had ever used or heard of or heard of  Why did zoom go from 10 million daily active users in december to 200 million in march?  There's a little question about the number. I think they gave out 700 million or something last month  And then they retracted it, but nevertheless we're talking significant growth. Why?

Start time: 3780.34
End time: 3787.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3810.20
End time: 3833.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably what happened is everybody at home had never done anything like this. I mean we'd all done  one or two face-to-face calls  But the idea of having 20 people in a meeting hadn't occurred to us so you have to say well  What did they use at work?  And that's that's the first thing that happened. Yeah, was zoom dominant in business before this?  It's an enterprise company and that was part of their problem is that they

Start time: 3834.68
End time: 3849.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They actually had pretty good enterprise security. The problem is that their documentation was written for it professionals  And most users had no idea how to turn on the security that was there  So now they had to make it a default defaults were wrong defaults were bad the defaults were wrong for consumers most of the time

Start time: 3849.52
End time: 3911.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean the way the company explained it  They said that the the the it professional, you know, because most of the time was enterprise  So you would be a big company you'd sign up and your it people would sort of delegate the security settings for your corporate  You know for your for your organization, right? And when people started using it at home  If you look at I mean zoom settings are insane  They're not for the mere mortal because there are so many of them  None of them make any sense and the the one feature that every average person found was the virtual background  Which was like the most fun feature and it's so stupid  But you know, but I think the the reason why zoom took off is because the companies latched on board immediately  All those employees came home  They started using it with their with their friends because it was unlimited and you can have all the fun people on the grid  It was easy to send a link to everyone  I don't know how people got their friends to install this because if I try to get any one of my friends to install some  Sort of new video chat app that i'm asking or because i'm testing it. They're like, no, no i'm good. I've got facetime  I've got this it's like the reason

Start time: 3912.04
End time: 3925.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In the world installed zoom overnight, but it's automatic when you go to the website and you join it when you join the chat  It just automatically installs so there it's kind of brainless. I don't like that  This impotently well, you might not be a fan of that it's easy. It's great. I I have to say that

Start time: 3926.82
End time: 3954.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's a big reason that that zooms a success. The app is uncomplicated. It's a yeah, it automatically  Installs the app as larry was saying and yeah, that's annoying that they didn't hardly ask permission to do that  But then again web x and the other ones they have something like that, too  But their their app is simple you look at skype's app and it's gigantic and it wants to be social and it's got a  A whole lot of old crap that you don't care about  Zoom's zoom's app is nice and simple and it works. So, you know, that's an interesting

Start time: 3955.50
End time: 3963.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 3963.62
End time: 4008.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, and they did they had to figure out ways around the security of like apple computers and mac  You know apple and uh and windows and the other thing is if you say no every single time  It tries to install that app it will run in the browser just fine  But they don't want it to run in the browser  They want it to be sticky on your system so that when someone calls you it immediately pops up  I mean I get why they did what they did but it was a very  Dark kind of what do they call like a dark pattern or whatever? It was a dark pattern  Yeah, it was and I don't like them for that reason and that's why i've kind of always been like  I'm not like I there's that's what I don't like about zoom even though  I will say i've tested all these different apps and zoom is the most fun  It has the most features and it's undeniably easy. Well, the other thing is and i've noticed this

Start time: 4010.28
End time: 4045.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not making friends if you say I don't want to use zoom. I want to use product x  Because they then have to install product x my mac at home  has  Big blue button blue jeans blue  It has it has it has all of these apps and i'm thinking as soon as this is over i'm wiping the drive  And i'm never installing any of this stuff again  So if so i've experienced this we have a jitsi server running which requires nothing. It's web rtc. It's just web-based  But I can't  Convince anybody at even in my own company to use it. No because they already use the name like that

I'm not aware of that and I went to the website and it was clear to me that this is the reason why only  Nerds are installing this one. It's because it's it's a nerd one.

Transcript:  Confusing although we force people to use skype. You're all on skype  We we have to force people to do it, but it's uh, the best quality we've had been able to get so till today  till today, right  um  so so the reason zooms in the news is because they've uh, they realized that their reputation was mud  And they did an amazing thing. They turned it around very very quickly  I'm wondering though what the panel thinks if this is a real turnaround or if this is a pr turnaround because in the past we've seen zoom  Do the pr thing without doing the real  thing so they hired or a  Consultant and we've talked about this before alex stamos very famously was at yahoo and then at facebook and he's a well  respected person in security they hired  Katie mazura's is a company that is a  Bug bounty company to help them track down bugs and pay people for tracking down bugs  And most recently this week and I was a little miffed  They acquired a company nobody's ever heard of except that I was a big fan of keybase at keybase.io  These guys are super good crypto guys  Uh, they have about 25 person team in new york that that's really all about crypto  And they brought them in to support the end-to-end encryption on zoom  It does put keybase which I had used, uh for I think several years  In jeopardy they sounds like they're it's an acquire. They're going to put all their energies into making zoom secure  These are good hires  but there  Are they are they what zoom needs to do they announced we're not going to add features  In fact, they famously lost out on a facebook deal. They were working with facebook on facebook's messaging platform  And had to move off of it because they said we're not going to work on new features  We're going to work on security only they saw that as the the big opportunity  um  What what do you what do you uh, let's see, let's ask rich  What do you what do you think rich is this real security or security? I think so

Start time: 4478.86
End time: 4525.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I think it's real security. I think that this company realizes they have exactly one opportunity to become  Uh a thing and right now, you know, we don't know what's going to happen after this whole pandemic  Passes when it if and when it does hopefully it does  You know, so I think zoom knows that they know that they've they've caught some fire here and they are ready to just ride that  To the uh to the win and I think they can um, I think that they really can and it's just going to take a matter of like  Like you said their reputation was was mud in the public's eye and of course the major media  You know you say zoom and you think security problems  But I think they can get over it because I think they like you said they made a lot of changes in the past couple weeks  That truly do make the service more secure and so I think they will get through

Start time: 4525.62
End time: 4542.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure you know, you know alex and katie and you know their reputation in the security community  But at the same time alex is not an employee katie's not an employee  It's almost as if they're putting together a team of people who confront  for zoom  Do you think they've done enough?

Yeah  I wrote a blog post called zoom needs to clean up its privacy act and then you were the guy more after that  including, you know, and then and then eric guan that the um,  The ceo reached out to me and and said I and he seemed very sincere about it  You know, I really want to fix this and I I really want your help and anybody's help  and um, I want to see here if  um  If they're they actually did the one thing I asked them to do which is get rid of yeah. No, they didn't. Okay  So they still have they still have trust arc on so the problem they had and the problem i'm telling you  They still have is that their privacy policy. Yeah, there it is.

Yep  and um  and and and obeying the letter but not the spirit of that which is to stop tracking people so  As long as they have tracking of some sort on their home page  It made it look like they have tracking at everything and I said it makes you look like you're an advertising company  And he told me I yeah, I i'm gonna we're gonna we're gonna do what you say  We're gonna get rid of that and I said you're gonna have a fight with your marketing people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you say that let me you're saying they haven't cleaned up yet. Let me read the quote doc because you say here's the thing  Zoom and you do this in italics zoom doesn't need to be in the advertising business  Least of all on the part of it that lives like a vampire off the blood of human data  If zoom needs more money charge more or give less away for free. It's an extremely valuable service performs. Well  It's a platform with lots of apps  and it should be  Interested in privacy and but what's interesting is it sounds like they still haven't this you wrote this  Uh, what is what is the day march 27th? So two weeks ago and they still haven't responded  Yeah, that's a that's about a month a month and two weeks ago. Yeah

I I liked talking to him  He was very modest and and and quite obviously shellacked  By what happened? I mean he had he had a in the background, you know  His false background which you have with zoom was this the san francisco skyline with all the with all the  Uh skyscrapers there and I said well I could you know  What happened is all those buildings exactly as rich said all those buildings drained out and all those people went on to zoom  And then by the way all of church and all of education and all of government and everything else went on to zoom and they  Absorbed that somehow  and by the way, uh credit  amazon as well for being a backend for that which is i'm told they are so that  That's one of us what has succeeded.

Start time: 4843.64
End time: 4901.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know it is but I have no idea it is not true at one point  Some zoom traffic was routed through china zoom says that was an error. It isn't normally here's the larger issue to me  Almost all of zooms code is written by three companies in mainland china  and since their coders are in china in my opinion that makes them vulnerable because  Any company that is in china is partially owned by the chinese government and is absolutely  Susceptible to interference by the chinese government. That's just okay a nature of doing business there  So honestly if zoom really wanted to win my trust  Perhaps they would start doing their coding  Somewhere else. I don't doesn't have to be the u.s. Do it in switzerland if you want but just china or any authoritarian state  Russia would be just as bad  Uh, that worries me a little bit  On the other hand, what are you doing on zoom that you that you're worried that the chinese government's gonna get?

They have a new surface book  Uh, they have a new a few new they have a new surface  Go surface book go was the little one that couldn't it was a little computer that couldn't  Now it almost can it's a little bit faster  What the most interesting story microsoft story of the week actually is the the revelation that  Microsoft windows 10x is going to emerge  On single screen devices now you have to be a microsoft watcher to understand why that's interesting at all. Microsoft  Is recreating windows 10?  In a I think it's going to be a more robust  Kind of containerized operating systems, so applications will all be isolated. It'll be more secure  It'll be less prone to crashing  But it's such a new way of uh doing things. There'll be a lot of compatibility issues at first when microsoft announced windows 10x  They said it's going to be for dual screen devices the the and the first one of those is the windows  Is it the neo? I think it's the I confuse the duo and it's like the duo and the duo is android and the neo  I think is windows  Now they're saying no, no, no, we're not going to wait for the neo for a couple of reasons because of covid  I don't think the neo is going to come out this year  uh, and I think they need to hustle along with windows 10x because windows 10 is  Really starting to show its age. It's getting a little creaky and unreliable

There are no menus  And there are there are the I cannot in fact  The other day I figured out how to import a video and then I forgot and I and I tried  You know figuring out again, but it's impossible because there's nothing intuitive about it

Start time: 6032.58
End time: 6060.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the idea is that your app is so simple  Like if you look at something like snapchat when I first tried that, you know  If you think about it  It was so complicated to me because but at the end of the day I realized it was kind of a cross, right?  You would swipe up for one menu at the bottom. You had to figure that out  You had to figure it out, right?  But after you did to people that use snapchat it makes so much sense and even on instagram to a small degree  And and tiktok especially is the same thing.

End time: 6087.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like this maybe i've been around too long  But this goes contrary in my opinion the way software should be designed where  All the affordances are discoverable  And there are clues there are tips for the ui  And and but the only way you could figure out snapchat and i'm bet microsoft photos is by just going well  Let's see. Does this do anything does this do anything? Does that do anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That seems dopey to do but when you're doing video editing  There's a lot of things you need to do and some of them are obvious, but some of them are really  Virtually impossible and i've stumbled on a few things  And some youtube videos explain it  But what you know, I think what they do is they test these things on complete novices that have never used a computer before  And they probably do better on them than they give you a more traditional program. It doesn't make sense to them. Anyway
