Transcript:  This is TWiT, This Week in Tech, Episode 39 for January 22, 2006.  This is TWiT, This Week in Tech, Episode 39, I don't care, I'm going full steam ahead,  Episode 39, the Jack Benny episode for January 22, 2005.  Welcome to This Week in Tech, it's a brand new show.  What would that stand for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's Tech, Tech, Tech, Tech, Tech, Water, which is the way the show is starting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this 2006?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John C. DeVorek, did I say 2005?  Yes.  I am such a loser.  John C. DeVorek is here, somebody told me you're the Howard Cosell of this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I gotta tell ya.  I never played the game.  That was in my Cosell voice.  I can do a Cosell, but I'd have to think about it.  So the reason that you're screwing up the beginning here is because of the stuff you're  drinking.  Why don't you tell people what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Our new sponsor, Absolute Vodka.  No, it's alkaline water.  And you're getting dingier by the minute.  I'm getting dingier.  It's good for ya.  Let me introduce, David Prager is here.  From revision3.com?  At the moment.  No, yeah, absolutely.  At the moment?  No, no, no, no.  Anything you want to tell?  I was trying to be a little more interesting.  Standing in for Kevin Rose.  Yeah, Kevin is doing...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's he, where is he?  He's doing dig.com meetings because J. Adelson's in town and they've got a lot of dig stuff  to do.  They're digging around, apparently.  They gotta meet with the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's getting a lot of press.  The Wall Street Journal did a story, big story on that.  Does it count if it's the Wall Street Journal online?  Is that the same as...  No.  No.  Greg Zachary is here, a former Wall Street Journal writer.  He wrote some great books, including Showstopper, which I loved about the Windows NT project.  He's now with Business 2.0.  Greg, it's good to have you on a...  Good evening.  On the Twit panel.  Thank you for having me.  Never before been a Twit.  Don't worry, it comes easy.  Believe me.  Just the TEP part that's gonna be tough.  TEP, yeah, that's gonna be tough.  Roger Chang from...  From nowhere.  From Jack Yard.  Oh, back yard.  Back yard.  This is a freebie from a wrestling event I went to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, the unemployed, Roger Chang.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Representing the unemployed today.  Oh, really?  You're out of work?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You were talking about this the other day, you were gonna quit something you were doing.  Yes, I did.  I was driving up here with Roger on the way here, and he gave me a really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  reason for why he quit.  I don't know if you were about to want to retell part of the reason why he quit, but  I thought it was...  Because of poor management and bad work ethic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that...  Does that count?  What's the good story?  No, that was the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just wanted to know if he wanted to be a star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that a story?  Is that a statement of fact?  I just wanted to know...  I didn't know if you'd ever told about where you were and why you left, and if it was worthwhile  telling or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The story is where you have an exposition.  This is just a statement of fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also thought I might be able to get a rant at Roger, because Roger rants well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I already did in the car.  I'm out.  He's talked out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't let him rant in the car.  Save it for the show, don't you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there's a certain someone who's pregnant, but I don't get it.  Okay, let's not start there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Coming up in just a little bit, we're gonna talk about the plight of the independent ISP,  Dane Jasper, our good friend and the president of the California Independent ISP Association  is here.  CISPA.  Talk about network issues.  Let's do the top stories of the week before we get too much further.  You have an interesting story, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this one here is...  I've noticed it on our list.  Should we tell the public that they can access our news list?  Did you ever do that?  Yeah, I don't think I have.  It's on Delicious.  Yeah, it's Delicious, you know, the Delicious D-E-L, whatever the heck it is, .us, slash  twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the problem with Delicious.  No one knows where to put the dots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you don't know how to spell...  Yeah, well, it's...  Right.  You have to play with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's D-E-L dot I-C-I-O dot U-S.  It's a case of being a little too clever.  Slash twit.  And there's an RSS feed you can subscribe to.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there's basically our news stories that we'll be doing on a weekly basis.  Some.  Some of them.  We actually only do about, what, five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, we do more than that.  There's actually a really neat news site.  I sent you all invitations.  Did you look at Newsvine?  I sent you the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I did.  I saw that.  It's another thing, that's another wacky thing you've kind of dug up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of a mixture of Dig, Delicious, and Blogger.  Oh, Newsvine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Newsvine.  Newsvine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Newsvine.  I've heard of it.  Yeah.  Is it any good?  It's not public yet.  It's newsvine.com.  There's a public beta going on.  I like it.  Here's what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you used it?  Have you used it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I sent you an invite.  Didn't I?  Maybe you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't...  Delicious is pretty basic.  It's just Delicious.  Yeah, it's just...  It's just tags.  This has that, but you can also blog about your tags, and the idea, the theory behind  it is they'll share the advertising revenue, so if you drove a lot of page views, you'd  make some money on it.  I'm not sure.  It's slick-looking.  Very slick-looking.  It's got some nice tools.  I think it might do well.  I mean, it's interesting.  I mean, it just validates Kevin, because it's really more of the same.  It's really like a twisted dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they say it's new and innovative because it's giving power to the...  The users are the ones making the editorial decisions, is what I'm saying.  Never heard of that before.  But then it's trying to monetize it for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  How do you feel about that, Greg, as a mainstream journalist?  Do you feel like that all these bloggers are just ripping you off?  You're doing all the work, and then they're linking to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I don't.  I do think there's a little bit of the tail...  The dog chasing the tail, so sooner or later, somebody has to come up with original material  that's costly that a consumer's going to want.  And as these mainstream media downsize and slim down and proprietize some of their stuff,  they're going to find the bloggers that it's a tougher go, and there'll be some shaking

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  out.  Yeah, but you know, there's been some blogs that...  Or quasi-blogs or pseudo-blogs or whatever you want to call them that have done kind  of this already end gadget comes to mind.  They covered CES probably as well as any mainstream media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they made the turn.  They made the transition from just linking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the thing is they have a clue about the online part.  I mean, they're essentially taking the photographs and posting them instantly.  So there wasn't anybody...  The old editorial model that you're talking...  That we're used to, which is...  No filter.  You have a series...  Right.  It's non-filtered, and there's a lot of...  The guys who are going to get burned by this change, if it actually happens, and I think  are going to be those...  That layers and layers of management and editorial management that's in between the writer and  the reader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, that's what we do.  We're a meta show.  We take other people's stories and we talk about them.  Although I think we could also start doing some of that coverage ourselves too.  I mean, that's not so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the way I see it, why do it until you have to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is how John covered CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From the living room.  From the living room.  But there's a great need for analysis, and I'd say that there's too narrow a band of  opinions, so all the blogging generally is welcomed.  But I just think it's a question of the economics of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, what about...  Somebody's got to pay for the actual news gathering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sooner or later, somebody's going to have to start actually paying for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Gadgets loaded.  I mean, Gadget's doing great.  The AOL's footing the bill, and I'm sure they're making money.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what about, like, do you worry about integrity of the stories where people might consciously  or unconsciously put a story into a particular slant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is there integrity in mainstream media?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm not saying but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, Greg's working on a paper for the Dvorak Uncensored blog, dvorak.org slash blog.  Wow, that's only five minutes into the show.  I know, I had to get it in there, but on this exact topic.  And you want to just summarize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I've been teaching journalism for seven years with John Markoff on technology  at Stanford and at UC Berkeley.  One thing about civic journalism that's great is it's giving all this opportunity, as John  says, and you're saying, for people with initiative to shed new vantage points.  The bad part is what we're finding is that people really do have serious access to grind.  And now in a very partisan way, I mean, even something like this Google not cooperating  with the government, you're going to see a lot of cleavages right away.  And it's going to be difficult to avoid many issues being shouting matches.  And so I think people over time will come back to some neutral forms of journalism,  but they're going to be much smaller.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We are in a polarized nation.  I mean, that we love those those kind of polarization.  Who doesn't love cleavage, frankly?  That's one of the things we we always need to more of on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In a deconstructionist French way of cleavage.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Intellectual term.  So tell us the story.  So here's the first story that I was just we've been sitting on for a while.  But this is the story that ran an info world and a few other places, which in its title,  the IBM expert warns of short lifespan for burn CDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you all get this?  I got this from 30 different people in the email.  It's like, what about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says two, two and a half years, two years to five years max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For burn CDs?  Yeah.  Is that coming from like a specific period like CDR is created back in like 99 or 90?  I had no idea.  To be honest about it, I have no idea what he's talking about.  I just installed an application I had on a CD that I've had for six years.  I think it's both.  I have.  Are you technically using CDs for archiving purposes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's a terrible idea to archive stuff on CDs.  What are you going to archive it on?  A hard drive?  Well, I mean, I think it's pretty much been proven that like a CD that's pressed lasts  longer than a CD that's burned.  Oh, yeah.  Well, that's a fact.  That is a fact.  So what?  Well, if I have a bunch of stuff like family heirloom type stuff that I want to keep, I'm  not going to burn it on a CD.  And I'm already, here's what's really, I recently actually bought a damn Flickr account because  I figured, you know what, I can upload all of my stuff there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Flickr will be around in six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know what?  I trust that right now more than I would stick in a CD in a safe.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I do.  Oh, brother.  Listen, this guy, Gurecky.  I'm backed up by putting stuff on my hot dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gurecky, the guy from IBM, he recommends that people use magnetic tapes.  I mean, come on here.  Oh, I got a mag tape in the back.  Let's just do a little background on this.  The first burnable CDs came out in 1988.  I, coincidentally, managed to get a burner.  He also came out in 1988.  I got a burner.  And I mean, there's a joke there.  I could have come back and I'm thinking, what am I supposed to say to that?  Because you're the better man.  Alcoholic water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're drinking Pepsi, I'm drinking alkaline water.  Coke, not Pepsi.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So anyway, so in 1988, these things came out.  And I actually had a couple of the early burners.  Olympus made one.  They were all 1X.  They were scuzzy.  They were very inconvenient, hard to use.  And you had to find software.  It's amazing.  I still have those discs.  Yeah, they work.  They may work, right?  Yes.  Me too.  I have old discs.  Well, go home and check, John.  Don't just say it like that.  Well, see, this is...  I just finished a column a couple of days ago because I got this new Plex door drive, a  DVD reader writer.  And because I have a couple of really old discs, I like to check them and to see if  they work on the new drive because some of these new drives indeed will not read some  of these discs because the waggle track is screwed up.  There's a million reasons.  The waggle track is a little...  It is.  It's a little track on the outside that the little head waggles around and then it says,  oh, okay, I should be reading.  It's kind of like one of those chihuahuas in the back of a car.  So anyway, so I ran it.  I think we're talking about discs from my OS2 era and all these old, old discs.  These things are over 10 years old, which is twice as old as this guy claims they're  going to last.  They all read fine.  And in those days...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No problem.  They didn't know how to make good media.  I mean, there were lots of issues with the early CD-R media.  It wasn't sealed properly.  It was oxidizing.  Cyanide poisoning.  So you're saying this guy is full of it?  Yeah, totally.  He's full of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I say too.  He's full of it.  Are most of these CDs using the same kind of filament that you melt with a laser tape?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They just die.  There's two or three kinds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Say phthalocyanine for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Phthalo is thalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because TDK has these scratch proof ones.  Have you seen those TDK scratch proof ones where you can scratch the crap out of them  and they still go.  That's just redundancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They've got a lot of redundancy.  That's got nothing.  But wouldn't that be better for archiving?  They scratch them radially.  If you scratch them along the groove, dead meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The other one is you can't scratch on the label side.  That's where the data really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's where the reflective layer without no light.  Let him talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This guy knows everything.  I'm done.  I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Get the new guy in.  So, did anybody study this?  Because I always was skeptical about cheap media.  We're talking even cheap discs to hold up.  These guys are full of crap when they say two years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is where we could actually become journalists and do the actual lab research.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty much all the stuff I've burnt on were all those cheap ones you get at the computer  show like 100 on a spool and they still work.  They're fine.  I've only had one disc and that was a silver-back blue dye.  That just kind of leaked.  The dye leaked out of it.  That was the only time I actually had a disc go bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the early days, there was a problem with bad sealing of the polycarbonate layers.  You'd get moisture in there.  The reflective layer would oxidize.  People in Florida would say, oh my God, there's rot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This used to be, you're talking about the stamped ones.  The early stamped laser discs, which is where the laser rot came from, were nothing but  all flopped.  I still have one.  They work.  There's a lot of them that don't.  Really?  They're early, early, early rusted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There were actually two.  Yeah, basically.  I think there were two plants that pressed on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, that's why I'd make alkaline water.  And then you'd use that glue or adhesive.  Actually, it probably oxidizes more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wasn't it Disney that wanted to do DVD rentals where once you open the seal, it oxidizes  within 24, 48 hours.  But lucky Eisner doesn't work there anymore.  You can't worry about, wow, that was their fake solution.  It was a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Nevertheless, this scared a lot of people, this story.  I know.  And it was circulated widely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's in the mag tape business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Come on.  That's what gets me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wants people to use mag tape.  Why don't we just go back to MO discs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't we just go back to Chad and use the paper tapes?  Just have the thing grinding away.  With your nail for it.  You never lose the data on a paper tape until the paper falls apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think probably the real issue is how long you're going to have a CD player to play back  this data.  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The devices are going to not live as long as the storage medium themselves.  Well, you have to keep taking it.  You have to keep your stuff in a pile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then when you get to the next technology, you have to check and recopy it into the new  technology.  You have to keep doing that till you die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think people do that.  Like, I've done that with a bunch of stuff just to clear out space, like copying them  over to DVD-Rs because, you know, it's five CDs that don't have to stack on top of each  other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Your kids are going to go up in the attic.  They're going to open this box and say, wow.  Porn.  I'm going to do what my dad did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When my dad had a bunch of old 8-track tapes, he actually put it along with the 8-track  player.  So I'm just going to shrink wrap a PC with a CD drive, modern keyboard and mouse, and  put it together as a package.  It'll be a CRT motor.  It's just like the little wax cylinders from Edison.  Edison.  They include the little...  You can still get those.  Yeah.  And the Viewmatics.  Viewmaster.  Viewmasters.  Viewmasters.  Just do the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you have your old Viewmasters?  Yes.  What little wheels do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One was Mighty Mouse and the other one was Sea Hawaii, like a little vacation.  I knew you would have those.  Yeah, I would.  It's probably got shrink jammies.  He wears Mighty Mouse jammies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Story two, and that's the big story.  Google fights when AOL, MSN, and Yahoo cave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you know why Google fought?  Is there a reason that hurt?  Let's tell the story first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's tell the story first.  Department of Justice lawyers wanting the search companies to do their research for  them have gone and went to subpoena to all the search companies.  Here's the issue.  They're trying to resurrect this lousy Child Online Protection Act, which was struck down  two years ago by an appeals court.  The appeals court said, look, this is a terrible law.  It's unconstitutional.  The only way you can get this back on the books is if you guys prove there's no other  way to fight child porn.  So for two years, the Department of Justice has been laboring, trying to prove there's  no other way to fight child porn.  They subpoena records from all the search engine companies.  The first story came out.  Google says no.  And then all of a sudden, we find out without a word, Yahoo, AOL, MSN all said, yeah, sure,  whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this an issue?  Absolutely.  We got a president that's doing domestic spying.  The NSA is spying on everything.  Emails, telephone calls.  And I think Google has a brand to protect.  Their value is in somewhat having transcended the fray, being a public trust.  And they know that if they start getting, stoking these conspiracy theories about what  they're doing, who they're turning on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They already have a problem because people, you know, there are people out there that  anti-Google forces, they have a grudge against Google for some reason.  I think it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But is there really any threat?  Isn't this just aggregate data?  There's no personal information in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is.  It's the precedent.  Because basically, while it's hard to believe that the NSA doesn't already either physically  tap their servers or surveilling in other ways, this is just a slippery slope.  I mean, why doesn't then the police just sit back there with them full time then?  Why can't they just be there 24 hours a day?  And if somebody makes a search, how to build an atomic bomb.  This might be a good time to bring Dane Jasper in.  And they just bring him in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dane Jasper has been running an independent ISP in Northern California for some time.  Move the chair over to David.  Make some room for Dane.  And the reason is because you remember the FBI some years ago had a project called Carnivore.  They renamed it to something more benign.  But the idea was they put a box in every Internet service provider in the nation and it's watching  all the traffic.  Yeah, it's basically a back end.  Dane, what happened to Carnivore?  Is it around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I saw an early version.  I saw Omnivore, which was pre-Carnivore.  It ate everything.  It did, yeah.  And we had an experience in our business where we had some customers doing bad things.  And the FBI came and said we'd like to deploy one of these devices.  And the funny bit was it didn't work.  So you let them.  So you let them.  You did deploy it.  Well, what we did, this is back in the day as dial-up.  And we configured the radius servers to give each of these customers a random looking IP  in a subnet.  And then we routed those two subnets over a dedicated wire.  And then we handed them that wire.  So we segregated it.  We segregated these customers.  But did they have a court order?  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, see they had a court order.  Now that's very different.  Well, this is a subpoena.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes, they're not a court order, but there's a subpoena involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, those are two different things.  Those are two very different things.  The court order is a specific investigation for a specific case.  It's like a wiretap.  Yeah, on a specific subject.  This is blanket.  Fishing expedition.  Yeah, fishing expedition, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a huge difference there.  And actually, I was very impressed in working with the FBI.  This was in 1998.  They had a computer crime squad and they really knew what they were doing.  And they began these dialogues with, you know, we have a question about this.  They were very specific.  We'd like a very narrow answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing here is that we're differentiating between, there was a crime, I would assume,  involved with this kind of thing.  There's no crime involved with this.  It's a fishing expedition.  They're saying, let's see how bad it is.  These guys are trying to get a law repass.  To me, I'm saying, why don't you just rewrite the law?  Here's the Republicans, they got the president, they got the congressmen, they got the senators,  they got everything.  They ought to be able to pass the law.  Why don't they rewrite the law so it's constitutional and walk it through Congress and pass it?  This is the second time.  Why?  Because they don't know how to write laws?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Chippa, Chippa, Coppa, they keep trying.  They can't get a law because of the First Amendment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well then they're doing something wrong.  What they're trying to do is they should be able to write a law instead of trying to shoehorn  this stuff with this bogus, this invasion.  This is worse than a fishing expedition.  This is a surveillance effort.  Here's the stinger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wall Street hits Google hard, their stock drops 8% as a result of fighting this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well it's fear that the government's going to find some way to take it out on Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a Republican pro-business government supposedly and this company gets slammed because  they're not going along with the program, which is not really a, it's not a criminal  investigation whatsoever.  It's just some thing that the Bush administration wants to do.  I mean, and then they get hit by Wall Street.  I mean, what kind of pro-business environment is this?  Don't get me started on Sarbanes Oxley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't want to see your socks.  When it comes down to MSN, Yahoo and AOL, what did they say to justify giving up the  information?  Why did they just say, yeah, sure, go ahead and Google say no?  I mean, there were some lame quotes here and there.  Are they rethinking saying, geez, maybe we blew it?  They did blow it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They blew it.  Our stock could have fallen 8%.  Obviously, if you're a member of these organizations, you're right.  Here's the real question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this a great opportunity to buy Google?  I was going to say.  Under $500, they hit, by the way, your target price a long time ago.  You predicted $500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now you're going to $6.  I'm almost going to $12.  That's going to do it.  I'm just saying I'm almost going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, I think the SEC would require us to say something about, don't listen to  us.  Okay, so if it comes to buying stock.  No, actually, I write for MarketWatch and I can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't there some sort of disclaimer you have to...  I don't own any stock in Google at the moment.  Actually, I do.  I should say.  Well, that you do have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have stock in Google.  I have 70 shares.  It's not like I'm going to...  70 shares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could be a lot.  You could be a millionaire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I bought it.  I was thinking...  It moves up slowly.  You know when I bought it?  When I was looking at Google and when the epiphany hit me, and we've talked about this,  but it was six months ago, eight months ago, that this is not a search engine company.  It's an advertising company.  I suddenly got it.  I got their business model.  I said, these guys are going to make some money.  But I think you're right, Greg, that it's very incumbent on them to be almost above  suspicion, to be kind of the public trust, right?  People are already scared of what Google knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the telephone company had that status.  AT&T had that status for many, many years, and Google seems to have inherited it and  they want to keep it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Dane, there's no carnivore in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He runs a SonicNet, which is a great internet service.  I want to ask him this too, because I've heard that since 9-11, most ISPs have installed  some sort of carnivore-like device.  Have you heard anything about this?  I haven't, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does it come up at CISPA meetings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and really, if that was the intent, that would be in the national and international  backbones.  They could do it so much easier that way.  They really wouldn't push that to the edge.  That's echelon.  Where we would see it.  And yeah, I mean...  I'm always starting to sound like a chief novel.  There is echelon.  The British...  They have conceded that.  The British...  Yeah, yeah, I've heard that too.  The US has never admitted...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They have meetings.  This is like the trilateral commission.  It's a beer drinking club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You find it hard to believe that the...  Well, the NSA is not supposed to, but some government agency that is mandated to watch  domestic...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't do this computerized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all keywords.  Yeah, that's true.  They just say, okay, he said hummus.  Watch for Osama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Watch for Osama.  One of the things you're supposed to say is like, you're supposed to use code words.  You're supposed to say, for example, if you're in the business of doing any security work  at all, you say, no such agency and Christians in action.  Those are your two.  Christians in action.  Those are your two.  That's the standard code words that you use and they will not pick up on them.  It's like...  Oh, I think they will now.  They just...  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They don't listen to it.  They don't listen to it.  Actually, you'd be surprised.  I got an email today from a major in the Air Force who's in the Pentagon.  He said...  Actually, I should get his permission.  I won't say his name, but he said he's been telling all his buddies at the Pentagon.  He says, we get lots of good inside information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is so sad.  It really is.  No, I think it's great.  It's as a death joke.  No, I mean, if they think they're getting any good information from us, they've got  a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Patrick and I, at one point, were invited by the Secret Service to come to their convention  in Florida.  That'd be cool.  This was a few years ago and talk to them about forensics.  And I thought, wait a minute.  We're two TV hosts.  We don't know anything.  We pretend to for television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I gave that talk, actually.  Have you done that?  Have you been down there?  They were actually very cool.  It wasn't there.  It was for the FBI.  We're educating local agencies, the police department, the sheriff's department.  And the big question was, how long do you, as internet service writers, keep logs of  who's been logging in, what their IP address was?  How long do we make you keep that information?  Well, you don't.  There's no law.  And that's why, you know, that's our hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The guy at, you know, company guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can you edit that word?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Company, edit company.  You know, if you go to...  He would erase his logs daily.  Well, I would too, if I were with my company.  You know what I'm talking about.  Yeah, PUD.  Yeah, PUD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you go to Freaks Company, he also has a...  I didn't say that one.  It's the same thing.  I haven't been on that site for years.  He has a family-friendly version.  I can't remember what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That site was just basically...  Freaking company?  It's a virtual water cooler for people that throw smack at.  I think it's lost its edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  PUD was brilliant though.  You know, PUD's brilliance was, and he even admitted this, I just write something that  maintains itself and kind of generates coin, and I can go do something else, and I keep  doing these, and the money comes in.  It sounds like one of those get rich quick schemes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a work of art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes money by itself.  You don't have to do anything.  Just put an ad in the newspaper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It worked.  It worked, Roger.  It's doable on the internet.  It's a community.  Let everybody else create them.  So anyway, they were shocked that you don't have to keep logs.  How long do you keep your logs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It varies depending upon the service, but I would guess...  I have a lot of exposure to internet service providers as I'm serving as the president  of this California association.  Most folks keep logs a month.  How come that long even?  And...  Why not forever?  Well, you want to know if somebody is sending spam from your network, if somebody's hacking  from your network.  But you want to surprise...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If the RIAA sends you a letter, you want to be able to...  But it's just keeping forever.  What difference does it make?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Storage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Storage.  How much storage is it going to take up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd be surprised.  We're talking about authentication logs.  Apparently I would.  Every time somebody logs in to check their email, which they might have configured their  client to do once every minute or once every five minutes, we've got an authentication packet.  And every time somebody logs in, logs out, we've allocated an IT.  There's a lot of logs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been a customer of Dane's for a long time.  And for what?  Oh, is that what you're doing?  I'm just kidding.  No, no.  He's not responsible for that part.  In fact, I wish he were.  Well, you know, we had a $30,000 bill with SonicNet with Dane.  He just saved our butt.  How did that happen?  Oh, you don't want to know.  This was that thing when I moved the RSS feed off FeedBurner without thinking.  I just put...  I stuck it on my...  Oh, and you were actually doing these huge feeds?  No.  The problem is with an RSS feed, I thought they're smaller, 30K, big deal.  How much could that be?  The problem is, first of all, it wasn't a server account.  It was just an ISP server, you know, the 10 megabytes they give you for free.  Right.  But the second problem was that all of these podcast clients, they don't just hit it once.  They hit it every five minutes.  So it's 30K every five minutes from a quarter of a million people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, right, right.  Yeah, that RSS stuff, it really...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there are a lot of people out there saying, is there a new podcast?  Is there a new podcast?  What's the new one?  They're on the edge of their seats in an automated fashion.  Well, some people go by hand.  They don't even know, and then it shows up every five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, so you were just...  So is that...  Have you noticed it?  Is this a real problem with the...  Is this the Achilles heel of RSS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fortunately, Dane knows me and we're friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I saw the revenue reports come through.  We made some money this month.  So I see Leo's account, 20...  Yeah.  Actually, his...  Holy mackerel.  You'd be surprised what we cleared on Leo's...  What we can clear to Leo's credit card.  Did it clear?  Did it clear?  Oh, brother.  You're buying.  I think we cleared 14 grand or something to Leo's credit card.  So I see the revenue reports.  The week I say, Leo, report 14 grand.  I look at the pending, he's got another 50 grand back up.  Another 15 or something.  So I pick up the hammer, Leo...  This is two months.  This only took two months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was like 15 a month.  Holy...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we just returned it and called Leo and said,  Leo, what's up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So kids, just a word of warning.  Holy mackerel.  If you've got a little setting, and you do,  and I should have paid attention,  that turns off the amount of downloads after you hit the limit.  Yeah, we actually emailed you a warning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't read my email.  He doesn't read his email, folks, ladies and gentlemen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Take a note.  You don't read my email.  I do.  That's because you have these lock...  You lock it with this digital...  No, it's a digital signature.  It's not locked.  There'll be a column coming up on this, ladies and gentlemen.  John can't read digital signatures.  This digital signature thing is a joke.  Wait a minute.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No.  I sent you email.  I sent everybody email.  Here's the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, most of the time, yours doesn't even have  the signature half the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is PGP sign.  It's PGP.  I have it signed.  That way, if you get it from me, you know that it came from me,  and nobody's modified it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  And then I send them, say, I do a hit respond,  and it comes up with a little note saying,  oh, this person cannot receive anything that's not digitally signed.  Really?  Yeah.  And then it says, click here for...  What email program are you using?  Then it says, click here.  It's the one that prevents spam.  I'm using Outlook Express like nobody in the world uses it.  It hasn't been updated since 1990.  I've been meaning to change it.  I've been trying different things.  I was testing software on it, so I got stuck on it.  You know what?  Most probably that's the number one email.  I bet you that's the number one email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure it is.  I used to use Eudora, and then it blew up a couple boxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They never could figure out why, and I switched over to Mozilla,  and then I had to test some software.  Thunderbird's good.  That's what I'm going to next.  I like Thunderbird.  But the point is, it comes up with this little message,  and it says, get your digital signature here.  So I click on it, and it's a 404 error.  It's crap.  Are you using IMAP or using POP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm using IMAP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm very curious about people's desire for IMAP.  I use IMAP.  I'm sorry to segue, but it's a perfect segue.  Welcome to Twitter.  It's a good one.  As an internet service provider, we hate podcasts.  We hate IMAP, and I'm being completely frank.  You hate my IMAP because of the amount of bandwidth it uses?  It was my service guy that told me to use IMAP.  I love IMAP.  IMAP is a great service.  I'm a big fan of IMAP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a big fan of IMAP.  I'm a big fan of your service guy that told me to use IMAP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  IMAP is great, and everybody should use IMAP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, can you explain to people out there  who don't know what IMAP is compared to POP?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Normally, when you use a POP server,  and POP stands for Post Office Protocol,  you go on the POP server, you download the mail,  you clear it off of the ISP server,  and you download it onto your server,  and yeah, he says thank you.  There's a problem with that, though.  For people who have multiple machines like me,  then I have to sync each machine.  If I send a message,  I can't send it to one machine, but not another.  IMAP is more like Microsoft Exchange  or any central server where the mail stays on the server.  And I use my clients.  And by the way, Outlook Express works fine.  Outlook works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can move it off there if you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can.  You can copy it, but most of the time,  you'll leave it on there,  and you can access it from anywhere.  It's kind of like Webmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can use a Webmail client with it.  I use Squirrel Mail, for example,  to go to my IMAP account,  and I can get my mail on anybody's computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just so you feel better, Dane,  I use a IMAP service called Fast Mail.  It's out of Australia.  It's excellent.  Yeah, we've been looking at them.  They're wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a lot of traditional internet service providers  are not offering IMAP.  And the vast majority...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's because of the duke constantly being pounded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the reason?  Yes.  And the idea is that you've got three different clients  at three different locations.  You leave the mail on the server  because that's centrally accessible.  And what I'm seeing is users are moving over to Webmail  because they're getting the same benefit  of ubiquitous access.  And I think it's time for ISPs  to probably have to stop resisting that  and find a way to do IMAP in an economic way.  Or just get on anybody's Gmail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get a Gmail account, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this is fine.  I got the greatest no-spam guy in the world.  I don't get any spam.  All right, all right.  But you don't get my mail either.  No, that's...  Actually, you get it.  You can't send it back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the client.  I get your mail.  It's the client.  And actually, Outlook occasionally,  for some reason, Outlook will send...  People will complain,  and I don't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know what happened with your stuff  a little while ago?  All of this stopped.  Your message never came in.  It always came in as an attachment.  Even if it was like,  hello, how you doing?  That's bad.  What, are you using a Mac or something?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is he sending HTML mail?  I don't know what he's doing.  Never.  Never.  I know he's sending HTML.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever it is, it's like the digital...  He says, all my mail's in Flash.  He's like...  The reason he's got the digital signature  is because I know one day there was a pop-up  and he said, oh, I think that's a good idea.  And he just clicks on everything.  No!  You're lying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I did it because I was being impersonated  and I wanted to make sure that when people got mail  from me, they knew it was from me.  So I tell...  But people get...  I get mail all the time.  People said, hey, I saw you in the chat room  or you commented on my blog or you sent me an email.  It's just somebody impersonating me,  which is going to happen now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This hasn't...  This doesn't stop it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, but I tell people and I'm telling you,  if you get mail from me,  it's not from me unless it's signed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You won't get mail from them, folks, anyway.  Well, that's true, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you got mail from me, it wasn't from me anyway.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't you just make that statement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Greg, what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you use IMAP?  Do you use Pop?  He doesn't know what he's doing.  No.  He used...  Get this.  What do you use, Greg?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hot mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He said he backed up his file stuff.  I want to just hark him back during that conversation  to tell you what I use.  I mean, when you were talking about,  are the DVDs or CD burns going to last,  I'm thinking global warming.  I mean, we just lost a city.  Are we going to last?  I mean, New Orleans.  I mean, we're thinking about,  are the CDs going to last?  Just keep it kind of high.  So, yeah, keep them up high.  So you're trying...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think we're just...  You're trivializing our concerns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't mean to be dismissive.  You hurt my feelings.  Yeah, I was trying to put it into perspective.  And I think for most people, the mail...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Your financial records on a CD,  this is a big deal.  The records of New Orleans could have been on a CD  and it could have been destroyed by the hurricane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, yeah, that would have helped  if they were all backed up there, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you're saying until President Bush  signs the Kyoto Accords,  there's no point in putting my stuff on a CD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, back to the mail.  I think most people use the mail system  of least resistance, least work for them.  Yes.  And it's surprising when your superpower users  like you guys are,  beeping along in relative bliss,  that most people are still caught up  in a very, very low level of interaction  with the computer.  I could never use Hotmail

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because it sounded like a sex thing.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what do you think about Yahoo then?  Is that worse?  Yahoo's a little better.  People like that, but Gmail, they like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at the new Yahoo mail.  That's what everyone says.  Awesome.  It's obviously bought odd post.  Yeah.  And it looks just like Outlook.  It's incredible.  Now, how do you feel about that kind of stuff, Dave?  Because that is also very bandwidth intensive, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is, and same sort of scenario,  but we think it's great.  And actually, we tried to license odd post,  and they got bought by Yahoo  and they stopped returning our calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It beats Squirrel Mail.  It beats all the other web-based mails.  It's just really easy to use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's get back to this RSS thing.  It's such a big deal.  I'm really kind of shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, somebody canceled his membership in Twitter.  He said, I'm not giving you my $2 because I hate Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So...  Well, you know, he's not listening, I guess,  so I can't say anything about it.  I said, take your $2.  Go away!  No, you hate...  You know, there are Dvorak haters out there.  They tend to be old Macintosh hacks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't care.  You know what?  You're the Howard Cosell of Twitter, like I said.  You're a lightning rod.  Telling it like it is.  That's right.  People hate you.  They love you, but they always listen.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got Leo impersonators.  Leo does a much better...  Dvorak haters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can't make it sound like crap when it's a Howard Cosell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder what they look like.  I feel like a Leo impersonator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo impersonator.  It's probably a woman.  It could be the same guy that hates John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So let's get back to this $30,000 RSS thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you noticed this happening?  I mean, because RSS is very important to the blogging community,  for example, and the podcasters.  Yeah.  And it...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, any time you create a mechanized process  to repeatedly pull something,  and it's a pull mechanism instead of a push mechanism,  and it's mechanized,  you're going to use a lot more bandwidth than you need to.  My understanding is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And obviously I'm not coding RSS.  You have done this.  You have coded RSS.  By hand.  By hand.  But my understanding is the mechanism,  the way it works is that you set the RSS feed up as an XML file,  which has got data in it that tells the other side  that comes in and looks at it,  because they've subscribed.  It parses it.  They've subscribed, and they say,  okay, I'm supposed to go and hit this thing.  I thought in the RSS feed itself,  it would say, well, we're going to update once a week.  There's a time to live, which is generally ignored.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh.  So you...  Well, that doesn't help.  Yeah.  And by the way,  this raises an issue with one of our stories.  You know, a lot of these people are not implementing RSS properly.  Dave Weiner was very upset.  Apple's got this new photo casting feature,  part of the iPhoto, where you can share your photos.  Oh, who's the owner?  No, it's called photo casting.  What you'll do is you'll share a folder,  and if another person is using iPhoto,  and then you have to get the new iPhoto,  you can subscribe to...  Grandma can subscribe to your photos over the net.  But Steve Jobs, in his speech, says,  and it's industry standard, RSS,  so anybody with an RSS reader can also subscribe.  Well, it turns out it's awful.  It's abysmal.  The RSS community is going crazy,  and this is the problem is people implement RSS readers,  but pay no attention to the spec.  And then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is the spec, though?  There's multiple specs.  I think there was a .96 and a .98  and a 1.1, a 1.0, and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And there's Atom.  I mean, yeah, there are issues with that as well, I agree.  But there is at least specs for those.  There's three good standards that people can follow,  and they should follow.  And they do work.  They work very well.  I mean, that's how podcasting works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't work that well if you're getting bills  for $30,000 for doing nothing.  You know, I was stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Personal account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was stupid.  I put it in the wrong place.  I didn't pay attention,  and that was just a dumb thing to do.  And I think that's a real object lesson  for people who want to create content.  Bandwidth becomes a big deal.  If we didn't have bandwidth for this from America Online,  we couldn't afford to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even though that guy gave us $2.  The $2 guy, you know?  Yeah, I got two bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do we still need ISPs?  Why aren't there just, say,  four or five bandwidth companies, and that's it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate to say, but we're getting there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.  But isn't that what I'm thinking?  Not in a good way.  That's not a good thing.  That's aggregation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because these guys can all of us...  That's like saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  why don't we just have one newspaper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's why it's not a good thing.  And it's already been hinted at  by either the Comcast guys or the AT&T guys.  One of the two, the guy I forgot,  Whitaker or whatever his name is.  He says, you know,  I think it's a kind of crummy  that these Google guys are making money off of our hard work.  I think we should maybe charge them  or maybe take a piece of their actions.  It's like a gangster.  I think we should...  Google's making billions.  I think we should get...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what they did with the programmers.  I mean, that's what Comcast and Malone did with...  Squeezed them.  With television shows for so long.  They went to them and said,  hey, you don't give us 10% of your show.  You're not on our cable network.  And maybe that's what they're thinking.  You're right, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's the problem with the...  But even with Dane,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  he's saying when people are using Yahoo mail,  they're using our bandwidth for your rich media  and it's costing us because of all the...  And the problem is, of course, this flat fee pricing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in the Internet service paradigm,  consumers are buying bandwidth.  And in the telcos concept,  they own a network and people are paying for access into it.  To their network.  And they're used to being paid in both directions.  I think...  If they terminate a call...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's treating broadband as a cable network.  Right?  And you're saying how would we protect ISP's existence?  What public policies or private policies would we promote then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and the FCC has talked about a set of standards where...  The FCC.  You know, we won't block traffic  or we won't provide preferential routing.  And John's point is that the phone companies,  Verizon joined SBC and saying,  why are these people having free carriage across our network?  And from my perspective...  It's not free, they're paying 50 bucks a month.  Well, the customer's paying 50 bucks a month.  And...  Oh, Google should be paying.  The telco wants to double dip.  The telco would like money from the content provider and the end user.  Greg raises a very interesting point

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because really there's two things an ISP does.  They provide the connectivity.  It's like plugging into the wall and you get electricity.  And they provide the service, whether email or what...  And that's the point is,  as more and more third parties like Yahoo and Google  end up providing the services that traditionally ISP's have provided,  what do we need an ISP for?  Why can't we just plug into the utility?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's been some of the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It needs to be...  I don't want to say it,  but it needs to be government-owned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sorry.  You made me drop my alkaline water.  What?  Socialize?  Greg, have you noticed?  He's getting more and more left.  I don't know what's happening.  I'm not.  I'm a right-winger.  I'm scared.  I'm just telling you.  He was the Michael Savage of computing for years.  And all of a sudden he's starting to sound like Bill Clinton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the last thing I thought you'd say.  But I think it's an interesting notion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe not government.  It should be a utility like the water company.  You should be able to plug into the wall and get water.  You can go to a hotel room, turn it on, get water,  you've got free electricity in the hotel,  you should have free connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what the number one internet service provider is  in this country?  Linksys.  Number two, default.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a gag that you might want to explain to them.  I don't have to explain it.  I can't learn from Nick Geary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What am I logged into here?  Linksys.  You're in the Linksys one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like some guy across the street, you're poaching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Meaning that's your modem.  Dane, defend yourself.  Why should there be ISPs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, internet service providers are certainly innovating  and driving the bandwidth to the household.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am not complaining about guys like you.  I think if there's all a bunch of little independents  doing their job, I think that would be fantastic.  But you're an endangered species.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  His business is better than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That doesn't mean he's not an endangered species.  The bigger he gets, the more likely AT&T will buy him out.  That would be so much more money.  You will not be able to resist the allure of a big check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What kind of car did you drive down here today?  A Prius.  You used to have a fancy car.  You still have the Linux license plate?  I do.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Waz has a Prius too.  Everybody's got a Prius.  I heard that.  And he's got a Hummer H1.  Does he have the license plate?  John and I drive Lexuses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A fine automobile, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like them.  Is that a little blatant?  But you have a laser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, one thing that's really troubling is that Wi-Fi didn't  become free, open, many cities.  And that seems to be a real market failure.  That a clear service.  It seems like we've gone backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Philadelphia's the best example because the big companies  just fought against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're ganged up on it.  They want to pass laws.  And so it seems like there are examples with bandwidth where  we're going backwards in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're numbers, what, 14, 15, 16?  We're like down on the list.  We're not even close in per capita.  Well, I mean, you have a point, John, in that you look at

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  countries where the telephony system is entirely government  run.  And in that environment, everybody had a phone line.  And then the internet came along and they wanted another one.  And another phone line meant more capacity.  And pushing over to DSL, where both are carried over one line,  was the right thing to do for the costs of running that  service.  And the side effect is it's darn fast.  So a lot of countries...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they're using ex-DSL and some of these high speed  DSLs in most of the countries.  In Sweden, I can get 30 megabits per second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So a lot of these countries got ahead of us because from an  altruistic perspective, it was better and more cost-effective  to deliver broadband and voice over the same...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And how's that different than in our infrastructure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because here it's all about is the consumer ready to pay for  that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  We're competing.  Companies are tripping over themselves...  To rip off the consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, to get those number of people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They pay less in South Korea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They pay less in Japan.  And they get more speed.  And they get more speed.  I don't understand.  I think we are getting ripped off.  China, it was just announced, their internet population hit  111 people online.  111 million.  111 million people online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All at the same internet cafe.  So left out a few zeros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  111 million people online.  That's the number two nation.  And you can bet they don't have IAS, but they do.  They bet they don't have ISPs in China, or do they?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's government run and there's internet cafes, but 111  people being censored.  111 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  111 million people being censored.  And that's another point.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, I don't know.  And if you think about it, 111 is very impressive, but you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  also have to think China has a population of one plus  billion.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he's right about that.  You know, I was in China for three weeks this summer.  It's very clear the Chinese government has soured on the  internet and is doing everything they can to slow  penetration.  As they should.  The internet is democratic.  Yeah.  They can control it to a point.  And so they love the cell phone.  They are loading everything into that cell phone because  they know that with the cell phone, its surveillance is much  easier.  There's just two carriers in China.  And so, but it was surprising to me how much the brakes are put  on the internet and how they're moving towards.  They'll pass this up anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even with the brakes on, they're going to pass this up.  Oh, granted.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just think though that that may distort them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the long run, I think if you do it at a price.  Distort their experience of the net.  You do it at a price.  If it's used through the cell phone.  In the long run, the internet will be open there too.  It has to be.  It has to be.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's just inevitable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like water.  What?  Alkaline water.  It penetrates.  Do we want to move to another story?  Did you see the brouhaha over Apple?  The brouhaha over Apple's Intel commercial?  It's insulting.  I think it's insulting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's actually a rip-off of a record, of a video by a company

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  called the Postal, by a band called the Postal Service.  It looks exactly the same.  Now, it's the same director.  But Postal Service, the band says, we're upset.  It's recently come to our attention that Apple Computer's  new television commercial for the Intel chip features a  shot-for-shot recreation of our video.  By the way, their music is not so hot.  But the video was very good.  Made by the same filmmakers.  You like?  Postal Service is the same guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a side project that he did with...  Oh, it's Death Path for Cutie?  It's this synthopop crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whatever.  I can't get into it.  What else you got to tell us, old timer?  Made by the same filmmakers responsible for the original.  We did not approve this commercialization.  What else we got to talk about?  Come on.  Apple should be really upset with that director.  Here's what I think happened.  Somebody at Apple, probably Steve, saw the video, said,  hey, that's a great idea for an Intel.  Hire the director.  And Postal Service is just miffed because they didn't  have an exclusive.  They should have been in the thing.  N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it just a number?  N.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's about time.  600 megabits.  And it's now on its way to approval.  We're going to see it this year.  Seems to work.  No, not really.  Have you played with it at all?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a heck of a lot better than what we have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been using the pre-end stuff for a while,  and it works great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it is a multi-end.  It's MIMO.  That seems to be the key.  But 600 megabits?  Yeah.  How many channels is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What are you going to connect it to?  Is that a second?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're using one channel.  That's every second.  Every NARTSIN.  Only one channel.  They invented this thing where you can send the same  signal on one channel on top of each other.  It reminds me a little bit of wave division multiplexing  in the fiber.  They had so much capacity, and somebody invented  this other technology.  There was more.  That turned half the country dark because you don't need  all this fiber.  Because it multiplied it by 16.  This multiplies it by, I don't know how many radios  they can run at once, but I know they do three now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about interference with...  That's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've got the interference thing busted.  There's no problem with interference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So if you've been using a pre-end with the...  Is it the atheros chipset that's the good chipset?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's the Ergo.  So if you've been using a pre-end with the Ergo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  that's pretty much what you're going to see with the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The atheros, all of them are going to be using  the same technology.  But right now, Ergo, the ones that are out there,  including the Belkin and some of these others,  you can get those, and they're running at 240.  I think there's a 400...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if we get this kind of bandwidth,  then are we just going to get movies over?  I mean, what are we going to shove through these pipes?  Say we're going to get 600 megabits,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which of course is optimal.  It'll be probably more like 300, who knows what.  What are we getting now?  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have your home network that everyone wants  to put all their media in one single storage  and then serve it up.  Yeah, because you only need 10 megabits per second

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to run HDTV across the... over the wire.  My ISP, I'd be lucky to get 6 megabits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What am I going to do with 300?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not saying within the home.  You can have this lash up, and then you can have...  You can do some download and play off the internet  for IPTV purposes, and then you can route it  right to your television set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Dane, SonicNet was very early into the wireless.  I know you were doing wireless to downtown Santa Rosa.  You're now wiring some of the communities  in Northern California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've had an aggressive try-it-out wireless policy.  Will you move to N?  We haven't yet.  We've certainly experimented with some N products.  How about WiMAX?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that a better solution for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, right now, there's been some certification changes  in WiMAX recently in the 3.5 frequency,  which is not available in the U.S.  They're talking about 5.8 products  that will be supported in the U.S. late this year.  So we haven't seen anything  except license frequency stuff in the WiMAX.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's going to be the way it's going to be.  Well, and I think that the challenge,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  as the telecom companies and as the cable companies  have woken up to the potential of the internet  and sort of seized control, so to speak,  of that last mile, internet providers  are really seeking to find other ways,  and wireless is one of those potential outlets.  So we've tried one technology after another after another  and found that many of them don't work.  And you're talking about the potential of Wi-Fi,  and why isn't there wireless internet everywhere  and it ought to be free?  You'd have to have an enormous mesh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a real problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and we've tried mesh products  where we deploy equipment on a light pole  on every city block, and it doesn't work very well.  So some of the problems are the technical barriers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so we talk about Philadelphia,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and we talk about the technology that they're going to be using,  and I haven't seen this stuff really work  in a real city environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You played with the pre-end stuff, though.  What do you think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've played with the pre-end stuff,  and it seems to me that...  It gets more distance, as Mike's saying.  Yeah, MIMO fixes a lot of the issues,  and it isn't about getting 600 megabits  when you're three feet away from the base station.  It's being half a block, two blocks away,  in a cafe behind a brick, earthquake,  seismically reinforced wall,  and still getting two megabits,  and still getting zero.  Is there a solution to that?  Well, so the MIMO fixes a lot of that,  and it takes advantages of the problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or it's actually MIMO, I think.  MIMO, MIMO.  You say MIMO, I say MIMO.  The MIMO technology would be interesting  if they made it put it on top of WiMAX.  That's...  It's called MIMAX.  MIMAX, MIMAX, I don't know.  It just seems to me, I don't know, these names are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why MIMO-MAX?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's an important point you raise,  because I think there's been this growing sense  that there's some conspiracy  that's keeping Wi-Fi from public places,  but you're saying it's really a technical issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The technology is not mature,  it's a wide area, in my opinion,  in our testing.  And when you're talking about a cafe,  and you're putting a good access point in a cafe  back-fed with a T1 or DSL circuit,  it works great in the cafe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are we talking about?  It seems to me,  these are milliamp radios, generally speaking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With high-gain antennas,  we're talking about a full watt of output.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're using a full watt with a big antenna.  Yeah, and the trouble there is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll be right back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've got a little too much alkaline water.  It's very interesting.  The trouble with that then is  in addition to an amplified output,  you've got what you call a big ear.  You're hearing a lot of noise in the environment.  So your noise floor goes up in every microwave oven  in three city blocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How does that actually...  One thing I've always wondered about,  you have all these wireless products.  Aren't you just making a huge EM cloud  that someday is going to interfere with...  It's amazing that it works at all.  But it does.  Someone's pacemaker just goes...  Some guy says,  your broadband wireless access  is responsible for giving my son

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a heart attack.  It's a lot more power output than a walkie-talkie.  Much, much lower power output than a cell phone.  Certainly a cell tower puts out a ton of power.  And so the Wi-Fi standard says  these power levels are very low.  The antenna gain is very low.  So there are standards  that are compared to some of the other  sources of EMF.  It's a really small number.  Especially as you look at  high-tension overhead lines

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  at hundreds of thousands of volts.  This is another thing that baffles me.  But I've noticed there's been more and more  products that are power line  distribution systems.  In fact, Netgear just came out  with one that supposedly is 85 megabits per second  and you plug it in the wall  and then your next door neighbor...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This internet over power lines.  BIP or something like that?  BPL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Big issues with that.  The hams are hating BPL.  Because it sends all kinds of radiation through...  It sends it into a big old transmitter.  And so you have to notch it  for the frequencies that you want to protect.  Now we saw a demo at the FCC labs.  I think you were with me, weren't you David  when we went to the FCC labs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was working on Coffrel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We saw a demo where they notch it  and so forth.  And Michael Powell was a big fan of BPL.  But I notice that BPL has not really...  I think it's just a way to spy on the public.  We need...  But honestly we do have to wire the rural areas.  It's becoming more and more of an issue.  If you're in an urban area  you've got two or three good choices for high speed internet.  If you're in a rural area  you're lucky to get 19-2 dialogue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Developing countries in Africa  and elsewhere are looking at this  internet on power lines.  Because at least they have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm convinced that the real reason  for internet on power lines, why the technology  continues to be developed  is because at some point in the future  all our appliances, the refrigerator,  the washing machine will all be hooked up  with an...they'll all have IP addresses  and they'll be hooked to the power line  and then you'll have advertisements on your washing machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you better not buy hummus because they'll be at your door.  But you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's been the great hope of the electricity companies  and the kitchen of the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the appliances will be talking to us  trying to sell us stuff spying on us.  And it'll be all brought to you by Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google refrigerator sense.  It's the newest product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Think about it.  Free refrigerator if you let it broadcast ads  in your kitchen.  Okay, okay.  A lot of people are going to take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Philip K. Dick was right. Remember he wrote that story about

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ads on every surface.  If it tells you a new ad each morning  every time you put in toast, it says...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're going to be crappy toasters and refrigerators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You never know.  We get some good stuff for free now.  You're absolutely right though.  They've used the cover of conservation.  They want to be able to shut off these things  if you leave the house and forget to.  Yeah.  But you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why would the power company  support a technology that allows you to use less power?  I don't think so.  No, they could turn it on while you're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole house is all lit up.  Who left the lights on?  I tell you kids to turn off the lights.  That's the security service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, someone was outside so we decided to turn on all the lights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do think actually that really  what's going on with BPL is that the power companies  are lobbying very hard to become  internet service providers.  We've got copper too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everyone wants money.  That's really what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the third conduit.  It's the third conductor into the house.  You've got your coax for your TV.  You've got your traditional pots voice.  And then you've got your power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the bug that the FBI planted.  It's not a big conduit.  It's been very difficult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember I went to Kansas City 10 years ago  and they were talking about getting rid of the meter readers.  There's a lot of products like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it just hasn't taken off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of places that do have the radio based stuff.  One more story and then we've got to leave.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long have we been going?  Too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you didn't go to the bathroom.  We've been gone so long that you went to the bathroom.  I think the show is nearly over.  Digital music sales tripled in 2005.  1.1 million people have been watching the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The music sales tripled in 2005.  $1.1 billion up from $380 million in 2004.  That's weird to me because it seemed to me that these guys said  that people only wanted to steal music online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now what they're saying is they're declaring victory.  Who's they?  The record industry.  They're saying, well, look, because what happened was

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  we've got 20,000, count them, 20,000 lawsuits out there now  in 17 countries.  And that has cast a spell on the record industry.  And that's the only way to get that money.  And that's the only way to get that money.  And that's the only way to get that money.  There are a number of other music stores that are doing  the same thing.  I mean, we've got the Carat where they're selling  music from the same countries.  And that has cast a chill on piracy.  And that's the stick.  We've got the Carat which is iTunes Music Store,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which is number one, but a number of other music stores.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've got a good way for people to safely buy music.  But overall music sales are way down.  Did you hear about the kids at Amherst and University of  Massachusetts story just broke before we started the show  which is they're suing, they got sued by the RIA  for some $100,000 plus.  They're blaming them.  It's your fault, Grokster, you did it to me.  I'm going to do one guy in particular,  there's some guy that was on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm waiting for somebody to sue World Poker Tour  because he was going to college, then he got hooked on poker  and now it's all over.  Dane, you must get regular letters from the RIA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, we don't.  No, we don't.  And I was actually real surprised by that  because I had expected that we'd begin to see those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been told by some cable companies  that, yeah, we get a letter, we then contact the customer  and we say, you know, we've been asked to tell you to shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was once contacted by Comcast in an error,  it seemed to me, but yeah.  But I think this area is more sophisticated.  You're a suit?  No, I was sent a letter saying,  you should explain why this happened.  What happened?  As you know, I can barely use email,  so I was quite puzzled what could have happened.  Maybe my neighbor Linksys was doing it.  Maybe the Bay Area is so sophisticated.  They know how to hide better.  Yeah, or they don't.  No, actually, to clarify,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we're not seeing lawsuits and subpoenas.  We are seeing a lot of DMCA notices.  You do get those.  We get those constantly.  And we have a full-time employee who's just dealing with that.  You're kidding.  Squashing spam.  Give us an example of how that works.  Well, you know, you have someone who's running a P2P application at home  or a web server at home  and the IP address is ours,  so we receive a notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What would he have on there that they would be objecting to?  Is it blogger?  No, movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, geez, excuse me, I gotta go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's where the $30,000 came from.  It's software, it's movies, it's music.  And they're saying, take this off your servers.  And the way that DMCA has written,  it's not on our servers, we're a conduit,  and we're not required to provide any information  about the subscriber,  it's not on our network.  So we send a courtesy notice to the customer.  There's some sniffing around happening here  and maybe the next thing might be a subpoena.  But the response to the sender is  I'm sorry, we don't have any information on this person for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you haven't yet received a letter saying  we're going to sue, we have a John Doe lawsuit or subpoena.  No, we haven't seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I were to put up, I mean,  I've started copying movies  when I rent them.  Home use.  Now let's say I would turn around  and offer that on a website.  How quickly,  how many hours or minutes or days  would it take for them to shut me down?  Just hypothetically, you know.  Just hypothetically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We see 20,000 lawsuits,  there are hundreds of millions of people,  it's like lightning striking.  No, but what does he think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's got to be more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you a story,  we had a customer on our network  who had a  4 enhanced DSL lines,  6 megabits each,  which we sell that circuit for $49.95 a month,  they're running their business on this,  and their function was to scour the web  for copywritten content  for their partners.  To download to steal?  No, they're the police,  so they are out there scouring the internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for people sharing this content.  What content?  I just decide,  hey, I'm going to distribute Lord of War.  How quickly will they shut me down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it depends on how widely  it's distributed.  If lots of people link to you,  they're going to find you sooner.  The more people are downloading,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the more people are linking to your mom, it seems unlike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's so widespread,  I think you're seeing,  even with 20,000 lawsuits,  it's one in a million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like to know what the real numbers are.  I can tell you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we look at net flows,  we look at protocols flowing across our network,  and I can tell you that  BitTorrent and Usenet NNTP  are by far the two largest  bandwidth pigs.  And people are downloading movies from that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Shame on them.  Movies, porn, wares, and...  Twitter.  They're on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is one of these paradoxes,  because you see the legal business  and the illegal business zooming.  Because DVD sales have just gone through the roof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They haven't heard them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're downloading music from  Peer to Peer.  They're downloading Usenet stuff from...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing is DVDs, they've been smart enough  to actually drop the prices, so...  They're cheap, and you get more?  It's cheaper to buy the thing,  rather than sit around for half a month  waiting for the rest of the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The basement of the Capitol building  in West Virginia,  they discovered an entire  piracy operation down there.  $83,000 worth of computers  purchased by the state of West Virginia.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't they only have like 14 movies?  It was very small.  But they were making a lot of copies.  Very scandalous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In the basement of the Capitol building.  They had 14 movies? They would just...  Crank it all out?  I got 23 on a hard disk in my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can vouch for the West Virginia $83,000 worth of computers.  Was it really 14 movies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a small quantity of movies.  Amazing. That were very popular movies.  Were they porn movies, or were they first run movies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was a state employee

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  who had had enough clout  to requisition $83,000 worth of computers  and to get an office in the basement  of the West Virginia Capitol building  to do this.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a guy with some hobbies.  Well, cojones, that's the word.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think with that, we should probably wrap this up.  One more story, which I think is relevant to us.  Pardon me?  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was that story about  the German Wikipedia getting shut down  because of the hacker's name getting revealed.  His last name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's ridiculous. His parents sued.  The kid's dead.  He passed away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Passed away would be the polite phrase.  Because of Wikipedia? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was an article about him.  Because he was a hacker.  Revealed his last name. His parents were unhappy.  They said, we don't want our son to be remembered like this.  So we were sued Wikipedia.  By the way, in Germany, it's Vickypedia.  And they actually,  the German judge, temporary restraining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very different free speech rules in Germany.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't do comparison ads there either.  Really?  You can't do? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow. That's wrong.  We're the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're number one.  Who is Colonel Clink here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We should mention that this show is listened to in 43 nations.  Many of them around the world.  I used to drive a German car.  Used to drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it Tvitt?  Tvitt is how USA says it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The last story was that  Amazon is going to do its own TV show with Bill Maher.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is, I think this is the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this going to be a tech show to compete with us?  As long as it's not a tech show, I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think of Bill Maher?  Do you have an opinion on Bill Maher?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He used to be funny.  He's not so funny anymore.  He seems bitter.  That's what I was going to say.  He sounds and looks like someone who's bitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just look at his face and it's a little...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'd like to see Bill Maher and Dennis Miller in a cage match.  With John Daly doing the play by play.  Alright.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now John Daly, I love. Bill Maher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The guy you want to watch is John Stewart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John Stewart's the king, isn't he?  How do real journalists feel about John Stewart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They like him.  I think more the problem is that  he's really genuinely angry about  what's happening to this country.  And so he's sort of been pushed from comedy to despair.  Stewart is just a gifted comedian.  Very bright.  He's got his biases.  But he has a real intelligent critique in the media.  He's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And he's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know, you can get away with a lot if you're funny.  He's been working for so long trying to find himself.  He's at the top of his game.  He should actually be on a network  making...  I'm sure he's making a good one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that all?  Well, you know...  There's local anchors making a mill.  That's sad.  That's not sad.  So five years...  He should be making what Leno's making.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He should be making like 14 to 20.  His opening monologue often has echoes of Carson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're old enough to remember Johnny Carson.  He was quite political.  And during the years of...  Stewart's the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Letterman's lost it.  He should be getting the Letterman-Leno money.  And he said he's getting Conan and brought money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well that's because he's on cable.  He probably has more downloads.  He gets a lot of stuff.  We used to be on cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We couldn't even stay on cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So John Stewart has a bad agent then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no. That's good money for cable.  I don't know. Look at Dave Chappelle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They offered him how much he was on cable.  That Chappelle money could be promotional.  I've never been convinced that that was a real deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe Stewart's making more.  I just read it was a million.  Maybe he's making 20.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, come on the show.  Talk about it. We love you, babe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And buy a pickup dinner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We need some of it.  Did you not like the Indian food we got?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Indian food was okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I just want more.  John was complaining because we had bread-y sandwiches.  So we got Indian food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John got all excited about my coffee, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did he bring coffee?  No, he brought one of these new, it's a cup you can buy at Safeway or some other store, a good store.  And you squeeze it and it heats up and it makes you a hot cup of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's that cost?  That's what is a Wolfgang Puck thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got to bring over the Nokia thing, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I want to see the Nokia thing.  Unbelievable.  Are we out of time?  We can edit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you buy this and you squeeze it and it heats up.  Don't spill that on your computer.  It's Wolfgang Puck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Just like Wolfgang, he's got a button on the bottom, too.  All the Twits drink Wolfgang Puck instant espresso.  Just push the button and the can is hot.  Does it work like those Insta Hot Packs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is nice.  You break in the two chemicals and make something.  How hot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's one use only.  What I find striking about this is in third world countries, they don't have refrigeration.  Here we have coffee in a can, you flip it over, you push the button, five minutes later you've got coffee at 148 degrees.  Tastes great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about a cooling one, one that pushes the button and turns it into a cold?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a lot more difficult.  It's a thermos kill.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've got the room heated to 72.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Inside the 72 degree room we've got a refrigerator that keeps our coffee cool at 32 degrees so that we can take the can out of the refrigerator, press the button and heat it to 148 degrees.  Now that's technology!  This is very cool.  This is Nokia's, is this the i70?  What do they call this?  It's an internet tablet.  But it's smaller than your typical tablet.  What's it running on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It runs Linux.  It does Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It will also sync up with your Bluetooth phone.  So this is not a phone at all?  No, it's not a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's from Nokia though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can pair it up with your cell phone that supports EVDO or GSM.  And that's what they want you to do.  You know, it's kind of funny because we browse the web on our little blackberries and whatnot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's just one to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But aside from that it's pretty similar.  What's the resolution?  Oh, here show it to the audience.  No, no, go ahead.  It's a little bit smaller.  So you like it?  Well, I just got it today.  It's $400 or $500.  Can you watch flash animations?  I have no idea.  You know, it just showed up about three hours ago.  UPS showed up today.  This is brand new.  They just started shipping these things.  And I wanted to try it because we've got these Wi-Fi initiatives.  And we're talking about Wi-Fi coverage.  And we've got a speaker too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It plays music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I want to know what's working and what isn't.  And so this seemed like a good way to test the Wi-Fi.  What happens if you drop it?  It's a good question.  These worked a little too long in the ZD labs.  You can drop this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is actually concrete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's amazing.  Well, the thing that activates it is quicklime.  Which is what makes concrete get hot.  So now it's hardened?  Who knows?  You're not supposed to open it up.  But in the bottom there's this.  This is exactly what's wrong with America right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Talk about waste landfill.  Holy moly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure is cool though.  One time use cup of coffee.  One time use cup of coffee.  It's got every environment.  So there's nothing in it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it's concrete, can't you recycle that?  Just shred the outside and take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if Wolfgang, if you want to advertise on the show, we'll take it all back.  Can we take a bunch of these and build a house?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, the fact that we talked about, we should have a few cases of these coming in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think about how much concrete we use in this society.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what this is going to be.  You save the canes and you build buildings.  This is the next building material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not concrete per se, but quicklime.  I think you might be right.  Yeah, it'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can make a can house.  Powered by OnTech.  And is this the first time it's been used on the?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On the Twitch show, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never heard of it.  We do something similar, but it's more like the hot packs.  They have to say, do not microwave, because it's some nitwit.  Right.  But I'm not sure if it's the same chemical.  It's not used in the can, but maybe it's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it was pretty hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was, it was very hot.  And actually, the nice thing about this is you sleep in, you're in a rush, you're leaving the house.  You have these in your glove box in your car.  They keep forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little decadent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Truly, we live in a garden of Eden.  We do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A garden of coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're a coffee society.  Look how much Starbucks is worth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I can get the TV dinner that automatically cooks when I peel it open.  I'm sure you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sure they're going to come out with chili and soup.  Who the heck?  MREs, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, we have to run.  And of course for airing this week on Tech.  We really appreciate that.  Of course, Bob Heil for our beautiful mics.  I love my microphone.  You like my microphone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd still like to get one for the Skype broadcast.  We've got to get one for you.  And the UCM audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  It's a great book.  It's about multicultural identity in the new world economy.  And I've been writing a lot for the San Francisco Chronicle as well.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All about mongrels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of mongrels, we want to thank Roger Chang.  Geez, thanks.
