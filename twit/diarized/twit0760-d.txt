Transcript:  Well I was actually supposed to first I was going to go to London for the weekend.  Because it was actually significantly less expensive to fly to London and then fly to Zurich.  And on Friday morning as I was about to leave for the airport.  The government of Switzerland said that all events with more than a thousand people would be canceled.  And that included our event.  So we had to immediately cancel.  And so I am here instead of in Switzerland.  It's just as I've always said.

Transcript:  Coronavirus is well let's do coronavirus.  We've started every show for the last two weeks talking about coronavirus.  But it is a big deal.  F8 the Facebook Developers Conference was just canceled.  The GDC the Game Developers Conference postponed till the summer.  Microsoft had pulled out a lot of companies had pulled out.  Wow.  Actually I have this is how fast it moves.  I have a story here on our rundown saying GDC moving forward is planned.  Wow.

Start time: 336.82
End time: 347.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It really is hard to keep up with the cancellations postponements.  We had someone at RSA just last week.  So you know it's it's really changing on a day by day basis.  We went to RSA.

Start time: 349.00
End time: 378.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I felt like it was a life.  It was a death defying act actually.  But I don't know if it's hard.  This is the problem.  Everybody seems fine.  It doesn't seem I mean there are some people very sick.  Right.  A fellow died in Washington Snohomish our first United States fatality due to coronavirus.  But then we're also hearing people like Bill Gates say that this might be the once in a century pathogen we've been waiting for.  He wrote that in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Start time: 380.29
End time: 436.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well it is interesting too because at this point this is why I get frustrated with.  I mean I understand the cancellations.  I understand people are wanting to be safe and I support that.  However as someone who with disclosure has traveled basically for the last six weeks I've been international almost every week and I've had a couple of trips.  I had my trip to Singapore was canceled although I still ended up transiting through and my Zurich trip was just canceled.  So I've been in a lot of airports and I don't want to minimize anything with what's happening.  However because we now see that it is spreading beyond people who've just had direct contact with people who've traveled to me it seems like at this point like the whole containment strategy has failed.  Thanks a lot Italy.  Like I'm going to actually blame you blaming Italy for this.  Well I'm going to blame them for the containment issue.  They were they did not when they had their first patient they did not follow any standard protocols at all for protecting the hospital.

Start time: 436.50
End time: 440.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in fact some of the illnesses in the US are from Italy.

Start time: 441.45
End time: 501.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  Well what happens is because Italy is in the EU and it's in the Shenzhen zone you don't have to cross it across borders is much much easier.  Right. So at this point I mean like I'm not a doctor.  People can disagree with me but I feel like the containment thing we've failed.  It is not contained.  So part of me I'm kind of looking at OK no matter where you are unless you want to stay you know as a hermit inside your home and not have any contact with anyone the likelihood like I live in King County Washington where we now have six cases and the first US fatality it's like am I any safer in terms of exposure if I stay at home or if I travel someplace right.  Right. Like at this point I feel like the containment is is it's been breached.  So I don't know. There are I understand you know cutting down some of the travel stuff but at the same time it seems like this is just going to get worse and worse.  And we've we've passed the point where simply limiting people from traveling is going to really do anything to stop this.

Start time: 503.08
End time: 527.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh this is the other problem of course is that the epicenter of this China is where everything we use is made.  So factory closings have affected. In fact I've heard people say if you're going to buy a computer a smartphone if you can buy anything get it now.  Because there's going to be shortages. I don't know. But the problem is we just it doesn't seem like we know it's all kind of a.

Start time: 529.00
End time: 607.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the that's the hard part. You know I was listening to the radio on the way in and they were talking about community spread here in the US and they were trying to link people that have been tested positive for the disease to each other or two places they've been.  And that's proving hard to do because several of them now don't have direct connection to travel internationally.  So I think there's just a lot we don't know. So like you were talking about earlier Leo with Bill Gates you know it could be something that is like a SARS, a MERS or Ebola.  Bill's comparing it to the 1918 flu pandemic.  Or it could be that we just there isn't enough data I think in terms of because you know like you said the number out of the numbers out of China can be maybe a little bit unreliable.  So we don't know actually how high the death rate is. We don't know necessarily how high you know the infection rate is how many people recover.  So it's it's too early. There's so much uncertainty to kind of know how bad it's going to get.  And you know it's not just computers. It's not just iPhones. It's not just electronics.  Lots of things are made in China. Medications you know medical devices like the mask shortages that you know everybody has talked a lot about.  A lot of that's made in China too.

Start time: 608.06
End time: 637.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah actually the the Surgeon General tweeted. This is how we're getting our information now folks.  The Surgeon General tweeted for God's sake stop buying masks.  He literally said the masks aren't going to help you from keep you from getting it.  And by by by buying all these masks we're keeping it from important medical personnel who do need the masks when they're dealing with coronavirus patients.  So so the word has gone forth from the Twitter.

Start time: 638.00
End time: 640.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stop buying masks.

Start time: 641.14
End time: 716.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't even reach the people. Say again.  You know I've gone into full prepper mode so I feel a lot different than everyone else here.  I'm avoiding large crowds. I'm trying not to take the subway. I have stocked up on food this weekend.  And just this morning you know you mentioned the Spanish flu.  I read an interesting data point about how the Spanish flu mortality rate was at about 2 percent which is roughly the same as what they're estimating for the coronavirus.  And in one situation you know people were ignoring you know people were were saying that that they wanted to avoid hysteria and that they wanted to go about their lives in a regular manner.  And so people in Philadelphia attended I think a parade and and what ended up happening at this at this public event I believe it was a parade you know was that like 12000 12500 people ended up contracting the Spanish flu.  You know many of those people and 2 percent died 2 percent right.  And 2 percent. Yeah I guess when I read that this morning I decided that it was time to start buying some non-perishable goods and not go to any parades.  Well and I mean in New York it's hard to avoid crowds.  Right. So you know St. Patrick's Day is coming up.  You think there'll be a parade.

Start time: 718.04
End time: 720.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know I'm not going to it.

Start time: 720.00
End time: 737.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And and and you know I'm not I haven't bought a medical mask yet but but I do think that there is reason for concern because you know I just don't trust that the government is actually testing people at this point.  I don't feel like there's a there's a real urgency to test people.

Start time: 737.20
End time: 753.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we don't have we don't have enough tests.  That's another problem.  The CDC screwed up the tests.  They screwed up. They didn't do it.  Yeah they they stopped.  They didn't work on it and they had the opportunity to collaborate with other countries.  Oh no no no we got this ourselves.  We got this ourselves and then are behind because.

Start time: 754.61
End time: 759.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you a prepper Michael?  No in most cases I'm not.  What's a prepper? Tell everybody what a prepper is.

Start time: 760.24
End time: 803.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A prepper is I guess someone that that anticipates apocalyptic doom or is kind of as preparing for the worst.  And and and you know usually when you say prepper it's someone that expects the world to end imminently or for there to be you know.  The zombie apocalypse starts tomorrow.  Yeah exactly exactly.  So in this case you know I'm not a prepper in the traditional sense.  I don't think that that we're on the verge of a you know of war or anything like that.  But but I do think that the coronavirus spread is a real concern.  I think that all all leading experts say that it's only a matter of time before cases start showing up in the US.  I feel like we're getting there.  Yeah we're getting there.  Community infection is happening.

Start time: 805.00
End time: 807.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah and this is a you know it's a tech issue.

Start time: 808.64
End time: 831.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a tech and health issue and unfortunately you know I that there isn't enough testing being done.  So it's up to the onus is on each individual to take the necessary precautions.  So for me that meant buying non-perishable goods making sure that I'm ready for you know I don't necessarily think that there will be a lockdown in New York.  But I want to be.  I wouldn't want to be in Brooklyn right now.

Start time: 832.38
End time: 837.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that yeah I could see them closing the bridge.  Yeah.

Start time: 838.91
End time: 841.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No no no no.  That will happen.

Start time: 842.30
End time: 843.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know why not.

Start time: 844.78
End time: 855.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well you look at what happened in China but we're a completely different system here right.  You know exactly.  You know in China they locked down cities larger than New York and basically turned the streets into ghost towns.

Start time: 856.42
End time: 874.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's interesting because we were able to see what the authoritarian regime in China was able to do with the help of technology very early on here.  They were able to do things nobody's been able to do it before.  Things like put an app on your phone that says if you've been exposed because they know where you've been and everybody else has.  Yeah you're right.  We're not China.

Start time: 875.22
End time: 968.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No we're not.  Thank goodness.  And in fairness I don't know if we actually can say because China has been so opaque about this.  If if those actions have actually you know stopped the spread right.  Like because China is not going to be transparent about what the situation is actually on the ground.  Now I think you could look to places like Singapore and potentially like like South Korea and you could say Singapore especially as a place where they are also going to be a little bit more shall we say to tell totalitarian.  And also are fairly transparent especially given what happened with with them in SARS.  They've been very transparent about the cases and I have a lot more trust in the information they're releasing versus what China is.  But again I mean it's like you could you could make the argument OK this is stopping the spread and this is stopping kind of the contagion at the same time.  That's not the country we live in and I'm glad for that.  So unless it's also probably too late.  Well this is my point.  It's like OK so I live in I live in I live in Washington state.  I live in King County which is where it is very close.  It is actually I think it is.  I believe it is.  So like one of my colleagues first fatality was yes.  And and like one of my colleagues lives in Snohomish and like a good friend of mine like it's a lot of people who live there commute you know to Redmond or to Seattle or whatever.  So I live where more cases are getting discovered right.  This is the reality.  The reality is is that also like we live like the city that I live in there lots of people who work at Amazon and Microsoft and Google and Facebook.  And they're all traveling.

Start time: 969.00
End time: 973.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazon and Google have both cut down on international travel.  Apparently so has Microsoft.

Start time: 974.80
End time: 1019.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well we cut down on non-essential to China and to Iran and to I believe South Korea for other places so far and maybe Italy is now joined the list.  I don't know other places it hasn't.  But any places that have like if there's like a government ban or something then then we're not going there unless it's essential.  But the thing is is because this can persist.  They were saying two weeks although a genome test that the New York Times reported today tracked the I think that the teenager in in King County in Mill Creek who got the virus.  They said that it looked like you know it had existed for a week.  So it's possible that you know might have actually been around go back to six weeks which would mean that this is you know maybe lasting longer than we thought.

Start time: 1020.06
End time: 1045.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just to put this in perspective we have about 200,000 people listen to this show.  If every one of them let's say only half of them got it.  That means that 2000 people would die who are listening right now.  That's a staggering number.  It's two percent sounds small.  But if you put it in that perspective if we lost 2000 listeners.  That's that's horrific.  That's awful.  No it's terrible.  You extrapolate that out to 350 million 330 million in the US and the global population.

Start time: 1049.10
End time: 1052.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It really is a staggering number of people.  Right.

Start time: 1053.02
End time: 1073.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean if you're if you're a Samsung.  I just don't know.  I just don't know.  Like is it too late.  Right.  Because my point is like it's already spreading.  And for me personally I'm like OK my likelihood of getting like exposed to this is the same if I go into the office or if I get on an airplane.  So forget it.  I mean the same thing if you're in New York City it's like OK.  I think it's not time to.

Start time: 1074.06
End time: 1078.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a good time to panic.  Well I think it depends on who you are and who you're around too right.

Start time: 1079.02
End time: 1080.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think this is a perfectly fine time to panic.

Start time: 1081.68
End time: 1100.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know that we know that this virus is spreading.  Wouldn't you like to be a prepper too.  And we know that it exists in a few different cities in the US.  I think it's a perfectly fine time to panic.  I think that you know you don't have to.  I don't think you have to take necessarily like extreme measures but just like general precautions washing your hands often.

Start time: 1101.20
End time: 1118.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The good news is people listen to almost universally do it all alone.  Right.  You're not in the studio with me.  You're off in your little Skype isolated boxes.  This podcast and you listeners will survive.  The rest of the world may be gone.

Start time: 1119.44
End time: 1177.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know I think that's another part of the technology debate around events like this right.  Because you have technology like video teleconferencing tools for collaboration.  People will be working at home.  Why not.  A lot more companies allowing people to telecommute or relax relaxing the work from home rules without having to lose a ton of productivity.  So I think we're actually you know the future of work was changing already.  I'm you know it's not sort of morbid fascination.  I'm really curious to see how an event like this maybe accelerates that that change to more working from home a change to collaboration across distances.  How does that affect corporate real estate the real estate market.  Do companies need to have large offices if more and more people work from home.  What happens to transportation infrastructure.  There's all these kind of questions that we just don't know the answer to because we haven't had a big event in recent history like this.

Start time: 1177.20
End time: 1191.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah there are other people who might benefit from this.  This seems like a little creepy but I'm going to talk about it.  Who's going to benefit.  Samsung is already they're blaming.  Oops they're blaming the coronavirus for the crap sales numbers for the S 20.

Start time: 1192.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently they've sold seven seventy thousand units in the first day according to nine to five.  That's half what they sold of the S 10 in the first day.  And Samsung says well yeah it's a virus man.  It's a virus.  If our numbers go down over the next six months I'm blaming the virus.  Who else benefits from this work at home companies.  Right.  I mean I know the stock market is tanking.  Is there an opportunity here to buy some stocks right now that would benefit from isolation and world.  Netflix.  Pandemic.

We should be doing.  Yeah.  20 seconds 20 seconds.  Yes for 20 seconds do it the right way.  Dry your hands.  I didn't know this.  I always thought that like the dryer hands thing was just kind of like whatever.  No that the wet hands spread bacteria more incubate bacteria more so you should dry your hands.  So I was like OK.

The Spanish flu ultimately killed 50 million people worldwide including six hundred seventy five thousand people in the United States.  That is shocking and it's not.  And just because this happened in 1918 doesn't mean that it can't happen in 2020.  These things can spread and especially when we're not testing.  That's what Bill Gates is saying.

Transcript:  It's funny because we have more medical technology.  But at the same time maybe it's not like we only have one hundred thousand ventilators in the United States.  And so if it's spread like wildfire we would not be able to put enough people on ventilators.  We have antibiotics.  They didn't have those in 1918.  We also have air travel.  You know one of the reasons it spread in 1918 is because troops are coming home from World War One.  But nowadays everybody's everywhere.  And that's I mean that's that's why it's spreading so fast.  So I mean this is not a show.  We're not medical doctors and this is not a show.  Right.  Right.  And people should travel.

Like know that this is out there and do your best to stay informed because we have no idea how many cases of this exists in the U.S.  Right now. And I think that's what concerns me the most that we're not using the technology.  We're not using you know all of the advances that have been made since 1918 aren't really being put to use in this specific case.  And nobody wants to prepare for no.  Well wash your hands.

Transcript:  Get your flu shot.  Vaccinate your kids.  Like these aren't going to stop coronavirus.  But these all are going long way.  It's called public health.  Genuinely one of the things we haven't talked about is the reason why this this could be more pervasive is that over the last 20 25 years there's been this whole war on vaccination.  Which has left people with lower immunities and with with things like being able to mutate in ways and impact stuff.  And if you think that that doesn't have an impact on you know people being susceptible to certain types of infections or not like you're kidding yourself like you know to me this is just another science like vaccinate your kids.  Get your flu shot unless you have this sort of condition.  There are some people who do have conditions where they can't have a flu shot.  Get that.  Get your flu shot if you can.  Wash your damn hands.  You know get vaccinated.  And like if you are sick don't go into work you know and that's that's one of the big things too whether it's a cold or something else if you're coughing and sneezing like don't go in.

I said that's how I feel every morning.  What are you talking about?  How am I going to know?  Do not get your coronavirus information from the Plague Inc. app.  The folks at Plague Inc. said please it's just a game.  This is not how it works.  However the Chinese app stores have removed it.  Apple and Xiaomi have removed Plague Inc.  which is a great game about a plague eating the world.  And your goal by the way is to eat the world.  And then you know survive as the plague.  It's a fun game old game been around for almost 10 years I think.  But can't get in China anymore.  Weird right.  Because that'll stop it.  That'll fix it.  Oh my God.

There was a lot of controversy if you watch the press conference from the White House  yesterday about whether the officials from the CDC or the NIH were being muzzled.  They said they weren't.  So that's good.  But you know a lot of people are just scrambling for information and I think they're trying  to get anywhere they can.  Even if it's from a video game.  It is.  That's a testament to how little we know and how scared we are.

I was talking with Sam Ebbels-Samet our car guy.  He said there isn't an issue yet in the automotive markets but there is an issue in the automotive  markets.  But there in time might well be because many cars do have parts made in China.  So this is we're going to feel it one way or the other over the next few months.  I'm flying to St. Louis on Wednesday for a WWT event.  We're going to actually if you're a WWT customer ask your rep because we're going to do a panel  on the future of the cloud on Thursday.

I don't want to talk about viruses anymore.  It's depressing.  I hope you all are staying healthy.  You're washing your day.  Hands as Christina says and stay well because we can't afford to lose 2 percent of our audience.  That would be bad wouldn't it.  All right.  Let's talk a little bit about our sponsors.  Zip Recruiter got a great panel.  Christina Warren is here from Microsoft.  Bill Detweiler from Tech Republic.  Michael Nunez from Forbes.  Zip Recruiter is how we do our hiring.  I'm just thinking of how many of our members of our staff came to us from Zip Recruiter.  I know Ashley did.  So here's the issue.  When you are down a person, it's kind of like hockey.  When you've got a guy in the penalty box, the whole team suffers, right?  And if you're the person doing the hiring, in this case Lisa, she's working double time and  trying to hire, you need a good partner.  You need Zip Recruiter.  That's what we use.  And boy has it been a great thing for us.  No more multiple job sites.  No more stacks of resume.  No more confusing reviews.  Hiring can be easy.  And you just go to ziprecruiter.com slash twit to do it immediately.  When you post on ziprecruiter.com slash twit, your job goes to 100 of the world's best job sites.  But it doesn't stop there because Zip Recruiter has millions of current resumes on file.  People go to Zip Recruiter looking for work.  And what they'll do is they'll use their powerful matching technology to get their job done.  They'll use their powerful matching technology to look at those resumes, look at your job,  and then they will go out and actually invite people who qualify for your job,  which means you're going to get responses, in most cases,  four out of five employers get responses, quality candidates within the first day.  And that's been our experience.  When our bookkeeper quit, gave us two weeks notice, I remember vividly at breakfast,  Lisa says, oh no, I'm going to have to start doing the books again.  And I said, Zip Recruiter, Zip Recruiter, she posted it at breakfast, by lunch, we had,  she was great, she was looking at her computer, oh, oh, this person's great.  Oh, oh, here's another great.  It's amazing.  You can even add screening questions to your job listings so you can filter candidates.  And all of the resumes, all the applicants don't come to your phone or your inbox.  They go into the Zip Recruiter interface.  They reformat the resumes so you can scan them quickly.  They highlight the best candidates so you don't miss a good candidate.  So you're not overwhelmed.  It makes it very easy for you to look at your applicants and pick the right one fast.  I want you to try this.  It's really the best.  It's been a lifesaver for us.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit, ZipRecruiter.com slash twit, ZipRecruiter,  the smartest way to hire ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  This is from the Atlantic.  Your AirPods will die soon.  Actually, this is last year, but I just wanted to reiterate this as we get a new series of AirPods, AirPods Pro.  This is so depressing because they don't have any way to make these last.  So if you bought AirPods about two years ago, they've been out since when?

End time: 1923.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I gave my OG pair to my husband, and I don't know how good the battery is, but.  Your OG husband?  No, I gave my OG pair of AirPods, the ones I got in December of 2016.  Your husband is not an original gangster?

Start time: 1945.62
End time: 1974.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I gave him my original pair, and I bought the AirPods to the ones that had the wireless charger.  Those were then immediately upgraded, or I guess I got the AirPods Pro as soon as those went up for release.  So I only had that second pair for a few months.  So they're my backups, and then I use the AirPods Pros.  The original pair, the battery life is probably not great, but I mean, Grant didn't pay for them, so he can't complain.  So whenever they cease working, I guess that's when e-recycle or whatever.

Start time: 1988.18
End time: 2004.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, my thought would be that they could do a thing where they send them off to wherever they send things off, and they could do a repair that way, similar to, I guess, what they used to do with iPods.  So you could bring them in, pay a fee, exchange for a new pair that has like...

Start time: 2004.00
End time: 2010.06

Start time: 2016.08
End time: 2064.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's such a shame, though, that they do, that they can't do that with them.  It's so frustrating.  You know, they do it with hearing aids, they do it with other devices, but it's just, you know, a shame in our modern manufacturing process.  It's just cheaper to not do that.  I mean, let's be honest.  I mean, yes, it looks good.  The aesthetics is good.  They have, you know, sealed devices, have a higher IP rating, so they have less chance of getting dust, water, all kinds of gunk in them, things like that.  But it's just cheaper.  And when you're manufacturing millions of these small devices, if you can save a cent, two cents, half a cent, you're going to do that.  So now I would love to see us be able to replace the batteries in them and use them longer, or at the very least, like you said, Leo, at least ship them back and have someone else give them a second life.

Start time: 2065.54
End time: 2088.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the reason I bring this up, TechRadar got a leaked EU document.  Remember the EU just passed regulation suggesting that all chargers should be uniform to eliminate waste.  Apparently, a leaked EU doc suggests legislation that would force all new phones to have removable batteries.

And then if I was traveling or whatever, I didn't have to have a Mophie case or a charger.  I just take it to have to swap out the battery.  I think that's a great feature.  I think consumers would like that.  And by the way, those phones weren't noticeably thicker or heavier.  It was a disadvantage.

End time: 2193.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I like having.  But also, the way they change batteries is part of the reason that they're sealed is that you can put them in funky shapes and you can get more battery life.  I think that if the alternative is, OK, I have this battery that's replaceable, granted, but it's not going to last as long.  It's not just funky shapes.

End time: 2223.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Well, then it should make it easy to change batteries, too.  I've since started going to Apple about every year, year and a half to get my iPhone battery replaced because it does prolong the life of my phone.  And typically I don't need a new one, but it costs like, I don't know, 120 bucks, I think.  And so I just feel like that process should be cheaper.

Start time: 2224.05
End time: 2229.00

But normal people don't want to buy a new phone every couple of years.  They want to keep it longer.  Well, I think you saw Apple address some of this, right?  I mean, with their trade in programs.

So are they going to want a phone that maybe has a lower ecological imprint, you know, that is more eco-friendly, has some of these features like a replaceable battery that they a battery that they see is more eco-friendly.  I just don't know.  I mean, right now, for the people that are buying phones, they like the shapes.  They like the sizes.  They, you know, if they can take it into Apple and get a refreshed battery for 50 bucks every couple of years, that's great.  So I don't know.  But I am with you, Leo.  I miss the days when you could pop out a battery and put in a new battery.  Yeah.  You know, I've been taking, you know, on Tech Republic, I've been taking these things apart for a long time.  You know, we do a series on Tech Republic and our sibling site, CNET, cracking open.  And, you know, it's from my perspective, I also, you know, in a previous life was an engineer.  So, you know, it is possible to create thin devices.  Are they going to be as thin?  No.  Are they going to be maybe as sleek looking?  No.  But it is possible to do it.  It's just not as cost effective.

So that's one of the things we try to do is to tear it down or we put it back together.  Right.  I'm not one of those ones that just puts it in a blender and shreds it or takes it apart and wants to see if it's working.  I have broken a few things.  But, you know, I'm all with you.  I mean, I wish devices had replaceable batteries, especially the AirPods.  You know, I love my AirPods.  My daughter loves her AirPods.  But I hate the idea that you paid a couple hundred bucks.

If you're asked, if you're told, okay, this is now going to cost twice as much and be less powerful,  and you're going to still have to get a new one every couple of years, maybe even more frequently because it is less powerful.  I think the number of people who would actively spend more on less just because of the echo argument.  Yeah, Leo is right.  I don't have faith in people there.  I don't.  I think that you could maybe have a small niche for the fashion thing.  But Leo's absolutely correct.  It depends.

Transcript:  Well, and you have some other kind of global event, not to go back to what we were talking about earlier, that starts to put a cramp on global trade.  Right?  I mean, not all of these minerals exist in areas where these phones are manufactured.  You mentioned it with blood phones, Leo.  These minerals have to come from places that are susceptible to disruptions, whether they're pandemics or political or just other events that are unforeseen.  So there's a lot that goes into making these kind of phones that most people don't kind of see and can be disruptive.  So maybe like you said, Leo, maybe it's the science fiction story where you'll eventually have to mine the garbage dumps to recycle these phones.  And hopefully that's why I say e-waste the devices, right?  E-waste your AirPods and hopefully every bit of gold, every bit of neodymium, every bit of the precious metals, heavy metals that are in these things, it's stuff that doesn't have to be dug back up out of the ground.

Transcript:  John Steinbrenner paid to upgrade that part of the screen.  Christina Warren is also here from Microsoft.  She does developer relations.  She'd be in Zurich right now.  So we thank Coronavirus for letting us have you for this show today.  Our show is brought to you by Privacy.  It is a brilliant idea.  It's a brilliant idea.  In fact, a lot of credit card companies used to, they stopped doing it for some reason,  offer one time only numbers.  Privacy takes it one step further.  With Privacy.com, I can create a credit card that is either for one use only, stops working after one use,  or is locked into the merchant.  So for instance, I have an Amazon card and only Amazon can use that card.  I love this.  Whenever I buy anything online these days, I use Privacy.com.  No, it's impossible for somebody to get my credit card number and use it somewhere else.  They just can't.  You can also set a limit on it.  So Privacy saves me money by eliminating fraud.  It lets me take control of my finances.  I can set a spending limit.  If you do subscriptions or recurring payments, how many times have you forgot or such a pain to cancel,  you just let it go.  With Privacy, pause the card.  That's it.  They can't get any more money out of you.  You have to pause the card.  They have a new card sharing feature, which is really great.  If you have a family or you work on a team, you can easily and safely send someone a Privacy card  from the dashboard in just a few clicks, completely securely.  No copying, no pasting, no screenshots.  They don't even need a Privacy account to use the shared card.  You just click the share button when you view a card, enter an email address to share it to.  Privacy does the rest.  It's PCI DSS compliant, same security standards as your bank.  It's secured with strong encryption.  Your information at Privacy is encrypted and then they use split key encryption.  So different employees hold different parts of the key.  So no one employee can unlock it.  All that server information is absolutely secure.  Plus Privacy doesn't sell your data and you can hide your data from the merchant because Privacy lets you use any name,  any address, any zip code.  They don't care.  So you can buy something completely anonymously with Privacy.  You connect Privacy to your debit account or your checking account.  Now normally, I was using the free plan.  The free personal plan, you get 12 cards a month, secure merchant locked, single use, all those features.  That's a great deal.  But then I found out about the pro plan.  I pay 10 bucks a month.  I get everything in the free plan, but I also get 36 cards a month.  That's more than enough.  And I get 1% cash back.  And I use Privacy so much that's always more than the $10 a month.  So I make money that way.  When I found out about that, I said, oh, that's obvious.  I'm doing the pro account.  If you have a business or you have a team, the team's option, 25 bucks a month, you get 60 cards a month.  You also get a dedicated account manager and transaction limits tailored to your business needs.  I like it that they have these tiers.  It's how they make money.  And it means there's no temptation for them to sell our information or do anything else.  This is a really great company doing a great product, which I have been using for two years nonstop.  I have hundreds of Privacy cards.  Head to privacy.com slash twit.  Sign up for an account.  We're going to give you five bucks so that you use that address.  You can spend it on your first purchase.  This is for a limited time, but it's just a little thank you for telling him you saw it on our show.  Privacy.com slash twit.  We thank you, Privacy.  They've created a great product.  I use it all the time.  And I think you'll like it.  Privacy.com slash twit.  They browser extensions.  I have one on Firefox, one on Chrome.  Works on Brave or you can use the website or the app privacy.com slash twit.  Let's keep this on Apple for a little bit longer because they sent a shockwave through the web community by announcing that Safari is no longer going to consider certs valid if they're long term certs.  Anything more than 13 months will be considered invalid after September 1st.  I use two year certs because I don't want to have to redo the certs all the time.  Those will no longer be valid when they expire after September 1st.  This was a proposal that was voted down some months ago at the CA forum.  The certification authority browser forum.  But Apple decided to do it unilaterally.  Now, Bill, you probably cover this a little bit.  This is kind of an enterprise issue.  What it means is you're going to have to start using short term certs and you're probably going to want to use automation to automatically renew those certs.  We've seen many times people forgetting even a company like, I don't know, Microsoft just forgetting.  Yep, that happened.  Teams went down.  Teams went down.  Teams went down because somebody, you know, oh crap.  Is it the first of March?  Oh crap.  And they had to go.

Start time: 3126.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Honestly, even when you have it automated, which most people do have, even when you have it automated, if one cert someplace isn't part of that automation flow, when you're, you know, I mean, this is true for anything that's automated.  You see this with key rotation a lot too where a key won't get rotated because if one thing is an input in the automation string, the automation.  It's embarrassing when it goes down.  Yeah, it makes it worse because you assume that it's automatically going to be like renewed.  And if you forgot one thing, you know, it catches you off guard because you just expect that it's always going to get renewed.

Start time: 3161.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Bill, are you hearing from people on this?

Start time: 3164.00
End time: 3266.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's funny.  Enterprise IT has always been a complex process.  You know, automation makes some of it a little bit easier, but, you know, it is easy to forget about sort of these dates when you think everything is automated.  I haven't heard anything specifically other than, you know, from from our readers, other than really that, you know, the certificate process is pretty kind of, you know, it's like forgetting to buy your domain name.  Like if you're someone famous, if you're a website, oh, you forgot your registration is going to expire.  And then the other thing is that your users expect to happen on a regular basis.  So if you're in enterprise IT and you don't do that and it kind of fails, it's very embarrassing.  It can cost you money because everybody uses two years.  Everyone uses two year certificates.  Right. Right.  I mean, so because you don't want to have to be doing this on a regular basis like security patches and updates.  But you forget all you think.  Oh, it's really easy.  It's one certificate.  No.  So you might have multiple systems that are connected together.  One point of failure comes down.  So now I'll be interested to see let's be honest here about Safari.  Isn't the most used browser on the desktop.  But what's really more important here are all the mobile devices, all the iOS devices that this could affect.  So Chrome users, Edge users, people that aren't using Safari, they'll be okay.  But all those mobile devices, all those iPhones, iPads, everything like that, that's going to be affected by this.  So I'll be interested to see where this really kind of goes.  If Apple has that kind of clout, to kind of force people to start going to 13-month certs.

Start time: 3267.22
End time: 3279.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Safari has more than 50% market share on mobile because of iOS.  I think it's only 17% on desktop.  No website says, well, we don't need those 17%.  Just throw out those people.

Start time: 3280.20
End time: 3332.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and to Bill's point, it makes me think about the MDM space.  So like the mobile device management space.  Because even if you are saying, from an enterprise perspective, even if your users aren't using Safari on the desktop,  this could be the sort of thing where I would think that it would violate a lot of policies to say,  okay, if our website or other things are going to not have a certificate that expires at this point,  then there could potentially be like, okay, that Safari itself might let you still access something,  even if it says this is unsecure.  But you might have some policy on your mobile device that might say,  oh, no, we're not going to allow you to access insecure websites.  So I don't know.  This opens up interesting questions to see, I guess, how people will deal with this.  I mean, it's interesting they made this move even though the other groups said, no, we want longer term certs.  Yeah.

Start time: 3336.15
End time: 3516.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there is a good security reason for this.  The problem is there's no effective certificate revocation process.  So if a cert and this has happened, if somehow somebody gets a cert, it says IBM, but it's a hacker,  you can't easily say to all the certificate authorities, to all the browsers, oh, don't honor that one.  It's not really IBM.  There's no way to revoke that cert.  You have to wait till it expires.  So it used to be you could get certs for 10 years.  That would be kind of untenable.  Now it's two years is the longest.  It's going to be less than a year soon.  And I think ultimately they'd like to make it even shorter and shorter.  But understanding how much pain was involved, the CA browser folks said,  we don't want to do this just yet.  I talked to Steve Gibson about it on security now.  He said there is a way you could do revocation.  It's just that Google and Firefox, Mozilla and others just won't do this.  The certificate certification comes from OCSP.  And the way it would work normally is every time you go to a site, your browser would check OCSP to see if that cert was legit,  if it had been revoked, if it was a good cert.  OCSP would respond back saying, yes, it's a good cert.  You'd go to the site.  But even if this adds a second or two to loading a site, this is problematic.  No browser wants to do it.  A technology was invented called stapling, OCSP stapling, where the browser would periodically go out,  even if you weren't going to that site and just update the certs, check all the certs just to make sure.  That would eliminate that latency of going to the site, but it would involve more Internet traffic.  I'm not sure why Mozilla and Google and others aren't going along with OCSP stapling.  Steve's of the opinion it would have solved this problem.  I have a very weird conspiracy theory.  I think Google and Mozilla, Safari, I think the people who do this all wanted to shorten the length because it's a problem.  If you've got a hacker cert, there's no way to say don't trust that cert.  You got to wait until it expires.  So I think they all wanted to do this, but nobody wanted to take the heat for it.  So here's what I think.  They all got together in a parking garage and they drew straws.  Oh, and Apple got the short straw?  Short straw is going to do this unilaterally.  We can all go, oh, my God, that's a terrible idea.  And then everybody does it.  And I think Apple got the short straw.  I love it.  Because everybody says, look, if you're not going to do OCSP stapling, you got to shorten the term.  You just have to.  And eventually it's all going to be let's encrypt three month terms.  It'll be everything 90 days.  That's still too long for a hacker cert to be good, though.  They should do stapling.  I don't know why they don't.  There must be a technical reason for not doing that.  I just I don't know.  I'm sure that's not the case.  I just love the idea of them all.  I love that, too.  Trust, trust.

Apple infringed with its FaceTime and VPN on demand features in iPhone and iPad.  Apple lost was hit with a 440 million dollar damage suit.  They appealed.  It went all the way up to the Supreme Court.  The Supreme Court has now rejected Apple's appeal.  So I guess they're going to have to dig into that 207 billion dollar kitty.

I don't you know, I can't you know, I can't comment on it on specific this specific case  or anything on the merits of it.  But you know, I did read about this.  And so I guess during the litigation, Apple had asked for a tribunal from the US Patent  and Trademark Office to actually sort of review some of the patents that were in question  here.  And I think the tribunal actually ruled them as invalid or said that, you know, some of  them are invalid.  So Apple went back to the courts and said, well, hey, look, by the way, that's victory.

Transcript:  We were told when there was a patent troll going after podcasters and we sat down, we  hired counsel and they said, well, there is a thing you can do called I think it's an  inter partes appeal where you go to the US Patent and Trademark Office and say, would  you please re-examine this patent?  Right.  And they said, here's the risk.  If they re-examine it and affirm it, you're screwed because then the lawyer tells the jury.  And not only that, but these clowns went to the Patent and Trademark Office said, you're  get rid of this patent.  And they had Patent and Trademark Office said, no, no, it's a good patent.  You really lose then.  So we decided not to do it.  Fortunately, the Electronic Frontier Foundation did and they were able to successfully overturn  the patent trolls podcast patent.  In this case, Apple won.  As you point out, the patents were overturned, but then the Federal Circuit of Court set  aside the rulings.

I mean, OK, so no one's going to cry that Apple has to pay the settlement, but I'm much  more concerned about anyone else who might fall afoul of this, who can then be strong  armed and do paying, you know, to, you know, to some company that doesn't even operate  other than suing people for allegedly using their patents.

Transcript:  So I don't know if you remember two years ago, Walter Wong, an Apple engineer, very  proud of his Model X Tesla, loved his car very tragically.  The car he was driving with autopilot on, it drove into a guardrail and he took it  and he died in a fiery accident, his family suing over it.  The NTSB finally came back with their rulings this week.  They said, A, the autopilot was on, but B, Wong never touched the steering wheel or hit  the brake as the car sped up and headed straight for the divider.  They blamed a little bit the California Transportation Authority's Caltrans because there had been  an accident two weeks earlier.  A Prius hit the guardrail at 75 miles an hour and the guy walked away with minor injuries  because there was a crash absorber, an attenuator on it, but the attenuator was damaged with  the prior crash and removed and never replaced.  And so Wong did not have the, you know, he hit that concrete at 71 miles an hour, did  not have a chance.  Apple was also blamed by the NTSB because the iPhone, it turned out Wong was playing  a game on his iPhone.  That's why I didn't notice the car plowing into the divider and the NTSB said Apple should  have a phone use driving policy.  There was a lot of blame to go around.  I honestly, I think the real problem is Tesla selling its autopilot as autopilot, not as  driver assist.  Although I have to say, having had a Model X for three years, it gets mad at you if you  don't keep your hands on the wheel.  It says, come on, pay attention, come on.  But a little inattention.  And by the way, the driver was using an Apple supplied phone.  So Apple was also dinged because here's a company phone and you really should have a  policy preventing cell phone use while driving.

Because the car doesn't have any determination if I'm sitting behind the driver's seat or  if I'm sitting right next to it or if I'm in the backseat.  Like the app doesn't know.  Yeah, it can determine if I'm in a moving vehicle, but it can't determine if I'm the one  operating the vehicle.

Lisa always said it's right.  Remember, we'd go around this one curve and you'd say it's pulling.  It's heading for the divider.  And I have to disengage.  We disengaged all the time on that autopilot.  And so it is a big mistake to assume it's an autopilot.  And test bear some blame for overselling that feature, I think.

Transcript:  You know, I think if they just use a different name, if they hadn't called it autopilot  because you expect autopilot on an airplane to actually be able to, you know, pilot the plane  without human intervention.  But here, like you said, Leo, they just called it driver assist.  I think that would have been given people the right expectation.  You know, of course, then we wouldn't have all these videos of people sleeping in their auto drive,  you know, autopilot cars to entertain us on YouTube.  But still, you know, when you see the real world, real life implications of people either, you know,  failing to use the systems as they were intended or, you know, texting or driving distracted, you know,  it's a real shame.  I mean, I honestly can't wait until I love to drive.  I've always been a sports car kind of person.  So I love cars.  But I really for my daily commute cannot wait until I can just get into a car and don't have to think about it.  Now, I would love to use public transportation.  Unfortunately, where I live, the public transportation is kind of lackluster.  So, you know, I understand why people want to use it.  But, you know, we're just not there yet.  And, you know, if ever and until every car, a majority of cars have a type of, you know, autopilot feature,  have autonomous driving, then, you know, you're still going to have people do bad things in their cars or, you know, make mistakes.  Well, people do bad things all the time with or without autopilot.

Transcript:  Lisa and I were driving the other day.  We're in the in the diamond lane.  And I see somebody stick her arm out the window and go like this, the universal signal for I want to get over in your lane.  So I slow down.  Nothing happens.  I wait.  I finally give up and kind of go ahead.  I look in there.  It turns out she was cleaning while driving her car, cleaning her hairbrush and putting the hair out the window.  She was signaling me.  She's just cleaning her brush.  That's all.  So people, I mean, that's all the time you see that if you drive, it's terrifying out there, to be honest with you.  I can't wait till we get real self-driving vehicles.  But as the NTSB was at great pains to point out that you cannot today buy a self-driving vehicle.  So please keep your hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road.  You got a job.  I feel like Tesla, the autopilot and my Tesla made me safer because I was always paying attention, but it just helped me keep distance appropriately.  You know, because it was the auto adaptive cruise control.  It would let me know if I was going out of a lane.  I never would let it change lanes by itself.  So many times when I first tried it, it didn't pay any attention to the car in the other lane.  So I never let it do that.  But I feel like I was a better driver.  I was less likely to get in a wreck from falling asleep or something.  So those I think they're good features, in other words.  But please, folks, drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Well, and they're less and less unique, right?  And like more and more cars are getting a lot of these crash prevention driver assist features.  And, you know, I think Bill said just a few minutes ago, you know, autopilot by definition is automatic pilot.  So basically, you know, the driver is is I you can't blame a driver for presuming that this feature is able to take control of the car and get you from point A to point B because that's essentially how it's marketed.  I'm surprised they're still allowed to do it.  I mean, this is I feel like, you know, almost every time I've been on this show, there's been a new instance of of someone crashing in a new way or or in a new state because of this feature.  And even though, you know, I'm excited, I obviously love Tesla as a as a carmaker, you know, their cars are really awesome.  And a lot of these features are really exciting.  You know, any any partially self-driving car that I've that I've been in or tested or driven has been awesome.  And I do think there's a real opportunity to save lives and to help help people drive safely and prevent crashes.  But but, you know, I'm just so tired of hearing about the same accident happening over and over again.  The fact that people are taking their eyes off the road because of this feature called autopilot, which is not at all autopilot.  It is a driver assist feature rather than an automatic.

Transcript:  But by the way, I won't buy another car that doesn't have adaptive cruise control and lane keeping.  That's really what it is. And I like that.  Right. Yeah.  I'm going to get the new Ford Mustang Mach-E when it comes out this fall.  And the first thing I checked, you got to adaptive cruise control not only means it sets the speed, but it slows down at the car in front of you slows down.  It can even come to a stop.  So it's great for stop and go traffic.  And then it starts up again after the car goes.  So you don't have to keep your foot on the accelerator going up and down.  And lane keeping is really great.  I mean, you know, if you start to drift out of the lane, it lets you know all those things are, I think, much safer as long as they're used properly.  That's all. I don't want them to go away.

Start time: 4314.76
End time: 4331.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I think the big difference is, as people are saying, it's the branding, right?  It's that, OK, you could call adaptive cruise control and lane keeping people in lane.  Like that is a part of autopilot.  But when you use that name autopilot, it has a completely different connotation.  It's worse than that because Elon's always talking about you.

What an interesting idea.  Speaking of self-driving grocery stores and.  Something's going on with Twitter.  Twitter, a activist investor, has apparently bought a large stake in Twitter and is trying to get out, get Jack Dorsey out.  There's some evidence he he's a Republican mega donor and a Trump fan and maybe is trying to turn Twitter into something else.  We'll see.  We'll talk about that in just a bit.  First, if you missed anything this week, we had a wonderful week of shows.  I slept through most of them.  So we we have to do this.

And then they turned around and they put it in the Creative Commons.  I bet half those melodies are horrible.  By the way, Sam Meskovic stole a banana.  Apparently this is his shtick.  This is not the first time he's tried to steal a banana from an Amazon Go store.  So I'm going to find out what Christina did.  But that's coming up just a bit.  First, a word from our sponsor.  He's going to be known.  Sam's going to be known as the banana stealing guy.  Like that's going to be your careful Sam.  Just careful.  You don't want to go down in history as the banana stealing guy.  Our show today brought to you by Captera.  Oh, man, everybody.  I know, you know, I have such sympathy.  We for the longest time in business, you know, you get a program and you run your business on it.  Oftentimes, a program was written by, you know, the boss's nephew who is home from college.  Then he went off.  He disappeared.  He's living in a house.  He's living in a house.  And you're stuck with this broken ass piece of software that nobody likes.  Fortunately, Captera exists.  We went to Captera.  It is the world's largest, best directory of business software.  Millions of people use it every month.  Captera is a business ally, an online resource that helps you find the best software solution for your business,  whether it's CRM or video management.  Maybe you run a YouTube channel.  Yeah, they got line of business software, a dog, it's all in there.  Seven hundred categories of software, every possible program, thousands of programs.  The best part about Captera, there's over a million reviews of products from actual verified users.  Captera vets everyone.  And that means look, here's brewery software.  You want to start a brewery.  So you're looking for a software program you can write.  There's a lot of different software that you can use.  So you're looking for a software program you can write.  There's a when you pick the category, the filter list is specific to that category.  All of that stuff is in there and you can check the things you want.  You could say, you know, I want it.  I want it to be free. I want to be on prem.  I want to be in the cloud.  I want it to, you know, all the features narrow it down.  Then you can do a side by side comparison.  There are, by the way, there are a lot of brewery brewery programs out there to run brewery breweries.  And then, but then you go and you look at the reviews and that's where you're really going to get this amazing, unique, valuable resource.  Millions of people use Captera every month.  Oh, I left out the most important part.  It's free.  No charge, not freemium.  No charge ever costs you nothing.  And I think that's why there's so many reviews, because I think people want to pay it forward.  They got this great free resource.  They use the reviews.  They found great software and they want to tell people about it.  So they leave reviews or they want to tell people don't use this.  It's terrible.  So they leave the review.  That's what makes Captera special.  You could do it right now for free.  There's no special offer.  I can't give you 20 percent off.  It's free.  But if you do me a favor, go to captera.com slash twit.  At least they'll know you saw it here.  C.A.P. T.E. double R.A. captera.com slash twit.  C.A.P. T.E. double R.A.com slash twit.

No, but this is what I like.  Even though it was packed, I mean, I just literally walked around, filled up what I wanted, and then walked out.

It's sealed or whatever.  Obviously, they don't have a butcher on site, but it looked good.  The produce was fresh and this was the second day.  So we'll have to see how it holds up.  But no, I mean, it was in good condition.  They were already out of Cheez-Its, which I thought was funny.  Of course.  They had other varieties of Cheez-Its, but the original Cheez-Its, they were already sold out.  So I'm interested to see what the process will be of restocking.  There was a bakery. They don't obviously have a bakery on site.  That looked cool.

And this is where right now, knock on wood, this last, it was cheaper.  It was cheaper than QFC. It was cheaper than anything.  It was very inexpensive.  I got a bag of Doritos. I got some cupcakes.

Start time: 5032.91
End time: 5097.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, totally. Without a doubt.  And the thing is, I can understand the arguments for why this is problematic.  I would say that A, some of that information the grocery stores are already getting.  They've got cameras in every grocery store in the world.  They've been doing that for a long time.  B, you know, for more than 20 years, loyalty cards have a track of everything you buy based on companies.  So on one hand, plus I buy a lot of stuff from Amazon, either Amazon Fresh or Prime now anyway.  So they already had this stuff on me.  But the convenience was there.  I liked the store.  The store is well laid out.  They had a good selection.  Like, I'm really happy that it's there.  I mean, like, I it was funny.  I saw the thing on Geekwire and I saw the neighborhood.  I was like, wait a minute.  Where is this?  That's Pike Street right across from me.  And then I thought it looked like I was like, holy crap.  Because the thing is, is that this space had been, I guess, under construction for a while.  We didn't know what it was.  And so I genuinely had no idea what was going in there.  I would shop at this one.  I would shop here.  The day that it launched was when I was when we found out like, oh, that's what's in the neighborhood.

Start time: 5097.44
End time: 5124.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know what? You don't need loyalty cards.  You already have one.  It's an Amazon customer.  You have this.  You've scanned the QR code when they come in the door.  So you should get a little bit of a deal for that.  Probably.  Do we worry about I mean, at least here in Petaluma, most of the baggers are high school kids.  A lot of them I know.  I'll see them.  And it's an entry level job for a lot of kids that those clerk jobs of people at the Petaluma market.  They've been there for years.  Those people are all going to be out of work.

Start time: 5125.08
End time: 5189.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting.  So there were a lot of employees.  One for, you know, I think just kind of looking around, maybe restocking things, making sure that when people do enter, they are using, you know, their QR code or whatever.  But they also have a wine area and an alcohol area.  And also, so if you want to get NyQuil or how do you get alcohol, you'd have to have a person for that, right?  Yes. So there is a person who's in an area.  It's kind of like a Costco where you have like a little like you have kind of a little area where you go up and you show them, you know, like you're getting NyQuil.  Like you tell them that you want, you give them kind of a card, they give it for you or you choose what wine or what other alcohol you want.  So that's that is manned by a human.  Again, you're not doing the checkout, but that is as human manned.  So there are people who work there is just less.  And it is a valid question to say, what impact does this have on cashiers?  The one thing I would say is I think by the time this becomes mainstream enough and affordable enough where this can happen, because right now I have to think the infrastructure and the cost involved just to make sure that people can get the alcohol.  So I think that the cost and setting this up would be prohibited for a lot of places to consider.

End time: 5229.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Yeah.  So hopefully at that point, you know, we are in a better position with maybe upscaling workers and and having other systems in place so that, you know, the jobs that are displaced, we have other things for people because it is a real concern.  I just I think that it's a longer term concern rather than something that's going to happen immediately because this is not an inexpensive thing to put together.  And I would think that most places like even like major grocery chains, you know, like the Kroger's and Walmarts of the world, like they'd have to look at, OK, how much would it cost for them to build that out?  And would it be worth, you know, like project?  How long would be before it paid off?  You know, the hourly workers.

Transcript:  You've already seen the other chains start to roll out similar.  You were talking about, Christina was talking about Kroger.  So the Kroger's in my areas most have the scanners that you can walk in, pick up.  Don't you hate those?  Do you use those?  I actually use them.  They tend to work because I hate putting everything in the cart and then getting everything out of the cart.  You know, at the checkout counter.  So I will scan as I go along, leave everything in the cart, but you still have to go to the checkout, hit the thing and then pay.  So, you know, I think this is the way most retail chains like grocery stores will eventually go.  You know, how long will it be before Amazon puts this in all the Whole Foods except for certain areas?  Right. Yeah, it's going to be expensive.  But as the cost comes down, I mean, they've got to be thinking about that.  And then you have other retailers, whether it's Wal-Mart or Kroger, looking at convenience, other convenience options.  So Kroger has, you know, you can buy online and then either have it delivered or pick it up.  Right. Or pick it up.  And so does Costco does that.  Wal-Mart's got Walmart Plus.

A, I lived on the third floor and I didn't want to have to climb up three stairs, three flights of stairs every time I'd go to the grocery store.  If I had to take a subway or whatever to Whole Foods.  So like I used Fresh Direct.

Joe Colum, age 89, passed away February 28th.  He was the guy who founded it.  There was a Trader Joe.  It was Joe Colum.  Thanks for Chewbac-Chuck, Joe.  Thanks for Chewbac-Chuck.

Transcript:  You know, I think Michael brings up a really good point about the dehumanization.  It's a problem.  It's a problem.  Of our lives in general, not just from like you said with kids and jobs and, you know,  filling those kind of low skill entry level positions, but also there are a lot of people  who are elderly, people who don't work, people who don't come into contact with a lot of  other people on a face-to-face basis on a regular basis.  And so going to the grocery store and talking to someone at the checkout, interacting with  someone at a fast food restaurant, fast casual, whatever, coffee shop, that may be their only  chance to actually interact with a human.  And as we remove those people, you know, the checkout people, the waiters, the whatever,  it continues to sort of isolate people.  And I do really worry, maybe not next year, maybe not five years, 10 years, but as you  get 20, 30, 40 years, you know, that isolation that sort of people feel becomes greater and  greater because, you know, the machines do everything for us.

Transcript:  It's funny that you should talk.  I've been thinking a lot about that, lady.  I think it's the disease and it's not the disease of the 21st century.  It's the disease of the last century where people have been spread out.  We no longer live in tribal communities.  Families are spread out all over the country.  Your family's not near Seattle, right, Christina?  No, they're in Atlanta.  Yeah.  And we don't have church.  We don't have a social group anymore.  And more and more we're working at home.  We're shopping in an empty store.  I do feel like we're kind of moving.  And this is not how our biology is designed.  We're gregarious animals or social animals.  And I don't think Facebook and Twitter is a replacement for that.  No.

Transcript:  And furthermore, like we're diving deeper and deeper into these digital lives.  So things like Fortnite and Minecraft, virtual reality, you know, we're going to be socializing  in digital spaces.  And I think there will be fewer and fewer human to human interactions.  And so, you know, again, I sound so cranky.  And typically I'm one to advocate for technology.  And I generally have an optimistic view of these things.  And of course, you know, the convenience of walking into a grocery store and walking out with my groceries is great.  But I can't help but think about the societal change that's happening right before us.  You know, there are, you know, I grew up working class and I feel like I just have I just identify with with those those types of workers.  And I think, you know, I'm a little bit worried about, you know, I think right now, you know, this grocery store is not going to like, you know, I don't think it'll have a huge impact.  But and and there's no way to stop this either.  Right. If Amazon's not doing this, you know, McDonald's or Starbucks or some other company will find a way to to implement this type of technology.  So I think, you know, Amazon ushering in this change is just kind of indicative of like the time that we're in.  But but I just I worry about the thousands or millions of of of workers and people that, you know, find meaning in their life through through social interaction, through their work.  And like, you know, the grocery bagging is working at the local grocery store is has long been part of just like a traditional American life, like a traditional working class life.  And I think that as that goes away, like, you know, I worry about what happens to those people and how we how we integrate them into society, because often those people are the ones that are, you know, while we sit here and talk about all this technology,  Tesla's and iOS and and and all of these and AirPods.  You know, I often try to remind myself that there's a huge swath of Americans and then an even bigger swath of the world that doesn't have access to that technology.

End time: 5916.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I was going to say, I think that that was more of a nada.  We're afraid of the backlash because the reality is is like the building that I live in,  I would say the majority of the people who live there probably work at Amazon.  And then the rest of people either work at at Microsoft or at Google.  But and it's I'm being serious when I say that probably 95 percent of the people who live in my building work at one of those three companies.  And so and we're across the street and we're not the only apartment complex.  There are a bunch of other high rises in the area, too.  So you have a lot of those employees very close by.  So I don't think that it was we're not wanting to get the backlash.  I think it was this is a part of the whole one of people to just exactly we want to be able to just drop the bonds that hey,  and this thing is available now and you can come in and shop coming soon.

But I was actually shocked by the number of employees who were in the store.  It was the second day.  But that's what I'm going to kind of keep an eye on as I go in more frequently is what how many employees are working because I will say there were certainly fewer employees than you would have.  I guess if you had full checkout counters, although sometimes they'll go to the bigger grocery stores and it's not as if the checkout lanes are all open anyway.  So, you know, right.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's interesting to me that to one, you know, where Amazon and other companies choose to run these experiments and to, you know, how different cities react or how how cities react to them differently.  So I wonder, like, you know, if Amazon tried to open a grocery store like this in New York, my guess is that there would be a little bit of a neighborhood.

Start time: 5970.00
End time: 5996.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Totally. Because you have bodega.  You have those systems like we have a bodega that's not that far that's closer to the convention center.  And it's it's fine.  But like it closes fairly early and it doesn't have a lot of things.  So really, most people are going to a QFC, which is owned by Kroger, a Whole Foods or a Trader Joe's.  Those are your options or you're going a little bit further and going to a Safeway.  So, you know, to me, it's like I don't have a local option.  This is smaller and close.

Start time: 5996.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Seattle is like it's, you know, it's well acquainted with all these big tech companies and all of their different experiments.  Right. Like you said, like, you know, given your the building that you live in.  And I think just even in terms of number of people employed by big tech in Seattle, my guess is that people are a little more have more favorable opinions than like, you know, Amazon in particular in New York is is still kind of.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 6023.14
End time: 6065.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We have it in Seattle, too.  It's just different. It's just it's just different.  It's a weird thing where they're big employer, but there is still a very vocal contention of people who are unhappy with the role of big tech.  It's just it's a weird dichotomy where you have a lot of people who are very vocally against it, who are also in some ways directly or indirectly employed by these places.  It's an interesting difference.  But you're right. I think in New York, this would be harder not to say that it wouldn't happen.  And I do think that in some parts of Manhattan in particular, it would be easier in Manhattan.  I think this would be hard in Queens. I think this would be hard in Brooklyn.  I think this would be hard in the Bronx.  But I think in Manhattan, this would be something with especially certain parts like Chelsea.  I don't think you would get a lot of backlash.

Transcript:  In perspective, I mean, clearly Amazon's goal is not because we want to reinvent grocery shopping.  That seems like a very kind of small goal for somebody like Jeff Bezos.  It's about the data.  And to put that in perspective, big, big acquisition this week.  Intuit bought Credit Karma, an app for seven billion dollars.  Now, what Credit Karma's app, it's a free app, so there's not a lot of money to be made.  You're not going to make seven billion back.  Credit Karma makes its money by credit offering a credit card number.  Credit card offers things like that that they get some affiliate fees from.  But what Credit Karma does have is a lot of financial data.  You go to Credit Karma, you put in your financial data, they give you your credit score.  They have 110 million users and they know all of their financial information.  And that's to me what's worth seven billion dollars.  In fact, in a way, I like to do the tax stuff.  And they do taxes.  And of course, Intuit has TurboTax and they don't want a free tax program.

Start time: 6196.08

End time: 6216.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even then, though, you don't spend seven billion dollars to put a competitor's tax program out of business.  That's true.  They've got it. It's like Microsoft buying LinkedIn.  The value is in the data.  And it tells you that the data, with 100 million users, it's 70 bucks a user that this company is worth.  It gives you some idea of what your data is worth.

Start time: 6217.96
End time: 6284.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And data has basically become coin of the realm in enterprise IT.  So if you don't have first party data, data you've collected yourself, not that you're partnering with someone else,  then you're really at a disadvantage to the companies that do have first party data.  So both in, you know, whether you're in retail or whether you are in finance or whether you're in the media business.  I mean, being able to have data about your customers that you collect directly,  just like we were talking about with Amazon and its grocery stores, you know, and translate that into, you know, and monetize that either for yourself or for, you know, through a third party is just, you know, that's the real value anymore.  It's not the physical thing. It's the data that you can collect.  And you were talking, you know, about the value per customer for the acquisition there.  That's a lot more than most people think their data is worth.  Right. You know, I've seen surveys that say people would gladly, you know, trade their data to Facebook for five dollars.  So clearly they're underselling the value of their own data.

Start time: 6285.68
End time: 6320.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's what isn't that what Tim Berners-Lee is doing.  In fact, he started something called Solid.  The idea is you have a data vault and you can then control your data and sell it at an appropriate price.  If you want to use Facebook, Facebook says, well, we'll give you free Facebook, but you got to give us some data.  You'll control it. It'll be explicit transaction instead of one of these implicit transactions.  Bruce Schneier just went to work for Inrupt, which is a company that's going to use this solid technology.  I don't think this is ever going to happen, by the way.  We're too entrenched in just, I'll give you anything. Whatever. I just want free email.  But I think it's a great idea anyway. I hope it happens.

Transcript:  Well, and the laws don't protect it, right? The laws and the regulations aren't there.  Think about a photographer.  The law protects the person that takes the photo in most cases, not the person in the photo.  So this is the same. The law is set up to protect the company that collects the data.  They're the ones that owns that work, not you who have given over the data.

Start time: 6344.04
End time: 6353.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a reason, Bill. It's because companies knew the value of the data long before we did as individuals.  So we never fought it. We never said anything about it.  The only people who wanted it was the companies.

Start time: 6354.54
End time: 6392.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and it wasn't possible, right? It was all hidden.  Imagine if you wanted to collect this type of data a hundred years ago.  And people did. You had to go to public records. You had to send the college students.  You had to send people that you would hire and pay in alleyways to go to the courthouse and physically collect this data or look for other ways to get it.  So this is companies have been collecting data since there were catalogs and there were records.  But now it's just become so much easier that and the technologies allow people just to give up their data without even knowing it.  Right. So, oh, yeah, get that free email and we'll just scan all the text in it and find out what keywords are in there.  Hey, that sounds great to me. Right.

Start time: 6394.92
End time: 6445.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, in many cases, I feel like these companies don't even understand the value of the data until they have it.  So it's really just collecting as much as possible and then and then finding the value of the data after it's collected.  Right. So it's like allowing artificial intelligence and other computer algorithms to detect patterns and to find value within the data that people are just kind of like willingly giving up.  I think the value of this stuff escapes most people beyond like a few computer scientists and even the leading experts don't fully understand the value of the data that they're collecting.  They they trust the models that they create. Right.  And so I don't know. I feel like people still, you know, even even though we're all sitting here saying like, yes, data is really valuable.  I think the true value escapes even people as well educated on this as us and right.  And even leading experts in the field.

I do think that people are more aware whether they're taking the actions to limit what companies have access to.  I think it's a different question.  But I do think that people are more aware than they were and care more and are more concerned than they were even a couple of years ago.  I do I do think that's true.

It hasn't gotten a lot of attention, but I feel like it could be a really important story.  There's an activist investment firm called Elliott Management.  And according to Bloomberg, they've just taken a sizable stake in Twitter.  No one knows what that sizable stake is.  But I should point out that Elliott Management is run by Paul Singer.  He is a Republican mega donor.  He was a never Trumper at the beginning, but he has since become a Trump fan.  Of course, Donald Trump, the president, uses Twitter to great effect.  And I have to wonder if this isn't kind of an interesting campaign contribution,  because apparently Elliott is demanding that Twitter CEO Jack Dorsey leave and that they get four seats on the board.  And you have to wonder if it has something to do with Twitter's decision not to take political advertising.  Is this going to be a sea change for Twitter?  What do you think?

Transcript:  Well, they've done this before, right?  Like this guy has made these attempts before.  I know that Samsung, he bought a big share of their...  He's a typical activist investor.  Didn't he also do stuff with Yahoo?  Was he the Yahoo guy?  Maybe.  I believe so.  So it's interesting.  Definitely.  This is their MO.  This is kind of their playbook.  Apparently, I think because of how much he's accomplished, he says, I guess he can put in three board seats,  which are, I guess, due to be up.  He wants to fill the board with four slots, but only three are going to be open.  The big question would be, would that be enough for him to be able to force a CEO change?  Something tells me that is going to be much harder.  But certainly, if he could get the other votes on the board and make an argument that says that the Dorsey has been a poor CEO  because of his split duties between Square and Twitter, that is interesting.  I think that it would be difficult just given Twitter's overall performance in the last few years has actually improved.  So I think that's a hard argument to make.

Transcript:  I'd hate to see Twitter become an arm of a political party, a publicity arm for a political party.  That would be devastating.  Definitely.  He's not rich enough to, I mean, he's only worth only $3.2 billion.  I mean, he's not a Bloomberg, for instance, was worth $62 billion.  He's not a Bill Gates.  But I guess $3.2 billion is enough.  Twitter's not that valuable.

Transcript:  But it should serve to remind Twitter users, the public in general, that these platforms are not public services.  They are private companies or public companies.  And so they may have rules, they may have guidelines, they may have operating philosophies, but those philosophies can change over time,  depending on who owns the companies.  And so if the management changes, you know, you were just talking about data, how the company uses your data can change what you're allowed to say or what direction the company goes, it can change.  And so I think it is kind of maybe a rude awakening to some people who treat these platforms, whether it's Twitter or Facebook or, you know, Michael and I in the media industry, you know, those platforms.  These are all private entities.  Right. And so while different entities have different values, you know, it'll be interesting to see what happens with a platform like Twitter.  Think about a platform like Reddit as well.  Right. So people, you know, if the owners, you know, want to take the company in a different direction, they can't.  They're not a public service.

Transcript:  Well, I think honestly, like you said, I'm not sure I would agree in turning any of these, you know, private companies into public services, but it does remind us of what we get out of things like roads or publicly managed utilities, even if they're private companies or public companies.  Right. Or the water company and the power companies, those public services that we really sort of value.  And, you know, in our everyday lives, you know, there are now these digital services that, you know, used to maybe have been created by this by the government, but are now private companies.  And so, you know, I like you, I'm not I wouldn't advocate taking away any of these companies and putting them in the public sector.  But it does maybe remind us maybe there's a place for a public version of some of these that can't be taken away.  And we have public television in the United States.

Transcript:  It's so polarized.  And, you know, I don't know much about this activist investor, to be honest, but I do know a lot about Jack Dorsey.  And I feel like he has failed time and time again.  I think I saw in the past week that a 17 year old high schooler was able to get a fake Twitter profile and get it verified.  Get a blue checkmark.  He got a blue checkmark.  He pretended he was what, a member of Congress?

Transcript:  Right.  No, I mean, look, there are plenty of things to criticize Twitter on.  I think this activist, I mean, this is kind of his MO.  We tried to do this with AT&T.  I think the success here is probably going to be overblown, like no matter how much.  So nothing to worry about.  I think it would be hard just because even if he did get all those board seats, which would be difficult, if he were to get his people involved, because the other board members have to agree as well.  You know, you're supposed to have ultimately a fiduciary responsibility with the shareholders and think that there could be larger revolts if those sorts of changes were happening.  I also think, frankly, this doesn't in any way disagree with, like, you and Bill's statements that maybe we need to have, we need to at least be aware of how these companies are controlled and that they are businesses at the end of the day.  And it's not kind of a public square.  But I do think that if there was a significant management shakeup, then you would see a massive amount of talent just leave, which in turn would completely drop the value of the service.  That's really true.  That's the thing you have to keep in mind too, is that, okay, you need engineers and they're prickly and they're in demand.

Transcript:  According to Steve Huffman, the CEO of Reddit, guy who wrote the software originally in Lisp, TikTok is fundamentally parasitic.  He's not wrong.  TikTok said no.  He was speaking at an appearance at the Social 2030 Venture Capital Conference.  Steve says, maybe I'm going to regret this, but I can't even get to that level of thinking with TikTok because I look at that app as so fundamentally parasitic that it's always listening.  The fingerprinting technology they use is truly terrifying.  I could not bring myself to install an app like that on my phone.  ByteDance, the owners of TikTok, said, what is he talking about?  There's no evidence of that.  Steve did not offer any evidence.  On the other hand, I think there's probably a lot of people go, yeah, that makes sense.  That's probably that's probably the case.  It is owned by a Chinese company.  Right.

They all give you cancer.  Yeah, they all have the same adverse effects.  I think they're all built to do the same thing, which is to keep you engaged or keep you addicted to the service.  And I'd be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy TikTok.  I think it's fun.  But, you know, use it responsibly like like, you know, like like a lot of other things in my life, I guess.  And yeah, he's not wrong.  But, you know, it's not that different than Reddit or Twitter or Facebook or, you know, any of these other apps, in my opinion.
