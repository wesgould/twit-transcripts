Glenn Fleischman joins us from parts northeast.  He's the editor of a brand new book, kick-started, northwest, what did I say?  Northeast, crazy.  I was thinking of you in Maine.  You're going to Maine to print your book.  You're in North, yes. Hello, hello.  Hello, Glenn Fleischman, editor of Shift Happens.  Good to see you again.  Thank you.  Also joining us from Windows Central Magazine, the editor-in-chief.  Do you still call it a magazine, Daniel?  No, no.  No, blog?

Transcript:  What are you doing there?  Good to have you here.  Of course, Microsoft Build was this week.  Lots of AI news.  We'll get to that in a bit.  But before we do, let's introduce panelist number three, my good friend, Owen Thomas,  columnist from San Francisco Examiner.  He's Alex Wilhelm's Twitter daddy.  Do you still say that now?  Is Twitter over?  It's done.  Oh, you're muted.

Start time: 199.02
End time: 204.62
Speaker: Owen Thomas
Transcript:  I think you need to say Twitter dad, not Twitter daddy.  That's different.  That's two different things.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's for OnlyFans.  Okay.  Is Twitter furry?  Is that right?  No, that's wrong.  That's also wrong.  That's very wrong.  That's very wrong.  This week, Twitter had a little attention on Wednesday, as Elon constantly reminded  us.  Ron DeSantis, governor of Florida, was to announce his 2024 candidacy for presidency.  Didn't go exactly as planned.  Somebody noted that Twitter had fired 97 out of the 100 people who worked at Spaces,  which might have had something to do with it.

Start time: 253.42

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  A lot of echoing.

Start time: 255.60
End time: 261.34
Speaker: Owen Thomas
Transcript:  They also stopped paying for the service that helped keep Spaces online.

Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  Brad, they literally didn't have enough servers spun up.  I think they're going to, when you look up Pyrrhic victory in the dictionary, I think  they're going to put Elon's face in the next edition.  It's pretty amazing, the cell phone there.

Start time: 284.28
End time: 293.05
Speaker: Owen Thomas
Transcript:  His cost containment strategy at Twitter seems to be, I'm going to randomly stop paying for  bills and randomly shutting servers down and see what breaks.  And this is an example.

Start time: 294.44
End time: 306.89
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  That story that came out, was it just last week about reporting what people inside the  company responsible for real estate and other bills were talking about, like what they were  asked to do, which seemed a little wild.

Start time: 311.20
End time: 327.46
Speaker: Owen Thomas
Transcript:  In the filings, they were saying, look, my career is in real estate.  I will not be able to work again in this industry if you have me try to stiff our landlord.  And the answer was, well, we don't care.  Management, Elon Musk, we don't care.

Start time: 328.00
End time: 358.62
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  Or I might be actually sentenced to jail or the person who was persecuted or persecuted.  But I mean, isn't this what I think he maintains when he's talked about in public, it seems  like this is what rich people allegedly do, is that they don't pay bills strategically  to see which ones they have to pay.  I don't think that's ethically the case for everybody, but certainly some other prominent  people have done that.  So it's amazing to see it so blatantly and on such a huge scale.

Start time: 359.38
End time: 376.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Did something happen when Trump got elected president that it just completely changed,  like it slid the ethical Overton window over about a thousand places, because he's very  famous also for not paying bills.  And it feels like he made a lot of things okay.

Start time: 379.55
End time: 387.23
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Yeah, and there's no repercussions.  Right.  If I don't pay bills, if I don't pay bills, I'm going to get in trouble.  All sorts of bad things will happen.

Start time: 388.26
End time: 550.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  We talk about politics and stuff, but there's also, the president is also in a way a leader  of what people think.  And you can really establish kind of a point of view that, yeah, it doesn't matter.  You can now say anything you want.  You can do whatever you want and it doesn't matter.  You get away with it.  I think Elon must have watched this with interest and is now sort of adopting the art of the  deal as it were.  On the other hand, there has been some very good news for Elon.  That was the bad news.  By the way, I got to point out the subtweeting that the New York Times did.  This is an article by Ryan Mack and Tiffany Shue.  Tiffany Shue, DeSantis' Twitter event falls short of the reach of past live streams.  Within hours of the event, participants celebrated the achievement.  David Sacks, who has been a big donor to the DeSantis campaign, declared it, quote,  by far the biggest room ever held on social media.  DeSantis himself said there were probably about 10 million people who would have watched the event.  The New York Times says in a very kind of crisp single paragraph sentence, they were wrong on both counts.  They were wrong on both counts.  According to Twitter's metrics, high of 300,000 concurrent listeners.  That is actually 3.4 million afterwards, listen to recording, not quite 10 million, nor the biggest room ever held on social media.  I mean, Facebook had an 800,000 person Facebook live event, which, by the way, featured two BuzzFeed employees placing rubber bands around a watermelon until it exploded.  Oh, yeah, that was great.  Oh, that was great.  That was some entertainment.  Five million people watched the entire event at some point.  The 2017, the Times is really being mean here, live stream of a pregnant giraffe on YouTube brought in five million viewers a day.  In fact, even Twitter Spaces had done more.  Three million people last month listened to an interview of Elon by a BBC reporter at Twitter Space.  So, yeah, this is this is severe degradation from what Spaces had been and certainly nothing compared to other.  AOC had to tweet more people watched me play a game on Twitch.  And watched your announcement, which is true.  Was she playing among us?  I think she was. Yeah.  But that's pretty exciting, as is watching a watermelon about to explode.  So either way, I can understand the interest.

Start time: 551.14
End time: 555.30
Speaker: Owen Thomas
Transcript:  Good news. Is there a are you making some kind of DeSantis metaphor there?

Start time: 556.75
End time: 585.11
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Watermelon's explosion, you think?  No, I wouldn't. Never.  No, I'm not. That's any any resemblance to a person living or dead is accidental.  I should say that at the beginning of every show.  Good news for Elon, though, the FDA has approved Neuralink's study of human brain implants.  Woohoo.  And what do you want to get in line for this one?

Start time: 586.40
End time: 588.83
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  It's going to be a real life blue check for people.

Start time: 591.42
End time: 595.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Because you know those are going to be the first people to sign up for it.  Oh, yeah. It's going to be Elon's stand, right?

Start time: 597.00
End time: 602.70
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  It'll be a blue check and then a little brain next to it.  You know, it's going to be awesome. Let them go. It's fine.

Start time: 603.00
End time: 653.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I have Elon in my mind. I mean, to his credit, the whole idea is really to help people with brain injuries live more normal lives.  So it's a I'm sure that's why the FDA cleared it.  They cleared Neuralink to use its brain implant and surgical robot.  Just what could go what could possibly go wrong for on patients but declined to provide more details should point out Neuralink has been in trouble there and in trouble with the United States Department of Agriculture for animal welfare violations.  They're in trouble with the Department of Transportation.  This is a weird one. They're probing whether Neuralink illegally transported dangerous pathogens on chips removed from monkey brains without my god without proper containment measures.

Transcript:  It's like a walking set of science fiction movies about to be made.

Start time: 658.34
End time: 664.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's like I don't know why he doesn't have a secret layer in a volcano. It doesn't.

Start time: 664.02
End time: 724.00
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  It doesn't. You don't know that he doesn't. He could know if it's secret.  That's true.  The exciting news though, you know, the Neuralink thing is brain based.  I realized that I was incredibly excited about the fellow who had been paralyzed who was able to regain the ability to use his legs.  The bypass that like a bridge bridge technology from spine to spine bypassing the disconnection.  And I like that is, you know, whenever whenever we talk about the future, I'm always like, well, you know, I don't we don't need flying cars necessarily.  We don't need, I don't know, AI based recipe generators, but it's like people being able with aphasia being able to speak, people being able to walk again.  This stuff is fantastic. And the question is, will anybody be able to afford it or will it be, you know, $10 million solutions that insurance companies can't reasonably cover for the people who need it?  So I'm excited. So Neuralink as a concept, I don't know what his end game is, but I'm excited if it leads to people being able to resume the lives that they had before.

Start time: 724.08
End time: 768.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. And I'm sure that's why the FDA was a little more open to the work.  It's not it's not just so you can go in Mark Zuckerberg's metaverse.  Swiss researchers implanted an electronic device in a paraplegic skull on top of the region of the brain responsible for controlling leg movements.  And then this is the AI part using algorithms based on adaptive AI methods.  This is from the Financial Times.  Movement intentions are decoded in real time from the brain and then transmitted wirelessly to a neurostimulator connected to an electrode ray over the part of the spinal cord that controls leg movement that's below the injury site.  And he was able to walk.

Start time: 769.46
End time: 793.00
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  Yeah, and then also even be able to do that.  Do I remember this right? It was even after after a lot of training, he was able to do it without the connection in place, I think was the case too.  So even though the signals aren't there, he was able to produce the response required.  I mean, just this is, you know, it's his science fiction that we're living in, which is the good kind, the non dystopian kind.  Yeah, occasionally you get it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  The Dutchman's spine was injured 11 years ago in a bike accident.  They upgraded his digital bridge.  He said this feels radically different before.  I felt that the stimulation was controlling me.  Now I am controlling the stimulation myself.  I could take steps that feel natural.  And there's no external computer.  It's all in, you know, it's all in his head, so to speak.  That's that is.  Yeah.  Thank you for bringing that up.  We should talk about the positive stuff.

Start time: 824.04
End time: 826.92
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  It's a feel good story.  Yeah, it is feel good.

Start time: 827.64
End time: 863.88
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  But I'll also point out that there's down the road security risks with this as well.  Lord, you have when you have wireless devices planted in your brain, people are going to hack those for good and for bad.  You know, so that's the other side we do need to think about, just like AI, just as we're building out AI, we need to think about both things.  How do we detect the bad stuff using AI and how we use AI for good stuff?  We got to do the same here with these implants and brains.  We got to be thinking about security and how well because, man, now you're actually really messing with people's lives potentially.  That's right.

Start time: 864.68
End time: 884.63
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, we've seen that with the pacemakers that we're having.  Right.  Yeah, that's something to be obviously.  The good news is I think we're much more aware of security than we used to be.  And presumably medical researchers who are creating especially wireless technologies like this, I would hope are really paying attention to that.  It's not not impossible to encrypt those signals and so forth.

Start time: 886.22
End time: 901.94
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  I wish I had Cory Doctorow to pull out from behind a bush right here and say, but wait, all the systems are proprietary and no one can investigate the code.  And we're relying on the FDA's underfunded groups to vet that they're secure and these companies never actually invest in security.  They'll push Cory back behind the bush.  That's exactly right.

Start time: 902.00
End time: 904.35
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Good. Yeah, he's right.  He's right.

Start time: 905.38

Transcript:  My wife has a bone anchored hearing aid, which is great.  But every few years they're like, we've ended end of life.  This thing that costs several thousand dollars.  We're fortunate that it got covered by insurance.  Other insurance payers are not because the premiums reflect that.  But there's no open source thing.  It literally snaps onto an anchor on her body and and that was surgically implanted.  The anchor is surgically.  Now they implant a magnet under the skin.  And so it's magnetically connected, apparently.  But it's a very simple device.  In in reality, the implant is the thing that is medical.  And but it's not open like, you know, there's this a Baja bone anchored hearing aid, but there's all those other kinds of hearing aids available.  What's the one that's the one you were an external part of?  I forgot what it's called.  I forgot the name of it, but it's one that goes directly and stimulates the inner ear where there's no cochlear implant.

Start time: 956.00
End time: 956.67
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, cochlear implant.

Start time: 957.12
End time: 990.00
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  Yeah.  And so all these none of these devices have any requirement or necessity for access outside the company's proprietary interests because they develop them and so forth.  So when the company goes out of business, you saw the thing where some people had gained regained the limited ability to see like some shades of color and the company had to shut down, I think.  And there is no future for that implant, which is or even supporting them medically for implant side effects.  So unwanted consequences from closed source development in the medical world.

Transcript:  This is where the communist in me comes out and just points out that for profit medicine is is destined to disappoint in the long run.  This is just not.  There's some things that should not be capitalistic and medicine is one of them.  Yeah, yeah, absolutely.  Yeah.  Oh, well.  Oh, well, sorry about that.  You were talking about chat GPT hallucinating.  We all saw the story.  Jeff Jarvis leaped on this.  He's already writing a book with it.  You already started the chapter.  A New York lawyer is in trouble because his firm used chat GPT for legal research.  The case involved a man suing an airline over personal injury.  His legal team submitted a brief that cited previous court cases saying there's a precedent for why this should move forward.  The airline's lawyers wrote to the judge said, we can't find these cases.  We can't find them.  Six of the submitted cases appear to be this is the judge speaking bogus judicial decisions with bogus quotes and bogus internal citations.  That's amazing.  He demanded that the legal team explain itself over the course of several filings.  It emerged from the BBC that the research had not been prepared by the lawyer, but by a colleague at his firm who used chat GPT to find precedents.  Go to the library, man.  It's in the basement.  We bought those books for a reason.

Start time: 1091.96
End time: 1103.94
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  My favorite part is when the guy said, but I asked chat GPT whether the citations were real and it said they were.  And then he attached screen captures of him asking chat GPT that and assuring him they were correct.

Start time: 1104.20
End time: 1123.74
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Screenshots attached the filing appear to show a conversation between Mr. Schwartz, the lawyer who did the research and chat GPT.  In one message says, is Varghese a real case?  Referring to the quoted president Varghese versus China Southern Airlines, one of the cases no other lawyer could find chat GPT says.

Start time: 1125.13
End time: 1129.15
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Yeah, would I lie?  Yeah, it's real.

Start time: 1130.99
End time: 1140.56
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So then Schwartz said, well, what's your source?  After quote double checking, chat says, no, no, it's real.  You could find it on the Lexus Nexus or Westlaw.

Start time: 1142.48
End time: 1150.00
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  I don't know why the guy didn't search.  I don't.  Yeah, there's a lot of things about that.  But by that, it's like the laziest thing that a lawyer.  Well, they're in trouble.  The judge is not happy.

Start time: 1151.00
End time: 1153.55
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There's going to be a disciplinary hearing on June 8th.

Start time: 1155.64
End time: 1161.41
Speaker: Owen Thomas
Transcript:  And doesn't doesn't this open him up to a malpractice suit from his client?  Probably.

Start time: 1162.02
End time: 1180.00
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  You got to think.  And also being disbarred or or sanctioned.  And I love that his thing is like, I didn't realize that chat GPT would give false results.  And every time you use chat to be just GDP, just GPT at the bottom, it says it may not offer real results.  You know, we're careful.  You're like, all right, I think the disclaimer is pretty good.

Start time: 1180.44
End time: 1235.24
Speaker: Owen Thomas
Transcript:  But I think the context here, though, is is interesting because this comes as as Metta and Google and Twitter have all vastly reduced their resources devoted to fact checking.  Right.  So bots like chat GPT are training on a corpus of publicly available Internet data that we know is increasingly faulty, increasingly unfact checked and, you know, and and also being fed by AI more and more.  So we have chat bots creating made up Internet nonsense, training on made up Internet nonsense, and it risk becoming this like vortex of like verbal vomit that, you know, that will doom our ability to trust anything we read online ever.  I blame us.

Start time: 1237.47
End time: 1270.47
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It's our fault.  And I mean, Twitter, I mean, all is to because the tech we have been singing its praises.  The New York Times has been Kevin Ruse said chat GPT fell in love with me.  We have been acting as if this is a thinking entity.  I know it makes mistakes once in a while, but you know, and so I think we oversold it to the point that this lawyer said, well, everybody says this thing's really good.  And and really didn't he didn't know that it was so risky.  I bet you.

Start time: 1272.31
End time: 1300.74
Speaker: Owen Thomas
Transcript:  Shouldn't we be as a, you know, as a species more sophisticated about this?  I mean, I remember as a as a kid in like the the 1980s, hand coding Eliza, you know, the the computer psychotherapist like this was a this was a program you could like type.  It was that simple and basic.  Yeah.  So, you know, you got a computer magazine, you typed, you typed out all the Eliza, by the way.  Is still in EMAX.

Start time: 1303.14
End time: 1316.82
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I can, if you want, I'll show you.  It's still around, but it was dopey.  You knew it was dopey because Eliza, you would say, well, how's your day been?  And it would say, well, how's your day been?  You know, I mean, it was it was just echoing kind of stuff back to you.

Start time: 1317.46
End time: 1319.90
Speaker: Owen Thomas
Transcript:  But and yet people people were fooled by it.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 1320.40
End time: 1363.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  There was a lot of conversation.  I mean, I remember back then about, well, could this replace therapists and things like that?  Great piece I want to recommend in the IEEE Journal Spectrum by Rodney Brooks, who is a roboticist.  He was until 2007, director of the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab at MIT.  He's he's taught at Stanford and Carnegie Mellon, and he's had three robotic startups.  The title just calm down about JET GPT-4 already.  But this is really important and stop confusing performance with competence.  You read you read the article, Glenn.

Start time: 1364.74
End time: 1406.50
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, he's always a voice of reason.  He's not a hyper, you know, I think he even when when he started getting into robotics, he was very excited about it.  But I don't think he ever I'm trying to remember, like over, I mean, almost 20 years of following his work.  I don't feel he ever said like, you know, did a segue kind of announcement.  This is going to change transportation in cities or whatever.  He's like, well, it'll have applications.  And then he was behind I robot.  So, you know, there are I don't know how many millions, hundreds, tens of millions of Roombas and knockoffs out there.  It did change home vacuuming.  It's a narrow scope.  And I think that was kind of what you would never ask a Roomba for legal citations in a lawsuit.  Right. Oh, just wait till they have the plugins.

Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  I mean, to be fair, though, it would pair legal jobs are one of the top on the list for a I to take over.  Like when people talk about a I replacing jobs, paralegals is going to be one of those professions because it is just essentially research and summarizing data.  Well, I is going to be will be good at that.  It is good at that. But there will be errors for now.  And right now, that's where we are. Right.  But the thing to remember, too, is that even though we have these, you know, these goofs and screw ups will make news and come out.  But, you know, the rate at which this stuff is improving is exponential.  And it's just going to be quickly.  These stories will go away and we're going to disagree.

Start time: 1449.28
End time: 1569.00
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  I got to disagree with you. It's not exponential, though.  It's not even geometric.  It's it's this is where I will I'll go off on you.  Let's have an argument. No, just a very.  OK, is is I think there is a tendency, I think there's a very human thing and also in technology where everything is exponential chip growth and speed and processors, a lot of hardware things to assume that certain kinds of things or not soon, but to feel that they're going to be going to continue at the rate of pace.  In artificial intelligence, we've seen again and again that there have been significant, particularly artificial intelligence, but in other software related capacities, we've seen again and again that things have improved to a certain point and then less.  And then leveled off and only eeked out improvements after that.  And I will remember very distinctly interviewing Jan Lacoon almost 10 years ago, who's one of the fathers of deep learning.  Deep learning came out of the stalls they had in previous machine learning algorithms that could never get beyond.  I don't know what it was.  Eighty something percent recognition on photo matching on voice recognition.  Deep learning was the new thing is can get to 100 percent.  And he said, even in the middle of all this, it's like 2015 or something.  He said, well, deep learning is kind of we're reaching the end.  It's not going to improve that much more.  We're eking it out.  Maybe this new kind of learning.  I forgot what it's called.  It's not reflexive, but it's like a responsive learning thing with a cycle.  I think it might be more like the generative adversarial network approach that that develop.  He said this has some promise, but I don't know.  Like he wasn't like throw away deep learning.  We got to this.  We got so much better, but it's not there.  I am absolutely convinced we're going to see this level off in the same way.  So I don't think there is a 99.99 percent for large language models or any combination of things.  But I think we will will certainly be better than the state we are now.  And chat GPT four is so much better than three point five.  You can compare them side by side.  But I don't think it's going to be a I would strongly disagree that it's going to be an exponential improvement.  I think we are we are near we're getting towards the top of the significant improvements that can be made.

Transcript:  I think it's going to continue to improve.  But I mean, I will say in terms of the human brain and what we know, this stuff is very far from that.  You know, these things still have issues with inference.  They cannot do it.  They can't do basic tasks that even a child can do yet.  So there is and I don't think the large language models are going to improve upon that.  I'm saying, though, in terms of what we're doing right now with them, they're going to improve very,  very quickly simply because of the exposure amount of people that are using them and the data that's being fed into them has never been done at this scale.  And so I think we'll see a large improvements.  I'm very skeptical of AI currently in the sense that it's going to reach, you know, our AGI.  You know, I think that should be far off.  We don't even understand how the human brain works ourselves, let alone being able to figure it out and these kind of systems.  So I'm not saying we're going to reach that far.  But I think within what we're doing right now with LLMs, I think it's we're going to see a dramatic increase over the next few months, and especially when we go to the next level of GPT.  But it will be confined. You're right.  I mean, we're not going to have like robots walking around in two years, you know, like, you know, acting like people.  This is Jermaine.  This is Jermaine.

Transcript:  The biggest story for Microsoft Build was AI.  I mean, this was the AI conference, starting with Sachin Adela saying we've got 50 plus AI products to show you.  I'm going to talk about five.  They're putting AI in search.  They're putting AI in Microsoft 365 in Office.  They're putting it in Windows even.  And, you know, in all the screens Microsoft showed at the very bottom in fine print, you could barely read.  It said that disclaimer, you know, this is generated by AI and may not be accurate.  But that's a lot to put on something that may not be accurate.  Rodney Brooks wrote an article to solve the problem between you two.  I will I will throw this in this.  He wrote this in 2017.  So he wrote this six years ago.  The seven deadly sins of AI predictions.  Oh, yeah.  And one of them really is.  And I think this is what's going on right now.  We're seeing how fast we were going from from Dali to Dali to to stable diffusion from chat GPT three to chat GPT four.  It looks like and it might even be Glenn exponential at this point.  But but I think you're not saying it's not exponential or it's not geometric.  What we don't know is, is it continuous?  And it's the improvement factor.

But 100, let's say it's 99.9 percent voice recognition.  Right. I just did a big roundup for for charter on AI transcription tools.  And I did earlier this year, did a lot of, you know, checking major services that are available to individuals.  And some of them also included chat GPT summaries or similar ones.  And a few months went by, the review just went up and I was doing a bunch of interviews,  doing a history of Yahoo pipes, by the way, for those who remember Yahoo.

Transcript:  I'll I'll I'll let you know.  They are very.  That's how great it was.  But so I interviewed, you know, I don't know, 10 people, all the original folks and had these 40 minutes, hour and a half conversations recorded all as I can do now.  And I take detailed notes. I try to keep verbatim quotations.  I've got a recording, but I feed it into the one of the best of these AI recognition things.  And I hadn't seen the chat GPT four version.  The summary, because I'm giving it a large language models are really good at taking a corpus of text and comparing it to a corpus of text.  It does so well with that as opposed to extrapolate.  So I'll give it the interview and it says, here's a summary of what you talked about.  I thought if I do this myself, it would take me 30 to 60 minutes to come up with a list that was that good.  And it was very good. And it was also 100 percent accurate.  There was nothing introduced. And I was like, well, here is a use case.  Here's something that works for me today.  It helps me inform my reporting because it allows me to review that and find the spots in the text.  In addition to the fact that I'm getting extremely reliable, like 97, 98 percent AI transcription.  So that to me is kind of like, oh, we're a new golden age for reporters who need transcriptions and and more efficient ways of producing their work.  Right. Without giving up the actual writing part.

Transcript:  So there's some useful things. I know that the big one where you get in trouble is anytime you use the word think, because these are not thinking.  They can't extrapolation is a good word. They cannot take existing facts and extrapolate from it.  Brooks uses the example of, you know, you can have a picture recognize that that's two guys in the park throwing a frisbee and you might say, wow, that's really impressive.  But you can't say, well, can you eat a frisbee? How far can you throw frisbee?  He doesn't know frisbee. It's it doesn't it doesn't understand the concept of frisbee.  It's not thinking. And I think we owe it to the unwashed man.  The unwashed masses, normal people to to kind of really belabor that point.  The problem is, we're all so excited about this and it fits our science fiction fantasies that I think we've oversold it to people.

Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Yeah, it's normal that we enter for more eyes, you know, or like they're thinking and we do it.  We see faces everywhere and we see with the face.  We treat it differently. You know, so humans are just wired to sort of see this behavior and then extrapolate from it and believe that.  So we're just naturally flawed. You're right, though.  I mean, we do need to get it out there, you know, that this definitely has limits.  But like I said, it's being rolled out in so many different ways that it's really starting to make an impact.  It's just gone from a buzzword and there's research and here's a new paper to like, oh, here's this product.  Oh, here's another product. And I think that's why it's just getting so much attention.  Right. I mean, if you look at stable diffusion, looking at video, it was just that I don't know if you guys saw the video going around with the Santas in the off playing in the office on the show.  They replaced Michael's face with the Santas's face.  And it's it's not 100 percent, but it looks really pretty good.  And so, you know, how this these kind of things affect elections coming up and everything, it's going to be it's going to be real.  You know, so I think that's the threat.  The idea, though, that these things are thinking and all this, it's, you know, we've got a long way to know what that happens.

But it's there are things like I'm working on a website right now and I have not found a graphical tool I like.  I'm so old. I remember good graphical tools.  They don't exist anymore. And I've kind of forgotten a lot of my HTML, CSS and JavaScript.  So I'm using chat GPT-4.  I'm like, hey, I don't say I've forgotten.  Hey, dear, Mr. Miss Java, chat GPT.  I say, you know, how do I make a box that is centered?  How do I do this? Whatever. And it spits out.  This is like copilot, right? But I'm asking kind of very specific questions.  I had a problem on a page. I described it natural language.  I said, why does the page move back and forth when I've got this with this CSS properties?  Oh, you need to do set overflow property to whatever.  And I was like, oh, my God, that's it.  But I gave it this like paragraph long description of a problem.  And again, it's a verifiable solution.  It said this is the thing I tested and it worked.  I didn't say like I've, you know, I'm a hemophiliac and I'm bleeding.  What do I do? That's probably not a good, probably not a good idea.  Some people's use of it. That's an example.  You know, I look at this video, I think we are heading into an election.

They sponsor our studio. We're big fans. You may say, well, who's ACI Learning?  I know you know the name I.T. Pro.  They've been with us since they started in 2013.  I.T. Pro is now part of ACI Learning's family.  I.T. Pro's capabilities continue to grow.  They have those great highly there's their studio.  I've been there in Gainesville. Highly entertaining.  Literally bingeable short format content that teaches you I.T.  skills so you can get the certifications so that you can get the job.  There's over seven thousand hours now in their library and they're creating new content every day, Monday through Friday.  And by the way, great content for enhancing your existing skills.  If you've got an I.T. team for building their skills, if you're an MSP, you must love I.T.  Pro. We know it.  We know it. And ACI Learning.  Thirty percent of ACI Learners are managed service providers.  ACI Learning is dedicated to supporting your MSP team through any challenges.  An MSP, you're selling the expertise of your team, their ability to solve problems for your clients.  They will love. They will love ACI Learning.  For instance, the ACI Learning Practice Labs, a place you can test and experiment before deploying new apps or updates  without compromising your live system. That's pretty cool.  Try out your skills on virtual machine labs. You could just do it with a browser and be running Windows Server, desktop clients.  You can run it anywhere. Mac OS, Linux, iOS, Windows.  You can prepare for challenging certification examinations with practice exams.  It's always best to take the test before you take it for real.  You could take and retake tests to make sure you're ready to sit for the certification exam.  One happy MSP team leader told us, quote, I had 110 engineers in the field.  Wow. We had dozens of IT Pro accounts last year alone.  They passed over 40 certs. That's real success.  If your IT training isn't raising your team to the level you need, you need ACI Learning.  And by the way, ACI Learning's content is so bingeable, is so high quality.  The industry average completion rate on these videos from other companies around 30 percent.  70 percent of people bail out. With IT Pro, it's an over 80 percent completion rate.  Why? Because these are great. They're entertaining. They're fun. And you're really learning.  Don't settle for subpar training. This is the format IT Pros want.  And with their Pro portal, you can assign courses. You can manage seats. You can unassign and assign team members.  You can even create custom programs for your team.

I'm just celebrating a very nice race from my man, Fernando Alonso in the Formula One.  I thought, you know, you wear a team jersey during football games. It's OK, right? I can wear a fire suit. If it gets spicy in here, I'm ready.  All right, let's get back to AI. You were mentioning the picture.  It was, you know, it's funny because I, this picture of the Pentagon on fire, which was, you know, obviously a fake Pentagon was not on fire.  The New York Times blamed AI for it. And I really think that was kind of a mistake. It really was Twitter that spread it. Right?  You could have done that in Photoshop. Was that an AI thing or a Twitter thing or a social media thing?

Start time: 2552.38

Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true. I mean, they probably did latch onto the AI for the buzz. But yeah, you're right. I mean, this is the danger of social networks. Right.  I mean, we saw that when they had the verified accounts and, you know, what was it? Oh, that one one was trying to be a pharmaceutical company. So they're going to give away insulin for free.

Transcript:  Well, that's exactly what happened here. This was a fake Bloomberg account, right? That had the blue check, tweeted this picture of the Pentagon burning and the stock market plummeted as a result.  You know, I think CNN got it right. Verified Twitter accounts share fake image of explosion causing confusion. Donnie O'Sullivan knows what he's talking about. He's a smart guy who was banned from Twitter for a while.  AI generated. Yeah. But you know what? If you look at it, it's not a good, again, we 70 year olds might not know that that fence is all munged up. But it's pretty obviously fake. Whether it was Photoshopped or AI is kind of irrelevant.  The real issue was it was tweeted out by an account that looked like it was Bloomberg with a blue check.

Like, you know, there's an efficiency gained over human Photoshop.  But yeah, I think the you know, I think the information environment is more the issue here. Like our our tea Russia today was one of the accounts that shared it legit.  By the way, the legitimate RT account because they loved it. Right. Yeah.

The it took the fire department from Arlington, Virginia, to tweet that it and the Pentagon Force Protection Agency said there is no explosion or incident taking place anywhere near the Pentagon.  No hazards to the public and then the stock market recovered.  Yeah, to me, that's really more about blue checks. And, you know, that's something people have to learn to the blue check on Twitter.

Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  It's going to be doesn't mean the same thing as it used to. Yeah, no, that's definitely that's a whole other thing. But like I would say with AI to what's interesting about AI is, of course, you could generate these images, but you can also use AI to detect these images.  Right.  Right. Like there are ways to do that to analyze the photos and videos to and what should happen is all these companies, Microsoft included, should be investing in technologies that do that as as part and parcel of making these other technologies.  And what social networks need to do and maybe be legislated into doing is implementing these safeguards into the system so that they're automatically detected and flagged as AI generated like this is going to be possible.  This is not out of the realm of, you know, like science fiction.  But right now, I mean, Elon Musk doesn't care about any of that.

Just it's a good thing to have around. Okay, it is pretty funny. Okay, I'm sorry. Don't, no, no.  The top five announcements from Microsoft Build that you need to know. All right.  It was really an AI show, right? Chat GPT gets Bing integration. That's not new, is it?

Start time: 3014.12
End time: 3052.46
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Well, so yeah, actually kind of is. So the problem with chat GPT was it was, you know, locked off basically to the end of 2021 for information.  And so if you asked about like the basketball game last night with the Celtics, it would have no idea what you're talking about. Where Bing does, Bing has access to the search engine.  And so that's the difference between the two. Otherwise, they're effectively the same. So what happens now is there's a plug in and they're going to allow basically chat GPT to have access to Bing.  So that becomes more effective. So the differences between chat GPT and Bing are really blurring now, which is good for Microsoft because users don't need to choose between them and see what the plugins.

Start time: 3053.38
End time: 3085.00
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Oh, see. OK. So I read the I read the headline backwards because chat Bing had already had chat GPT integrated. Right.  This is now chat GPT getting Bing integrated. So it has more up to date search results, not just Bing either.  Quite a few extensions. You know, they talked about OpenTable, which has been around for a while and Zapier, but they're adding quite a few extensions.  And this kind of makes sense because now like Wolfram Alpha, that's not new, but that's in there.

Transcript:  Yeah. So what happened was chat GPT announced the plugin support week ago.  It's like six weeks ago. And then Microsoft announced plugin support a couple of weeks ago.  And then at Build, what they basically announced was, hey, our plugins, they're interoperable.  Oh, build them for Bing. They work on chat GPT. Build for chat GPT. They're going to work on Bing, which is great because as a developer,  you don't want to have to choose between these two systems if you have limited resources.  And you're not going to have to do that anymore. There is going to be the same system, which is going to be really beneficial for Microsoft here because they're going to reap the benefits.

He brought up Bill Gates definition of a platform, which is a platform is something that the people who use it make more money than the platform makers make in effect.  Right. Microsoft created.  Microsoft knows better than anybody the power of a platform.  It created Windows and the people who developed on top of Windows did very well and and I guess made more money in aggregate than Microsoft did.  But everybody benefited from that.  So Microsoft says this is a new platform, essentially. Yes.  Yeah. Oh, yeah, absolutely.  Now they were able to get this plug in format compatible with chat GPT because they own 47% of chat GPT.

Yeah, that makes a lot.  And so he was like, all right, well, I'm going to go.  But then he said, I'll still give you some money.  And they're like, all right, cool.  And then he didn't give the money.  And then all of a sudden they want to scale up because Google was doing these large LLMs.  And then that's where Microsoft came in.  So Microsoft's like, here's a couple of billion dollars.  That's how it all happened.  So technically this is, yeah, it's all Musk's creation.  It's his creation from the beginning of OpenAI and its creation where it is now because of his actions.  Yeah.

The supercomputer was that was 2020, I believe, that Microsoft and OpenAI announced that they're going to use that to train their LLMs.  So that's a big difference here with Microsoft versus some of the other, you know, that's where I worry about Apple.

Transcript:  We'll get to Apple because Apple's coming up with a big announcement.  And I'll be very curious how they respond.  You know, we've been really watching Google and Microsoft go back and forth over AI.  Right. There was Google I.O. where it was AI every three seconds.  I have to say, Bard, Google's chat engine search engine, it seems a little bit laggard compared to chat GPT.  But Google's now integrating it into their own search with SGE.  It's a Google Labs thing.  So there's and then Microsoft comes back with their own volley of AI applications.  So that was the first one. Bing integration. Bing chat is boosted with plugins.  Oh, here's the plugin slide. This is this is the one with with all of the plugins from Adobe to Zillow and everything in between.  Spotify. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, they did this. They said the Spotify thing like four times.  It's really we we did.  We covered both keynotes with Rich Campbell on day one and Rich and Paul Theron on day two.  And both times they announced that you could generate a Spotify playlist.  Like this is the number one thing people want to do.

I mean, I'm still using quicken.  But, you know, I'm sure this has been talked about before, but it's this is continues the culmination of like Google search results are terrible.  And I wonder if one of the reasons that Microsoft's been able to have so much room to run on this is that I mean, I am sick of Google results.  Like I even if chat GPT is making stuff up, it's better than when I got out of Google.  So I think Bing has an incredible opportunity if they get if Microsoft doesn't mess it up with all the extensions with the whole approach that it could dramatically leapfrog.  I mean, I get I am completely concerned about the shape of inaccurate results.  But at the same time, I get an accurate results on Google.  You search and you search almost anything on Google now.  And often if the first or second result isn't good for me, I have to go down pages or do a ton of refinement.  It can take me five or ten minutes to shape a Google search that actually gets me past the spam.  And that is unacceptable.  And I also don't blame them because I'm sure the you know, there's a war in heaven that's always going on between the spamming search results and not.  But it would be great.  It would be great if this is one way to cut through it is that you can't spam the LLMs the way you can a Google search index.

Transcript:  I've been using Bing for for many, many years, but because you have to as a job occupation, but you prefer it.  I actually prefer and plus I get, you know, there's the credits you get on Bing.  So I have like two hundred and thirty thousand credits and I can go and read those for like hours.  I can read even for Amazon cards and Spotify cards.  And I'm just being rewards are better than I thought.  They're really good. I mean, it literally does pay you to and say we were shopping.  You got money back on shopping, too. So it's really good in the US.  I think Microsoft's problem is outside the US.  It starts to not be as good where Google tends to have a little bit better global presence.  I've been hearing this from a lot of people that Google search results have just been not as good.  That said, there's not a ton of evidence currently that Microsoft is gaining any significant traction with Bing, even with all this hype.  They were around two to four percent before.  They may be slightly higher now. I don't know if they're going to be.

And I just I finally found a site that had a good discount on a hotel I wanted to stay at.  And I ended up picking up the phone because I just did not trust that the website Google was serving me was, you know, was reputable.  You know, it's not it wasn't Expedia or Priceline or one that I'd heard of.  And I think that, you know, I think that a lot of a lot of searches are kind of degraded at this point.  Let me let me let's do an experiment.

Here's a video from YouTube, a Google property, and then the Wikipedia result.  Plus, a panel that shows where you can listen to her music on YouTube, Spotify, Pandora or YouTube music.  A knowledge graph about Box, which is cribbed directly from Wikipedia, I might add.  So it's really the same as that Wikipedia result.  People also ask and now I'm below the fold.  There's songs people also search for.  There's more YouTube videos.  Finally, I get top stories.  Now Bing, let's look at Bing.  It's all its links right away.  There is a knowledge graph.  There is a top searched artists.  It's not much different.

And you get maybe one or two good results and you get hundreds of pages that are optimized.  And they're often have, they're clearly maybe pre-AI generated text that was copied and pasted.  I'm going to ask you a question that I will then answer, which is why is every how-to question that you search for,

Start time: 3793.00
End time: 3806.00

They're like, you've got a lot of views.  You can monetize this before they impose the things.  I said yes.  And I already had a Google AdSense account.  So it was just depositing small amounts over years.  And one day I looked at where it was like, oh, here's so much money you made.  And I was like, how did I make $1200 off that?

There's going to be one opportunity for Bing.  This is it.  There was also the talk that Samsung may adopt Bing as its default browser, but it looks like that's not going to happen.  They changed their mind on that.  Yeah.  Yeah, that stuff like that would be needed, you know, because even though most people would still switch away, the problem is, is people are like, once you're hooked into Google, it's just like browsers.  You know the thing, but Microsoft's making a good effort here.  I mean, they're doing all they can.  It's just a changing sentiment.  There's two things that I think are always required in these situations, right?  One, and we almost have them.  We almost have them.  Google is going to be required to basically really trip up on itself and fail and annoy people enough that they want to move away.  And then there needs to be a really good alternative for people to go to.  And we're kind of almost there, but we haven't seen the actual push yet.

And she just says that Google results are bad because everything is bad on the web.  And I'm like, all right, she has a point.  Like there's a lot more fraud today than 20 years ago.  You know, there's just a lot more, she says, I think because there's a lot of economic incentive for misinformation, for clicks, for purchases.  And this all makes sense.  And this is on an interview with Freakonomics, Freakonomics podcast, where they asked, is Google getting worse?  The answer was, yeah.  And they talked to her because they figured, you know, she's actually a slightly disinterested third party now not being at the company and having led it to where it was.

I look for things like that, like like they're generic enough and you should get authoritative results because think how many there's 20 publications that have really good roundup guides on gas grills.  And often not always, but often the top results for things like that are polluted by in my maybe I have terrible results.  But my results are polluted by just the this is the best blah, blah, blah.  These, you know, nonsense things from sites that don't don't have any credibility, but they show up in Google results.  Right. So at least water cutters showed up there.

So I started Google like to see if anyone's posted anywhere a similar problem.

But a lot of publications have found it. I think all of us understand this very well on this episode.  I found it difficult for advertising dollars to support most publications.  And so some went to subscribers, but a lot followed.  Wirecutter was a little cutting edge in looking at the how far you could push the we are totally editorial independent, which they were and are.  And the we're taking money for referring you to a place in this slightly hands off transaction.  And, you know, in I remember long ago back in 2000 or something, the Seattle Times said we're never going to put advertisements on our cover.  And, you know, fast forward 15 years of Seattle Times, of course, they have ads on their on their cover.  It's the same thing. Every site now has affiliate relationships because it's a much more reliable form of income than anything else.  So you go on.

Microsoft has been using the phrase copilot or the brand copilot, starting, I think, with GitHub copilot.  Right. That's now two years old.  And it's now spreading. The latest copilot is Windows copilot.  What does it what does it do, Daniel?

Transcript:  Yeah, so I mean, it's just kind of funny.  We jokingly call it Cortana 2.0.  Yeah, they have that in there. Yeah.  Kind of. Yeah. So it's not that radically different.  Obviously doesn't look like Cortana.  It's not called that. It does pop out from the side, though.  And it's going to be accessed to the chat being chat as well.  So that's not a huge thing. But the bigger deal is it can act upon windows.  You can ask it to do things, you know, put my computer into dark mode and, you know, go to do my windows update.  And you can actually do more voice commands that are more advanced to get the operating system to do stuff that you may not have known where it is or whether it could do it or not.  And so this is, I think, where the first step of where these digital systems may actually become useful.  I mean, you think like Siri has been around for so long now, and that really is not improved. Right.

Transcript:  So none of them. None of them have. In fact, we were talking earlier, Micah and I on Ask the Tech guys.  Somebody said in my nursing home, I used to set an alarm with the Google Assistant, you know, set alarm for 450.  And then for a long time, I could say how much time is left in the alarm.  Now it just says you have an alarm set for 450. It's gotten dumber.  And he said, why is it getting dumber? But this seems like all three assistants have been very disappointed.  Serious, serious, serious, terrible, but none of them are very multi trillion dollar company.  What are you doing? But I'm not sure I want chat GPT in there because it's going to go on and on and on.

Transcript:  Well, let me tell you, you had, you know, I mean, I just like to be able to say like, I can't Siri currently.  If I say, you know, send a text message to my child's name, it'll say mobile or email.  And I'm like, well, I don't know what's the thing I've used for the last seven years to use them.  Maybe that would be the method. And then if you say mobile or email, it's like, I don't know what you're talking about.

Transcript:  Email is where I do really look forward to this stuff with machine learning and what we're calling A.I.  is the ability to learn a user's behavior so that it can act upon stuff usually proactively.  Right. It's like, well, you usually do this around this time, you know, or like say right now you can get a notification.  You have a meeting coming up. Cool. Why not?  You know, it works. You did get watches you into the meeting or get you set up for it.  Right. It actually acts upon the thing before you need to do it yourself.  I think that's sort of the next level of this stuff that I'm really kind of looking forward to.  And you can ask things probably to look at your documents.  That's because they have copilot now coming out for that document summary thing.

Transcript:  Someone could have if someone had published it, it wouldn't have been entirely inaccurate  because it did actually accurately only use quotes from the article and it used them essentially correctly.  It was boring and it didn't have any. There was no reason for the article to exist.  It didn't have a conclusive tone to it. Right. It wasn't analytical.  But you could add all that. I was like after the fact. I mean, yeah, I don't.  I I'd look forward to that to not to that not being my job.  That's why, you know, I don't know.

Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  No, I want it to be an enhancement and I hope it will be.  I think again, as a writer, I have particular, you know, we all have particular needs that there are things  and any like transcription is an incredible leg up like having a transcript of everything that's brief.  If it's not perfect, I can go listen to the audio and fix it up.  So it's verbatim in a few seconds. That is an incredible enhancement over, you know, I mean, that that alone,  like that could save hours on a long article. Very even with Microsoft teams.

Transcript:  They're rolling it out real soon. So it's the thing that Fireflies.ai is the transcription service I'm using.  And it puts action items at the bottom and they were again, it's because it's taking a data input  and not extrapolating. It seemed to do a fairly good job.  Like if I were doing, I mean, for an average meeting where you don't need you would never transcribe, you never pay for a transcriptionist.  You never pay for someone to analyze it. Someone might post some notes somewhere.  This becomes an incredible company tool if every meeting can wind up being searchable and have some extracted stuff from it that that helps.  I mean, think about I just think meetings are terrible to begin with.  But having meetings and then having all the value lost because there's no way to harvest what was discussed except for people's imperfect note taking as it passes through the telephone game of office stuff.  Just a transcript of everything could be helpful. I mean, it might also be bad. It could cause a lot of hurt feelings too.

Transcript:  Well, or if you missed an action item that was critical and it didn't know what was an action item.  I mean, yeah, I guess it's figuring it out from the words you use or something.  Anyway, I want to take a break because there is something we haven't addressed that is really the dirty little secret of all of this.  And Microsoft didn't really address it either. I don't think they did.  But Daniel Rubino is here from Windows Central. He will he will correct me if I'm wrong.  Owen Thomas, always great to have you from the San Francisco Examiner.  And we're going to keep putting pressure on you to bring Dithuradi back because we love Dithuradi.  And while you're at it, bring back Yahoo pipes and then everybody will be happy.  Glenn Fleischman. I miss Yahoo pipes so much. I often miss them.  It was a great thing. It's a thing.

Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  I think I am trying to think of a piece of technology that people have more nostalgia for than Yahoo pipes, partly because it showed a lot of promise and it was frozen for like seven years before it died.  So it never had a chance to decline. It just sat there and ambered.  Everyone stared at it like a rare fossilized dinosaur bone or something.

Transcript:  Anyway, they killed it. So no point in mourning it.  And you should probably learn Python because it's not coming back.  Our show anyway. Great to have you too, Glenn Fleischman, for many, many points.  But we will talk about your new book coming out with Mars in witchery that you wrote called Shift Happens.  It's imminent. It's imminent.  And if you contributed to the Kickstarter, you'll you'll hear some good news in just a bit.  But first word from our sponsor, Worldwide Technology, WWT.  We love WWT. Lisa and I went out there just before the pandemic broke before lockdown.  And we saw the amazing Advanced Technology Center.  The ATC is at the heart of worldwide technology.  It's a research and testing lab that brings together half a billion dollars of equipment from the leading OEMs and emerging disruptors.  All the companies that enterprises might be using to get business done.  Why do they build this?  Well, initially, so their engineers could spin up proofs of concept, could get to know products, could use them in the lab before rolling them out to customers.  But there's now a really great feature to the ATC.  You can use it too.  The ATC offers hundreds of on demand and schedulable labs featuring solutions that include technologies representing the latest advances in enterprise.  Everything from cloud to security to networking, primary and secondary storage, data analytics.  Absolutely.  If you want to learn what the cutting edge and AI is, for instance, AI used for business intelligence, they've got it all in the labs.  DevOps, agile, so much more.  WWTs, engineers and partners use the ATC.  But you can too.  It'll cut your evaluation time from months to weeks.  It'll introduce you to new ideas, new technologies.  It'll help you do the thing you do best with technology that supports you.  Before you go to market, you can access technical articles, expert insights, demonstration videos, white papers.  Of course, those hands on labs, all the tools you need to stay up to date.  And not only is it a physical lab space, but they've virtualized it.  So you don't even have to go to St. Louis like we did to use the ATC platform.  Anybody can access these amazing resources anywhere in the world.  365 days a year at no cost to you.  So while you're there, make sure to check out WWTs events and communities.  We did a great panel event.  It was so much fun.  For more opportunities to learn about technology trends, to hear about the latest research and insights from the experts,  we've sent Lou Maresca from This Week in Enterprise Tech out.  He did a great keynote last year.  Whatever your business needs, WWT can deliver scalable, tried and tested tailored solutions to help you succeed in business.  Because WWT understands business.  They bring strategy and execution together to make that new world happen.  To learn more about worldwide technology, the Advanced Technology Center, and to gain access to all those great free resources,  it's simple. Just go to www.t.com slash twit.  www.t.com slash twit.  Create a free account on their platform and you're in, man.  And it is really a wonderful place. These are great people.  www.t.com slash twit.  And by the way, please do us a favor and use the full URL so they know you saw it here.  www.t.com slash twit.  So to me, the dirty little secret of all of this is it's hideously expensive.  And right now it's being subsidized, right?  By Microsoft to gain a foothold into a new market.  But that can't continue forever, Daniel.

Start time: 5000.03
End time: 5121.47
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  No, of course not. It's going to be charged.  And I've heard this from Microsoft off the record that, you know,  I shouldn't be pricing, but like it's obvious, right?  They're going to charge us somehow that who knows the mechanism mechanism for likely,  I would say, Microsoft 365.  They already have a subscription program that it can come through.  You know, we'll start probably with enterprise and say have deep pockets and typically don't mind spending that.  How that trickles down to consumers.  There's, you know, Microsoft 365 there where you get a terabyte, one drive access to office and all these other perks.  You know, they could have another tier. It's an extra couple of dollars a month.  But yeah, the economics.  I think there's two issues here.  One, they're currently not charging for it simply because the value isn't there.  Right. A lot of the stuff we just talked about isn't here yet.  So co-pilot's not here yet. Coming out maybe later this year.  They'd be with co-pilot for office.  So a lot of stuff isn't here.  So it'd be premature to charge people for it when you're not really getting a lot out of it.  You know, you have the big chat. OK, it's cool.  But is that worth money?  Probably not.  They do have Bing Image Creator and it does have they call boosts.  And if you get you get the boost, you get a priority on the server and your image renders more quickly because that's the issue here.  Right. So server time, the server load and who gets access.  If you pay for chat GPT, that's one of the things you get primary access to the server.  And you it goes really fast.  A chat GPT if you're paying for it.  If you don't pay for it, yeah, you get that lag.  So this will trickle down.  I think they have time yet to make sure that there's actual value there that people will pay for.  We're not there yet.  But you're right. And the other thing they're doing, too, is they're putting a lot of emphasis on Azure and optimization.  So they really, really try that.  And they've been lowering costs internally on this stuff.  And they're going to continue to push that and continue to expect that to happen.  So that finally, I think when they do roll this out, it won't be even as expensive as it would be today if they were to do it there.  But yeah, obviously, they have to charge for the stuff.  It is very expensive.  A lot of server space.

Transcript:  I mean, when you're talking about building it into Windows 11, and we've talked a lot about Windows Weekly,  really being maybe that's what Windows 12 will be, is Windows with AI.  Then you have a billion people all of a sudden hitting, hammering your servers.  Plus the cost of building these large language models, which is steep, even though Microsoft owns Azure,  it still costs some money to run it.  Yeah.  But it's your sense.  I don't want you to breach your NDA, but it's your sense that they are thinking about this and they think it's going to be OK.  Yeah.

Start time: 5163.40
End time: 5183.93
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  I mean, like I said, they already have a subscription plan for enterprise and consumers where they can just build these costs into it.  I think the question right now is what's the perceived value that people would pay?  Right.  How much would they pay?  You can't charge them yet.  And can they reduce?  Yeah.  And how much can they reduce the actual costs before rolling that out?  Glenn, you've pinpointed a great use of it.

Transcript:  For just the transcription or for the summaries?  I'm paying Fireflies right now while I'm actively reporting because I don't always have a big article like that.  We have to do tons of interviews.  I think it's $19 a month.  That's not bad.  They give you 8,000 minutes of uploads and unlimited Zoom.  I pay 20 for chats with the chat GPT.

Start time: 5225.50
End time: 5271.97
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  I was wondering whether with the Fireflies, I'm thinking what engine are they using?  Maybe if it's proprietary, what's the computational load, storage load?  I don't know how many people are using a substantial amount of the process, but it can't be.  AWS services, Amazon services are incredibly cheap per minute.  I can't conceptualize it, I guess.  You can run some of the models.  You can download and run on a phone.  I know phones are supercomputers now anyway.  Legitimately, the fact that you can run some of this stuff in very low-end hardware compared to what you get at a data center makes me think that the computational cost must be relatively low, but it's nothing when you multiply it by time.  If I peg my CPU on an iPhone, well, that's fine.

Start time: 5276.44

By the way, how much did Nvidia's stock price go up this week?  They became almost a trillion dollar company.  And I think a lot of that is because of build.

Start time: 5343.06
End time: 5363.86
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Because they need their GPUs and everything for AI.  They're positioned, and they do their own AI.  Nvidia is positioned really well for the future.  They're in automotive, they're in gaming, they're in every growth category, basically.  They've been releasing products.

Transcript:  It's kind of crazy that the GPU, which was this very specialized niche thing,  mostly of interest to gamers or people who were computer animators,  has become this really desirable computing commodity.  And Intel has badly missed that transition.  No kidding.  It's not the only transition that Intel missed.

Start time: 5413.97

I will say that with Intel, don't forget, so we're talking about server costs and all that, and that's true.  But there's the other half of this that's coming out, right?  And it's already kind of out, NPUs, right? Neural Processing Units.  So you'll have localized processing.

Start time: 5498.18
End time: 5533.94
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, this was a big, big thing, by the way, at Build.  I think Paul Therop brought this up.  A lot of the technologies they were talking about on-device technologies require an NPU.  Only, I mean, right now only Qualcomm makes NPUs.  It's going to be the fall before the Meteor Lake Intel processors with Neural Processing Units come out.  Of course, Apple stuff all has NPUs now because they're using their own chips.  Microsoft's going to be a little bit behind because of that.  They've got to get NPUs out.  I think just the Surface Go, right, or Surface X uses...

Start time: 5534.00
End time: 5560.98
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Surface Pro 9, yeah, has it because...  Pro 9 has it.  Well, the 5G version, because that's ARM.  So that can do native background blurring, AI tracking, and all that kind of stuff, and that's NPU.  Right now we're relying on GPUs mostly to do that, and occasionally CPUs.  Fine, but it's brute force.  NPUs are hard-coded designed to handle AI.  Intel does have theirs coming out, but yeah, you're right.  Technically right now it's just Qualcomm, and they've been doing it for years because of smartphones.  Right, yeah.

Start time: 5562.06
End time: 5588.53
Speaker: Owen Thomas
Transcript:  I just want to point out that Qualcomm is worth slightly more than Intel.  They're both around $120 billion, but Qualcomm's a little more.  AMD, which has long been the underdog runner-up to Intel, is worth $200 billion, and Nvidia is worth $960 billion.  They've been flirting with that $1 trillion.  They're almost a trillion. Can you imagine that?  Eight times as valuable as Intel.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Intel's saving grace right now is their foundries, you know, that they build chips, and they're going to be building chips for other companies, including Qualcomm.  Right.  And that's their, you know, I think their next big business move as, but their processors are catching up.  I think their positions long term, they're going to do all right.

Windows 11 is getting cloud powered OS backup and restore the kind of thing that we've got with an iPhone and you've got with your Android phone.  Windows.  We had with Windows 8.  Well, really, this was a Windows 8 feature that disappeared.  Yeah.

End time: 5714.00
Speaker: Daniel Rubino
Transcript:  Wow.  Yeah. Yeah.  A lot of people upset about that.  Yeah. So it's a basic function, right?  That when you say you get a new Windows 11 PC, you install it, you log into your account.  And then the question is, all right, what are the apps I need to install?  You know, and if you have a pretty previous Windows 11 device, this is just going to populate the stuff from the store on your start menu again, just like a smartphone would when you, you know, transfer your old.  That's awesome.  Actually, that's a great.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Pretty basic.  You know, but yeah, Windows 8 used to have it and then it got rid of it and people been wanting it back ever since.

Actually, I think really this whole arm thing is interesting because Windows on arm historically has kind of not been great.  I found it's getting better and better.  I've started using it on my Mac and emulation or no, not emulation in VM.  Well, it is emulation, I guess in hypervisor and hypervisors, VMware.  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  It's parallels and it actually runs great.  It really runs.  It's very snappy.  Yeah.  Is Microsoft going to how important is arm to Microsoft?

Transcript:  Very important, but don't forget Apple has a different strategy.  Apple is like we're switching from x86 to arm and we're just going to throw that switch and everybody has to come over to it.  And because they can do that, they do and they were in just a better position long term with their chips.  Microsoft is will support arm, but we're going to keep x86 around.  And that's two different strategies.  And so they're getting their Windows 11 is much more optimized for arm than Windows 10 was.  And Windows 12 will be even more of that.  At build, we saw them bring over a unity is now on arm and a bunch of other tools that are needed for developers to build apps.  We're doing a basic app right now.  You can do it in arm.  Not a problem.  And you can even do hybrid apps now x86 and arm.  But the problem is we have very complicated apps that rely on other libraries.  Those libraries don't support arm.  Right.  You know, it's a problem.  And so that's been the journey there combined with qualcomm's chips.  Haven't been that impressive.  They've been getting better, but they've always been like compared to what last gen Intel has done.  The big thing now we're expecting is, of course, the new via chips, what are called the onyx processors.  I expect those to be debut later this year in the sense that they'll premiere them.  They'll talk about them, the architecture, the processing speeds.  I don't think we'll see them ship until at least summer 2024, maybe fall 2024.  So we're still far out.  But according to Qualcomm, they've had a lot of design wins, meaning a lot of OEMs are committed to building laptops and devices around these chips more so than any other.  At that Qualcomm says 2024 will be the pivot point for Windows on arm.  That's going to be where we're going to really start to see it take off.  Will that happen?  Will onyx deliver?  I think it's a tough challenge, especially a gen one chip, but it is the ex Apple engineers.  So fingers crossed.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's an interesting story.  Guy left who was instrumental in the design of the Apple chips left Apple founded new via Apple suit him.  He countered suit.  I think those suits have been dropped because he took a lot of employees with him to new via and then Qualcomm bottom.  And so that's how Qualcomm got into the race.  It's interesting because when Apple came out with these Apple Silicon chips, they were performant.  They were low power.  They had NPUs built in.  They had integrated memory.  It looked like they had kind of leapfrogged the PC industry.  And I imagine that all of this is in response to that.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Windows fans and Windows fans have this weird fantasy that Microsoft is just going to build an arm processor.  It's going to come out the gates.  Gen one.  It's going to blow everybody away.  And that's going to be the end of it.  And it's less like that's not how any of this works.  Yeah.  Apple came out the M1, but it took him 10 years.  10 years.  Yeah.  They were doing it for a very long time and they had a lot of devices to test it on and scale.  Microsoft does not have an A4 processor to start with to build up to an M1.  Apple was putting these out on the iPhone for years.  Yeah.  So I think there's some truth to this in this sense that I do believe Microsoft experiments with chips and chip design.  I think that's actually publicly known that they've done that.  They've done it with, you know, for server chips and have explored that.  They have people working on it.  They build their own co-processors.  That's public knowledge.  They have them in the Surface device.  So they do.  And they use them at HoloLens.  They use them in Xbox.  So they do build microprocessors, but they don't do it at the scale of like what Apple is doing.  That said, I wouldn't be surprised that back in 2019 and 20, they were, you know, looking into this, which is where the Bloomberg story came out.  Saying that Microsoft was looking to build its own processors to use in Azure, and they may trickle down to Surface devices.  I think what happened, though, was they were hedging their bets if Qualcomm couldn't, wasn't up to the task of Windows and committing to it.  Or they didn't, they were going back out of that market.  So I think, but then what happened was Qualcomm in 2021 bought Nuvia for $1.4 billion.  I think they did that because it was a strategic decision, but it was also sending a message to Microsoft.  Hey, we're serious.  We're serious. We're committing to this.  I think Microsoft was OK.  Why would we need to build our own chip at this point when we're going to get it from these people?  It doesn't make sense for Apple to make their own processor.  Microsoft. Yeah.

Dr. Vivek Murthy cited a profound risk of harmed adolescent mental health and urged families to freak out.  No.  To set limits.  OK.  And governments to set tougher standards for use.

So I think there's a lot to be said for it's time for government to step in because the companies are, you know, it's not like they're ignorant of the problem.  They're fully aware of the problem.

Transcript:  I mean, I think that, you know, the question of whether a state should have the authority to ban an app is separate from is that app actively harming people?  I also you know, I also think that like humans are our own worst enemies.  We will find ways to hurt each other, whether it's in person, in writing.  You know, the founding fathers used to like rip each other, you know, rip rip each other apart in like pamphlets that they circulated.  If you've you know, if you've watched Hamilton, you know a little bit about this.  But to the point, I mean, aside from being a decade too late, I think I think there is a lot of value here to the surgeon general, even you know, even if it doesn't lead to regulation, just saying this is a real problem.  The the flip side is that this horse is out of the barn.  Teens are going to use social media.  What we need to do is adapt to it and, you know, like figure out how to, you know, figure out how to get our, you know, our youth like in a healthy place where they can be on social media, know how to take it with a certain lightness and grace.  And, you know, and and also behave appropriately because, you know, a lot of the problem is, you know, teens bullying other teens, you know, it's it's mean girls on, you know, internet, you know, on internet steroids.

There's been a lot of efforts at state and federal level to declare it that.  And it's funny, the social media thing might fall in the same category where it's like, yeah, we all think we all but a significant number of people think it's a it's a bad idea to laugh under federal access.  But firearms a different issue in that regard.  But how do you provide it with how do you not do it?  Something that violates the Constitution, whether or not you support the full range of it in the Second Amendment or really want it in the First Amendment?  Well, I guess you're right.

Start time: 6633.14

Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  I mean, this is the double edged sword of giving corporate free speech rights is that corporations have expanded rights and they they would have 20 to 50 years ago that allow them to defend themselves in that way.  It's ironic when free speech maximalists are saying that corporations like Disney can't say what they want to say.  It's sort of a funny thing.  I mean, I guess it's always the only the freedom from repercussion is not what the First Amendment says.  The freedom from government intervention and your right to have speech.  But I don't know.  We kept our kids off devices.  They did not have full time devices until they were in their early teens and they didn't have access to devices overnight.  And we set limits.  That's probably a good idea.  Contract with them that schools had suggested about usage and a couple of times like, oh, set up an Instagram account without telling you.  But we're not going to, you know, you tell what's fine.  And so now, of course, when I got off Twitter, they both got on both my 16 year old 18 year old just for the lulls.  But they're mature enough to deal with it because they laugh at Twitter as opposed to are sucked into its dramas.

And it's you know, it's not free speech because that's pretty cut and dried.  And it's not Section 230 because that's proved very tricky to kind of take apart.  And Mike Masnick, among others, has has laid out a very strong argument for why you don't want to, you know, take apart Section 230 to just to go after social media companies.  But product liability has been an interesting kind of legal tactic.  Snap, for example, was found liable.  I believe I'm not sure if this was a final ruling, but in some early rulings in a case, Snap was found liable for creating a filter that lets you post how fast you were going when you took a snap.

Transcript:  She was absolutely right.  Yeah.  Jeff, Jeff Jarvis, I'm going to channel our our host from this week in Google, posted this text from the Surgeon General 51 years ago.  All the available statistics confirm the pervasive role television plays in the United States, if not throughout the world.  More people on television sets and more people watch television that make use of any other single form of mass communication.  The question of violence on television has been one issue that was raised almost immediately after television became a major contender.  You know, warning about television.  But after that, they warned about video games, violent video games.  There's always been a new cultural phenomenon that we old people look at and say, you kids and your rock and roll.

And it was then it was the bicycle.  Yeah. So there is there is a certain irony here that we need to be careful that we're just now overreacting to what's new.  But I think social media is clearly different in some ways.  Right. The fact that it instantly accesses millions of people and its ability to spread disinformation or violence.  You know, there was I even hate talking about the story a couple of weeks ago with the torture, the animal torture videos on Twitter.  It took down there.

There doesn't seem to be a concern.  And then you have like with the Republicans, it's like you have free speech and you can do whatever you want.  But then TikTok's Chinese. So maybe we should ban it.  It's like, you know, it's all over the place.  And I don't. And meanwhile, though, and to be fair, in China, what do they do?  Right. They ban social media. They don't let the kids on stuff.  They are limited to gaming just for a couple hours a week, and they force the kids to learn stuff.  So their children are all like, you know, focus, education, engineering, and our kids are just like on social media all the time.  I mean, TikTok's not even in China. I always thought that was interesting.  Well, they have their own version of it. Yeah. Yeah.  But TikTok is for the rest of the world. Right. So it's sort of like it's a fascinating thing.

Transcript:  Well, it's like it's like accelerants are always a problem and they're hard to measure.  For some people, it has no effect.  And other people, you know, it can be a devastating thing that they wouldn't otherwise have encountered.  And so the question is, is the greater exposure to things that otherwise someone might not have seen?  Is that worse than in real life?  If the Internet didn't exist, would they be facing the same hazards at this time?  You can't really do an A.B. test on that.  I mean, we talked to our children, frankly, about drugs, and it's like we're like, look, fentanyl is a different category.  So, you know, Instagram and Facebook didn't exist when we were children.  They did fentanyl in this variety.  And it's like fentanyl is destroying people and killing people.  And it's it's not like pot or even it's not even like heroin.  It's not even like other of these super hard drugs when we were kids, you know, some of which were circulating around.  I knew people who were engaged with it's like fentanyl is a whole new thing.  So how do you respond to fentanyl?  I think there is a little bit not that Facebook is fentanyl, but it's like there is a little bit of that.  Like, well, it's a million times more powerful than the telephone and a comic book.  And it's free and it's free and your parents don't want you to do it.

I'll stay up all night if I if I start looking at Instagram, I can see doom scrolling and all that.  And, you know, I mean, there's certain things you can do.  I've fortunately my kids are a little bit older. I didn't have the same problems.  Dr. Murty has also decried the public health crisis of loneliness, isolation and the lack of connection in our country.  I think that's true.  I don't know if it's government's job to fix it, I guess, is my question.

And I think it's it's true, you know, like between the pandemic and the changing social structures  and how men is being perceived, like there's a lot of moving parts here.  And I take it for I love working from home.  I love being an introvert, being a shut in.  I'm also my 40s. I've done my time. Right.  I wasn't like that in my teens and 20s. But if you're in your teens and 20s, those are formative years to build these skills out.  And if you're not getting them, it's like it can cause a lot of problems.  And there's that issue with I forgot the name already, but they have in Japan with  pillow men, pillow brides.  Yeah, it's called like I've got the name of it, but there's a name for it.  Yeah, yeah, they don't leave the house. Oh, yeah. Yeah.  Yeah, they pull out of society, basically. And that's starting to happen here for different reasons.  You know, there's changing, you know, and now you have steroid use going up and young men because of now it's like body image stuff going on with men, too,  because everybody wants to, you know, they go on Instagram and they see all these guys who are jacked.  And it's just like there's a lot of stuff that's going on, which is why I'm not a parent, by the way, because even I'm like, well, next I don't know how I would handle this stuff either.

Is it a new psychiatric disorder?  I don't know. Next week, we'll talk. We didn't.  I meant to. I thought I would with you, Glenn, talk about what Apple's going to do a week from Monday.

Transcript:  I may have to eat a hat. You think that Apple is not going to release a VR helmet or what?  Well, my my argument was I didn't think they were going to release one as a product that would ship this year for a reasonable sum of money.  But I thought it's possible they do a developer release that would be anchored to a computer and only available to developers and in limited quantities.  And so I think I'm right about that second part.  But all the all the word that's coming out from people who seem to know birdies inside the company, which only happens when things are getting actually close to being released, that these this information comes out.  Seems like Apple will be ready to ship it this year as a consumer product.  I still think it's ridiculous.  I don't see how they're going to make it work, but I could very well be wrong.

Start time: 7465.00
End time: 7476.92
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So let's just to get this on record.  Exactly right. You're not saying they won't announce something.  You're not saying it won't be a developer product. You just don't think it will ship as a consumer product in twenty twenty three.

Start time: 7477.78
End time: 7534.72
Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it'll be out this year. It just doesn't seem right from like a like like who would buy it is what you're saying.  Yeah, well, that and physics and hardware and what's developed for it.  I don't think developers get the thing.  If Apple announces in June, even if they're ready to ship a developer test version, which they which they've done for multiple previous products in major transitions over time, then it's one thing to port software across generations of Intel hardware, Intel, M1 or whatever.  Those things have happened before.  It's another to develop stuff that's entirely new and compelling in an AR VR environment.  And I just don't think there's time to make it happen.  Yeah, I also just don't think the hardware could exist the way it's described.  It's either ridiculous if they're going to ship what's being described widely sounds like an absurd Homer Simpson's car to me.  It's not that I don't I don't think the technology exists to make a thing that won't be like that.  So that's I'm not disagreeing.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not betting against ready to be wrong.  I am not betting against you.  I think you might be wrong, but not because you're not right.  You're wrong because Apple's executives have put so much wood in those arrows that they can't pull back at this point.  So even though you're absolutely right, Apple should not do this.  They're going to do it.  And I think it's going to be the worst product mistake Apple has ever made in its history.  I mean, it's going to be.

Speaker: Glenn Fleishman
Transcript:  It's it's that's my my reaction keeps being if what I keep reading about being described is what were to ship.  It seems like a complete failure.  So I can't believe what they're going to ship will be what I keep reading about, in which case they have to violate the laws of physics or they just have some really clever hardware innovation.  We haven't seen before that is going to wow people.  And I'm willing to be wrong about that because I don't know.  I'm not in chip factories in China and across the US and in Germany or something looking at what's being made.  So it's it's plausible that it's going to be something that's going to be extraordinary.  And I'm just not ready for it.  The future shock that will hit me.  No, I think you're absolutely right.

Transcript:  The question is, do you think they're going to talk about AI?  Because they've been so quiet about any of that.  Yeah, like so.  And to me, that's the weirdest part of this.  It's like if they're doing AR VR, it's like, all right, but everybody else is just like,  we're switching positions now on that.  That's last year's fad.  We're moving on where AI is the new thing.  And here's Apple like we're going to do AR VR.  Even their geniuses and really figured us out.  Like, you know, what Glenn is kind of looting to maybe.  Or, yeah, this could be just a really big error in terms of guidance.

They've done a lot of they've done a lot of machine learning stuff that is not very flashy,  but works actually quite well.  That's the device to device and end encrypted and relies on, in some cases,  dedicated cores like Apple added, you know, OCR to photos library.  So everything, every piece of text now I can search on it.  That's extraordinary.  It's an incredible improvement.  And it's so quiet.  Most people don't know they did it because they want it just to be something that's  emergent when you search and you just oh, there's more things that will be.

Transcript:  Maybe Tim could.  That would be an interesting attack to take.  Tim Cook comes out and says, we don't think AI is ready.  We don't think it's safe.  We think it should be incorporated into existing products in a way that's safe,  reliable and private.  And that's what we do as the privacy company.  Meanwhile, casting shade on Google and Microsoft is not caring one bit about your  privacy or accuracy.  The Newton, according to Ars Technica, sold an estimated 200,000 units.  Now, it's interesting because Apple's saying they expect to sell 100,000 of these of  these nerd helmets.  So maybe Apple really is in their mind thinking this is our Newton and we will.  How long was it after the Newton came out?  They came out with the iPhone.  Was it like 12, 15 years?

Start time: 7764.00

Start time: 7767.72

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So it's exactly 10 years.  Yeah.  So it might be that might be accurate.  They might be saying in 10 years we'll have the AR device, the equivalent of the iPhone  to the Newton.  That'd be interesting, wouldn't it?  I actually have a little soft spot in my heart for the Newton.  If this is a Newton, it wouldn't be so bad.  Yeah, that wouldn't be so bad.  And by the way, let's not forget that one of the outcomes of Newton was the ARM processor,  which was the processor used in the Newton.  Apple bought or actually founded ARM based on the Acorn Risk Machine, ARM, and eventually  sold off their stake, but there would be no ARM without Newton.  I forgot about that.  So these early, you know, and Apple, I think Tim Cook is very aware of Apple history and  the lessons learned.  It might very well be.  That's how they think of this.  You've given me a new perspective on this.  So it's not that you're wrong.  You're just not right.

In the 1800s we went from being a low information society  in some ways to a high because of improvements in printing allowed the rapid transformation  of news from what happened into newspapers, and it's an incredible thing.

It's Shandlo?  I'm liking his name.  He went on the air with Walter Cronkite and demoed it, and you just zap it because the  ink would vaporize and the paper wouldn't get as hot.
