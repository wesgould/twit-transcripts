Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 246.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I don't think so.  I've known David for more than two decades.  I can't understand this.  Anyway, David's been knocking around  with tech reporting for years.  You saw him on CNET.  He was at Forbes.  He was, where else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, the funny story,  a lot of people tweeted me when the news came out  that Gawker was going in bankruptcy  and was gonna sell out to Ziff Davis.  They said, oh, you must laugh at that  as a long time like you, David, Ziff Davis employee.  And I said, no way, that's not Ziff Davis.  The people who own PC Magazine, Extreme Tech,  the old Ziff Davis assets are far from Ziff Davis.  It's J2 Global.  They're known for E-Fast.  It's not Bill Ziff anymore.  Oh, it hasn't been Bill Ziff for years.  Yeah.  But now it's like, it's the strangest thing  because J2 Global, they do e-Voice and e-Facts.  Oh, e-Facts.  Yeah, I mean, that's a big one.  Well, apparently they've made some money  because they've then started to buy up content,  digital content stuff.  So they bought PC Magazine.  That's where they, I guess you get the name Ziff Davis,  but it ain't your father's Ziff Davis.  It's a very strange conglomeration.  So I don't know.

Start time: 315.20
End time: 319.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they needed another E, so they bought E-Week.  E-Week.  Yeah, E-Week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They always eek.  Eek.com.  Fuse mail.  It's a strange, we live in strange times.  That's all I can say.  It's diversifying.  Yeah.  So what do you think of this Gawker thing?  Gawker announced that because they are not being,  they have to put up the money that they owe Hulk Hogan,  $140 million, they can't do it, Chapter 11 bankruptcy,  and they put themselves up for sale.  And I don't know if the news,  if Davis will get them or not,  but they've put up at a $100 million bid,  which is kind of the starting point for the auction.  If nobody else comes along, then they will.  We were talking before the show began.  I mean, this is kind of one of those,  for journalists, no-win situations.  On the one hand, Gawker dragged journalism  through the mud in some respects.

Start time: 367.48
End time: 388.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think a lot of publications over the years  have dragged journalism through the mud.  I mean, they've done some good work,  but you're only gonna remember,  I worked at Gizmodo for six months.  Gizmodo's good.  Lopnik's good.  Okatu is good.  I've, you know, Gawker's Gawker.  And there's, you know.  I knew there were, I mean, there were.

Start time: 391.40
End time: 411.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't really, I don't have a relationship with Nick.  That's my relationship.  I talked to him once when I got hired at Gizmodo,  and then I might've said hi to him at a company party.  And that's really about it.  I've never had a conversation with him  other than hi, welcome to Gizmodo.  I'm, thanks for giving me money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nick Gettin and Owen Thomas,  both of whom are openly gay,  announced or felt that it was best to out  Silicon Valley stalwarts who are also gay  but closeted, including Peter Thiel.  And Peter didn't take, well, that was over a decade ago.  Because at the time, maybe even this truth today,  I wouldn't be surprised,  it'd be very hard to raise money in some areas  like Saudi Arabia if you were known to be gay.  And he took offense to that  and then subsequently secretly funded Hulk Hogan  and perhaps others fight against Gawker,  a fight that Hulk won, although that will be appealed.  And it was enough to put Gawker out of business.  And while many journalists feel like,  gosh, we really ought to defend the First Amendment,  others say, couldn't happen to a nicer fella.  So where do you stand on it, Cashmere?  What's your take on this?

Start time: 467.38
End time: 544.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think Peter Thiel is far from the only  Silicon Valley billionaire who hates Gawker.  I'm not that fond of him, to be honest.  I mean, during Valleywag's heyday, they went after  a lot of billionaires.  Sheryl Sandberg at one point reportedly said  that the person who wrote Valleywag should be shot.  So they're not beloved in Silicon Valley.  But I criticize Gawker a lot.  I think they sometimes go too far in stories.  I thought the posting of the Hulk Hogan sex tape  before we found out about Peter Thiel's involvement  was horrible in that they shouldn't have done it.  But I also think Gawker does really great, important,  provocative reporting.  And they're always pushing the line  and sometimes they go too far.  But I do think that they have done really good work  over the years, along with stuff that  I found questionable.  And if they do end up declaring bankruptcy  and getting sold, Gawker itself might go away,  the actual main property covering media.  But their blogs are gonna stick around.  Gizmodo, Lifehacker, Deadspin, Jalopnik,  they're such valuable properties.  They're gonna keep doing what they do,  maybe not quite as provocative as they have been  in the past.

Start time: 545.32
End time: 555.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Gizmodo got in a little trouble too  with checkbook journalism, right?  They bought the iPhone 4 when it was left behind in a bar.  Yes.  And Denton's never shown any reluctance  to pay money for a scoop.

Start time: 557.50
End time: 570.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, I mean, that's just.  Yeah, I mean, which a lot of journalists,  including myself find, and I work for TMZ, so.  Yeah, you know what you're talking about.  I work for TMZ and Gizmodo, so.  You know what you're talking about.

Start time: 570.14
End time: 589.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've been everywhere.  David, you were concerned that this is,  Peter Thiel's actions have a chilling effect  and you're worried about the next billionaire  coming along and suing,  because there's something he doesn't like.  Uh-oh.  I think you're muted.  Oh, David, you're muted.  You're muted, unmute.  I can't hear you.

Start time: 589.34
End time: 650.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I'm unmuted, I'm better now.  Some of today's billionaires, I think,  are way more unhinged than the old ones used to be.  I never lived in particular.  I never lived in particular fear of Bill Gates,  although, Flaip Kahn certainly did for years.  I never thought that those people were going to come sue me,  but at InfoWorld, at the places that I worked,  we never did any of the kinds of things.  But we called names and we certainly made  some of these folks pretty unhappy.  You'll remember when she was used to run Novell,  now is executive chair at Google.  CNEP put his home address and information like that,  that they got off of Google, they published it,  and there was that big boycott of CNET.  That was a big deal, wasn't it?  Yeah, it was a big deal.  But they said, hey, look, we Googled it, Eric.  This is his public.  Yeah, Eric Schmidt, why are you so touchy?  You do this to us, but you're a billionaire,  and therefore, you're much too good to have this stuff.

Start time: 650.90
End time: 654.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He didn't sue them or fund secret lawsuits  behind the scenes against them.

Start time: 654.18
End time: 657.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they just boycotted CNET,  and eventually they kissed and made up.

Start time: 657.80
End time: 692.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These things happen.  I remember on Tech TV, we were very concerned  about showing how to hack the Xbox,  the original Xbox when it came out,  because Microsoft was a big advertiser.  But to their credit, and this was when it was Ziff Davis,  the management said, no, no, you go ahead  and do your editorial job,  and we'll worry about the loss of advertising revenue.  And a lot of times, these things,  these boycotts don't last very long.  I know Microsoft has in the past boycotted  PC Magazine for a week.  A week?  Or whatever.  It's hard.  Hardball.  Yeah, I know.  Well, it is actually.  It could be a significant loss of revenue.

Start time: 692.66
End time: 715.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that was back during the day when the publishers  and the vendors had significant ongoing relationships,  and there was some equality of terror  between the two sides.  Once you have all of these little publications  that are struggling to survive,  even brand names that we know, they don't have any power.

Start time: 715.58
End time: 726.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know who I'd worry about is Apple.  Now, maybe less so now,  but they put ThinkSecret out of business,  sued them out of existence.  Under Steve Jobs, Steve Jobs was never reluctant to sue.

Start time: 727.24
End time: 761.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Steve Jobs was an elect to do much of anything.  Steve Jobs put his mind to it.  I mean, the concern isn't like, let's say,  Engadget or where I work right now or any other place,  they write an article that makes a billionaire angry.  They don't have to win, they just have to keep  funding lawsuits.  Because it's completely legal.  It's the Scientology.  It's out of Scientology's playbook in the 90s where-  Just harass them to death.  Yeah, they would just sue you into oblivion.  They didn't have to win, they just had to tie you up  in court so you couldn't afford to do anything anymore.  They'd buy you.  That's the real feel.

Start time: 761.68
End time: 774.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because you have the legal right to sue,  and the courts will decide if the First Amendment  trumps your right to privacy.  And I think that's all sensible,  but when you can sue and spend so much money on lawyers  that it actually puts somebody out of business  before the judgment, that's another matter.

Start time: 774.88
End time: 780.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I think that's the concern for-  Steve got the local police, the local constabulary

Start time: 781.46
End time: 798.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to knock down Brian Lamb's door.  No, it was Jason Chen.  Jason Chen's door, and come and take all his stuff  because he'd had the iPhone 4.  Steve had no problem going to the local police  and saying, hey, you gotta help me.  Actually, there was a task force,  like some Silicon Valley investigative task force.

Start time: 798.76
End time: 806.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and the police were compliant.  I mean- Yeah, they were doing  what the execs wanted.  They have something that belongs to us,  it's stolen as far as we're concerned.

Start time: 807.08
End time: 832.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there was a Borland incident much earlier than that  in which executive leaves Borland,  goes to work someplace else, lawsuits, arrest warrants.  I think somebody got arrested as part of that.  And I don't wanna say who  because I'm a little foggy on who it was,  but yeah, that was Philippe Kahn  and Borland going after somebody.  There's a long tradition of this.  Yeah. It's a long and occasional tradition.

Start time: 833.20
End time: 840.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's usually from a company.  Right, yeah. It's usually a company,  like a large company will sue you.  This is an individual who has a beef with a publication.

Start time: 844.32
End time: 848.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is not in any respect illegal for what he did though,  right? You can secretly fund.

Start time: 848.44
End time: 857.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it looks, I mean, I think Gawker,  they're looking for some sort of legal way to sue him,  the counter sue or whatever.  I guess not counter sue  because he didn't bring the lawsuit.

Start time: 857.32
End time: 870.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does seem like, at least a tradition, if not a law,  that you should be able to face your accuser  and have a secret accuser funding secretly.  It doesn't feel like fair play exactly.  On the other hand, I'm so happy to see them go.

Start time: 871.00
End time: 886.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, it was a venture investment, Leo.  That's what it was.  He saw it as an investment.  An investment.  I see ROI in that lawsuit.  Yeah, and it's taking ROI on the lawsuit.  How much did he put in?  What's $140 million plus smiting one's enemies?  What is a smite worth?

Start time: 887.02
End time: 938.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's big bucks.  What is a smite worth?  Spike big bucks.  I'll tell you, I pay almost unlimited funds  for smiting some people.  WWDC and E3 start tomorrow.  Let's start with WWDC.  I feel like Apple is struggling a little bit  to reclaim the magic.  And now the latest is no new hardware  will be announced at WWDC.  It's gonna be exactly what it...  Supposed to be?  Supposed to be in title anyway, which is,  hey, developer, here's the new OS X,  here's the new Mac watchOS, iOS.  Here's what we're gonna do.  The end.  No virtual reality, no new MacBooks, nothing.  Is there a risk if Apple does that,  that people will just go,  oh God, they're so boring these days.  I'm about to say that.

Start time: 938.84
End time: 948.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're so boring these days.  If they can fix Siri, or how about search in iOS?  How long have they had Siri?  Like search in iOS is horrible.  You pull it down like 50% of the time,  it's like nothing.

Start time: 948.40
End time: 950.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead and try to find an app on the app store.

Start time: 951.32
End time: 987.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Right?  If they can fix those things, I'm just, yeah, I'm fine.  Because they're gonna have their event  in October or September for the holiday season.  That's when all the stuff's gonna appear  and everyone's gonna go,  oh, gah, gah, gonna buy a new phone, computer,  so on and so forth.  And so, but they have to take care of  their operating systems.  And if that means like stepping back  and really from hardware and just focusing on the software,  as a user, I'm happy.  I think the people will be upset  because they're not gonna hear about a new iPhone  or Amazon Echo clone or some storage.

Start time: 987.68
End time: 1000.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Cashman, when you sit down at the editorial meeting  beginning of the day,  and you say, let's cover Apple,  and people go, eh, what, there's nothing going on there.  Ever since the encryption thing's over, it's been boring.

Start time: 1000.64
End time: 1021.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the thing, that's the Apple story right now  that's so interesting is still the battle over encryption.  And so, the big thing that they could announce  that would be very exciting is  after the whole debate with the government,  they said that they were thinking about  encrypting Apple iCloud by default,  which is not encrypted now  and is a way for the government to get in  when it can't get its own itself.

Start time: 1021.36

Start time: 1034.76
End time: 1039.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 1040.48

Start time: 1048.04
End time: 1070.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, well, there will be a new iPhone someday.  We talk about this enough on MacBreak Weekly,  we don't need to talk about it here,  but I just worry that Apple has lost interest  in desktop computing.  You're sitting there with a MacBook Air.  It's working.  It hasn't been updated in years.  The Mac Pro hasn't been updated since 2013  and it wasn't very good to begin with.  I just feel like they've kind of lost interest.  It's like, eh.

Start time: 1071.40
End time: 1087.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  These phones sell so well.  They make so much money on those phones.  They're like, oh, we could make some computers too,  or we can make a lot more money with phones.  Yeah, I'd like a brand new MacBook Air  that does something magical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does Apple really have anything new out on the horizon?  As I remember, Steve Jobs was going to reinvent television.  Yeah, that's over.  And when Steve died, it was thought,  well, they have maybe two years of pipeline there.  So I guess we're at the end of that pipeline  because the watch was in the pipeline, I believe,  but this leaves them with nothing.  Declining revenue unless they can get into all kinds  of new international markets for the phones.  Or. And certainly not very much excitement  for the phones.  And in fact, I think they did.

Transcript:  Supposedly this week.  We will be covering that live.  We do our usual kind of Mystery Science Theater 3000  coverage of the keynote 10 a.m. tomorrow Pacific time.  That's 1 p.m. Eastern 1700 UTC.  Annie Anakko, Megan Moroney and me will be doing that.  And then we'll of course talk more about it  on Tuesday with Mac Break Weekly.  Our show today brought to you by Razor Harry's.  It's Father's Day, you know.  Have you got a Father's Day gift for your dad or your grad?  Because we've got graduations going on right now.  Man, I recommend.  This is the Harry's Father's Day kit.  We've talked about Harry's before.  Harry's kind of is reinventing the razor industry  by buying the factory in Germany  and then selling them direct to you.  They deliver to you in a subscription.  So you're always got fresh blades,  but you always have to start with a Harry's kit.  And look at this, this is really nice for dad.  I really like this.  You get the, this is a new handle for them.  It's kind of a soft touch black handle.  You get the, of course, three blades with the kit.  And they have a new blade carrier  that's kind of designed for travel.  They've got the travel cover.  This is the stand for the razor.  I love this.  And you can get this engraved for dad too, if you want.  Like you're a swell dad.  And you put that on the counter there like that.  And then dad gets his choice  or you get your choice for dad of the Harry's gel.  And it's a full size or the Harry's cream.  This is what I use.  I really like it.  It's a sleek giftable box and you can add the engraving.  You can add a personalized card.  I got a personalized card that says to twit from Harry's.  It's arrived for the dad that appreciates aesthetic  and function.  This handsome set includes everything he needs.  And it came from 59903 star 11 star 0017.  Thank you 59903.  Appreciate that.  Those nice thoughts.  $40, but we're gonna show you how to save a little bit.  And this giftable set will get your dad started with Harry's.  If you've not used Harry's, you gotta try them.  Great blades at about half the price of what you pay  in the grocery store or the drug store  where they lock them up behind plexiglass.  Why pay 32 bucks for an eight pack of blades  when you can get them for half the price.  And they're great blades from harrys.com.  Now with their iOS app, it's easy to order  and easy to renew.  Just four taps of the mouse.  Harrys.com slash twit.  We're gonna give you $5 off your first purchase  if you use that URL.  Harrys.com slash twit.  Check out their Father's Day limited edition set  for dads and grads.  Harrys.com slash twit.  $5 off something dad will actually use.  We are talking the week's tech news.  David Corsi, my old friend is here from decades gone by.  And great to have you.

Apple is, according to Bloomberg,  getting its new radio chips, not from Qualcomm,  but from Intel?  I thought Intel was getting out of the mobile business.  Intel laid off 12,000,  or was planning to lay off 12,000 people,  cut out its projects for mobile phones,  mobile phone chip sets, but apparently,  I guess they still make the radio phones  and they're gonna sell to Apple.

What did you do?  What was wrong?  Why did you, come on?  And he's like, no, we just kept like,  that's what we were there for.  We're journalists, we're there to ask questions.  And he, I.  He cried.  Yeah, I feel bad a little bit, but not really,  that is my job.  And, you know, they should expect that when I'm around,  I suppose.  I don't know.

Transcript:  You're among friends.  The other badgers.  Apple, Bloomberg says Apple will use the Intel chips  in the AT&T, I guess, GSM phones,  but not on the Verizon chips.  Those will be Qualcomm.  That makes sense.  And if they're going to do it on AT&T phones,  they'll do it on their unlocked  and their T-mobile phones as well.  Those are GSM.  And I would guess the Sprint would also use the Qualcomm.  Chips, Qualcomm owns this market.  iPhone sold in China, according to Bloomberg,  will also be on the Qualcomm chips.  Apple has not commented on this.  But that's, you know, it's a little bright,  little tiny bright spot in what looks,  must look very grim to Intel as the future goes mobile  and Intel does not.  It's not like AMD is knocking them out of the park either.  All right.  Didn't spur any great discussion here.  We'll move on.

And the presenter is talking about all the wonderful things  that the Internet of Things is going to do in agriculture.  It's going to tell you what you need to spray,  where you need to spray, what you need to do.  What you, you know, and he's talking about  all the great opportunities there  and how many jobs are going to be created.  And I call her the guy after the thing and I say,  what do you mean?  One guy could run a hundred farms sitting in a control room.  God only knows where.  And he says, but what about all the development?  I said, how many times do you have to develop this stuff?  You know, once the Internet of Things is basically built  and you have the big data analytics built,  how many employees does that take going forward?  So when people tell you that the Internet of Things  is going to create lots and lots of jobs.  The other way around, huh?  I just look at this and say,  yeah, at the end of the Internet of Things,  it's the Internet of no jobs.  It's happened already, it's continuing to happen.  And there's no reason to believe  that the Internet of Things is somehow going  to make everything okay for the jobless.  There are going to be three people with jobs  who are going to be the super,  the Bill Joy's of the world,  the Bill Gates's of the world,  those kinds of people will have jobs.  And us mere plebeians will be here wondering,  where all the work went,  while they still expect us to buy their stuff.  That's the really rich part of it.

It isn't in mass production yet, but yeah,  it's thin enough to go down the corn rows  and do things like spread pesticide.  Right now they're using it for fertilizer.  And the other thing it can do  that you don't normally do when you're growing corn,  I learned a lot about corn yesterday,  is the problem is once you harvest the corn,  all the topsoil will blow away or wash away.  So you have to put some sort of ground cover in  and the problem is it's too late  after you've harvested the corn,  then the rain's coming and you can't.  So the Ro-Bot will go in and will seed ground cover  before you harvest the corn.  It goes under these little, it's a very cute little thing.  That's pretty cool.  Yeah.

It's from a group called SourceFed asserting  that the Google auto-complete  suppresses negative searches about Hillary Clinton.  If somebody types Hillary Clinton CRI,  Google does not complete it with crimes,  but crime reform, crisis and others.  This is Matt Lieberman.  Now Google immediately weighed in on this  when Matt Cutts even, our good friend at Google,  said, that's ridiculous.  If you do the same thing with Donald Trump CRI,  it won't get crimes because we intentionally don't surface,  we don't auto-complete that kind of negative stuff.  They got in a lot of trouble in the past  for kind of auto-com, suggesting negatives about people.  Trump says it's a disgrace that Google would manipulate.  Its search is very, very dishonest.  They should let it float.  It's people, let people see how crooked she really is.  Matt Cutts said it's just false.  And by the way, if you do Hillary CRI or Hillary in,  you'll see it in Hillary indictment,  Hillary indictment news.

Would you want one of those?  Telephones whose names we can't pronounce.  Billionaires who seem, well, a little different  than the rest of us, more than their bank accounts.  Phones you don't want.

By the end of the year, when you're actually using it,  you'll use maybe one of those.  Maybe two.  I think about 3D Touch, which I was very,

Transcript:  So there's a battle and Apple is by the way,  leading this battle against the right to repair.  You know what the right to repair is?  And it comes up at first, I guess the John Deere tractors  that you're not allowed to fix  because they've got DRM on the software in the tractor.  They don't want anybody to steal it.  But it also comes up in the independent repair shops  and Apple really doesn't want these iPhone  independent repair shops.  There's a bill in California being proposed,  the Right to Repair Act that would give  independent phone repair shops the manuals  and the information, the parts they need.  Apple does not wanna give it to them.  Now on the one hand, Apple says,  well, you don't, but the problem is these guys are no good  and they're gonna do a terrible job  and you really should use us.  But on the other hand, I think David,  you have the right to bring that phone to a third party  and get it fixed.  It's a lot cheaper.

I mean, that's a good thing.  But yeah, I ought to be able to get my phone repaired.  But if you're Apple and you're control freaks  and this is your cash cow in ways  you can't even describe to people  how much money they are paying you,  of course they're gonna wanna do all the fixes.  Of course they do.  The article-

It's that you were renting all your equipment.  The economics of Ma Bell was set up in a certain way.  We finally came to a point where all of the money  that Ma Bell was making,  some of which went to fund  the National Geographic Society, by the way,  suddenly there was this pause-

And that's what opened up competition,  ultimately killed the Bell system.  And I will tell you,  I think it would be better off today  if we still had the Bell system,  where four guys could get around a table in a room  and say, we're going to do fiber to the home.  And it would just happen.  I kind of liked that world.  I liked the Bell system.

If you are in Southern California  and you got your Verizon Fios replaced by Frontier,  which happened just a couple of weeks ago,  people are furious.  Frontier's done a terrible job of replacing Verizon.  I guess you're saying though,  if we're AT&T, if we're all Ma Bell,  we wouldn't have, are you kidding?  We wouldn't have fiber?  We'd be on DSL with like-  We'd be doing one megabit DSL.  We wouldn't have fiber.

The Japanese people were taking pictures of it.  The desk, the empty desk.  Desk, two of them.  But that was an amazing place  that invented amazing technologies.

Television and radio, phone and internet.  And so if you're convinced by Tim Wu's book,  then you would not agree with David  because there were many examples in there  of technologies that were suppressed  because it would create another market  that would compete with their market.

End time: 2823.84

Transcript:  RCA under David Sarnoff was a big suppressor of technology,  which could be a little bit of what Kashmir is thinking of  because they got the FM radio band moved,  meaning that all the FM radios that had been sold  by Major Armstrong stopped working.  Suddenly they were in the ham six meter band,  I mean of all things.  And there were major fights like that.  And then the FCC, which tends to do okay on little things,  but messes up horribly on big things,  there was an idea once to make your radio dial  start at AM and channelize as you dialed up into FM.  So it would look like one radio dial to you.  No separate FM radios, no separate converters,  push buttons would go wherever you wanted to go.  And that couldn't fly because it made FM too accessible  and too competitive with AM,  which was dominant at the time.

Start time: 2880.10
End time: 2895.03

Transcript:  But David, long distance calls, for instance,  pre-Carter phone were extremely expensive.  I remember calling people up and saying,  hey, I'm on long distance, this has gotta be quick.

I don't think anyone at Google knows how to say no,  but yeah, we have cars, I mean, getting into phones,  that idea was insane if you think about it.

Start time: 2974.78
End time: 3021.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, that's why they're not doing it anymore.  What I was gonna say is the reason we had these huge  long distance bills is because long distance was seen  as a business service,  and it was expensive to provide at that time.  If you say you don't have to subsidize anything,  and you can build networks and charge for long distance  based on what it costs,  you end up with MCI and cheap long distance,  and the internet comes and wireline telephones go away.  I don't think that's such a good idea either,  but that's just me and national security thinking.  So I mean, I'm not sure that everything that we've done,  yes, it gets cheaper, yes, it gets cheaper,  yes, it gets cheaper,  but what is the real cost of all of that cheaperness,  if you like that word?  It's cheap.

Start time: 3022.94
End time: 3057.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cheaperness is good.  Look, there's no solution that is perfect.  There's negatives and positives to both.  You got the Bell, on the one hand,  you got Bell Labs with this giant monopoly.  On the other hand, you have, frankly,  an incumbent protecting their long distance tariffs,  because it's very profitable for them.  And less incentive for them to bring those prices down.  So I think that there's negatives on both sides.  I would come down in favor of a free market  over a subsidized or regulated monopoly  almost every time though, wouldn't you, David?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3091.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because we have an unwillingness to regulate it,  but we've created it.  Yes.  Yeah.  So back to the secret war.  To keep you from repairing your iPhone,  this is the Huffington Post.  Apple has repeatedly opposed legislation  that would allow people to go to third party repair companies.  And Apple, I think, has a rationale  that makes a little bit of sense,  which is, well, we can only guarantee the quality  if we do it ourselves, and we don't want to repair,  and we won't repair something  that somebody else has repaired first.  So the minute you take it to a third party, we're done.  But I am in support of people like iFixit,  and I'm in support of the states,  Minnesota, Nebraska, Massachusetts, and New York,  who have considered adopting right to repair amendments,  which would force companies  to give out the information needed to fix stuff.  Shouldn't Apple have, you know, I mean, car,  you know, the same thing with automobiles these days.  Yeah, I mean, if you buy-  There's no shade-tree mechanics anymore.

Start time: 3176.92
End time: 3206.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the reasons the state legislatures  are arguing for the right to repair  is also because of this issue  of the throwaway disposable economy  that companies like Apple create,  forcing people to buy new computers, new phones,  because they're not repairable.  You can't just easily swap out the battery.  If it dies, you got to throw it out  or take it to Apple for a very expensive repair.  Where do you stand?  What do you think?  Cashmere right to repair?

Transcript:  I'm gonna take a break and let's talk about VR.  Because now, I mean, I was very excited.  We got the Rift and we got the Vive,  and I was all excited and playing with it.  And now I'm starting to think maybe this isn't,  this is like 3D TV.  This is a non-starter.  Your opinions will come in a moment.  Think, think about what you think about this.  But first, ladies and gentlemen,  let's talk about audio books.  Now this is an innovation.  But it's been around for a while.  In fact, I joined audible.com in the year 2000.  And man, was I happy,  because I had a long commute to San Francisco every day.  And the idea of sitting in a car for two hours,  listening to pop music on the radio,  I was about to blow my brains out.  Then Apple invented the iPod,  and Audible came along,  and suddenly, life is good.  I've read more books on Audible.  My library on Audible now is,  three or 400 books, it's awesome.  And I get more every month  because I'm an Audible subscriber.  You wanna try Audible, go to audible.com.  We're gonna get you a deal, two books free.  You'll be signing up for the Platinum account.  That's what I have, which is two books a month.  It's the best deal, absolutely.  You'll also get the Daily Digest  of the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times.  You get to pick.  And then John, by the way, the Tim Woo's book,  The Kill Switch, that's on audible.com.  I listen to a lot of industry history and biography  on audible.com, but great fiction as well.  Two books await you.  That's not it, that's Jo-let.  They're not Tucker Waite.  Boy, there's a few kill switches.  Keep going.  Master Switch, that's why.  The Kill Switch, though, that looks like an interesting,  seven books.  It's a whole genre.  The Master Switch, Tim Woo, thank you.  Your Audible will never stop.  There you go, The Rise and Fall.  That actually is a great must read book.  But here's the deal.  You're gonna get two books free.  So there's one, but maybe, I don't know,  maybe you wanna read a little fiction,  maybe a thriller like The Kill Switch.  Or you get to pick.  Two books await you, audible.com slash twit two,  audible.com slash twit and the number two.  That's two credits.  Most books are one credit.  There are a few longer books like Game of Thrones.  It's two credits, so you could just use it  for the Game of Thrones book.  And you'll finish that some year.  Oh, look at Jerry Purnell, The Moten God's Eye.  Love that, what a great book that is.  Our friend John Hodgman's,  More Information Than You Require.  He reads it, it's wonderful.  Right now I'm listening to The Confidence Game.  This is a triangulation interview we did  with Maria Konokova that's fascinating.  It's about the history of con artists  and how they have found a fertile field  in the internet era.  And if you're interested in why we fall for this,  every time, this was a great book.  I'm listening to it right now.  Listen to it on the way in.  Audible.com slash twit two, two free books await.  Take advantage of that offer right now.  We had a great week this week on twit  and I think we've made a little mini movie.  You ready with that mini movie, Brian?  To show you what you might have missed.  Previously on twit.

It was just like, he just kinda came out.  It didn't seem like he wanted to be there.  When he was by himself on stage  and he did his little presentation,  he did a really good job,  because he did that jobs movie.  He knew how to do keynotes.  But then when the CEO was up there  and they were talking, there wasn't like a queue,  I guess, for him to leave,  so he was just kinda standing there.  And then he was wandered off.

Transcript:  Thanks, Leo.  Here's a look at a few things  we're gonna be following closely in the week ahead.  First off, as you probably know,  Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference kicks off tomorrow  and, well, you're gonna be on set,  along with Megan and Andy Anotko,  to cover the keynote live at 10 a.m. Pacific,  1 p.m. Eastern.  Pretty sure there'll be plenty to discuss  throughout next week from that event.  Also, the E3 Gaming Expo begins on Tuesday, June 14th,  lasting through the rest of the week.  Possible new hardware from Microsoft,  maybe even Sony, although they say don't expect the Neo,  but regardless, plenty to discuss next week,  and we'll have a team there doing on-site coverage as well,  so look for that.  June 14th is the VR unveiling of the OnePlus 3.  Leaks reveal, I think, a sharp-looking device.  This'll be the first time a OnePlus phone  won't require an invite in order to buy,  so you better get your wallets ready.  The Bluetooth 5 spec is actually set to be announced  on Thursday, June 16th.  It should bring double the range  and four times the speed of Bluetooth 4.2,  so Bluetooth fans, there you go.  And I'm sure we'll dig up plenty more other things  to talk about.  We usually do find Megan Moroney and myself talking tech  every weekday at 4 p.m. Pacific,  7 p.m. Eastern, 12 a.m. UTC, at twit.tv slash live.  That's a look at the busy week ahead.

And of the three big players,  that probably is gonna be the biggest,  only because there's so many,  something like 40 million installed units  of PlayStation 4s that can use this VR  without a much higher cost.  You don't have to go out and buy a whole new PC,  for example.  A beefy PC.  Yeah.  We built a $5,000 PC to use the Oculus Rift in the Vive.

Although one thing I did notice,  the ones I've looked at weren't 360 degrees.  They were kind of constrained angles.  And that was the other thing is I found myself like kind of,  okay, they're fooling around in front of me,  but I'm more like, let's look at the decor.  Oh, look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but that's the thing is you can kind of...  So what is interesting about immersive video,  360 degree video in VR,  is you choose what you're gonna look at.  So it is kind of interesting that way.  There's a Cirque du Soleil demo  that comes on the Gear VR, the Samsung Gear VR,  where there are performers all around you.  And you can...  And so it's a little weird,  but it's kind of interesting  because you could watch that trick or that trick or this.  And so what's unusual is you are controlling  the point of view,  which makes it difficult from an artistic point of view  as an artist, because normally what an artist does  is tell you what to look at.  That's kind of the art of film.  And that's gone because you could be shagging  right in front of somebody  and he's looking at your bookshelf.

When you started talking about you're there,  you're looking around,  you're seeing the wonderful sunflowers  by the side of the road and all of that,  that would be kind of fun.

It's not like I need to experience the great white shark  30 feet out in the water at Santa Cruz.  It's, I want to be in a museum.  I want to be at your house looking at all the technology,  old stuff that you have on your shelves  like I have on my shelves.  That would be interesting.  But this, I want to play a game in VR.

Okay, so the super flexible phone  you wear like a watch non-starter.  Maybe there's some value in VR if we get the right content.  That's one of the reasons it's hard to judge this stuff.

Or we've gotten a lot of like,  oh let's do an interview with somebody.  But in 360, I'm like why?  That person's sitting right there.  You're interviewing him.  I don't need to see the people behind him.  We're just throwing things at a wall  and hoping something sticks.  And hopefully someone will come up with something cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So one of the challenges with VR is how do you show it?  And so what we do have is in the other room,  we have a giant green screen stage  and that's where we set up the VR  and then you see the person  and everybody looks dorky when they're doing VR.  You just cannot help it.  But at least behind them at a full size,  you see the environment that they're in.  And actually is a pretty,  I think that's the way to demo VR.  We figured that much out anyway.  As opposed to just.  Yeah, there you go.  So now this is actually Kate Patella,  my old screensaver's friend.  And then she's in the tilt.  That's the tilt brush game, the painting game.

You put in your email address.  It's been around for a while.  We've used it before to see if your emails showed up  in any of these pwned databases.  Oh, you're totally pwned.  Oh, I've been totally pwned.  The breaches I was pwned in.

Transcript:  All this means is that your email address showed up.  Maybe not even your accurate password or credit card.  They don't tell you that.  Just that your email address in my case for Adobe,  LinkedIn, MySpace and Tumblr.  But this is the numbers that blew my mind.  The top 10 breaches, MySpace breach,  359 million MySpace accounts.  I still have an account.  That was the thing that I did is I logged in.  I said, oh, I still have an account.  You logged in with your password and then you're like,  oh no.  I changed the password immediately.  LinkedIn, 164 million accounts.  Adobe, 152 million.  The size of these database dumps are,  I mean, Ashley Madison was only a mere 30 million accounts.

Start time: 5083.32
End time: 5111.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's the problem with sites like MySpace  where we signed up for something five, 10 years ago  and maybe it's changed hands a few times  and the people who own it now,  their security is lax.  They're not paying attention.  And you keep using that same password.  You're like, oh, I've been using this password for 10 years  because the name of my dog and the street I lived on  and my favorite football team.  And then suddenly now your current Twitter account  is hacked or worse, your email account's hacked.  All because of MySpace.

Transcript:  One of the problems with technology generally  and also with capitalism is you can't move backwards.  Once television killed radio in the United States,  it wasn't allowed to do that in the UK.  We couldn't ever go back and have good radio again.  With this technology, if we had to invent the internet today,  it would look nothing like when it was invented  with no idea of what it would become.  No idea, no security, no this, no that.  So we're constantly playing catch up  and we don't have the ability to say stop.  Beginning tomorrow, there is a new internet that is new  and it is secure and it is whatever.  We could build that internet,  but there is no way to do the transition to it,  unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What disturbed me most in this most recent round  of passwords that got hacked, the LinkedIn 2013 hack  that just seems to be kinda like coming out now  and then the Twitter hack is the people  that weren't using two factor.  This is the new security solution we've come up with,  because we know that passwords are not secure,  they get out all the time.  So you have the second factor that you have sent  to your phone and that becomes more secure.  But in this most recent hack, DeRay McKesson,  the Black Lives Matter activist was hacked  and he actually had two factor turned on for Twitter  in his email account and the hackers went to Verizon  and got them to change his SIM card  so that the two factor messages that were coming  from Twitter, for example, went to their phone  instead of his and it was just such a deep hack  and it's so hard to protect yourself against that,  especially because social engineering always works.  You can call the phone company and you can get them  to believe anything, especially if you have the sound  of a crying baby playing from a YouTube video.  So that's what's terrifying to me is that you can take  all the measures and then still get hacked.

Start time: 5242.48
End time: 5282.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So DeRay tweeted at 10 31, someone called Verizon  impersonating me and successfully changed my SIM,  unsuccessfully attempted to change my phone number.  What they're trying to do, of course, is get  that second factor authentication sent to their phones  instead of his phones.  I'm not clear though, he says, Verizon says,  we're investigating, we're not.  But they say by changing my phone SIM,  hacker bypassed two factor verification,  which I have in all accounts.  I'm not sure I buy that because if they weren't able  to get his phone number for their phone,  how would changing his SIM change two factor?  Would it disable it?

Start time: 5282.74
End time: 5288.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they have that SIM, they can just have it,  put that SIM in a phone and suddenly every text message  that he gets goes to that.

Start time: 5288.94
End time: 5296.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They have to get his physical SIM though to do that  or convince Verizon to say, oh, this is my new number  or this is my new phone.

Start time: 5297.20
End time: 5302.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5309.10
End time: 5322.05

Transcript:  I saw a talk with Kevin Mitnick about a year ago  and he has that pen, well, he has a company,  I'm just using Infosec, he has a company that goes in  and checks the security of other companies  and someone asked him, how often can you break into it?  He's like, well, if we're not allowed to use  social engineering, I think it was like 67%.  He's like, if we are, 100%.  Kevin wrote the book on social engineering.  Yeah, so yeah, it's 100% and then that's how Matt Honan  that's how I learned how to hack my own accounts  was because Matt was hacked  and we had to do all the research about it  and we would just call and like pretend,  whatever we could find the internet about ourselves,  we would tell them and then we could change.  That's all you need.

Start time: 5387.82
End time: 5411.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's pretty easy.  I mean, the same thing happened to him  where they called his phone provider.  That's why actually whenever I screenshot my phone,  I try to crop out who my provider is  and I tell other people to do this  because once they have that information,  then they can call and try to impersonate you  and usually the only kind of information  they need to get in are the last one.  Who's your carrier?  Your social security number, which is easy to get.

It was a lot of people using the same password on Twitter  that they use on other sites.  That probably had more to do with the LinkedIn database dump.  Do you find that credible?  Do you think Twitter is notifying users?  In fact, they say we've notified millions of users  that your account may be taken over.  The leak at Social Leak was 33 million usernames  and passwords.  But Twitter says, no, but they didn't hack us.  There's no evidence that they hacked us.  Not Social Leak, I made that up.  Leak source.  I made up a new place, Social Leak.

I will once again just say, use a password manager.  Always get to promote those.  You really shouldn't use the same password  from site to site, because sites aren't,  they're not good at security,  and your password's gonna get out.

You can have multiple contributors.  You know, I see magazines and places  saying how great our CMS is.  And they must spend millions of dollars on this stuff.  So easy to do a magazine on Squarespace.  I don't know why more of them don't just do it.  It's the ultimate CMS and you can do it all right there.  In fact, I do it for my blog and it's just me.  But so many people use Squarespace.  Squarespace has commerce too.  In fact, it's the only platform that lets the commerce,  the shopping cart, look exactly the same as your design.  It all is seamless and I really like them for that.  Go to squarespace.com and take a look at it.  Members who have built or contributed to more than,  the three or more active Squarespace websites  will have access to Squarespace Circle.  Circle membership includes advanced guides,  optimized support, six month trial periods,  six month trial periods for new projects and more.  That is a nice deal to kind of reward you  a frequent flyer plan for Squarespace users.  And by the way, they now do domains.  They'll sell domains directly.  So if you have a, like David did,  you got an idea for a site,  but you haven't yet set up the site,  they will sell you a domain name  from the 200 of the top level domains.  That's pretty much all of them.  And then you register your domain  and they give you a beautiful spam free parking page  until you're ready to start building.  So, and you can use the cover pages even  just to create a cover page of,  you and Scruffy right there on the front.  It is gorgeous.

And they'll say, we don't have one.  And before the meal is over,  he'll set up a Squarespace site for them.  Said, you got two weeks, enjoy.  And if you want it, just, you know, pay it.  But I designed a site for you.  It's I think really cool.  Squarespace.com.  Zuck is going to do a live Q&A on Facebook.  What do you guys think about what's going on with Facebook?  They're really moving into the media,  becoming a media company.

June 14th, 2.30 p.m. Eastern.  They're going to let you ask questions of Mark Zuckerberg.  I think that's a brave thing to do.  I can't think of a lot of other CEOs.

Transcript:  I mean, it's brave in the fact  that everything's going to go through filters.  But it is live.  Yeah, but they still have.  I mean, they've had the live sort of like town halls.  The president's done it, so it can't.  It's like he's going to be answering  every crazy hard question.  The people are like,  why are you deleting people's synced photos  from their phones and making us down the moments instead?  That's probably not going to get it.  Not going to make it through?  Or he'll already have an answer for that.

Start time: 6545.52
End time: 6591.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Another thing to think about with this is,  is it going to become like, say,  a television network with pre-scheduled stuff?  For example, former Secretary Robert Reich,  you know, what the Bernie supporter has scheduled  for like 12 noon on Thursdays or something.  He does office hours and does those cool drawings  and answers questions and stuff like that.  And if you happen to know it, you'll know to tune in.  And if you're on at the time,  you may see a note that says,  Robert Reich is on, is live now.  But at what point do I go to a directory  of everybody who's going to be on  in the next three or four days?  I mean, is that really Facebook or is that something else?  I don't know the answer to that question.

Start time: 6592.00

Transcript:  I think that sort of breaks the relationship  between users and the communities that they have.  But it's also part of the, oh, what,  the tasty videos that show up all the time.  And all of this new video content that's designed.  And they do a pretty good job.  Once they started telling the story in captions,  rather than making you listen to it,  those things became really useful.  And people are, I watch a lot of them now,  because you just scroll past,  you watch it to your board, you're scrolling up.  I'm sorry to do that with my hand.  And it goes away.  But does that makes, what does that do to Facebook overall?  I don't know.  I say Facebook's more useful than it used to be.  Still a lot of things wrong with Facebook,  particularly if you're trying to be an administrator,  or try to do a nonprofit or something like that on Facebook.  But I like Facebook now a lot more than I did two years ago,  which is sort of saying something.

Transcript:  I'm sad to say, by the way,  this is a great service that Facebook does,  the Facebook safety check.  They've never had to use it in the US until,  I'm sad to say today,  this is, they've used it in other disasters  and terrorist attacks, remember Paris,  where you could go, you could find your friends,  friends who were in the Orlando area  after the horrific shooting at the nightclub last night.  And so they're the first time they've activated this,  and you can go there and see  if your friends are in the affected area.  And if you are in the affected area,  you can let your friends know if you're safe.  But that is a sad thing.  And yet I have to commend them.  I mean, I think they do a good job.  They took some heat for the choice of places  that they would use this safety check.

And to your argument that, you know,  is it going to be like a television station?  Is there going to be a schedule?  I can see Facebook probably doing that in the future  with something like with the live videos.

Transcript:  You know where maybe an opportunity for Facebook,  both Facebook and Google are going to be big presences  at the Republican and Democratic  nominating conventions this year.  And while there may not be a lot of news there,  there's also the potential that there could be big news  in either convention.  If Bernie Sanders takes on Hillary Clinton  or the Republican elite take on Donald Trump,  there could be a lot of stories there.  And at this point, I still like from the primary night,  still went to CNN or MSNBC.  But I think that we're at close to an inflection point  where people will go to Facebook  because there'll be news, there'll be live video,  there'll be their friends, there'll be conversation  that it might be a better place to get that kind of story.

Start time: 6812.16

Transcript:  Cause you can't, you know, if you share a live video,  you can have that conversation with your friends  in the comments.

Transcript:  You don't have a use for it.  So Fusion is a television network,  as a cable network as much as it is a website.  I think it's very interesting.  As long as the cable companies don't give you a hard time.  When we did Tech TV, it was in our cable contracts.  You may not put more than 10 minutes of an hour  on the internet.  We don't wanna undermine our nicely paying cable customers  by giving them a chance to look at this over the top.  I bet you those days are gone.  I bet you Fusion doesn't have to make those deals anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So clearly you don't have those restrictions.  And if I were-  Yes, not.  And absent those restrictions, I would have done it.  We would have done it on Tech TV  because one of the hardest things  about doing cable television is getting on cable,  getting into cable homes.  It's murder.  It's hugely expensive.  Paul Allen spent more than $300 million,  lost more than $300 million  trying to get into 44 million homes.  The internet, you go on Facebook,  you're in a billion and a half people's browsers instantly  at no cost to you.  And so if I were, you know, today,  I think you absolutely do that.  You absolutely go to Facebook  as long as you don't have restrictions  preventing you from doing that.  It's just more eyeballs.  Why not?  It's so easy.  Instead of having to say, I want to get on Comcast,  you say, well, I'm on Facebook.  Plus you get the value of people are browsing  and they're gonna come across it.  I think it's easier to get in front of people by doing that.  You can share everything.  And they interact with you,  which is also very interesting.  We did, when Facebook Live came out,  I did a little bit of one of our shows.  Actually, I did the whole thing on Facebook Live.  And we got some good engagement.  I can't remember, it was 36,000,  something like that, 40,000 views.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks,  a super simple cloud accounting system.  When I was a freelancer, it was the biggest pain.  I loved doing what I did.  I loved my work.  I loved doing the shows.  I loved it.  The thing I hated on the 30th of every month,  sitting down and doing invoices, hated it so much,  I often didn't do it.  And you know what I learned?  You don't send an invoice, you don't get paid.  And that wasn't a really tenable situation.  Fortunately, I was very lucky.  I knew somebody named Amber MacArthur.  We were up there in Toronto doing the TV show up there.  She said, and I was complaining about sending invoices.  I think I was telling her the story  of not sending invoices for six months  and then really getting in trouble  with the accounting department  when I finally sent six months of invoices all at once.  She said, Leo, you gotta find out about FreshBooks.  It was just starting up about 10 years ago in Toronto.  They are great, great.  Now five million small business owners use FreshBooks  to create their invoices, to send them out,  to get paid faster, to keep track of time and hours  with their app, to get insights into what they're doing.  You can find out whether a client's paid you or not.  If you can find out whether the client  looked at the invoice or not.  No more can clients say, oh, your invoice,  I didn't get that.  Yes, you did.  Yes, you did.  And if the client is slow to pay,  FreshBooks takes care of it.  They'll send out a polite reminder  to help you get paid faster.  I wish they'd had this too.  They have a new feature, project deposit feature.  Super handy.  You can invoice for a payment upfront  when you're kicking off a project  so you don't have to pay out of pocket  and wait to get reimbursed.  That's just a small token of all the fun,  fabulous things FreshBooks can do for you.  You didn't get into business to do the paperwork,  but you gotta do it.  Let FreshBooks help.  If you are somebody, a provider that goes  into people's homes, maybe you're a contractor,  a plumber, maybe you set up AV systems,  you'll love their EMV chip card enabled card reader  that goes right into the FreshBooks software.  You plug it into your iPhone.  You can do the whole thing without leaving the premises.  You present them with your bid, they accept it.  You do the work, you present them with the invoice,  they sign it, and then you pull out the chip card,  the card reader, and they can dip the chip  or swipe the stripe and pay you right there on the spot.  All through FreshBooks, it's awesome.  Try it today, 30 days free.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  It is amazing.  We do want to, since we mentioned the Orlando tragedy,  we do want our hearts and prayers go out  to all the people in Orlando.  It's just a terrible thing.  Pride Week is normally such a celebration  here in the Bay Area and all over the world,  and what a terrible, terrible Paul to put over it.  My God, 50 people.  It's unimaginable, unimaginable.

They are the savviest thing we've ever come up against,  and it's hard for us to defeat them.  I mean, they have lots of advantages in this  that just being big doesn't give you.  But I think, in a way, I'm gonna say that

Start time: 7297.98
End time: 7326.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's the argument against democracy in general  and freedom in general, is that some will take advantage  of that, and of course, you could say,  well, we need a police state, that's the way to security,  but it's not the way we want to live.  And so, yes, of course, they can take advantage  of these things, but do we want to live in a place  where, well, maybe we're a little safer,  but there's a little less freedom?  I don't think so, and I don't think that's the choice  we want to make.

I'm just saying that the technology that enables  all of these cool things that we like,  also enables all kinds of terrible things  that we don't like, and we haven't found a good way  to have the good stuff without also enabling the bad stuff.

Transcript:  But I'd still choose freedom, and what I hate to see  is the FBI, and I'm sure that the FBI  and federal law enforcement is doing this  because they want to protect us.  I'm not in any way implying that they have some  subterranean agenda to take over the planet,  but they continue to push for new powers,  new ways to invade our privacy.  You probably saw what the Department of Justice  published or proposed, a rule change,  that would let the FBI's NGI,  or Next Generation Identification Database,  be exempt of the Privacy Act.  This is a fingerprint, face print, iris scan,  information like scent, your smell, your gait,  your voice prints, all sorts of biometric information  about people, people not only who have been arrested,  but people who have applied for jobs  and got FBI background checks, anything they can collect,  exempt from any privacy protections.  The DOJ wants to allow the FBI to make judgments  about people based on what they know from that database,  even if it's not accurate.  Bar ordinary people from getting information  from the database about what's in there  so you can't verify it.  No, I don't smell like that.  That's not my scent.  I'm a Chanel number five guy.  Bar people from correcting inaccurate information  held about them.  And, probably most important, provide itself immunity  so the FBI cannot be sued if it violates your rights  or breaks the law using this  next generation identification system.  They want access to your internet records  without a warrant.  They're seeking congressional authority to expand the NSL,  the National Security Letters,  so that they can be used to get information about you  and about your browsing, your internet history.  And, by the way, no judge ever sees those subpoenas,  let alone approves them.  I mean, it just goes on and on.  I agree, we want to live in a safer world.  We don't want ISIS to win by any means,  but what are we willing to give up?

Transcript:  Yeah, it really seems like the government response  to terror attacks has just been like,  we need more information.  We need to be able to gather more information.  Encryption is getting in our way,  and so we've seen a bill introduced  to make end-to-end encryption that can't be broken impossible.  But the other thing that these attacks have in common  is the use of guns,  and we just haven't seen much movement on that  beyond the Obama executive order about developing,  putting more resources into developing  smart gun technology.  But still, if somebody buys a gun,  then smart gun technology isn't gonna allow them to use it.  So it's interesting that we keep focusing  on information gathering,  and not on the other part of these attacks.

I will hazard a guess that none of you have ever sat  in a sheriff's department office at three o'clock  in the morning when there was a missing child  looking at very confidential information  about sex offenders, trying to figure out  if any of those sex offenders might have something to do  with the missing child.  And I will tell you that if I could have gotten  more information about those people,  I would have done whatever was necessary  to get that child home.  I understand that, David,

They're not getting a lot of signal with their.  Well, that's a larger question.  Yeah, they're just like.  Is this even effective?  Let's just get everybody, let's get all the metadata,  and that doesn't help them.  Instead of targeting individuals,  they're targeting everyone, which creates a huge problem.

They wanna spy on your pacemaker.  They wanna gather information about you  on biomedical devices installed in you.  And of course, look, I agree with you, David.  I understand their heart is in the right place.  We're not saying that.  I'm not saying, and I think there are people saying that.  I'm not willing to say that the NSA  is somehow extra governmental  and trying to take over our liberties.  I think they're working to make us safer.  They believe this is what they need to do to make us safer.  But at the same time, I think this is  a constitutional republic, and we have certain protections.  And I think overstepping those protections  because they think it makes us safer  is not a good solution.

If you want a browser that you know is not very secure,  it's a trade-off that you make  that people are going to, rightly or wrongly,  be able to get at your data.  That's what I was getting at is,  is the convenience of the internet worth the crime,  you know, the hidden tax and everything we do  for internet crime that we don't even add up  because people, if we knew it,  people would revolt on the internet  if they knew how much theft occurs over the internet.  So it just never comes up, how much banks pay,  how much credit card companies pay,  how much everybody pays in order for us  to have the convenience of the internet.  Is that convenience worth what we're paying for it  in dollars, in security, in whatever?  You know, should consumers be able to make a better,  a better equation of what they give and what they get?  Because we already, with all of these terms of services  we all sign, God only knows how much data  that we willingly give to businesses  that we don't want the government to have.

I do think you need to keep in mind  that there are many damages that you yourself  have not had to suffer.  I mean, people that end up on terror watch lists,  people who can't fly because they end up on a list.  I mean, with the recent death of Muhammad Ali,  and Martin Luther King were put under  essentially illegal surveillance for their beliefs.  I mean, this is stuff that has happened  and will continue to happen.  And so you do need boundaries  on the kind of information gathering that happens  so that those like terrible edge cases  that really threaten civil liberties don't happen.

Transcript:  J. Edgar Hoover wrote him a letter saying,  "'You should commit suicide.  "'Here's what we know about you.'"  I mean, admittedly, that was a long time ago,  but I have to say there's plenty of evidence  of government malfeasance with this information,  and giving them more information  is not making them any more responsible.

Start time: 7901.80
End time: 7914.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not as recent malfeasance,  I agree with you about J. Edgar Hoover,  the man who couldn't be fired  because of what he knew about everybody  and had real life physical agents everywhere.  No, he should have been in jail, no question about that.

I'm a vegetarian, I believe in animal rights,  blah, blah, blah.  I flew for the next five years post-9-11.  I was always pulled aside for all my luggage being checked.  I couldn't fly anywhere without,  oh, we've randomly pulled you aside  to check your luggage every time.  I read it just at Devon.  I don't have any facts.  I mean, it could have been completely random.  I mean, the odds are pretty high.  I think there's a lot of evidence this goes on.

Transcript:  I read a very disturbing piece in Medium this week  by a UI designer who was trying to go to England  to give a talk who was detained for two days  and then eventually deported for really no apparent reason,  but just kind of petty bureaucracy.

They were very polite the entire time  when they were going through all of my luggage,  but it's hard not to, and I'm no longer on this list.  You're always saying that  because you want to be able to fly.  I'm already on a list now.  Yeah, you're back on it, baby.  So I'm on a list, and then you start covering security  and you're definitely on another list, and then yeah.

Transcript:  And I think that's what's so hard about it  is when it's that kind of Kafka-esque,  you have this sense that you're on a list.  It's these petty insults.  You're probably on a list,  but there's no way for you to check  and there's no way for you to challenge it,  and that is what is at the heart of that debate  over this database that the FBI has,  just the idea that they're making it even harder  to do anything about it if you're kind of in there wrongfully  or if there's information that's incorrect about you  in databases.  Even Uber and Lyft actually signed onto the letter  of all these civil liberty organizations  objecting to the secrecy of that biometric database.

Like this is the culture I'm from  and now I'm a vegetarian,  I live in San Francisco, blah, blah, blah.  But an assault rifle is,  that's, you know,  it's only for killing people.  That is exactly what it's made for  and it shouldn't be sold to people.
