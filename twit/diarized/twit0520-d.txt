Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Unfortunately, your office didn't have Tang,  so I am scraping the bottom of the twit barrel, if you will.  Again, I wanted the Jameson Rocks,  but unfortunately your bar has failed me.  So I shall fail you instead.

Start time: 157.18
End time: 162.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  All right, your mom did,  because she said, I want him.  Someday there will be a social network called Twitter.

Start time: 162.48
End time: 166.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, more of a proto Twitter at that point in time,  kind of way back in the stone ages of technology.  You were born in 1989?

Start time: 167.26
End time: 181.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You were born in what, 1942?  That makes you 26 years old.  As of two years ago, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you're just a child.  I am, dude.  Speaking of children,  Steven Stevens is also here.  Great to have you.  He is a editor at large at CNET,  focusing though a lot on cars.  We'll have a little to talk about today.

Start time: 181.60
End time: 188.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's saying that I have a lot of children  or that I am still a child.  You don't have children, do you?  I have no children at all,  which made me a little bit nervous there from that.

Start time: 188.94
End time: 193.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Don't you talk about the beard though.  The beard says no kids, I feel.  That's really, I think, a leading indicator of no kids.

Start time: 193.60
End time: 218.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought beards were dad things.  No.  No?  It just says no shaving.  That's what it really says.  And Georgia Dow from Montreal at imore.com.  Great to have you, Georgia.  Nice to see you.  Last time I saw you, it was WWDC, the Apple Music Announcement  and all of that.  Was it WWDC really?  Gosh, seems like it.  How has Apple Music been to you?  Because it's only been out now for a month.

Start time: 219.04
End time: 240.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  You like it?  I'm enjoying it.  I find that it's a lot of fun.  I find a lot of different tracks  that I wouldn't find naturally.  It feeds my lazy natural nature  and I can just listen to music as I need to.  You just push play.  Yeah.  I just ask Siri to play something for me  and it finds any song, almost any song that's in existence  that I would want to listen to.  So that's great.

Start time: 240.50
End time: 248.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple folks seem to say Siri is the kind of magic sauce  for Apple Music.  Because that's one thing that nothing else can do, right?  If only it worked though.

Start time: 249.18
End time: 260.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, Siri, I feel like we've all had iPhones  now for some time.  Siri's been on them for a long time.  And the experience hasn't gotten that much better, I feel,  on an incremental basis over the last, what,  two, three years now.  Right.  I'm like, eh, pass.

Start time: 261.14
End time: 264.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't function.  I mean, what do you say to Siri, Georgia?

Start time: 266.12
End time: 273.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll just say play Smooth Criminal from Glee  or something else. Oh no.  And then we find it.  Oh my God, that's so wrong.  From Glee?

Start time: 274.66
End time: 279.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Can we cut off her Skype stream?  This is not gonna work out.  Georgia, you're, we're gonna wrap that.

Start time: 279.78
End time: 282.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was with you until you said Glee.  I didn't know it wasn't Glee.

Start time: 283.50
End time: 286.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was Renee.  It was Renee who showed me all this.

Start time: 288.32
End time: 296.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're a smooth criminal.  It was Renee.  I'm sneaking in your house late at night.  Oh, that's dope.  Please don't.  Or it was Billie Jean or something.  Billie Jean.

Start time: 296.68
End time: 306.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But he showed it from like all the different,  all the different songs that it could just find  just by asking.  So even if you're listening to it  from one of your favorite shows,  it'll be able to figure it out, which is really neat.

Start time: 306.60
End time: 309.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Surely it has Michael Jackson doing Smooth Criminal.

Start time: 309.90
End time: 313.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, if you ask for it, it will.  That's one problem.  A lot of music services, if you say,

Transcript:  Right, Georgia, does it have tool?  Is tool on the service?  I don't know.  What is tool?

Start time: 323.84
End time: 328.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tool, what's tool?  That's what they make wedding gowns out of, it's pink.  No, that's, just for yourself.

Start time: 330.40
End time: 341.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Tool is an alt metal band that does a lot of prog rock  and they're not on Spotify,  which is my main beef with Spotify today  because there's no tool on.  Georgia, can you ask Siri?  Yeah, you do it on live for us if you could.  I will.

Start time: 342.40
End time: 343.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She'll probably navigate you to a tool.

Start time: 343.32
End time: 345.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Siri, can I play tool?

Start time: 348.20
End time: 350.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's what I found on the web for Siri,  can I play tool?

Start time: 351.32
End time: 352.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And that's why Siri is bull crap.

Start time: 353.94
End time: 360.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I found it on the web.  But what song is it?  Because there's so many ways that you,  it's gonna understand what tool means.  So do you know one of their songs or the band?

Start time: 360.64
End time: 367.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look, if Siri can't figure out what tool is  in a musical context, then I quit.  But no, it's not a musical context.

Start time: 367.40
End time: 369.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Siri is in every context.  That's not.

Start time: 369.56
End time: 376.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, then it's bad.  Like if you can't do what she wants,  play implies music.  Tool is one of the biggest bands.  Say this.  It shouldn't be able to do that.

Start time: 376.18
End time: 380.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you play, say Siri, play tool,  prison, sex, and sober?  There we go.

Start time: 382.90
End time: 385.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Siri, can you play tool, prison, sex, and sober?

Start time: 386.08
End time: 387.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just wanted to hear her say that.  Dangerous.

Start time: 388.78
End time: 391.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sorry.  We don't know those are tracks off Tool's first album.

Start time: 391.82
End time: 393.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, could not find it.  There is no tool.

Start time: 394.28
End time: 398.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not unusual that Spotify, if Siri,  if Spotify doesn't have it,  that Apple Music wouldn't have it.

Start time: 398.62
End time: 415.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I agree with that entirely.  Because it's probably tools,  tools saying you can't have it.  Certainly, but I think people say Apple Music is better  in some way, it has more.  Well, it might.  It apparently doesn't,  because the one thing I can't find,  the one thing I can't find on Spotify is that.  And if they don't have it,  why am I gonna move my playlist over,  give them different money?  Like, just no.  Right.

Start time: 415.80
End time: 423.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And there is voice search on Spotify as well.  You can do the same sorts of things there,  especially if you're using something like Android Auto.  You can do, say, play me something by so-and-so,  and it'll play.

Start time: 424.16
End time: 432.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, and I said in the past  that you couldn't upload your music collection to Spotify,  but somebody's corrected me on that as well.  Right?  You can.

Start time: 433.66
End time: 436.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I honestly don't know.  Yeah, I didn't.

Start time: 437.28
End time: 453.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought you couldn't.  No, you can.  You can, though.  So that was one real differentiator.  I thought that Google All Access and iTunes Music  will include your existing record collection  along with their 30 million songs.  So if you had Tool ripped, you'd have it in there.

Start time: 453.92
End time: 471.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but I feel like we were sold the premise of,  like, streaming music is the future.  No longer keep that stack of CDs.  Don't worry about your files.  Just have the application and you're good to go.  So if, given that's a 99.5% solution,  I'm not gonna go to the record store  and buy a bunch of Tool albums,  rip them and put them online  because it's the one band I don't have.  I feel like they should just solve that problem  and get to an end to it with a 95%.

Start time: 472.52
End time: 481.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you have to blame Tool for that.  I will Tool our bunch of Tools.  Yeah.  There you go.  Tool the Tool bag.  There you go.  Please don't ban me.  Jim Dowrymple of...

Start time: 481.88

End time: 516.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jim Dowrymple of Loop Insight wrote a screed  screaming at Apple Music.  Now, Jim is an Apple guy.  I mean, he loves Macintosh, he loves Apple,  but he said, that's it, I'm not using Apple Music anymore.  It lost 2,400 of my songs,  mostly oddly enough Ozzy Osbourne and Black Sabbath.  I thought it was 4,700 songs.  Well, it was a lot.  But anyway, the update on the Loop is that Apple...  But see, you're gonna get special help  if you're Jim Dowrymple.  Apple worked with him and they got all but a few hundred back.  In any event, doesn't sound like a good experience.  Jim will join us on Tuesday.  We'll find out.

Start time: 516.50
End time: 531.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To see that he is definitely an Apple lover,  but obviously he's more of a music lover  than an Apple lover.  He's also a beer lover,  so I wonder if there were ever an Apple beer service  that lost some of his beers  or that would rank in there.  But certainly music seems to rank higher than Apple  in his priorities.

Start time: 531.40
End time: 550.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And rightly so.  Happy 30th anniversary to this.  Ugh!  Do you know what that is, kids?  This is what mom and dad used to play with late at night  after you were asleep.  It's an Amiga.  30 years ago on Friday, the Amiga came out.  Let me play the promo video from 1987.

End time: 560.14

Transcript:  Step into a brave new world of power,  performance, and productivity.  Yeah!  Made possible by the new Commodore Amiga 500 home computer.

Start time: 560.32
End time: 564.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look at that, that's made on the Amiga.  That's not done.  That's a MS-Pen, I'm proud of it.

Start time: 564.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow, stand back.  I am the Commodore Amiga 500.  I am the ultimate home computer.  So easy to use, with powers and abilities  far beyond anything you may have ever experienced before.  I am dazzling graphics and animation.  A home office productivity wonder.  I am extraordinary home video production and special effects.  A versatile composer of thought as well as music.  I am arcade quality games and stereo.  A teacher of fact and a teller of tales.  I am 512,000 bytes of...  Oh, a smoke machine!  A lighter?  Yeah.  Of internal memory.  Ooh!  Oh man, Superman!  I can roll a 68,000 microprocessor.  A built-in three and a half inch disk drive  and a floating keyboard with 10-function keys.  In drive, how dare they?  Baby stocks.  Versatile, easy to use menus and pull-down windows  make me adaptable to virtually every goal  and aspect of your life.  At the touch of a button, at the click of a mouse,  I am yours to command and control  at a price you can afford.  This is a long ad.  I am the building you ever thought possible.  Yeah.

Start time: 632.44
End time: 636.46

Start time: 636.48
End time: 638.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, really.  There was a-  No, it got arcade quality graphics.  An event at the Computer History Museum on Friday  celebrating the 30th anniversary of the Amiga.  And, you know, we're laughing at it,  but we've come a long way in 30 years,  but this was really a breakthrough when it came out,  the graphics particularly.

That's on YouTube if you want to watch the entire nine minutes.  It'll be in the show notes if you want.  It's in the show notes.  Apple Music said,  Jim Dalrymple is a nightmare and I'm done with it.  Wow.  Dave Mark, who's also on loopinsight.com responded,  why I'm not done with Apple Music.  Jim Dalrymple.

Start time: 724.20
End time: 732.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He basically said all the same things,  but yet he's a little more optimistic for the future.  It wasn't much of a rebuttal in my opinion.  It was more of, yeah, I have the same issues,  but I'm a little bit more optimistic.  Yeah.

Start time: 733.54
End time: 754.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, what do you think, Tim?  It seemed like the issues that Jim really had  were came down to the fact that Apple didn't distinguish  between songs that were on different albums.  Same song, different album.  Like a compilation album, a best of, and the original.  And it seems to me that's a minor,  that's something most people wouldn't care about.

Start time: 754.80
End time: 801.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It definitely seemed like catalog issues for the most part.  And that's a huge issue.  Nothing does that well.  A long time ago, I actually helped with the other startup  that was trying to do some streaming music stuff.  And that was a huge issue, just trying to get people  to kind of trawl through these massive catalogs of music  to make sure that everything is linked up as it should be.  That makes me wonder if indeed Apple Music  didn't kind of come together in the last minute.  Like there was a lot of rumors that maybe it did.  But that's definitely a bad sign of data integrity issues  and that kind of thing within, if you're losing music.  And like you mentioned, Jim is obviously getting  some special treatment here.  I wonder if anybody who on the street had lost 4700 tracks,  if they'd had the same issue.  But yeah, I mean, these are the sorts of issues  that will certainly go away.  But when you're coming out of the gate  and taking on Spotify that's been in the market for years now  and is in a pretty good state,  these things have got to be perfect.  And pretty clear that this is not perfect yet.

Start time: 802.72
End time: 813.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually had to, Georgia, rely on Serenity Caldwell  to explain to me some of the ins and outs of Apple Music.  She's written a whole bunch of stuff  and on the Beats 1 radio.  It's not completely intuitive.

Start time: 815.48
End time: 837.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I think that that's like,  it's just a really big problem in trying to figure out  what does everything mean and what do you actually have  and what shouldn't you delete versus what you can keep  so that you always have a hard file  and you're not gonna have to worry  about losing a whole bunch of songs  that you're really attached to.  So I do the same thing, I just ask Serenity.  Serenity, what can I delete, what can't I?  What do I have to do so I don't have to lose anything

Start time: 838.27
End time: 857.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's important?  Some of these problems go back to the fact  that we're in between the physical media era  and the streaming media era.  Well, you're obviously a child, Alex.  Indeed, I'm a teen, actually.  Practically a teenager.  I'm 14.  Do you still have any attachment to physical media  or can we just let that go?

Start time: 857.72
End time: 864.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I mean, in terms of news, I absolutely do.  I love reading the paper.  You like a paper?  Absolutely.  Because I read more broadly.  It demands that I branch out.

Start time: 870.74
End time: 901.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  so it kind of works out.  But for music, I've really left behind  the entirety of owning music  and I just rent it and pay for it now.  I mean, back in the Zune days,  people forget that Zune software was actually fantastic  back when it was live.  I used to love to own songs, upload them, buy them,  store them, track them, back them up and so forth.  Now, Spotify, I see no actual reason to do that.  So, talk about buying tool albums,  I just don't even think that direction anymore.  I'm just like, oh, why I pay much of my own money.  So that's why it's upsetting because they don't have it.  Right, and I would pay,  if they were like, Alex, Spotify plus tool  is 20 bucks a month, I'd be like, done.

Transcript:  We know those headphones that sell through iPhone  that have the 10 sound quality of like 10 things  being waxed to the state.  That's why.  I don't think they care.  Yeah.  And Beats headphones are notoriously bad for sound quality,  so I don't think it's really a priority for them.  But I mean, I think Spotify,  if they can increase their content library,  is the main play for the future, at least for me.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Did you read the article,  the post from the creator of Seek Pod?  Yeah.  Apple, he says,  got, basically targeted me  and got the music labels to shut him down.  You may remember back in 2007,  Seek Pod was a search engine for music.  And I guess, of course, part of the issue  is that much of that music was illegal,  although that wasn't a necessity.

I was told by Warner Music  that Steve Jobs had a meeting with them  and said that streaming user services like Seek Pod  are gonna be a problem if we're gonna make a deal with you.  So this is a problem company  that needs to quote be addressed, end quote, by Warner.  Warner.

Transcript:  It'd be a shame if something happened to your music service.  It would be a shame.  It'd be a shame if it burned the ground.  Fire's happening, Colonel.  People forget that Apple doesn't make a lot of money  by accident.  And they don't win categories like iTunes  for 10 years by playing nice.  They play hard.  They make great products.  I mean, I'm an Apple guy mostly.  But they don't win by mistake.  And so in this case, this beautiful story actually  lays out the history of how Seek Pod was essentially wrecked  by legal fees and so forth and how they couldn't survive.  They were sued for, what was it, $40 billion  at some point in time, which was a ludicrous quantity.

Transcript:  120K per search, which makes no mathematical,  I know, I know.  It's crazy.  It's almost like lawyers are not nice.  But they eventually failed.  And so we saw innovation in a way be snuffed out  by incumbent interests, which is really too bad.  Although iTunes was revolutionary at its time,  it certainly shows how they protect that franchise  with the heavy weight of $40 billion lawsuits.

I've had conversations with many companies  who have found themselves in the music industry's sites.  And it's not pretty.  But what Casey and Frank says in his article here on Medium  is that he realized he wasn't fighting the record labels,  he was fighting Apple computers  that was using the record labels as a proxy to attack him.  And I think that's when he says, I realized it was over.

Transcript:  Well, to Brandon's point, if this is Apple Sue's  small startup to, in fact, they can't do that.  But if Warner Music does, everyone already hates them.  Apple has to protect its consumer-based rights.  Can't do any worse.  But I mean, they have the labels by the needs.  So they have to do what they want, I think,  or they can renegotiate in Sue and so forth.  So Apple really has almost a standing army  of not its own lawyers, but also your lawyers  and his lawyers and her lawyers to do their work.  Which is impressive.  But they have $200 billion in cash, so.

Transcript:  Okay.  FTC is investigating Apple's practices,  the 30% cut that Apple takes  out of streaming music subscriptions,  which forces competitors like Spotify and Pandora  to either charge higher rates  or lose an amount in revenue equivalent.  In other words, the record labels say,  hey, we're getting 70% from Apple.  What about you, Spotify?  So Franken is actually piling on.  He's written a letter to both the FTC  and the Department of Justice,  also saying Apple is anti-competitive.  So there is an investigation on that.

Start time: 1214.96
End time: 1224.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He does this every single week, though.  Franken is infamous for the amount of press releases  he puts out demanding things.  It's part of this PR strategy.  So I'm never quite sure if he takes it seriously  or just kind of disregards it entirely.

And I think that out of all of us,  he, you know, utilizes all of the fitness sets the most.  He really enjoys that it reminds him  when he needs to take something,  when he needs to do something, and keeps him on track.  I find for me, because I do contact sports  where I'm versus another person,  I cannot actually wear my watch during that period of time  because I could injure them with it, so,  which is not allowed.  I could injure them with my body, that's allowed,  but I can't injure them with my watch.  Not allowed.  So, how much per day do you wear the Apple Watch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I am at work, I use it constantly.  So if I'm out of the house, I use it almost all the time.  If I'm at home, I usually don't have it on.  So at home, I don't want to be bothered or notified  or deal with anything I wanna shut off.  So I don't have my phone on, it doesn't ring,  I turn my phone off, and I usually leave my watch to charge.  So rarely do I actually use it in my home.  Charging is one of the issues.

Start time: 1498.62
End time: 1512.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've not had any problems with it.  It easily gets through the day with a lot of juice left.  But Lisa, who exercises,  people seem to exercise with the watch on,  especially the 38 millimeter claim  that they're having trouble keeping a full day's charge.  Have you seen that?

Start time: 1513.74
End time: 1533.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, well, it's gonna be using the heart rate monitor  so it's more active when you're training.  Plus, it's smaller, so the 38 is smaller.  So because of that, it's gonna be,  the battery life is not gonna last really as long,  but I usually have it that it has an extra 30, 40%  by the end of the day.  It's funny. So I don't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I don't think you're far off, Alex.  I think it's probably Apple subtly saying,  we know you're all a sedentary bunch.  So the best thing we could do in a watch  is to get you stand up for one minute an hour.

Transcript:  But that's why you need to have the Apple Watch.  It helps, you know, mock you into actually getting up  every once in a while, or at least reminding you  so you'd have the choice to do it.  I think that the one thing that I really would like  to have changed is I would like to have the option  to have the low power and always,  like the watch fails as a watch for me.  That's the problem with my Apple Watch.  Is that, you know, if I'm in session  or if I'm in a meeting with someone,  I cannot, you know, it's really hard to flick my wrist  or tap my screen without someone noticing  that I'm checking the time.  That's a little distracting, yeah.  Yeah, so it does not do a good job.  So I actually have, even if I'm wearing my watch,  I have to have my little tiny watch on the desk  during my sessions so that I can also keep track  of the time.  So I would love if it could just have like, you know,  I'll be good with the watch.  I don't care if I have to recharge halfway through the day,  but let it be a watch and always have the time on for me.

Transcript:  So Georgia, does it, is it as bad as phone etiquette?  Cause I feel like now whenever I'm out to dinner  with friends or my partner or whatever,  we just put our phones down a little stack  just to keep them out of the way.  Does the watch keep you more?  You're one of those people.  No, no, we do it politely just when we're hanging out.

Start time: 1666.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The whole point is we're trying to not tweet texts  and so forth during dinner.  We're trying to be with the group, you know,  trying to be personal.  Yeah.  So does the phone allow you to be kind of like  still plugged in even when you're trying to be more,  I don't know, available in a social setting?

Start time: 1681.62
End time: 1705.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that it's a great cheat.  You can very, you know, casually lift up your wrist  and take a peek and no one's gonna notice.  And so I think that it's a great way  that you can stay connected.  It's not something that's gonna be interfering.  You know, the problem with the phone is that they're huge.  So my iPhone 6 Plus takes, you can't see me at all  if I'm gonna take a look at it.  There's no discreet way to get that out of my pocket  or out of my purse.

And the problem was because they were not  actually deleting the information,  the hackers were mad that it was offered  as a for sale feature.  And so they went after it because they weren't  actually deleting the information.  So they built essentially the biggest blackmail database  of all the time.  Because they had the data still on the site.

Right.  Not because we're voyeurs, well, we are,  we're little voyeurs, but we're really interested  in the lives of others, right?  And documentaries to me are that,  but in a kind of a legitimate way  of seeing how the other guy lives.  Doc Club is new from Sundance.  It's Sundance now, Doc Club, a streaming service  for those of us who love documentaries.  Now, I have my picks on there,  my five favorite documentaries,  but you can get the run of the place for 30 days  when you go to docclub.com slash twit.  Real people, there's one on here that I had found,  and I don't know how I found it, but I loved it.  It's called Deep Water.  It's the story, right after Chichester did his solo  around the world sale, right?  This became all the rage, and Great Britain,  I think it was The Guardian, decided to have a competition  of solo around the world sailors,  but one of the people who signed up for it  was a complete amateur sailor,  and the story that comes out of it is amazing.  The movie's called Deep Water.  He ends up kind of pulling over and just waiting,  and then he skips, it's an incredible story.  Spoiler alert, Leo.  Yeah, sorry, spoiler alert.  Actually, I didn't tell you the big spoiler,  but you'll have to watch it for that.  It's a shark.  It's a shark.  Really, so I like sailing, so this is a great story.  If you like crossword puzzles, wordplay,  which not only is it a great story  about the crossword puzzle competition,  but it's also, it features the puzzle designer,  Will Shortz from the New York Times, and it's just fabulous.

Transcript:  Let's see how the Ashley Madison lawsuit goes  and I'll let you know.  Your settlement time.  Let's talk Chrysler.  We talked about this on Security Now on Tuesday.  It's a fascinating story.  We had talked before about the insecurity of automobiles.  One of the things most auto designers have done  is even though they have two computer systems,  an entertainment system and the system running things  like the brakes and the ignition,  and one would think, and they certainly say  that these systems are separate,  it turns out in fact they're not.  That almost all of them are on the same bus.  They use CAN bus because it's cheap,  not particularly secure.  And that means that if you can get  into the entertainment system,  you perhaps can get into the car's operational systems  and that can be a real problem.  We've seen hacks before with people  who have physical access to the car,  but Charlie Miller, who you remember  from the Pwn to Own contest every year,  he's the guy who wins big bucks hacking the Mac every year,  has demonstrated a remote hack.  He was able to hack a Jeep in this Wired article  remotely from his living room, sitting on a couch.  Turns out the Jeeps, like many cars,  have 3G access, in this case from Sprint,  and they were able to figure out  what the IP address was for every car,  where the car was located,  and then using undisclosed software.  Apparently they're gonna try to tell the world at DEFCON.  We'll see.  I have a feeling they'll be prohibited from doing that.

Transcript:  I'm very impressed by this,  underscoring the dangers of the internet of things  kind of movement we have right now  across all sorts of other forms of electronics,  cars, toasters, whatever.  People don't realize there's a risk  built into each one of those connections  until we have better, I think, larger end-end encryption.  This will keep happening, but Tim, you're the expert here,  so let's go.

Start time: 2518.72
End time: 2520.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, anything online is at risk.

Start time: 2521.40
End time: 2536.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's still a lot of question marks about this story,  and they haven't exactly proven yet  that they can do this without any physical access  to the car, that's the big story,  because before this demonstration was run,  they had plenty of time to do whatever they wanted to  with this car, within the car.  And that's a big question.

Start time: 2536.52
End time: 2540.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's what Fiat Chrysler said.  It said it would require physical access to the car.

Start time: 2540.82
End time: 2615.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, if you can do this without physical access  to the car, that is incredibly, that's horrifying.  That's really bad, but if you have to get into the car  and do something within the car  to open up the door for this kind of an attack,  that's a little bit better.  And that's what Fiat is saying,  that there needs to be physical access,  but they're saying that they didn't need  physical access at all.  That's what remains to be seen.  That's what I'm hoping that we find out  when they do a better demonstration of this.  But yeah, absolutely, there's supposed to be  some sort of a hard firewall  between the infotainment system with the radio  and the heater controls and all that stuff,  and the CAN bus network,  which actually controls the power steering,  the brakes and everything else.  And if you can bridge that gap, then at that point,  you can steer the car, because most cars,  these are quite a few cars anyhow,  have electronic power steering,  which means the computer can actually turn the wheel.  Certainly for the brakes, which is built in,  a lot of cars have throttle by wire,  which means the computer is controlling the throttle too.  So the computer can steer the car, it can change lanes,  it can certainly stop the car,  or it can disable the brakes too, if it wants to.  And that's definitely a very scary notion  with the idea that a hacker could get into the car.  But again, the big question in my mind is,  can they do that without having to get into the car  in the first place?  And if someone can get into your car,  they can do all sorts of bad things today.

Start time: 2615.58
End time: 2621.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, once somebody has physical access  to any computing system, well, all bets are off.

Start time: 2621.14
End time: 2625.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Exactly, but Tim, do you think they require physical access,  or do you think that's more of a canard here?

Start time: 2626.26
End time: 2699.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think they probably do at this point,  because I don't know how they would learn to identify  that given car without having some kind of access to find it.  I'm guessing that all they probably need is a key  out of the ECU or something like that,  some kind of an identifier to basically figure out  what this car is, and probably a security key.  I bet that's all that they need.  But I would be very surprised if they could do this,  if they could basically be sitting on the side  of the highway, watch a Jeep drive by and click a button  and take it over.  Yeah, for noobs, what's ECU?  I'm sorry, the ECU is the computer that actually  is controlling the works within the car.  And so within any kind of security system for cars,  for example, any kind of a wireless key system  has a pretty simple but sophisticated enough series  of keys that get passed back and forth,  digital keys, that is.  So when you hit the unlock button on your key,  the car unlocks.  And that's pretty hard to actually hack,  but if you can get into the car,  you can figure out the sequence of numbers  that are generated to drive those keys.  At that point, you can unlock that car at will, pretty much.  Same basic idea, I would think, for the wireless connection.  I'm guessing there is some kind of an encryption key  that's involved, that is stored within the ECU,  or somewhere within the car itself.  I'm guessing that they had to get into the car  to find that key.  I could be wrong, but that's my guess.  I would not doubt that.

End time: 2703.10

Transcript:  If somebody has physical access to your car,  they could put sugar in your gas tank.  I mean, it's not hard to, yeah,  could cause problems with a car  if you have physical access to it.  I presume that they, you know, they claimed they didn't  or they didn't need to.  They did, in fact, have access to the author's car.  And I presume that they're waiting to DEF CON.  This is often what happens.  Certainly, Charlie Miller's MO is to hold off  on the big reveal until, you know, the big reveal.  I wonder if they'll be allowed to present at DEF CON  if they really do have a method to do this.

Start time: 2739.94
End time: 2756.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I wonder too,  because this is a step beyond a computer hack.  This is a step beyond taking over someone's browser.  This is definitely creating something  that could threaten the lives of a lot of people.  You know, this is a very limited access.  It's only Chrysler cars with sprint connections  and an 8.4-inch Uconnect navigation system.  Well, but this hack.  Right, exactly.  This hack.

Start time: 2757.44
End time: 2765.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What else is at risk here, Tim?  Like, is this gonna be pervasive across all Chrysler's,  Porsche's, Fiat's, whatever?  Or is this more of a constraint  to one kind of make of one company?

Start time: 2766.24
End time: 2804.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It seems to be tied to that sprint connection somehow.  And I don't know exactly what the details are there.  Again, they haven't given us a lot of details  of exactly how this works.  And I'm definitely very much looking forward  to seeing what goes down at Black Hat 2.  But it seems to be tied to that sprint connection.  And as of now, the recall only affects those Chrysler cars  with that 8.4-inch navigation system, which is an upgrade.  So I'm guessing we're talking a very small percentage  of Jeeps at this point.  But again, if indeed this is a hack  that can be applied on that system,  if it applies to every sprint connection system,  then that's almost every Chrysler that's being sold today.  So there's, again, there's a lot of questions  that are involved at this point  that we don't have the answers for.  It's certainly serious enough that Chrysler decided  to put out a recall for those cars.

Start time: 2805.48

Start time: 2819.62
End time: 2843.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm guessing that they are,  especially because it's such a simple thing.  And especially because they actually just today  got hit with a $105 million fine  for not being proactive enough  when it came to some earlier safety recalls.  So they're getting a couple of black eyes this week.  But I'm guessing they're trying to be a little bit  proactive here and ultimately trying to apply this fix  as broadly as they can,  because ultimately it's just a software update.  And if they can get people to come into their dealerships,  that doesn't take any time at all  to apply that kind of thing.

Start time: 2843.70

Transcript:  Yeah, you get, now Tesla does it over the air, right?

Start time: 2854.08
End time: 2894.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right, and then it happens in the background.  It's not the kind of thing  that you even really necessarily know about.  You might boot up your car one morning  and find out you've got new features  that you didn't have the day before.  So that is already happening on that front.  And Tesla's made a huge investment in security.  I think it was last year they went to Black Hat  and they sent a recruiter there and basically said,  hire us 30 dudes from Black Hat because we need some help.  And that's pretty much what they did.  Because there were a lot of stories  about Tesla exploits last year.  And I'm guessing that the link  between the infotainment system and that CAN bus system,  which is driving actual guts of the car,  is probably a lot tighter than in other cars  when you find it in Tesla.  So Tesla went out and got help.  And I think that ultimately we'll see a lot  of that kind of thing from other major manufacturers  in the near future.

Start time: 2895.26
End time: 2935.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ultimately, you need to air gap the two systems.  I remember talking to Ford and Alan Mullally telling me  they had, not necessarily air gaps.  See, this is the issue.  They said, oh no, no, the Ford SYNC is separate  from the car, the telematics and the stuff  that runs the car, but separate,  I mean, really the best separate is two separate buses.  There's no physical connection  because you can't always rely on software to do this.  Two US senators have introduced a bill  to set standards on vehicle security  and would also create,  the bill would also create a security rating system for cars,  which is not a bad idea.  So you could actually see among other things,  how safe is this?

Start time: 2936.18
End time: 2944.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But does the senators actually know enough about security  to kind of help put together legislation  that would allow for that to be decided  or are they kind of hacks?  You know, I mean, I'm a little skeptical.

Start time: 2945.62
End time: 2995.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and seeing how well it does.  You know, just about anybody can figure out  a good way to do that.  Unless they again go to Black Hat  and hire a bunch of people to make this work.  I have a lot of doubts that this sort of program  could be successful, but ultimately I do think  that the industry needs some kind of oversight,  whether it be some kind of standards of buying  that they themselves create, or you know,  short of that, the government may need to step in  and make something happen.  But you know, there's definitely been a lot of talk  about how these systems are very, very strongly  not linked at all.  And I think this story proves that there is some kind  of a link, even if you need physical access to it.  There shouldn't be.  On sync in particular, you know, you can get access  to some of the car's data from sync apps, for example.  Sync apps can read the vehicle speed and things like that.  So that means there is at least, excuse me,  there is at least a read only portion  of that communication going on.  But as we've seen in many hacks before,  read only doesn't always stay read only.

So you can imagine where smartphones were five years ago,  and that's what they were basically designing against.  There's been a lot of progress in the past couple of years  where manufacturers are doing a better job.  And things like Android Auto and Carpola  are making that easier too.  But ultimately, they're living in this very closed ecosystem  where they're used to having all the keys to the castle  and no one has any insight into what's going on.  And so it's very much like the earlier days  of personal computing where when the first hacks  started happening, these manufacturers were angry  because these people were playing with their sacred systems.  That was very much what Chrysler's response was like.  These guys shouldn't be playing around in our systems  because it's dangerous.  Well, people are going to do it.  They haven't had access to do that in the past,  but now people do and they're going to make it happen.  And so it's gonna be an eye-opening experience  for a lot of these manufacturers.  And frankly, I hope they follow Tesla's direction  and go out and hire the best hackers that they can  and tell them to go crazy on their systems.  Because ultimately, that's the only way  that these exploits are gonna be found.

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  As we get CarPlay and Android Auto in our cars,  this might, instead of making things better,  make things worse.  Ron Amadeo was on Twig this week  talking about his review of Android Auto.  One of the things he pointed out,  yes, you can plug in your modern Android phone  and be able to use it on the screen.  But the software running on the car,  he found at least one of the cars he was using  was Gingerbread that they were using Android  for the multimedia system in the car running,  I guess it was a Hyundai Sonata,  2015 Hyundai Sonata running Android 2.2.  What year was that out originally?  Android 2.2 is I think four or five years old.  But that's exactly what you're saying.  That's the cycle.  That was the latest thing they had  when they started the design of this car.

Start time: 3212.78
End time: 3256.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and they basically standardize things within companies  so that they can kind of plug in  whatever the latest and greatest is  toward the end of the design cycle of these cars.  But ultimately, a couple of years ago,  Hyundai probably thought they were doing this hot new thing  and ultimately, they kind of were that they had half of it.  The Android idea was right.  But ultimately, the specific implementation is wrong.  Whether or not Android Auto and CarPlay  proved to be security risks, that remains to be seen.  The penetration of those two systems is so small right now  that we've got a long way to go.  In theory, those systems are not making any connections  to the car except for things like GPS location and speed.  And that's about it.  But hackers may find a way to get into more  vehicle information through those systems.  And that could be another door into the system too  for hackers.

Transcript:  But Tim, if people keep using Android and cars  and are always so far behind in terms of what's new  and what's safe, doesn't that always represent  a security flaw or risk portal?  I mean, I feel like you can get away from that  using your four year old open source software.  That's why I almost prefer you use QNX or something, right?

Start time: 3294.90
End time: 3342.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it certainly depends.  And QNX is certainly the foundation  for quite a few of these systems.  And Sync was originally built on Microsoft's Windows Embedded  which for all its pluses and minuses,  at least that is a pretty closed system.  But now they switched over to QNX as well.  But ultimately that's just the foundation.  At that point, you gotta build everything on top of it.  And it's what you build on top of it  that really exposes you to these sorts of risks.  I'm inclined to think that Android Auto and CarPlay  are gonna be very secure systems  and ultimately probably a lot more secure  than what these manufacturers could come up with  on their own because Google and Apple  both have faced these sorts of challenges for years now.  So I think that those things are gonna be pretty solid.  And ultimately, we're not far off from the point  where nobody even really cares what these systems are doing  so long as you can plug your phone in  and so long as you can get CarPlay.  So long as you can do that, most people are gonna be happy  and they're not gonna be using those systems anyway.

Transcript:  It definitely depends on the company.  Companies like GM, for example, has made a lot of hires  from the consumer tech industry.  They poached a lot of people from HP, for example,  on WebOS, from Google.  They've made a lot of hires because I think  they've finally come to the realization  that all their embedded systems developers  who've been building car systems for years  don't really have the knowledge or the expertise  when it comes to not only security  but also simple things like interfaces.  Our expectations for what a good interface is  have skyrocketed over the past couple of years  simply because of mobile phones.  And if your developers weren't kind of weaned  in that environment, they might struggle there.  So they have been making quite a few smart hires.  And like I mentioned, Tesla's certainly been doing  quite well there too.  So I do think it's a challenge for them.  And they're also, they've been working  in a very closed environment.  These systems until just a year or two ago  were very, very much proprietary systems  so that each individual car might have  completely different software than each other.  Now they're trying to embrace these open systems  and open source software.  And that's a very new thing for a lot of these developers.  So I think it's a mix and I think there's definitely  quite a few risks there.

Transcript:  What do you know about the onboard diagnostic system?  My car and my actually all cars since the mid 90s  have OBD2 ports that you can,  I mean, I think they're intended for technicians  to plug in, but you can buy, I bought a $30 dongle  I plug into the OBD2 port and I use software on my phone  to see how the engine's doing and all that.  Is this pretty secure?

Start time: 3437.94
End time: 3487.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is fairly secure in terms of what you can basically,  you can do a lot of reading from that port.  It's pretty hard to do writing.  You certainly can.  And in fact, there are chip upgrades  and that kind of thing that you can basically do  from plugging into your OBD2 port  and making changes to engine parameters.  So it is possible to do things like  change throttle mappings and boost pressure  if you have a turbocharged car,  you can do that kind of thing through the OBD2 port.  But primarily the sorts of applications that we see  are reading fuel mileage, speed, location,  you can get location information from there as well.  So that is a fairly secure thing.  But again, if someone has access to that port,  then they've got basically they've got  physical hard access to your car.  And at that point, I would be very  I'd be very skeptical about what I'm plugging in there.  You know, I have an OBD2 reader as well.  If I have a check engine light,  I use it to see what the check engine code is.  But once I'm done with that, I pull it out and I certainly.  Oh, you don't leave it in?

I think you're probably OK, but definitely keep an eye on the news  and see what's coming up, because that is definitely effectively  creating a physical access to your car, some sort of physical access to your car.  And that's all that a lot of hackers would need to get in there.  And for example, pull down information about the wireless keys.  I was talking about before that kind of thing.

Let me tell you what a discovery Harry's was.  These guys, they one of them, Jeff was one of the founders of Warby Parker.  He specializes, as a lot of entrepreneurs do these days, in disruption  and like finding businesses that aren't working for people and making them work better.  And of course, as anybody who's ever gone to the drugstore  to buy a razor blade, knows these things are so overpriced, they're locked up.  You have to get an attendant to unlock.  It's like gold.  Instead of buying a four dollar blade, a Gillette Fusion blade,  how about half as much for a better blade?  And how do I know it's better?  Because Harry's bought the factory.  They wanted to make blades that were designed for performance,  that were designed for reliability.  And they decided the only way to do it was to actually buy the factory.  One of the two blade factories in Germany,  they make their own blades, engineering them for sharpness and high performance.  And then they ship them free to your front door.  So, but of course, before you start the Harry's subscription,  you got to get the Harry's kit.  There's two kits, the Winston and the Truman.  If you go to Harry's, h-a-r-r-y-s dot com, take a look at the kits.  Very affordable.  The Winston set, which I'm holding right now, it can be engraved.  It's a metal handle. It's really elegant and beautiful.  But, and Steve is, Steve Gibson prefers the Truman set  because he likes the warmth of the plastic and he knows how the handle is oriented.  So you should certainly look at that.  And at 15 bucks, it's very affordable.  What do you get? You get the handle, you get three blades,  and you get Harry, your choice of Harry's new foaming shave gel  or the original Harry's cream.  The gel, you know, a lot of people are gel users nowadays.  The gel is, well, oops.  I got a little bit on the table there.  The gel smells good, it feels good, and it smooths the blades.  So you get a clean, close, comfortable shave.  You can get the gel and the blades delivered, as I said, for free shipping to your door.  It costs about half as much as the razors in the store.  Smells great.  They have a new aftershave moisturizer, too, that protects and hydrates your skin.  Harry's, I'm going to give you five.  Look, there it is, my shave cream.  Five dollars off your first purchase with the offer code TWIT5.  So that means 10 bucks for your starter kit.  That's a good deal.  Ten bucks for the Truman.

I think that people, as more and more hacks are coming out  and people are thinking, you know what, this is something that's really important.  So if the Department of Homeland Security is going to use a BlackBerry,  I think, oh, maybe...  It'd be a smart move, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'd be a very smart move.  You couldn't be...  I mean, they've always, BlackBerry's always pushed the security angle.  And you'd be very, you'd be very smart to persist with it.  Although I understand that one of the BlackBerry...  one country has just decided to shut down BlackBerry in their country.  I'm not sure if it was Malaysia, India, somewhere.

She works at the Globe and Mail in Toronto  and written the book on the story of BlackBerry.  And I think  Pakistan is shutting down BlackBerry services  There we go.  in by December over security,  which probably means the Pakistan government cannot crack.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That sounds not quite what you wanted to say, but all white background.  Such a white background.  I feel like Twitter has a long history of making changes to its platform  that its users don't like.  I mean, we've been on Twitter forever, right?  It's such a weird change to make.  Yeah, but it's one they could have signaled, discussed, talked about

They want to do ads on that background.  They want to do takeovers.  They want to use that space on the website.  And some people say, well, who uses Twitter's website anymore?  Don't you use the Twitter client?  Well, Twitter doesn't want you to use Twitter clients.  They want you to use the web.  That's what they bought.

And therefore I have no control over my own editorial.  You would stop using it.  Well, no, I'm addicted.  But I would complain vociferously on Twitter about Twitter.  Yeah.

So I feel like you have to reply to everyone.  If I get something that's really popular, I end up getting like maybe like there's  50 or 100 people that reply to me.

Start time: 4568.06
End time: 4591.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thing is they change it without asking.  And this is what you consider your own little environment  that you've created.  And then to have someone else go in and mess with it,  it's like someone else going into a room.  And even if they make it look nicer, you're like,  well, you should have asked permission or let me done it.  Because Twitter wants it to be your ecosystem  where you feel safe.  So I think that they should always be wary of when they make  changes to what someone's personal space is.

Transcript:  Well, and people tweeted me, well, it's their home page,  not your home page.  And I said, well, I beg to differ.  It is my home page for Twitter.  Because it's people I follow.  It's the stream I created.  It's not like anybody else's.  Anyway, it was a strange thing to do.  And the only reason it has any import is probably  because I think it's the beginning of some sort of ad  campaign or they're going to use takeovers.  And that would be bad.  I cover their earnings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She says in a tweet,  I simply explained to Twitter that as a freelance writer,  I make my living writing jokes,  and I use some of my tweets to test out jokes  in my other writing.  I then explained that as such,  my jokes are my intellectual property,  and the users in question did not have my permission  to repost them without giving me credit.  She said most of the accounts that were reusing her tweets  were spam accounts,  which is, it is I think my experience as well.  Yeah.  And Twitter just, she said, Twitter just removed them.  They don't even talk to her or ask any follow-up questions,  and they just, in fact, if you search for,  saw someone spill their high-end juice.  Okay.  And a bunch of tweet withhelds.

Wait a minute, you would mind if Chris Rock stole it?  I would send him an at like, hey man, that's mine,  and then I would move on with my life,  because I have other things to do,  but I feel like complaining about spam accounts,  stealing a bad joke. What if Chris Rock retweeted it?  Well then I'd be the happiest man alive.  Yeah, or favored it.  I'd be just a little jig in the studio.  Yeah.  But.

If you're an author, and you're, you know,  if you choose to have your short story broadcast over Twitter,  which I've seen before,  if someone goes through and takes those tweets,  and puts it into a book, that's a problem.

It's the RTM version, but not quite  in the usual traditional sense.  And so I've had a lot of phone calls about this  over the last week and I'm like,  is it the RTM build?  It's the final build.

Wednesday, now I'm not sure exactly what's gonna happen.  I don't think anybody is.  Many people who are running Windows 7 and 8  have already gotten the little icon in their system tray  that says, would you like to reserve your copy of Windows?  I did. Yes.  And I said, yes.  We think that some of those bits may already be arriving  on your hard drive and it won't,  but Wednesday you will give them the opportunity  to install them.  You do not have to install them right away.  It is a free upgrade in the sense that it's free.  You own Windows 10 now.  The only caveat maybe is that you have to install  all updates going forward.  You can defer them for a little bit.  Certainly.  But you will ultimately have to install updates.  That's the tit for tat in getting the free version  of Windows 10.

A good launch is now confusing  and causing discord among the blogosphere,  which is what I do.  And so I feel like they're doing the right things  technologically, but they're screwing up  the actual communications and explanation of it.  Because if we're not sure this close to launch  what's actually happening, they've screwed up.  Because we're not that dumb.  We're just half dumb.

Transcript:  I am too.  You know, I was really not thrilled with Windows 8.  8.1 fixed some of the problems.  But it was such a weird hybrid of a desktop  and a tablet operating system.  And I think Microsoft heard us  and is making it a little bit more your choice.  So if you wanna run it at Windows 10 as a tablet, you can.  And if you wanna run it as a desktop operating system,  boot to the desktop, have a start menu,  all the stuff that we love about Windows,  then you can.  And I think that's really probably the right way to do it.  Have you, were you in, did you do the beta  or are you waiting?

Start time: 5275.76
End time: 5310.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I haven't had the chance to do the beta,  but I should be installing it Monday, actually.  And I'm looking forward to checking it out  and spending some time with it.  I haven't really been that happy with Windows 8.  It's been fine, but I use it exactly like I used Windows 7.  So for me, it's just more clicks to get to the same stuff  that I ever did before.  I don't really use any apps available  through the Windows app store.  I'm not really into only being able to put apps  on a third of my screen or anything like that.  So I am definitely very much looking forward  to seeing how they've kind of taken a step  into a more traditional Windows environment for Windows 10,  but yet hopefully bringing in some of the cooler things  of Windows 8.

Transcript:  We had a Windows 7 launch party.  They sent me playing cards and balloons.  Did you actually use them?  Yeah, I did it on the air  and we installed Windows 7 together.  Did you dance a jig perhaps while it was going on?  And actually, I loved Windows 7.  I thought it was the best version of Windows ever.  It was until now, I feel.  But what did Windows 8 do?

Start time: 5336.14
End time: 5385.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Did they do anything to acknowledge it?  Windows 8 was Steve Lisinowski's pipe dream  that essentially led to, that's your done.  Updates were installed.  But with 10, I honestly feel like they've actually  been so public, so open, so clear  about what they're doing in response and feedback  and fixes and so forth,  they've actually built a better OS  because we've all been part of it.  In the Windows Insider program,  it's not five million people that are doing this.  So instead of it being kind of a mystery  about what we're going to get, we know what it is.  We know where it is, how strong it is, how safe it is.  And so when they now put it out,  we're not gonna be surprised or confused by it,  which is an upgrade.  With a lot of these former launches,  they just were like, here's what you get, you will like it.  And now they're saying, hey, what do you want?  We'll make it for you.  Which is a real change in how you build code.  I think it's gonna be better.  I'm not entirely sure.  But certainly, I feel like they're moving  in the right direction.  But this actual launch cycle itself has been a mess.  But that's their PR problem, not mine.  So, whatever.

Transcript:  It is interesting that Microsoft is giving away  what were the crown jewels,  the things that they made money on, which was Windows.  And in some ways, they're giving away Office,  although you still buy it, but you can give Office online  and it's pretty capable.

Start time: 5400.88
End time: 5432.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're not giving away Windows 10.  If you already have a Windows license,  you can now upgrade.  If you buy a new PC, the OEM is still paying for that.  If you wanna buy it in the box, you still pay for that.  So it's not free.  If you're a business, you're paying for it.  Absolutely.  And so that's not much of a change.  So the business model is now changed,  but not completely torn apart.  They do wanna build a service-based offering,  from actually being economically viable  to replace old OEM revenues for Windows itself.  But you have to start somewhere  and they can't just whole-claw start again  because it's like five or 20 billion dollars in revenue.  So you can't just deprecate that right off the bat.  We'll see.

Transcript:  Amazon did all right.  Of course, speaking of quarterly results,  Amazon surprised everybody by making money this quarter.  It's my understanding that Amazon  kind of controls those dials.  They can make money or not, depending on what they want.  But they reported a 92 million,  that's not a lot for Amazon,  92 million dollar profit for the quarter ending June 30th.  Investors expected a loss.  Yes.  So of course the stock market went, wow!  Ended 10% higher on Thursday.  Sales up 20%.  So they made 92 million dollars,  but they sold $23.2 billion worth of stuff.  Unbelievable.

Start time: 5488.96
End time: 5506.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's not a very good margin  if you're doing the math out there.  It's kind of weak actually.  But I mean, if you expected to be at a loss  and you grow faster on revenue and beat on profit,  that's very good for the street.  So that's where their shares spike.  But I mean, you're still very correct  that they're spending so much money to grow,  their revenue is not that inexpensive  on a short term basis.  So, same story.

Transcript:  Here in the States, most grocery stores,  I think do offer delivery.  We use Safeway and they'll come and they'll deliver  for a fairly low fee.  So why would I do this instead of getting my grocery store  to actually bring it to me?

Start time: 5553.22
End time: 5578.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see, we don't have,  I don't have delivery here at grocery stores.  You can call to order,  but then you have to actually go,  put all the boxes into your car yourself  and then bring it home and unload.  So I would love to be able to just drive up,  have it already set for me and then bring it home.  If they would deliver it to my door,  I think that that would be a much better benefit.  So I think that that wasn't,  that's not a greater thing for Amazon to get involved with  if you already have home delivery.

Yeah, they don't break them out, huh?  So if you are not yet an audible member,  and you've certainly heard us talk about it,  I'm wondering why.  It's certainly not the selection.  I mean, everything comes out on audible now.  Best sellers, fiction, but also non-fiction,  anything you could conceivably want.  There's even computer books,  like programming language books on audible.com.  And of course, if you're a fan of performers  like Aziz Ansari's new book, Modern Romance, just came out.  This is a great way to read those celebrity books.  And often they're read by the author.

I would get 20 hours battery life.  Now they offer a very pure lollipop version of lollipop  they call their Oxygen OS.  You can also get Cyanogen Mod 12 on it.  So the OnePlus Two, people have been very interested.  OnePlus has been giving out tips talking about it.  They say it will be around 450 bucks.  That's about 100 bucks more than the old phone,  but still a lot less than a flagship phone  from anybody else.  700 usually, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So it's still a firm discount.  Oh, it's a great discount.  They're also going to include a Type-C connector and charger.  New USB connector that Apple's using on the MacBook  and Google's using on the Pixel.  Google's already said that the future of Android is Type-C,  so that's pretty excited.

We also think that it's going to have four gigs of RAM,  which makes a big difference in Android.  Apple really manages RAM much better,  but on Android, more RAM is good.  And the interesting thing is the launch tomorrow  will be in VR.  So they're going to be in what?  Virtual reality.  You'll be able to go.  It's going to be 7 p.m. Pacific on Monday,  and you probably should run out and get cardboard  or some sort of VR helmet so that you can go online.  They're actually even offering on their cardboard page  an opportunity to get cardboard that will work.  Oh, it's sold out.  Oh, there you go.  That's not a surprise at OnePlus.  Pretty much.  They made 70.  They can't even get enough cardboard.  That's ridiculous.  So they say that there is going to be an invitation system  again, and in fact, I applied for my invitation immediately,  but that they're going to be far more this time.  So maybe they'll be able to get those out to people.

I think that reliability's been a challenge for them,  so I'm hoping that they improve that as well.

They haven't done a good job of,  they're a Chinese company,  I don't think they have a big support network,  so that's been a concern too.  I've heard from a lot of people,  as I'm sure you have, Tim,  who bought OnePlus phones,  they had a problem,  and just couldn't get them replaced,  couldn't get them fixed.  In any event, it's gonna be interesting to watch.  I'm very intrigued that they're doing a VR announcement  from their offices.  And I hope that the phone is available soon.

Transcript:  That's such a hard fish.  So I've been dying to try out Oculus Rift and went to CAS.  I had my date planned  because I'm really into the virtual reality type of thing,  especially for gaming and just experiential kind of things.  And the day that I left,  Serenity and Renee got to go in my place  and then bragged about it the entire time to me.  So I have never actually used Oculus or HoloLens  or anything else as of yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is a difference.  You can see the world around you with the...  What do you prefer, VR or AR?  Well, okay, so this is a big change  because for a long time I said forget VR.  It makes people nauseous.  It's really only for gaming.  You can't see what's going on.  People could sneak up behind you and cosh you on the head.  But AR, you see what's going on.  It doesn't make you nauseous.  And the use case is amazing.  Now, it's not great for gaming,  although Minecraft looks pretty cool.  Indeed.  But it's not really for immersive gaming.  It's kind of a new user interface imposed on the world.  And I thought that was, I was very excited  until I kind of spent a little more time with the Gear VR  and now I'm kind of more, I'm sold on both.  I think both technologies are very exciting  for different use cases.  But both very exciting.

Start time: 6485.80
End time: 6493.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it's very, very true.  But Tim, if you had to pick right now,  or Georgia, either one really,  between VR and AR for the next five years,  pick one of the two varietals.  What would you pick?

Start time: 6494.62
End time: 6507.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  VR right now.  I think in five years AR could be cool,  but in the intervening years,  AR is probably gonna be rather challenged.  VR is in a much better state right now  than AR is gonna be.  So if I had to choose between the two,  definitely I think VR will be much more cool  over the next couple of years.  Georgia?

Start time: 6508.92
End time: 6516.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm also most interested in VR right now.  I saw the HoloLens and,  I'm not as interested in that,  and in the end I'm just waiting for a holodeck, so.

Start time: 6517.42
End time: 6543.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll take that.  But that's kind of what Oculus is about is,  if you can get the frame rate high enough,  the resolution high enough,  it's immersive and you look to the left,  look to the right.  That's why you get sick, right?  You get nauseous because your mind says,  I'm moving, I'm looking around,  your ear says, no you're not,  you're sitting down.  So I think that that,  I think they're both gonna be huge in five years.

Start time: 6543.28
End time: 6549.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I agree, I agree entirely.  But I think VR will be at their first, AR second,  because it's more difficult of a problem to do

A federal appeals court in Cincinnati  has ruled that somebody who accidentally calls  somebody else is not protected by a right to privacy.  So in other words, you know what,  okay, Georgia, again, you're my guinea pig,  because I admitted to the fact that when I walk by  a lit window at night, I look in.  If somebody butt dials you, do you listen?

Transcript:  Here's the backstory.  Two members of the board of the Cincinnati  Northern Kentucky International Airport  were in Bologna, Italy, October, 2013.  One of them called Carol,  who was an assistant to the chief executive of the airport,  to ask her to book a dinner reservation for them.  So they're calling Kentucky from Bologna, Italy,  saying, can you make a dinner reservation for me in Italy?  After the call, the James Huff, the chairman of the board,  put the cell phone in his suit pocket,  and it butt dialed the assistant's office number.  She said, hello, hello.  The directors didn't hear her  and continued talking about replacing her boss.  For 91 minutes.  For 91 minutes.  That's a long phone call.  That's an expensive phone call from Bologna, Italy.  She, as the assistant, put the phone on speaker  and took notes.

Toward the end of the call,  Huff returned to his hotel room,  recapped the conversation about firing the CEO  with his wife so that she had a second chance  to write everything down.  She got the audio,  the assistant got the audio file professionally enhanced,  typed up her notes,  and gave copies of it to members,  other members of the board.  Now, the husband and wife then sue,  saying you violated federal wiretap law.  It's illegal to intercept  electronic or oral communications intentionally.  The original court ruled for the assistant.  The Huffs appealed.  The appellate judge, Judge Danny Boggs,  and if I ever have to go before a judge,  I want it to be Judge Danny Boggs.

By the way, the judge provided a link to a article,  prevent unwanted butt dialing with Smart Pocket Guard.  Smart, there we go.  An app that he says the defendant should have downloaded.

The other thing, we talked to somebody on the team,  the New Horizons team a couple weeks ago  on the new screensavers, and I asked her,  why aren't there more craters?  You know, the moon is like pockmarked.  Absolutely.  It's not that it's not getting hit by stuff,  but it's active, it's tectonically active.  So the craters are getting covered over.  So I think that's kind of interesting.

Start time: 7077.58
End time: 7096.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, well essentially, I mean,  this deal is gonna happen.  $48.5 billion!  Shout out to Lucas Mandy, my intern,  or our intern, I guess, that I hang out with.  The real story is after the FCC killed the Comcast deal,  essentially, the list went through.  It proves that big combinations on the telco  and cable side are not impossible.

Start time: 7097.92
End time: 7100.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  DirecTV's kind of a weakling though, isn't it?

Start time: 7100.86
End time: 7118.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's say they're allowed to buy it.  If you combine the two biggest players  as they're trying to do the Comcast,  you can't do that, it's too anticompetitive.  In this case, they're gonna let it go through.  The dollar amount's eye popping,  but I mean, in the era in which large tech companies  have tens of billions in cash on hand,  it's not that terrifying.  And I think it's a fair deal, I'm not that opposed to it.

Start time: 7118.62
End time: 7128.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It does make AT&T the largest paid TV company  in the world, 26 million subscribers.  That's bigger than Comcast?  I don't have the Comcast number off the top of my head,

Start time: 7129.00
End time: 7134.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  but I think this combination is.  I think Comcast has 23.5 million cable subs  and 23.3 million broadband subs.

Start time: 7136.74
End time: 7139.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting, they have more broadband subs  than they have cable subs.

Start time: 7139.26
End time: 7142.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm not surprised.  Are you surprised by that?  Yeah, I'm very surprised.  Why?

Start time: 7143.18
End time: 7155.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because Comcast really incents you to get both.  And they even charge you more if you only,  if you get internet without TV,  they charge you 10 bucks more.  So it seems like most people just say,  well, all right, I'll throw in the TV.

Start time: 7156.54
End time: 7171.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but then the special deal ends  and you pay for it for a year and a half,  which I did for three years, by the way,  until last month, so I'm done.  I feel like broadband now is supposed to enter TV  for so many people that it's not a shocking stat to me,  and it's a long time coming.  And so it'll only grow into a discrepancy moving forward.

Start time: 7172.19
End time: 7202.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  26 million is of course a lot smaller  than Comcast Time Warner would have been,  had that merger been allowed to go through.  FCC also made some stipulations.  They required the combined entity to deploy,  this is good for us, high speed fiber optic broadband  internet to 12 and a half million customer locations,  as well as E-rate eligible schools and libraries.  They have to obey net neutrality provisions.  So they're not going to get to squeeze small video providers  as a result of this merger.

Start time: 7202.80
End time: 7209.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And importantly, on the peering side of things,  they have to submit those agreements to the FCC for review.  Love that.  Exactly, so cute. So they can't go to level three

Start time: 7209.48
End time: 7216.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

For a long time, there were no video game consoles  available legally and officially.  You had to go kind of through the black market to get them.  Wow.

Transcript:  But really a good example of what I think,  I have such respect for Reed Hastings, the CEO.  Absolutely.  He made that pivot, a very difficult pivot,  made more difficult by some missteps  saying he was going to merge the two companies  and then we were going to separate,  and it was going to charge you twice as much.  But one of the things,  this is the New York Times writing about it,  one of the things they've done right,  they've fallen in 2010,  they were doing 20 million subscribers to DVD service.  Now it's 5.3 million,  but the way they've made that work for them  and continue to be profitable is by automation.  Yes.  So they have a giant robot now.  I just like saying the word giant robot.  They used to have humans empty the envelopes,  stuff the envelopes.  Now they have a giant robot,  which opens the envelope,  cleans the disc inside, identifies it,  checks that it works,  puts it back in the sleeve and then back on the shelf.  3,400 discs an hour,  which is a 500% increase over humans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Think about how much better their margins are  on digital distribution  as opposed to actual physical distribution.  So as this declines and we move from DVDs  to actually streaming services,  they make more money.  Yeah, because they have six,
