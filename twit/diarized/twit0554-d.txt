End time: 186.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Alex Wilhelms here. That guarantees it'll be an interesting episode from where are you from? Mattermost. Mattermark.  Mattermark. So I installed some software called Mattermost and I was like, how is it that Alex works for this company that does this?  It's kind of like messaging platform. That's because I don't.

Start time: 189.02
End time: 195.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's when I realized I was so close. I'm impressed that you got the name almost right. Matter something. Yeah, well, you know, it matters.

Start time: 195.64
End time: 210.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mattermark. I literally for like a day wondered, I wonder why they hired Alex Wilhelm, because what they do is a Slack competitor, an open source Slack competitor.  It's actually very good. It's really cool. Is it better than Slack? Yeah, self-hosted. Oh, really? So you don't pay anything for it.

Start time: 210.34
End time: 219.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, Slack's pretty cheap for, you know. It adds up if you, you know, it's like five bucks a person per month. But Slack is so good. I feel like that's a cost I'm much willing to eat, even if I have to pay for it myself.

Start time: 219.70
End time: 240.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I love Slack. Is Slack a sponsor today? I love Slack.  We hate it.  From techinsider.io. Is that right? Yeah, I got it right. You got it right. Finally, Steve Kovach is here. That's a division of Business Insider. Yeah, it's our first spinoff site. Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I noticed you have, I didn't notice this before. You have the Skyline of New York on your arm. It's actually not New York. It's a, I'm also peeling because I was on the PCS board earlier. Is it your Monopoly board? What is it?  No, it's kind of an imaginary comic book-y city. It's Gotham. Come on, admit it. It's Gotham. Yeah, he's actually Peter Parker and he works for it.

Start time: 260.62
End time: 282.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I don't know where to begin. There's so much juicy and delicious stuff. I guess I have to start with you, Ian Thompson, in your article. What have I done now?  You wrote the article that busted open the Microsoft caper. Game Developer Conference was this week, GDC. It's a great event and of course Microsoft held, I think, a great panel on how to increase diversity in game developing. You know, how to get more women involved.

Start time: 283.02
End time: 302.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's become a regular thing, this women in gaming lunch and then just a few hours later. They have a party for Xbox with dancers.  Well, wearing the kind of schoolgirl uniforms I wish they wore at my school. Schoolgirls never wore those uniforms, ever. Exactly. Plaid skirts and brassieres, basically. Yeah.

Start time: 304.12
End time: 315.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think your article really galvanized a lot of criticism. I wouldn't have done this story, but you're here. No, no, I mean, it's fine. I can't honestly claim credit for it. Were you at the event?

Start time: 316.10
End time: 344.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it was female developers at the event that started to tweet out about this. Tweeting. People like Branowu and others saying, what is going on? Yeah, exactly. This is, hang on guys, the 1970s call and they'd like their attitudes back, please.  We haven't, I mean, this is booth babes basically. Pretty much. You don't see these at conferences much anymore, right? It's kind of like at the women in gaming lunch if they'd had, you know, sort of Chip and Dale's waiters lightly oiled serving suggestively shaped snacks to female attendees. I mean, it's that kind of level of mental disconnect.

Start time: 344.04
End time: 360.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. And I don't know what on earth went on with the Xbox. Well, Microsoft has apologized now. A very swift and grovelling apology, yes. And it's. But there was no other possible response. If they equivocated even one iota on this, they would have gone through two bad media cycles. Yeah. They only had one option.

Start time: 360.94
End time: 405.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know though, it does remind me of the kind of historically boneheaded PR Xbox has had since they announced the Xbox one. This is the same company that said, well it'll be all right unless you're in a submarine. They always are on thing. I mean so many of their PR people have blundered with around Xbox. Yeah. And it's a shame because I think the Xbox.  I'm an Xbox user. You probably are on PlayStation, guys. I'm on PlayStation. Yeah, you look like a PlayStation. What about me uses PlayStation to you?  Well you're lucky because you know, the other big story at GDC was PlayStation announced their VR. I'm going to buy it no matter how much it costs. See that's what's interesting to me because I also think that a lot of people bought the PlayStation 4 because it was $100 cheaper than the Xbox one. And now you're saying I'm going to buy a $400 visor though.

Start time: 406.24
End time: 417.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is my easiest access to VR. I don't. This is the only computer I own. I don't have a thousand dollar gaming PC. I have a $350 PS4 that I use all the time. As long as it was under $600 all in, I was going to buy whatever they announced this weekend.

Start time: 422.20
End time: 428.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're not going total Apple fanboy then. You do have an upper price limit. Oh yeah. This is not the iPad Pro. Come on. Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 430.30
End time: 442.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nvidia said, I'm trying to remember the number, that there were only something like 18 million PCs in the world that could run an Oculus Rift. Exactly. Tiny number out of the several hundred million. There are 38 million PlayStation 4s.

Start time: 443.36
End time: 488.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're going to be the early leader in the high end VR game. What annoyed me about this announcement was they come out saying it's going to be $399. Everyone flipped out immediately and then you dig in and realize it doesn't come with the PlayStation camera, which is necessary for the thing to actually work.  So for $399, you get a non-functional VR headset unless you already bought the PlayStation. How much is the camera? About $50 or $60 on top of that. It's not that much more. No.  And you need to move controllers too, right? Two days later, they announce a bundle that's $499 that has everything you need. So that's the real price. That's the real price. Right, exactly. So it's going to be $499. You get the two controllers, the camera, the headset and a game with a bunch of demos and stuff.

Start time: 488.12
End time: 496.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How much is the Rift? $599, right? $599. And the Vive is $800, $799. So you're still, even at $499, lower than anybody else. Exactly. And plus, again, you're going to have more games. And you're going to have more games.

Start time: 500.52
End time: 513.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Almost 40 million PlayStation 4s in the world. They're just poised to totally crush it this holiday. I'm going to get one as soon as I possibly can. You've got the interactive thing going for you as well, which we're still not sure about. What's that?

Start time: 513.30
End time: 519.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, just interactive gaming is much easier. You've got an entire community of PS4 users who are just aching and willing to play with you.

Start time: 520.24
End time: 557.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so for multiplayer. Yeah, it's going to be. Now, VR multiplayer is a challenge because, in fact, was it the Sony? Somebody was showing at GDC the goofiest ever multiplayer game where you're in with other people. You've got giant clown hands. And whoever it was said, I couldn't stop laughing, but it was awesome. I was giggling the whole way. I wish I could remember who that was and what was the...  Pretty sure it was a PlayStation. No? Did you go to GDC? No, this year, no. Anybody? No. I skipped it. I sent someone there, but... Yeah, we sent somebody. Yeah. Which is dumb. I should have gone. It looks like it was a lot of fun.

Start time: 558.00
End time: 568.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was all VR. And then you kind of balance that with Apple, what they're going to announce next week. A smaller phone that looks like the same one from two and a half years ago. Hashtag innovation.

Start time: 569.00
End time: 580.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We should talk about that because, well, we'll get to that because I do feel like that's a very good point. I mean, where is Apple's VR solution? They've hired people. Right. Supposedly have hundreds of people working on it. Yeah.

Start time: 581.26
End time: 593.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm just really excited that if we can have a $500 kind of all in version one of VR for your house, that means in version three, it'll be like $150. So this is a pretty good starting point. Very good place to start. Yeah. I mean, the first Blu-ray player was a thousand bucks.

Start time: 594.02
End time: 614.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, you know, I mean, when you've got a new technology for 500 bucks, of course, that's because you have a pretty powerful console. Most people already have. Is it going to be powerful enough? The PS4? Yeah. Well, there's an extra box. And I forget what kind of gizmos are inside that extra box that you hook and attach to. So there's a little bit of extra processing.

Start time: 615.10
End time: 636.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The old RAM packs that you use. Kind of. Yeah. It actually looks like a mini PS4 that you hook into. So that helps it out a little bit. Sony was also rumored, I don't know if they confirmed this, to be doing another PS4 that's kind of PS4.5. Yeah. But that's normal for the console lifecycle. About halfway through a console's lifecycle, they release a minor hardware.

Start time: 637.04
End time: 659.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's one reason though. Exactly. You might say that VR, while Sony will have a head start, it's still not going to come into its own right away. I mean, we're going to see more powerful platforms and consoles traditionally don't get updated very often. So they may get lapped very quickly by newer, better technology on the PC side.

Start time: 660.70
End time: 675.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are we due for a console refresh in ten soon? No, no. Nintendo. Next year. Nintendo. Are they still around? They're still a little bit. They need to do a refresh for decades. Nintendo will have something next year. They're kind of off the cycle from Sony and Microsoft.

Start time: 675.50
End time: 690.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But wasn't it ten years from the Xbox? It's almost a decade. How is that still possible? I mean, PCs improved so quickly. A decade is like... A different product. It's a consumer product. No, not anymore. Xbox is not just a Windows 10 machine with a wonky keyboard.

Start time: 693.54
End time: 715.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I guess they want to get the maximum value out of the manufacturing processes that got set up so they don't want to change the thing too much. But the technology moves on. But you're right. If you're actually a PC gamer, then you could swap your cards out a lot more quickly. But yeah, they want to get the maximum value out of their revenue chain. And then when people are really aching for it, they'll give them a new console.

Start time: 716.16
End time: 733.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I wonder if the console model itself is really that viable now that we have a lot of cross-platform development in the Windows community, for example. Why do we need to have separate OS-based devices when games work across different platforms already? It just strikes me as kind of an old-fashioned way to go about it. And if we're going to move faster with VR, maybe it doesn't make a lot of sense moving forward.

Start time: 734.06
End time: 752.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the appeals of consoles, though, is unlike a PC, there's one platform. So you develop to one capability. It's easy for consumers. You buy the disc nowadays, you download the game, and it's going to work. You don't have to download new drivers for your DirectX. You don't have to update your video card. It just works. You know it's going to work.

Start time: 753.08
End time: 759.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very plug-and-play. All you need to do is take it out of the box. The kiddies get excited, plug it in, and you're ready to go. As opposed to...

Start time: 760.00
End time: 770.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And for a developer, you know that there's 38 million PlayStation 4s all with the same capability. So that's your market. I think if you're developing with a PC, it's hard to even know what your market is.

Start time: 771.32
End time: 774.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Your market's like Steam.  Steam. Well, Steam helps, doesn't it?

Start time: 774.04
End time: 776.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A lot.  Steam makes a PC more like a console.

Start time: 777.00
End time: 779.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Very much so. It's like a console inside your PC in a lot of ways.

Start time: 780.10
End time: 795.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Y5 will be a very interesting play too as a VR thing. But in all these cases, we're talking about VR as gaming. Is that ultimately really all VR is going to be? Is it going to be augmented reality that's going to be the new UI? Or is VR going to move into that territory as well? Is VR just for gaming?

Start time: 796.34
End time: 820.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it can change everything. At least it's what people are predicting. It's the final medium because it's so malleable and changeable. You can make it whatever you want.  Do people want to be immersed in their computation?  Imagine going to a Knicks game and you don't actually have to go to the garden. You just strap on the headset and it's like your name is on the port side.  It's great.  Is there a productivity app?

Start time: 821.26
End time: 826.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's more AR. AR is for work, VR is for fun. It's been my general mental dichotomy.

Start time: 827.36
End time: 830.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the real goal here is to eliminate screens.

Start time: 831.12
End time: 840.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's like a mullet?  It's the mullet of technology. VR in the front, VR in the back.  Five points. That was good.

Start time: 842.68
End time: 855.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The problem with VR in a business perspective is you can't see your hands. It's too immersive. So you can't actually create anything. You can just absorb information.  It's about consuming.  Whereas with AR, you've actually got the ability to build into that.

Start time: 855.26
End time: 869.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What about the nausea factor? Isn't some fixed percentage of users going to get sick when they use it? I can't think of a product that sold well that sickens its users.  Cigarettes. Wait a minute. Cigarettes and tequila. I'm sorry.

Start time: 871.94
End time: 881.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I take it all back. On the entertainment front, there is a certain subset of content that exists in the world that has been at the forefront of tech innovation for online payments and video streaming.  I know where you're going.

Transcript:  We're getting censored now. Okay, cool.

Start time: 898.30
End time: 903.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My only thought was do you think that's going to be an important content for AR and VR? And if so, where will it land?

Start time: 904.14
End time: 907.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's going to be huge. And I think no one's going to talk about it.

Start time: 908.32
End time: 914.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're already talking about it. Just like the internet. Pwn is probably the number one thing people do on the internet. But no one admits that.

Start time: 915.06
End time: 922.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I haven't experienced it myself. I've seen videos of people who are doing it.  I have.  And is it as immersive? I mean, do you get any kind of...

Start time: 923.08
End time: 929.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so immersive that it's scary.  Ooh. Okay.  That, well, you're in the game. You're in it.

Start time: 930.66
End time: 932.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't try. I know people who tried that demo at CES.

Start time: 933.00
End time: 1001.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is it that you guys haven't tried it? It's so easy. You just download it and you put it on your helmet.  It's in Gear VR?  So to speak.  I don't own a nerd helmet yet.  If you don't have a Gear VR, I mean, that's easy to do. And there are a number of...  Google Cardboard has it, but I mean...  All the players are doing it. Well, the problem with Cardboard is you have to hold it with your hands.  You want your hands free.  All right.  Class.  Can we cut this part out?  I don't know how big it'll be. That's an interesting question.  And this is in general my problem with VR. It's a considerable additional cost.  There is this issue of kind of just even getting used to it.  And the potential nausea issue.  My sense is that adult content like that flourishes in an environment of easy accessibility.  The simpler it is, the better. Not the more expensive it is, but the easier it is.  That's what's been pushing all this technology is easy access.  By adding an extra device and the extra cost and the difficulty.  Besides that, you can't tell if anybody's watching you.

Transcript:  Ah, the old mother leaving the cup of tea beside you while you're wearing the headphones on thing.

Start time: 1008.12
End time: 1009.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, has that happened to you?  No, no.

Start time: 1010.00
End time: 1041.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a terrible thought. Do you still have it at home?  No, no. It's an old urban myth. The story has been repeated over the internet for two decades now.  Of the person pleasuring himself with the headphones on and his eyes shut.  And when he finishes the open desires and he finds a warm cup of tea and a plate of biscuits by the side of the bed, which his parents have dropped off.  I just thought you might need a little bit of refreshment after your...  I'll have mac and cheese and a red bull.  But before I give the wrong idea about my country, I would say I don't think anyone's going to buy a VR headset just for porn.  I don't think so at all. I think this might be the first time that it doesn't forward technology.

Start time: 1042.44
End time: 1066.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the point about reducing friction is really important in that context.  I'm just curious to see where version 3, don't laugh, don't laugh, hold it in.  Where version 3 VR is when it's very cheap and just kind of pervasive.  The smartphone revolution really had a bigger cultural impact once we all had one.  It took a couple years, like five, after the iPhone.  I wonder if also the adoption curve will be faster in VR or it will be niche long term.  What, Jason?

Transcript:  It's only going to get more weird over time.  All right, let's take a break.  When we come back, we should talk about Apple because they've got an event on Monday.  Yeah.  Two events.  They've got a big event on Tuesday, too.  And that may be a bigger show.  We've already heard a little bit about the logistics.  You may have to wait in line seven and a half hours if you're lucky enough to get a ticket to the Tuesday show.  To go to court?  Yes.  Wow.  It's even harder to go to court than it is to get into the Apple event on Monday.  We'll talk about that in just a little bit.  But first, a word from our sponsor, audible.com.  We love audible.com.  As you know, I've been a member since 2000.  I had a long commute.  And the only thing that saved me from true road rage was the fact that I was listening.  I listened to all 21 of the Peter, Patrick O'Brien, Aubrey Matron books as I was driving.  That's a lot.  That's many, many, many hours.  Audible has...  Now, the last time we checked, it says here 180,000.  The last time we checked, it was almost a quarter of a million downloadable titles.  All kinds of literature.  There's fiction.  There's nonfiction.  There's science fiction.  There's periodicals.  They just acquired, and I think this is such a great acquisition, the great courses.  So you could take college-level lectures from the best teachers in the world on subjects  like relativity and medieval history.  They've got the course that one of the great courses ever, How to Listen to and Understand  Music, just...  I loved it.  And now it's available.  It can be part of your audible subscription.  We're going to give you a chance to listen to two books free.  You'll be going to audible.com slash twit and the number two.  Audible.com slash twit two.  And you're signing up for the platinum account.  That's two books a month plus the daily digest of the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal,  all read to you so you can listen in the car while you're doing the dishes, while you're  walking the dog.  I love it in the gym.  It really puts that treadmill time to good use.  You're going to have a month, pick two books, cancel.  Anytime in that first month, you'll pay nothing.  Those books will be yours to keep.  The real idea is here's a chance to see what it's like to be an audible listener.  I love it.  You will love it too.  I don't even know where to start.  I mean, that's kind of the first challenge is you want to listen to Harry Potter?  They've got all eight books now free.  First two books anyway, free.  I'm listening because I'm going to go see Hamilton on Thursday.  I'm going to listen to...  Oh, that's the great, by the way, Jim Dale.  Perfectly normal.

As I said, I'm listening to the Ron Chernow autobiography, or not autobiography, biography  of Hamilton, which is great.  I can't wait.  I'm going to be really prepared for this Broadway musical.  I'm going to know the history before I go.  I want you to go to audible.com slash twit to get your two books right now and enjoy.  You're going to love it.  I'm telling you audible.com slash twit and the number two two books free right now.  So Apple's event is Monday.  Anybody got an invite here?  Steve is going.  I'm the only one going here.

Start time: 1342.77
End time: 1367.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I was forgotten too, I believe.  That's OK because it's first of all, it's at one infinite loop.  So it's 350 people thereabouts.  It's a small auditorium.  Small demo area too.  There usually is a demo area.  In this case, you'll probably be seeing a new smaller iPhone, a four inch iPhone.  As you point out, not exactly a cutting edge innovation.

Transcript:  Although I think it'll be interesting.  One of the questions, will it have 3D touch?  It sounds like no.  That's weird because that feels like the new UI for iPhones.

Start time: 1379.06
End time: 1421.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sounds, I mean, who knows?  I mean, that's still up in the air, but it sounds like it's basically could be a six s stuffed into a five s body.  Or a six even, maybe not even a six s.  It's a six s.  Same processor, almost the same camera.  Well, the six s has 3D touch.  Exactly.  So that might be the only exception.  Maybe they haven't cracked how to make it work on that screen or that body type.  Or it's not available.  Or it's not available, who knows?  But yeah, I mean, my take on this is it's finally the cheap iPhone people have been dying for that has all the...  We'll see how cheap.  People are guessing 450 something like that.  Yeah, which is 200 bucks cheaper than the six s.  That's cheap.  So...

End time: 1436.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 1437.00
End time: 1465.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, Apple structures it such that you have to spend 100 extra bucks from the base model.  But yeah, I mean, there are a lot of people who are still hanging on to the three and a half and four inch iPhones.  This is a way to kind of entice them saying, hey, we stuffed all this great stuff that we've added over the years that you've been missing out on in the same form factor that you used to and love.  And it's 200 bucks cheaper than the six s.  Probably be a big seller.  Sounds like a lot of people, but not most people.

Start time: 1465.52

Transcript:  Apple's in this position now and companies get to this position where they're saturated the market.  So they're there.  The Samsung did this to where they start trying all sorts of kind of weird sizes and shapes and just trying to find a little wedge into a newer market.  So that's clearly what this is.

Start time: 1481.36
End time: 1506.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And iPhone sales, if you look at them, they're they're one percent growth.  They're going to decline this quarter, almost certainly.  So this can inject a little artificial growth into it by kind of forcing these people have been hanging onto a five or even a four s for two and a half, three or more years.  They might finally feel like, OK, it's time for me to upgrade because I don't have I can get the device I'm comfortable with.  Yeah, I don't have to get this massive screen if I don't like it.

Start time: 1507.54
End time: 1517.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What was really the case is that iPhone users are not early adopters.  They're not generally the cutting edge.  And so this is probably a good market for Apple to tap into.  Right. Which market is this?

Start time: 1518.02
End time: 1520.92

Transcript:  I mean, if you go up to beyond six and a bit into phablet territory, then I remember when people mocked me for carrying a note, the first note or the second note.  And it's now it's a normal it would be a normal sized phone.  It's a five inch phone.  And we were begging Apple for what, two or three years?

Start time: 1568.16
End time: 1582.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Please make a big iPhone.  And it spurred this mega upgrade cycle.  The iPhone six record sales, they shattered records.  Yeah.  This is kind of a way to go back and court the people who didn't upgrade in that mega upgrade.

All the Android people are freaking out because there was a rumor that the next version of Android Android nut roll.  I'm going to call it that until they give it a better name.  Nugget nut roll.  Nugget.  Android nut roll.  I think that everybody thinks it's going to be Nutella, but the first screenshots didn't have an app drawer.  Oh, yeah.  And then the LG G5 doesn't have an app drawer.  They took it out.  And Android people are going freaking out.  There's no app drawer.  There's never been an app drawer.  I wish there was one.  The iPhone will never have an app drawer.  It barely.  You have to make a folder for your junk stuff and then put it on the last page so you don't have to see it.  You can't. Every app is there.

Start time: 1637.46
End time: 1650.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say they're going to solve that soon.  Tim Cook even said almost it was almost six or seven months ago.  He hinted you'll be able to delete files.  You'll be able to delete or hide them at least.  So maybe that means some sort of app drawer.  But I mean, it's just silly.

Transcript:  I mean, if you went back to the original iPhone, which I owned, and pulled up the main screen and held it looks the same.  It looks exactly the same.  There's more icons.  But things you can do a lot more stuff now.  I'm not saying the phone's haven't gotten better, but the core UI has really been very consistent.  And I think people like the comfortability.  I mean, when they took away the start bar and windows, which no one actually used, people lost it and they put it back in.  Oh, this is scary.

Transcript:  And smartphones are our home now.  Samsung a couple of years ago had an ad campaign implying basically the iPhone was your mom's phone.  Oh, the old people phone.  The old people phone.  So Samsung has a new phone.  So they're going to have to change the UI.

Start time: 1708.04
End time: 1721.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're going to have to change the UI.  It wasn't so wrong and yet it, I don't know if it worked.  In fact, that was the year the S5 tanked.  Well, that whole campaign, they were even doing that before, like around the S3 and S4.  That whole campaign just boosted Samsung so much.

Start time: 1722.00
End time: 1734.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was their best campaign ever.  That's why we still talk Samsung versus Apple.  So whether they're correct in that assessment doesn't really matter.  You have to look at the S7 though and say in every way now that they have bested Apple.  I don't see the camera.  Better than the iPhone.

Start time: 1735.00
End time: 1754.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Better than the iPhone.  So that's why they're doing that.  I don't see the camera.  Better looking phone.  The screen.  Better camera.  The flexibility of having different launchers.  I mean, one of the answers to people who say, well, where's the launchers?  Well, just use one of many different launchers.  You don't have to use the stock launcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which one would you rather have or hold?  This one, I mean.  Let me take the case off.  It's the same size screen, but it's smaller.  It's so much smaller.  It's in your pocket better.  It's nicer to hold.  This thing feels like I'm carrying an anvil around in my pocket.  And I have both and I use both.

Start time: 1778.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But when the S7 came out, I put the iPhone 6 in a drawer because I missed the flexibility of Android, really.  The Apple Watch is still a better watch than Android Wear.  There's no question about that.  Yeah, it's not exactly much though.

Start time: 1791.04
End time: 1800.71

But they happen to make the best one.  Right. Best selling one.  Best selling one at least.  And right now that's the only trick that matters.  And VR is cool and exciting. It's fun to see all these companies come out with it.  But is it a mainstream product yet? No. It's for hardcore gamers right now.  Right.  Does it mean Apple is totally ignoring the trend? Of course not.  They have hundreds of people researching this.

A hundred engineers just means mild interest for them.  They've got so much money. And so absolutely they've hired some of the best VR people actually.  But it doesn't mean they're going to do it.

Mac sales, small. iPad sales, in decline. Apple Watch sales, very modest.  And if iPhone goes flat, then what's the next upward lever?  And if you say Apple TV, I will laugh at you.  It's definitely not TV. And it's not cars either. Can they sell a $70,000 car?

It's a very credible phone, 250 bucks. That's really cheap.  Unlocked, and now they've never sold these in the US, but there's considerable thought that they may.  This may be the one where they introduce it in the US.

Transcript:  We've been waiting for it, to be honest. Wouldn't that be interesting?  I've tried some of their phones out. I'm really impressed with them.  They've got some great software on them.  Whether or not, they're not going to beat Apple immediately in anything like a premium market,  because they are cheap.  But if it's a choice between spending half the price on a phone, which is 95% as good,  I don't know that iOS and Mac OS is going to have enough to hold them there.  And you're right, we have been saying this for years, but it's growing, slowly but surely.

At that price, I have to think that this is the biggest market in the US.  There's the premium market, which we all participate in, so we're a little bit in a bubble.  But most people don't want to spend $800 for this phone. That's more than their computer costs.

We're pretty sure an iPad Pro 10-inch version.  Again, this is very much like nibbling around at the corners trying to find a new market for something that is not growing.  Maybe it's not going to change the equation.  The iPad still hasn't convinced me, especially the Pro.

No one knows that because no one has typed on it enough to know that the letters fade.  I think we've learned now that iPads hold onto an iPad for 3, 4, 5 years.  Then you give it to the kids and they watch Netflix or YouTube on it.  This is not going to inject more excitement to the iPad.

Transcript:  Apple moved this event a week ahead. I've got to think because they wanted to be the day before the court.  Which is very cheeky, by the way. Very cheeky indeed.  They're cheeky all around.  Don't you think that Tim Cook doing an open letter on the Apple webpage saying there needs to be discussion about this? That's cheeky as hell.  Tim Cook to stop carrying.  In the face of a federal court order to say we're not going to go.  Hang on. The FBI was cheeky as hell by the same standards.

Transcript:  Everybody's cheeky.  The San Bernardino case was picked specifically because it's a terrorism case.  The suspect's dead anyway.  It's very clear what they're really looking for is precedent.  What they're looking for is case law.  They set Apple up a beauty and Apple turned around and fought them.  I say good luck to them.

End time: 2305.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm glad Tim Cook did that.  It turned out to be the right strategy because it's not just us but I think in general the American populace is aware of this issue.  Is aware of privacy and encryption.  It may be a little bit of theater.  I expect that Tim Cook will begin the event with a little 10 minute making the case.  It'll be his closing argument in effect making the case which he's preparing as we speak for why we don't want the FBI to have access to these phones.  But I think the whole thing is theater from both sides.  Oh yeah.  Because we really live in a surveillance society.

Start time: 2307.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah well I mean this is what the FBI was talking to a lot of guys at RSA about this and the feeling was pretty much universal.  In that up until we started getting full encryption on iPhones and the same with Android phones and Snowden started leaking about what was going on.  This was all from Snowden.  You can blame Snowden for all of this right?  I mean up until then if you said oh the government is collecting dossiers on everyone's internet habits you would have been laughed out the room as a tinfoil hat wearing nutjob.  Then when the stuff came out it was just like oh well maybe they are but I'm sure it's all very safe.  Apple and Google responded perfectly well to what is a customer demand for secure communications.  And the FBI panicked when they realized all this lovely stuff which means we can just sit in an office and scan stuff rather than going out and doing police work.

Transcript:  I would, you know Neil Stevenson says relying on encryption is like a guy living in a house with a picket fence that consists of a single picket a mile high.  That encryption yes does work but there are so many ways that you can never eliminate the human factor.  Encryption doesn't work on a rooted computer.  It doesn't work in general really and law enforcement has many means which they know very well to get around all of this.  How do they get Silk Road? Bitcoin is encrypted well informants.

Transcript:  Susan Crawford wrote a really interesting piece.  She is an expert in this kind of law.  I am trying to remember her title. Let me find it for you.  It's on medium. She is a professor at Harvard Law.  Oh she might know about law then.  Backchannel's tech policy columnist.  Backchannel is Stephen Levy's medium channel for tech writing.  In 2009 she served as Barack Obama's special assistant for science, technology and innovation policy.  The law is clear she writes.  The FBI cannot make Apple rewrite its OS because Kalia specifically forbids it.  She says every once in a while President Obama removes his law professor and chief hat and puts on his I get terrifying briefings every day hat.  She said yeah he said what he said but he must know as a constitutional lawyer by training that when Kalia the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act was passed by Congress 20 years ago it made it very clear the government cannot, may not, it says specifically tell manufacturers how to design or configure a phone or software used by that phone including security software used by that phone.

Start time: 2512.74
End time: 2546.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did bring it up in their last court filing because I did a story about it.  When the Kalia hearings were first done in 1994 then they had big congressional committee committee and they got the then director of the FBI who said yes of course we're not going to force companies to decrypt.  We'll just take the signals and we'll work it out ourselves thanks very much.  Just let us wiretap that's all we ask.  Now director Comey is turning around and saying actually no you know we haven't actually we haven't probably asked the NSA where they can uncap the chips or anything like that but if you could just do it for us that would be great.  Using a law that was written in 1789.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This with the All Ritz Act and that's what she says this because they can't use Kalia they're going to the All Ritz Act but she says this was part of the negotiation this was the tit for tat.  Congress said okay you're going to help them with wiretapping but in exchange section 1002 the feds gave up authority to quote require any specific design of equipment facilities services features or system configurations from any phone manufacturer.  That's that's directly yeah I mean there's no question and I'm surprised Sherry Pym the judge in this federal case didn't know this but and by now she must know this.  She can't this is going to be the surprise on Tuesday she can't rule this because it's direct contravention of what Congress clearly mandated.  I am amazed that Apple just didn't give her this sentence and say your honor case closed.

Start time: 2595.00
End time: 2630.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah I mean also Apple is an information services provider rather than telecommunications provider so the full clear laws don't even act on the company.  Except phone manufacturer they are.  Then they're mentioned.  They are.  So that's the one place Kalia does apply that.  Which explains why they went for the all writs act approach.  This has just been I can't help feeling a botched job on behalf of the FBI and also a slightly botched job on behalf of Apple because they came out saying we're not going to put a back door on encryption.  And when you look at that specific case that's not what the FBI were asking for they were asking for a way around brute forcing.  But it's clear that they've decided to go all in on this.

Start time: 2631.08
End time: 2636.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well Apple's argument is the brute force is only made possible by writing out a rule.  Exactly.

Start time: 2638.09

Start time: 2641.01
End time: 2654.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody knows that by now.  Oh sorry.  But you know it's a mistake to really focus on that because the all writs act very simply says a judge can do whatever the judge needs to do to get the job done.

Start time: 2654.30
End time: 2670.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a two sentence act saying that when the government issues a writ you've got to obey it unless certain circumstances come in.  Right.  And the FBI has decided to use this to say.  It's flimsy justification.  Yeah the FBI has decided to use this saying well we're telling you to do it so do it.  Right.  And it's why that holds water is beyond me.

Start time: 2671.00
End time: 2695.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they've been this has been around for a long time for exactly this purpose.  So what's changed is that this is going to be a little more theater on Tuesday because before it was just the two lawyers arguing and the judge ruling.  The Department of Justice has just has asked for witnesses and testimony.  Now I'm no legal eagle but I was told that that means they think they have a weak case.

Start time: 2696.91
End time: 2698.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That means Apple thinks the FBI has a weak case.

Start time: 2699.29
End time: 2702.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it was the DOJ that asked for the witnesses right.  Right.

Start time: 2703.18
End time: 2716.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And but the witnesses are calling they're not calling Tim Cook they're calling Apple's cryptographer.  Well yeah some good people.  Yeah.  So it's going to be it's going to be a really wonky hearing I have a feeling and get really deep into the nitty gritty of what.

Start time: 2716.66
End time: 2742.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how it works over here but by the same corollary if they're if they're asking for witnesses from Apple Apple can then presumably ask for witnesses from the DOJ because the one argument they've been saying is we don't know how to do this.  It's up to you to work out how to do it so that we can decrypt messages when we want it.  So if they can't find a single government representative who can give a reasonable scheme where there will be witnesses on both sides.  Yeah.  So this is they could have just completely.

Start time: 2743.44
End time: 2771.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This was revealed in a conference call Apple held on Friday that on Wednesday the judge the Apple lawyers and the lawyers for the Department of Justice had a conference call and the FBI requested an evidentiary hearing this is something that's within their rights to ask for.  Apple's providing two employees one is Eric Neuenschwander who I'm sure I'm mispronouncing that Neuenschwander is Apple's chief product security and privacy manager.  In other words their encryption guru.

Start time: 2771.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Lisa Ali who's their global law enforcement manager Apple has to have a global law enforcement manager to manage law enforcement requests.  So that's a full time job the FBI will also have two witnesses.  And so the hearings begin at one o'clock Pacific time but the judge has warned they'll be handing out tickets as a small courtroom there'll be an overflow room.  Courtroom I think is 35 people half of whom will be Apple and DOJ employees and then there's a 350 seat overflow theater.  And you'll have to get tickets tickets will be issued at seven in the morning on Tuesday.  And well you need to be there early because they can only get they say 10 people an hour through the security or is it 30 people 30 30 people at slow.  I've been through courtroom security they really go through it.  And so they say an estimated seven and a half hours to get everybody into the courtroom so it's going to be tight.  So bring lunch if you're going.  They will they also said that there's no food.  There's a snack machine bring lunch.  It's going to be very interesting.

And by the way a lot more interesting than following the political situation.  There's a lot of what's going on in Syria.  There's a lot of stuff that's not as much fun.  I do think this is just massive theater and that both sides really know that law enforcement gets plenty of information from all sorts of sources.  Yeah.  They are not going dark.  There was a Harvard.  Harvard-Burkman.  Prism is still going.  Prism is going.  Echelon is going.  They know a lot about what's going on.  Furthermore Apple cooperates with the government quite routinely.  They cooperated on this.  Yeah exactly.  I don't blame them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Math works.  Yes.  You can't break math.  So that we have encryption or we don't.  You can't just have this awkward middle ground because someone else told you could.  Magic ponies don't exist.  Maybe we can look a little deeper.

Start time: 2996.00
End time: 3123.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK.  I think this I think and I don't know where what we're going to find if we dig deeper.  But we've got to assume that all parties in this are intelligent.  Not the congressman.  But but the law enforcement.  The law enforcement's intelligent.  Apple's intelligent.  The president is for sure intelligent.  I suspect there is a deeper longer game being played here and I can't quite figure out what it is.  But I do feel like.  It's a that was a dumb thing for the president to say.  And I think he knows better than to do that unless there's more than meets the eye here.  What is the long game?  What would the government really like?  I think here's one thing.  And by the way, I'm going to credit Bruce Sterling.  You've got to listen to his keynote at the end.  He's done it for 30 years now at the end of South by Southwest.  And he is brilliant and he is acerbic and he is totally cynical.  But he says forget it.  The four horsemen of the five horsemen of the Internet Microsoft Apple Amazon Facebook and Google have are have created a commercial surveillance society.  They know everything.  Law enforcement has created a law enforcement surveillance society.  They know everything.  There's no dark.  What they would like you to think is there's some dark.  But in fact, there isn't.  And so a lot of this he believes is hand waving from both parties to say pay no attention to the real matter at hand, which is we know everything you're doing.  And it's only getting better as you continue to put Internet of Things devices in your house.  I asked my radio audience today, look around you.  How many microphones and cameras are around you right now?  Look here.  Every one of our computers has a camera.  Every one of our phones has a camera.  They all have microphones, your echo, your television set.  And we're adding more and more all the time, all of which is accessible by bad guys, good guys and commercial interests.  I think what they want us to do is just forget about that.  Look, no, we can make your phone private.  They want to have that conversation because they don't want us to think beyond it.

You can't have them saying you don't have the right to secure communications because once you've given up that battle, that's it.  Everything else is just.

And then you're going to win.  And you're going to feel good because you have encryption.  Meanwhile, yeah, everybody who wants to know what you're up to, which includes commercial interests and government interests, knows exactly what you're up to.  OK, we will have to pay no attention.

I think it's most of the case.  But I think if we can win this particular battle, we can move the weight of gravity more towards our direction and the direction of privacy.

Transcript:  I mean, it's.  Look, Tom Wheeler surprised all of us.  He did.  Because the guy was.  We thought he was.  Chief lobbyist for the cable industry, chief lobbyist for the telco industry.  In the hall of fame for both industries.  He then almost when he published that initial net neutrality thing, he just like, oh, yeah, here we go.  Here we go.  Bend over. It's coming.  And then he was like, actually, no.  And then the industry got a little bit of hope on this.  Yeah.  But with this, and with the encryption thing, they're going to carry on pushing and pushing and pushing.  Doesn't it puzzle you that the guy.  That sooner or later somebody breaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wheeler, you've been a faithful and loyal servant all these years.  And we'd like to ask one more favor of you.  Would you pretend to be on the side of net neutrality and privacy and all that is good and holy?  Because we'd very much like people to think that that's that that the battle is raging here while we put rooms,  secret rooms in the AT&T offices and we put special devices in every ISP to record all your activities for the next two years.  While we secretly do all of this stuff and everybody's saying, Tom Wheeler,  he's fighting for the good.  And he gets, by the way, good for Tom Wheeler.  He's now in the Wireless Hall of Fame, the Cable Hall of Fame and the People's Hall of Fame.  And he'll probably retire with a nice payout.  But really is what he's doing and what the FCC is doing changing this in a way.

End time: 3472.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't want to conflate what the FCC does and what the NSA does.  I mean, those are two very, very different things.  Tom Wheeler's argument about why he made the choices he did with neutrality was that his customer is now the American public.  So he's going to operate as if that works for a customer, whatever that might be.  Well, that sounds very commercial, but I think he's actually a very moral person because he took a withering fire from his former allies and employers for those.  And the best part was in Congress got involved and held a number of ridiculous hearings and got whacked around by Tom Wheeler, which I really enjoyed watching.  Yes.  But on the on the NSA side, it's a separate thing.  I mean, I'm not mad at the NSA because of Tom Wheeler or vice versa.  They're very, very different entities and responsibilities.

You bought that.  I did buy that.  We're not firing people.  We're refocusing.  Look at the history of Sonos.  They were so far ahead.  They made a big bet 12 or 13 years ago.  And won.  And won that streaming audio was going to be a thing and we probably thought they were idiots.  We're still listening to CDs back then.

And they realize we need to double down, refocus, move people around where we need to move them  and get into the space because it's the next big thing.  And I bet next year we start seeing Sonos's with Alexa built in or something very similar.  Okay.

But the idea of just having this hard way in my house, constantly listening to conversations  around the house, and I've got a bad sense of humor in some respects.  It'll tell you bad jokes, by the way.  Yeah?  Yeah.  Echo, tell me a joke.  It'll tell you a joke.  Here's a bad joke.  You can get the next...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You could say, Echo, tell me an Obama joke.  Tell me a Clinton joke.  They have all these...  What's interesting is it's very easy to write additional skills for the Alexa, the Amazon,  so they're exploding.  And that's one of the problems actually they're having is there's so many skills, it's hard  to keep track of all the things it can do.

Transcript:  So what's funny is it's not as good as...  Be honest, it's not as good as Google or Siri, but it's your house listening.  Interesting.  It's sort of a cultural difference that I think is a very big difference.  You're not talking into something or manipulating something.  You're just standing there doing what you're doing, and you say to your house, how much  gas is in the car?  And it tells you.

They screwed up with the Fire Phone.  It was a total flop.  They missed smartphones.  So they're like, we need to find a platform that we can just dominate.

Would you like me to reorder that?  And I say, yes.  And it says, what's your code?  Because you have to give a PIN code.  And you give it the code, and it's ordered, and it arrives in two days.

Start time: 4032.41
End time: 4042.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's the thing.  You have to live there.  Because it only orders it once until it arrives, and then it resets.  So as soon as it arrives, you can order again.  That's why he would go every couple of days, push the button.

Transcript:  Actually, Leo, on your point about ADD,  it's kind of an interesting point for all major tech companies  because they have to do everything.  The market expects them to have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what is the issue that the market expects insane growth?

Start time: 4269.28
End time: 4296.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Insane growth and the platform effects are very important.  So if you miss a platform, you may miss the next four or five platforms.  Good point.  So voice recognition is not that useful in Siri right now,  but if Apple doesn't learn that tech,  it can't put it into everything else it does down the road.  So you end up with these really broad companies  that can only exist with hundreds of billions of dollars of cash and capital.  And so it's almost like the creation of new mass conglomerates inside of tech.  That's what Google is now.  Alphabet.  With Alphabet.  Exactly.  It's a pretty good encapsulation of this trend that I call the platform wars.

Transcript:  Have you been following the argument, you cover finance,  that really the problem is a structural issue,  due primarily to index funds?  Keep going.  So an index fund, as many of us know, is the smartest way to invest, right?  Because it's very low fee,  because it's just matching the performance of the stock market.  The stock market tends to perform well over long terms.  So it's an inexpensive way to invest money, but it's a passive way.  A guy named Professor at Harvard Law, who I happen to know,  Einar Laha wrote this article,  he says it's a passive way to invest that rewards big companies,  because these tend to be large cap stocks,  and encourages a certain kind of performance from large companies  that isn't necessarily in the best social economic interest.

Start time: 4348.08
End time: 4358.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you're saying that economic patience by investors using index funds to purchase equities  allows companies to make socially dubious choices  because they're not under activist investor pressure?  Exactly.  Okay, well, I mean, maybe.

Transcript:  That's been going on for a while, I think.  I want to see more data on that.  Well, he says it's getting worse.  I mean, it started with the, I mean, you had the corporators in the 60s and 70s  who divorced the idea of, you know,  who came up with the idea that the sole purpose for a company is to reward shareholders  rather than to serve any other kind of, to function in there.  And yeah, maybe that's moving along faster,  but there's always been an element of that in capitalism, surely.  Yeah.  Profit over...  Allow me.  Capitalism...  Who is an antitrust expert.  Free markets are great for going for short-term profits.  They're lousy at long-term planning.  Yeah.

Start time: 4394.12
End time: 4400.94

Transcript:  You should read the articles by James Ledbetter and The New Yorker.  Is passive investment actively hurting the economy?  And I think it's an interesting case to be made.  But here's why I bring it up with the tech angle,  which is related to this issue.  And I just am saying maybe it's a larger issue.  What the market expects from tech companies is a larger issue.  And I almost feel like, wouldn't it be great if we rewarded companies  who said, look, we're only going to be around for 20 years.  We're going to pick a technology.  We're going to express it the best we can.  We're going to ride its cycle, and then we'll go away.  And for that reason, we don't have to be ADD.  We don't have to be constantly seeking the next platform.  We can just serve the platform.  The reason I mention this is kind of my plan with Twitter.  I'm not trying to build a media company.  I'm not casting around for the next big thing.  I'm merely riding this particular wave into the ground.  And I think that a lot of companies doing that might be a more efficient way  to run an economy.

Transcript:  Maybe, but it's not the way it's worked out so far.  I mean, Standard Oil was big for a reason,  and it wasn't because they wanted to do six oil wells in one state.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But didn't you can say, well, we're going to beat the business cycle,  but you never do, do you?  Standard Oil didn't.  Xerox didn't.  Apple beat one.  Polaroid didn't.  Apple, but debatably.  It worked out in the end.  It almost is two different companies, really.  But OK, they went through one cycle they got within 100 days of going out of business,  and then they got a new cycle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  OK, well, think about Google.  They're essentially a search company with experiments attached to it.  Apple is an iPhone company with experiments attached to it.  Microsoft has maybe two things, Office and Windows, with other stuff attached to it.  I don't think using cash flows from functional products to build out new things  and try new stuff is bad.  And here's kind of one example of why.  So Microsoft Research does what's called basic research,  which means they do stuff in a non-commercial setting just to discover stuff.  And that's a huge money pit, probably.  But they pay for it with essentially software sales from other parts of the company.  And cool stuff comes out of it.  So when they wanted to build Kinect, they're like, can we track bones in motion?  And the team was like, oh, yeah, we did that five years ago.  Here it is.  And then Kinect came out of it.  And so that's cool.  Same with Herb and Rolf's encryption as well.

Start time: 4528.02
End time: 4559.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a purely search project, which is doing very well.  But the one thing I would say is that those kind of things are very good,  but at the same time, for every company you've got like Microsoft and Google doing that,  you've got tech companies who are spending the bulk of their profits  buying back their own shares to keep shareholders happy,  to pay off these passive investors.  IBM.  IBM, classic case.  And that doesn't produce anything.  It produces returns for shareholders, and that's about it.  If a company is willing to invest in research, fair play to them.  Right.

Transcript:  Take as an example the airline industry.  He brings this up.  80% of all stocks in the airline industry are owned by a handful of investors.  He argues institutional investors with an emphasis on index funds  are playing an outside role in the sector.  And that's why we have higher air prices for travelers  because of this kind of pressure, this ownership concentration,  this pressure to return results for the stakeholders in the short term, not in the long term.  And look, we're using, all of us using computers that are based on an operating system  created by AT&T's Bell Labs, their Blue Sky Research Division.  Nice.  Right?  And if it weren't for Unix, I think there's a lot that we're enjoying today that wouldn't exist.  So I agree Blue Sky R&D is not a bad thing, but is it best done by these big companies?  And look at Google, where they don't give robotics time to mature,  and they have to move quickly.  That didn't work. What's next? What's next? What's next?  That isn't really a very long term point of view.  And I don't think societally that's necessarily the best thing for R&D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I think that's a really interesting point,  but I think that the obvious but kind of lame answer is maybe it's not possible any other way.  And maybe there isn't a second option.  I mean, if you could design these kind of single rocket ship companies that you outlined and did one thing,  maybe that just wouldn't work out because companies tend to not do that.  They're never going to act that way.  Yeah, because you're acting in a suicidal run. It's like a game studio.  Game studio will do Age of Empires and then die.  Right.

First up, you and I will be covering the big event tomorrow where we might see announcements about some small products,  including a $600 9-inch iPad Pro and a new 4-inch phone.  But even bigger Apple news might come on Tuesday, March 22nd when Apple gets its day in court.  The hearing before magistrate Judge Sherry Pym of the Federal District Court for the Central District of California  is scheduled for 1 p.m. Pacific time on Tuesday.  Jason Howell and I will be sure to bring you all the details on that on Tech News today.  On the lighter end of Tech News, Silicon Valley Comic Con is going on right now,  and Padre and Patrick De La Honti are there.  Look for some news next week about what came out of Steve Wozniak's inaugural conference.  Next week is also Y Combinator Demo Day when a bunch of eager start-ups try to show off why they're worthy of your money,  judging by the recent funding apocalypse that seems to be going on in Silicon Valley these days  and the fact that there were no start-up darlings coming out of South by Southwest Interactive last week.  We are really curious how this will play out.  Look for this news and a whole lot more with Jason Howell and myself on Tech News today, every day at 4 p.m. Pacific.  Back to you, Leo.

Transcript:  Our show brought to you today by Gazelle.  Now, anytime there's a new iPhone or an iPad ready to come out,  I urge you to go right now to gazelle.com and get a quote on your old one,  even if you don't know if you're going to get the new phone or the new tablet,  because I can tell you one thing that doesn't take a soothsayer to figure out.  Your device, any device, is not getting more valuable.  Every day it goes down in value. So get the quote now.  Here's the beauty part. It's all in your benefit,  because Gazelle's locked in now for 30 days on that price.  You're not. You don't have to.  But you at least you have the price, and they guarantee they will pay you  at least that much for your old iPad, iPhone, tablets from Samsung,  Microsoft, BlackBerry's, lots of different devices.  It's also, believe it or not, a good time to buy a used device.  See, Gazelle is going to get a flood of older phones,  year-old iPhones, year-old iPads, and sell them, the very best of them, to you.  So they have a variety of iPhones, including the 6s, the 6s Plus, iPads,  Samsung Galaxy phones to choose from.  In every case, the devices are fully inspected, a 30-point inspection,  guaranteeing not only they're fully functional, but they're cosmetically good.  There's no big scratches or anything.  There is, of course, a 30-day return policy.  You don't extend your carrier contract, but they do work in all the major carriers.  Go to gazelle.com, see what your old devices work, and then check out worth,  and then check out the selection of certified pre-owned devices today.  If you're buying, they offer financing on all devices from a firm.  You can do this in checkout.  So you just provide some basic information.  Instant approval is available.  You can pay in 3, 6, or 12 months through a bank transfer, a check, a debit card.  Just select financing with a firm at checkout.  And they also now offer an aftermarket 12-month warranty for cell phones and iPads  powered by Assurance Solutions.  That covers water damage, cracked screens, hardware defects.  This is really nice.  You don't have to, but you can.  Help is available too, 24-7.  In case you want to process a claim and return your device, they'll help you do that.  Gazelle.com, G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.  Give new life to used electronics.  Trade them in for cash.  Buy certified pre-owned.  Pay it forward.  It's the best way to recycle.  Gazelle.com.  You saw in that little promo that one of the things we talked about this week,  and we finally got confirmation, is that Microsoft is kind of hard to believe  upgrading people who have Windows 7 or Windows 8.1 automatically to Windows 10  without their permission.  Dun, dun, dun.  Mary Jo Foley called Microsoft and said, is this a bug?  I thought it was a bug.  An accident?  Oops.  Yeah, at first I thought, oh, it's not happening.  People are clicking OK.  Then I heard from enough people who said, no, no, no, it happened.  So Mary Jo called Microsoft.  They said, no, it's not a bug.  We told you that we were going to do that.  They did?  What?  Yeah.  I don't remember that either.  No, they told, no, you missed the meeting.  They didn't get the memo.  They said we are moving the Windows 10 upgrade into recommended updates,  in the Windows update.

Start time: 5111.08
End time: 5117.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's why in Windows update you had to go from doing automatic updates  to manually picked updates.  Well, you didn't have to.

Start time: 5118.35
End time: 5156.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And most people didn't.  Yeah, and this is why.  And the default setting is to install critical updates and recommended updates.  So a great many, now the fix is, by the way, to immediately go to Windows update.  Continue to take critical updates.  I think you have to do that.  But you might want to turn off automatic recommended updates.  What will happen is if you have recommended updates, and most of them,  you know, it says update in the middle of the night, 3 a.m.,  you'll wake up and you will be faced with a EULA saying,  here's the license agreement for Windows 10.  And if you say, OK, you have Windows 10, because it's already been installed.  You only see the EULA after the install.  If you decline.  Then it has to uninstall Windows 10.  So you get penalized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you're talking the base operating system of a computer,  the very UI that you have to deal with in day in and out to do everything.  Now yeah, Picasa and Google, that wasn't a great move.  But if you're going to change from Windows 7 to Windows 10,  which is a big change for people who aren't really that good with computers,  you can't force that on people, they've got to choose it.  It breaks some sort of trust you had with the software and the user.  Unfortunately, with that kind of user, they're not going to go,  right, well I'm going to go and install and download Debian from now on.  They don't have the technical skills to do it,  and they don't have the inclination to do it.  So maybe Microsoft thinks they can get away with it that way,  but it's just a really bad way to destroy trust.  But it's hundreds of millions of devices.

We had a wonderful time, but...  This was, I think, 2009. When I entered the country,  you could still post to Facebook and Twitter.  And by the time I left two weeks later, you couldn't.  And it was... They had the Weiger uprising in the West.  And I guess they decided... I remember we were watching in the hotel.  We were watching international CNN.

Transcript:  A little disappointing that NPR has decided that you can't...  If you're an NPR host, you can't promote NPR podcasts or the NPR One app on the show.  To keep the radio audience in place?  I don't know.  Yes, it's a strategy tax, right?  Are they doing a Kodak?  They're afraid that people will stop listening to the radio.  Part of the NPR is very political because it's not just the national organization.  There's every NPR station.  The stations make their money on not the podcasts, but on the radio shows.

Transcript:  Yeah.  So, it's stations like KQED are saying, well, don't promote the podcast.  Who's going to listen to the radio?  But this is something we went through in radio years ago.  And any smart radio station immediately developed podcasts and internet streams and did everything  they could to go digital before terrestrial just disappeared entirely.  Yeah.  Sad.  That's a strategy tax where the existing business keeps the new business, the innovative business,  from growing to protect it.

So, they're finally catching up.  A lot of the TV networks are starting to catch up to this notion that, wow, digital is a real thing.  We just, BI just lost its executive editor to CNBC, and he's going to head up digital for CNBC.  So, the traditional media companies are slowly realizing this is a thing.  No, JR.  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, sorry.

Start time: 6415.72
End time: 6450.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's where they're putting this money that worries me, because a lot of traditional media organizations  are getting a digital media operation, but they're not putting the same effort into the news side of it.  It's all about sponsored content and native advertising, which is a nice way of saying, let's screw over our readers.  So, I mean, I'm not sure I trust some of these larger media companies to actually do a good job by the readers.  I think it's more going to be, yeah, here's something which looks like an article we've written,  and if you look very closely at the bottom, it says sponsored by XYZ Company.

Gizmodo, Jalopnik.  Jezebel.  Jezebel, Deadspin.  Deadspin.  I love Deadspin and Gizmodo.  But they also have Gawker, and for a little while they had Valleywag, Gossip Rags.

Transcript:  Back when Natasha and Sam Biddle was a very active publication, now it's the occasional pot shot from Biddle that somebody doesn't like.  It did actually break some stories in his day.

Start time: 6612.16
End time: 6624.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Gawker didn't hesitate to buy it and run it.  Yeah.  Now Hulk Hogan is a public figure.  And traditionally if you're a public figure, is it anything?  What is the law?

Start time: 6625.00
End time: 6630.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has to be true.  That's the number one thing.  Well, it's a tape.  It's obviously not a lie.  So the number one barrier you have to cross is it true?

Start time: 6631.02
End time: 6646.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So libel means that you have to say something untrue with intent.  Intent, correct.  So it's not libel.  I mean there was intent, but intent to get some hits.  But it was not untrue.  Does anything go?  In this case?

Start time: 6658.12
End time: 6660.60

Start time: 6665.00
End time: 6672.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll see.  But it depends on your definition of a public figure.  Are you a public figure?  Kind of goes a lot.  Sam Biddle thinks so.  I think you are.  Yeah, no, I think I am.

Start time: 6674.02
End time: 6675.89

Start time: 6677.00
End time: 6679.25

Start time: 6680.00

Transcript:  That's a lawsuit they should have to write.

Start time: 6682.00
End time: 6706.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see, I think this comes down to what...  They outed him.  You can be a public figure, and that gives you maybe slightly less rights to privacy,  but absolutely no rights to hypocrisy.  Now if Hulk Hogan had been going out and campaigning for traditional marriage and for a divorcee  to be stoned in the streets, this would be wide open.  But the guy's never made a big thing about his sex life, so why should the fact he's  knocking off his best friend's wife...  No, he didn't make a big fact about it.  He did?

Start time: 6707.02
End time: 6717.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he was bragging about it, Hulk Hogan.  But he didn't circulate the video.  Well, he didn't circulate the video, but he talked about the fact that the video was in  public.  So Gawker wanted this lawsuit to happen in New York, where they're headquartered.

Start time: 6720.26
End time: 6729.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 6753.62
End time: 6774.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Worse, in order to appeal this, they have to file a bond.  A 50, right?  Which they don't have either.  So they want to appeal.  And you know what?  They would win on appeal, because the federal court would say, no, come on, it's the First  Amendment.  You don't have any protection.  And as reprehensible as it is, that's the way it is in this country.

End time: 6805.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't understand why their lawyers allowed some of these people on the stand.  When they got the guy on the stand, they were just like, so would you consider publishing  a video, a sex video of a child?  It's like, well, it depends how old they are.  So pick a figure, it's like four.  You know, it's like, you don't make jokes like that in front of a jury.  You real judge.  You really just don't do it.  Or on Slack, or in private.

Transcript:  The argument I've heard is that Nick comes from Britain where there's a different kind  of cultural rule about this kind of stuff.  Libel laws are different, of course.  I can't just speak for my people.

Start time: 6818.04
End time: 6855.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you speak for your people?  The libel laws are massively different.  Libel is a really stupid case in English case law where if you accuse somebody of libel,  they have to prove that they didn't libel you in a way that caused you harm.  So the burden of proof.  Oh, well, there's definite harm here.  Yeah.  So the burden of proof is always switched around from the accuser to the accused.  At the same time, we've always taken the view that if you're a public figure, you have a more limited amount of privacy,  particularly if you use your public image to push particular products and services.

Start time: 6855.02
End time: 6861.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been told that Denton kind of comes from this tattler tradition of anything goes...

Start time: 6862.12
End time: 6870.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a long tradition, certainly the British tabloid media, of publish and be damned.  And yeah, we've got lawyers for sorting out the payment schedule afterwards.

Start time: 6870.04
End time: 6881.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So Denton coming to the United States maybe brought that tradition to the US.  Could be.  I mean, they've done quite well.  You know, Valleywag I'm sure did well and Gawker's done well.

Start time: 6882.06
End time: 6893.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because they were prepared to write stories that other people's weren't.  And sometimes with some merit, which is great.  Which is good, but occasionally this turns around and bites you on the ass.  Is this a First Amendment case?

Start time: 6894.40
End time: 6899.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't the federal court just going to overturn this?  I think they'll win in the appeal.

Start time: 6900.00

Start time: 6902.64
End time: 6907.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 6908.12
End time: 6927.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also, you don't want the courts to decide what can be printed and what can't be printed.  You definitely don't want that.  No.  So as reprehensible as Gawker is, as much as I'm rooting for them to die of...  Of course, you're holding your nose and supporting it.  You have to hold your nose and support it.  Kind of sad.

Start time: 6927.02
End time: 6947.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is, it is.  But you know, the difficult arguments when it comes to privacy and free speech are the ones that make the best cases.  Right.  You know, it's like everyone I'm sure with half a brain cell, which is the Westboro Baptist Church, disappeared into a smoking oil on the ground.  But they have the right to say and protest what they say.  It's one of those things.  And for me to defend Gawker is just...

Start time: 6948.04
End time: 6958.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The irony is stunning.  So that's saying a lot right here where you stand.  Yeah, but you have to because I don't want to be the next one that a court comes along and says, oh, by the way, you can't say anything about Microsoft.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Thank heavens.  One difference I have noticed between the press over here and the press over back in the UK is when a company tries that in the UK, all journalists on other publications will circle the wagons and go after them with all guns blazing.  Whereas over here, there doesn't seem to be that sense of brotherhood, if you like.

Start time: 6999.12
End time: 7018.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is a health. It's because Gawker is Gawker and they are such a polarizing publication.  And I've seen journalists who are very smart and very liberal and well-respected who want Gawker to lose this.  Hell with them.  And I think it kind of is where Leo's coming from.  They're just trash. They burn so many bridges.  How can you feel bad for them? You want to see them die.

Start time: 7019.02
End time: 7048.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

I mean, there's some responsibility on the part of the journalists to do a good thing.  Isn't there?  Being tasteless shouldn't be illegal.  It shouldn't be illegal.

He's very efficient.  He knows where the company is going, but he doesn't have a lot of charisma.  I mean, I don't know if you remember when he took over the Onion Runner headline.  Steve Jobs launched his new iPhone, came on stage, showed his own.  This is a new phone.  Isn't it great?  He's he's gotten a little more polished.  He has.  He has.  But at the end of the day, he's not a showman in the way that Steve Jobs.  No, no.
