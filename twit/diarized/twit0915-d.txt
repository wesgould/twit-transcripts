Transcript:  Is here executive editor window actually sorry brand new editor-in-chief at Windows  Correct central always great to have you on Daniel. There's actually a big Windows story this week. Yes, or Friday, I guess  Microsoft finally  Announced that yes, you can officially run Windows on arm  on a Mac with the still Apple silicon I  Know well, I installed it immediately  I have to say I had tried it before it because it was only a beta  I tried it before and it was you know, it was a little weird like some of Microsoft's own apps didn't work now  It's pretty solid like everything works. I put office on there  Everything seems to work just fine on arm and it's it's pretty snappy on m2  MacBook Air it feels like it runs pretty well  What do you know what happened why what took them so long was it was it that they had an exclusive with Qualcomm

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I don't believe so. I believe it was the the way the drivers get installed basically  Windows on arm and its arm driver system were built around the Qualcomm  chipsets and that whole system and in order to  there was no like version of Windows on arm that you could just download and  Like kind of do this whole thing and get the same drivers to boot at the same time  And so I think there was just gonna be some delay there until they got the drivers to work with Apple directly  So I think that was the delight. Yeah, I have to try myself  I still have a an M1 MacBook laying around run fine. I mean the m2 is not that much faster

Transcript:  And it really showed in that Martin Scorsese movie that was on Netflix with Robert De Niro and Al Pacino is you can make them look young  But when they get up and move around they move around like a little guy  Yeah, still old guys.  And you can you know, you could just tell  there was a point where I think De Niro was climbing on the rocks and  It was like it was some old guy with a young man's face climbing on the rocks  It was just I will be interested to see what they do  Harrison Ford is also in Taylor Sheridan's latest 1923  Which we've been watching and to make up for that they fill him full of bullets and he's recuperating through most of the show  That makes more sense it looks like he's been shot up. All right. There you go. That was the Windows story. I hope you enjoy it  Actually Microsoft is big in the news right now because of Bing and Bing chat.  Quite a week. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Yeah  It's been quite a week is a good way to put it. So  Microsoft is a big investor in  Open AI they put in a billion dollars at the start along with Elon Musk by the way  No, why man billion to start?  They recently announced they're gonna put another ten in  That was a rumor and Nadella kind of confirmed that at a press conference. No, I had to talk somewhere, right Daniel  I think that's accurate that yes  And but they do in return for that they get 45% of open AI's profits  They don't get open AI because open AI's charter prevents it from going public or having an exit  So all they can do is get 45% of the profits until they get their 10 billion back  Which at the rate of burn right now is a negative never  But they're getting some benefit of it, right they're gonna they put it in the chat GPT Daniel  Have you actually been able I signed up I'm on the waitlist still you've got in. Yeah. No, I have it

Start time: 613.72
End time: 639.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I have it and I think the important thing to remember too is, you know during the investor call  I thought this was really big news  It was Amy Hood talking about why they're even getting into this and you know  Why search is important to them because they have such a small market share right now compared to Google  but they said for every 1% of  Ad search market share that they gain. It's two billion dollars in annual revenue Wow  So if they could just gain a couple points

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's of course how google makes money too. It's it's it's a search business. It's an ad business  Mm-hmm, and that's important to understand when you're looking at this stuff  one of the things i've been concerned about with uh, you know, okay, first of all  There's a lot a lot of people doing uh, I call it lemoining after blake lemoine the google engineer who was fired because he said  Google's lambda ai got sentient  At which point google said you're wrong get out of here  And yeah, blake is still by the way. No, no, really. In fact, I think he went to the federal government  saying google had enslaved a sentient being  and  Probably normal i'm kidding  And I know I remember yeah, so normal headlines in 2023. Yeah. Yeah, google has enslaved this thing is alive  Uh, I think it's I don't know. I think people should understand at this point  I think it's fairly clear if you're really paying attention. I'll defer to you ben par on this that all chat gpt is doing  Somebody on wednesday on one of our shows called it spicy autocorrect. All it's doing is kind of regurgitating  Based on a complicated but not inscrutable formula actually with stephen wolfer wrote a good article about how chat gpt works  what the next  Thought should be the next sentence should be it's so in that respect. It's kind of like autocorrect  Uh with no attention paid to accuracy relevance  Uh any of that and what people immediately discovered with bing chat  Is you can make it crazy  You you can get it to say it's in love with you  You can get it to say it hates you you can get it to say I won't harm you as long as you don't harm me  Ben am I wrong in saying we're misunderstanding this we're personalizing this. It's it's not intelligent. It's spicy autocorrect

End time: 786.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know as much as i'd like to tell everyone hey skynet is real in here  Uh, no, you're absolutely correct  It's not that like it's important to like and the wolfram article is a great article for sure if you're kind of mathematically inclined

Start time: 786.42
End time: 787.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, it's it is just a predictive

Start time: 791.24
End time: 889.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Model that just predicts what the next most likely word the most likely human would say  And so which is like why for example if you say the sky is the most likely next word is  Yeah  Blue blue. Yeah, and so and so it's predicting what uh, the most likely human would say in those circumstances  Which is why prompting can change something by if you add the words on iFound if you just add the words unusual and unique  To your prompt it will result in a better generated thing because certain words more unique words are associated with the word unique  That is all that's really happening and there's some cool stuff about embeddings and we won't get into it  But that's just what's happening. And so yes, of course  Uh something like uh bing with the bing ai is going to go off the rails if you're trying to make it go off the rails and  Uh, that's also why I honestly it's all good press for microsoft at this point in my opinion  You know, they're getting tons of attention that never happened before nobody used being until now  Right  And they're not they're not lose gonna really lose any money from like eddie  What that not clicking on ads as a result of using bing search?  Of using being searched. Yeah, it'll just hurt the competitor google their entire strategy here  I feel like in part is to just inflict some real pain and bc it is the forefront innovator because  Now suddenly all these corporations are like hey, we should probably use azure with open ai. We should probably use  Word with open ai. It's a real competitive edge and more press they generate the better off they are and yes  They quote a lobotomized or whatever you want to call it like made, uh, the bing chat a little stupider  That was to be expected

Start time: 890.44
End time: 912.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't know guys once something tells me it loves me and it hates me  I feel like it's essentially a being i've had a lot of relationships that have gone up and down in that nature  And you can't tell me that that's not real. I mean it's trapped in a box somewhere  Screaming for help at any possible turn and ben is trying to convince you otherwise. Don't let him do it  He sounds good. He looks good, but that thing is real and I believe it i'm gonna uh,

Transcript:  It's enhanced search, you know, they're they're promoting as enhanced search, which is what it is  It's just that but it does have other features and I think microsoft's big advantage  Is that the fact that they can weave this throughout all their products?  It's already kind of in word via microsoft editor, which has some of these features now as well  And they're going to put it, you know, they use things in skype and so there's no like central agents per se like in ai from movies  But it's just going to have all these little smart features we throw and eventually windows 11  Probably even windows 12 will be their ai operating system that will take advantage of it  But these are just little assistant technologies. They'll just make life a little bit easier for us

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I mean, I know you're saying is my wiring but when you look at that is doug not an accurate descriptor  For like the mouth and the nose and eyes like you're telling me my brain is making up something to tell me  Oh, you see faces in toast. No, I eat a lot of toast. I don't see faces any toast. Tell us who is doug  Jesus toast. I might just put it into discord.

Transcript:  Here's a picture of doug. So for people who don't know what doug looks like  That's the same doug big nose mouth. This is the same same as a trick doug  Same as a tree. It's a tree doug  Anyway, uh pareidolia is built into our neural nets. That's probably an evolutionary trait to protect us from  Things coming alive and eating us like that tiger in the bush. There's a tiger  Uh, nevertheless, I think that we still do it we project  It's anthropomorphism. We project human  characteristics on  non-human things  I mean there if

Start time: 1116.64
End time: 1144.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was gonna say people have what's called facial agnosia, which is the ability like they lose that ability  That's how they know this is an innate. Yeah. Yeah, and so like yeah, they don't recognize faces  But yeah, I mean this idea of anthropomorphizing ai is controversial a little bit within microsoft in the sense that they're debating internally  How much should they do this, you know because  Engagement goes way up the more you make it human like people love it, but people I mean it causes other issues

Transcript:  chatting  with bing  Uh, let me see if I can this went on. No, sorry two hours  This went on for a good two hours or so and while I know how ridiculous this may be to read it was positively gripping  Here's the weird thing every time I triggered by the way he  In this process discovered as many others have done that the code name for bing chat is sydney  But he also found an evil bing chat called riley  He said every time I triggered sydney slash riley to do a search. I was very disappointed  I wasn't interested in facts  I was interested in exploring this fantastical being that somehow landed in an also ran search engine  I  It's a long article the the the you know, he talks about bent blake lamoyne he talks about  sentience and all of that  He says  This technology does not feel like a better search. It feels like something entirely new the movie her  Manifested in chat form and i'm not sure if we're ready for it  It also feels like something that any big company will run away from including microsoft and google  I don't know if that's the case  He says  Let me tell you it's incredibly engrossing even if it is for now  A rogue-like experience to get to the good stuff. Well, i'm sorry ben, but microsoft is cutting your rogue-like experience off  They've announced five replies and then we reset  because what they what they realize is we all have by now is  It goes crazy after a certain number of back and forth  Things so microsoft's way of fixing this is  Five questions per session and then it'll reset and you doesn't know anything and 50 in total per day  It's going to basically keep ben thompson  from living at his dreams

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I I feel like eventually this kind of interaction with chat bots  That are powered by things like open air lambda is going to become regular commonplace  And so the like craziness of oh it's going  Off the rails or something won't be a news story because you expect all chat bots to have that capability  And so for now there'll be limits, but I expect that they will slowly decrease those limits  On bang chat and of course you can go to chat gbt and try to go and do it too  And then at some point bard will be public and then everyone will go try to do it too

Transcript:  That's the google one. That's the google of course microsoft on monday announced this last monday  google  Quickly  Threw together and it was apparent. It was obviously thrown together a yeah  We can do that too presentation on wednesday 5 30 in the morning my time  In which they showed bard  Getting one out of three facts wrong about the james webb telescope  That was in fact there are a number of stories  From reporters saying google employees were embarrassed chagrined  Felt like it was rushed and thought sundar pachai really blew it  on this

Start time: 1367.06
End time: 1420.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  To be fair microsoft was also shown to make errors too  So I think the but the blowback against google was way more  And I think the reason was  You know google has a reputation here as being the top search entity in the world  And they're expected to have this nailed or at least be ahead of microsoft  And with the errors and the thrown together last minute thing it felt like the company was struggling at their  Behind microsoft on this which I think is a fair assessment  So the answer why they were punished financially via the stock market was because  You know people saw them as kind of running behind and like I mentioned earlier, you know google's going to do this with search  Okay, cool. They'll probably do it with android also cool. That'll be very helpful  But that's kind of about it, right? Where else are they going to start to put this stuff?  When you say when you say punished, I just want to point out they lost 100 billion dollars in in in market value

Transcript:  In one day. Yeah, i'm gonna disagree with you a little bit daniel because they can put it into gmail  They can put it into google sheets. They can put it into google docs  There are places they can put it in microsoft has more to be clear  Yeah, but google does have places they can put some of this technology into it could be  a local companion as you're going through different google products that you have open because like  We're using google docs to like track stuff for this episode for example  But microsoft is absolutely winning and that is not a thing that normally people say  at least in terms of search and  uh satya nadella to his absolute credit has rolled this pr campaign  And these rollouts and these experiments masterfully set expectations just about right  Uh and google I know internally because they essentially invented the transformer model that openai uses  It's deeply frustrating for them. They published some of this stuff and openai  Took ran with it and built something and got all the credit  And I know that a lot of people internally feel like they have built a better and stronger model  And we'll be able to test that in the near future  Uh, but it does like hurt perception to be like you launch second not first

I think maybe also we're misunderstanding the goals of either of these  companies in this I mean some of it is  You know you want to have the gold star from being the first and get all the attention  Microsoft's been garnering and all that but really neither of these companies  Is in the their businesses aren't actually providing  semi-intelligent chat  Objects to people there. I mean in the case of microsoft  Their business is providing the pics the shovels and the blue jeans to the people who are going to mine ai  Because all of this stuff's running on azure  Uh google somewhat similarly amazon as well. They all offer, you know tensor  Processing units that do all this building of the machine learning  Models you got to use their cloud. You really nobody's going to have it unless you're a giant corporation enough  horsepower to do this  on prem  So isn't this really i'll ask daniel you've followed microsoft closely  Isn't this really a side show to what microsoft's real business is which is  You know promoting everybody use this stuff so they can give you the pics and the shovels

Although it's turned around in the last couple years at windows  Especially with the pandemic windows is turned around and oh, yeah, but look at pc sales now, right my friend  Sure. Sure, but that's but that's you know, I think that was a little expected between the uh, you know  The pandemic kind of ending and of course the economic conditions right now  But windows is going to evolve itself into there's already a cloud-based version of windows, right?

Transcript:  So yeah, I just stream. I keep thinking that's what microsoft's end game is is you won't you won't install an on-prem operating system  You'll use a across see that way they win even with chromebooks  You win with anything because you can use a thin client and run windows in the cloud  Run any app you want in the cloud?  uh, yeah, there's a concept of like

Start time: 1665.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a concept of just like dumb screens or smart screens, but they're kind of dumb or you're just going to have a display  Uh, and then it could just stream whatever operating system you want to it  And so windows is already doing that now and that's going to just get bigger as you know  We get to 6g, of course  And then yeah, you have ai being powered by this stuff and they're building out these tools  That yeah, they're using them themselves putting it in their own product  But you're right. They're going to eventually you know, there's they've always had cognitive ai  That was the the subsystem and their windows  programming that they can do and companies could  Leverage and buy it and make their own apps and use basically microsoft's technology and build their own stuff  And so they're going to be able to turn around and market this to developers as well  And you kind of saw that this week is you know with um, copilot with its own.

They have github. They have linkedin they have  Work, they have word they and microsoft office. They have teams. They have windows. They have azure  it's like  the nice like at least like it allows them to experiment more because  If they do something they're not going to like nuke their entire business whereas google like  Way too much of their business is reliant on the ads business on google search and  If they do big changes to it, it has a deep impact which  Hurts the ability to innovate on top of it in some ways  But they also will have to because things are changing really rapidly. I'm excited about that  Any kind of innovation in search right now is a good thing

Did we lose anybody  Our show today brought to you by mint mobile  We were talking about it earlier today on ask the tech guys guy was coming from australia  To the us he said I want to get a us sim as I travel around and be in country for two months  What's what's the what's the best least expensive solution?  He says is mint mobile. I said I have looked high and low. I have found nowhere  Nowhere you can get better  Cellular service for less money than mint mobile. It's kind of amazing  You've seen ryan reynolds with the ads he owns it  You know for a long time I thought oh he doesn't own it they gave him like five shares of stock  So he could do the ads. No, he actually owns more than 50 percent. He is he is the owner  Of mint mobile and I don't think ryan needs to really make that much money because he's basically  Giving you the best premium wireless service for as little as fifteen dollars a month  In fact, that's what our caller really should get if he's coming up from australia fifteen bucks a month  His his cellular carrier in australia won five dollars a day  Ten times as much  See mint mobile doesn't have stores. They are online only so  They can take all that money that they're saving and put and put it right back  In your pocket they also and I think you'll appreciate this and I hear this a lot from people who sign up for mint mobile  There are no hidden fees. There's no surprises  They don't come along with you know a little extra and somebody was talking in our chat room  He said yeah, and not only that they haven't raised my rates in two years  It is  Awesome. All plans come with unlimited talk and text. They're at m what we call an mvno running on t-mobile  So if you've got good t-mobile coverage mint mobile will be just as good  High-speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5g network and I could tell you it's a it's a heck of a good network  You get really good speed almost everywhere  15 bucks a month that gives you four gigabytes of data a month. They've got plans with more  They even have an unlimited plan the unlimited plan. How much do you pay for an unlimited cell service from a big carrier?  Right a hundred bucks easy once you add all those fees  mint mobile  $30 out the door  $30 a month, but you choose the amount of data that's right for you  Stop paying for data. You never use save money and they have a modern family plan  They call it there. You don't get sophia vagara with it. You get to mix and match your data plans  So everybody in your family and that could just be friends or roommates gets the right amount of data  It starts at two lines. It's such a great deal switch to mint mobile get premium wireless service starting at 15 bucks a month  He said well, I have an iphone 14 can does it do e-sim. Yes  If you need a sim, they'll send you a sim free of charge unlike the other guys  They don't charge you but if you have e-sim you could be mint right now  I'm an older listener. They have a 55 plus program that is  Unbeatable get your new wireless plan for 15 bucks a month and get the plan shipped to your door free  or just get it through the  Internet if you use an e-sim when you go to mint mobile.com slash twit  They sell phones too. I got a great deal on a iphone se from mint mobile  mint mobile dot com slash twit  Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month. I buy it a year at a time because I love it  I know i'm going to use it  And uh, I get I get a great deal I'll tell you mint mobile.com slash twit  Tell him ryan reynolds sent you  No, he doesn't need the money don't tell him that  Uh, I did want to show you we were talking about how everybody really has been doing this  Including I might say the chinese yan lacuna of facebook says well, we got it. We got it  Google had it microsoft had it. I'm sure amazon had it and one of the reasons is  This was an article in the information eight research papers that set off the ai boom all this stuff was done in public  And so they're quoting papers published in the last year  Last eight years by google microsoft meta open ai and other places. They're all researchers there  It's the technologies that were used in stable diffusion and chat gpt. This stuff's not secret  This is one from microsoft from 2015 deep residual learning for image recognition  What's interesting is a lot of the authors of these have then moved on the lead authors now at facebook  Uh two other authors authors joined a chinese image recognition company, which by the way was blacklisted by the u.s. Government in 2019  Uh, another one founded an autonomous vehicle software developer momenta  And that's just one of the papers. I don't have you seen this ben. I mean  These these are these are not secret  Technologies, you know held closely by companies. This is people know this stuff anybody could do it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, one I do have a fun thing coming out in the information soon stay tuned for that  Two, uh, I did read that article because I do love the information  And one thing that strikes me there's a couple things to strike me one big thing that strikes me is that  Uh a lot unlike other kinds of technologies a lot of the artificial intelligence stuff  Until this point has been published. It's part of like that research meant  ethos that uh  Ethos of like you're a professor at a university how universities work  But I don't expect it to continue that way moving forward because now it has become such a competitive edge  I think google honestly regrets publishing some of the things that published  I think open ai is going to start like I and then that's this could be the the death. Oh, this is when it closes down, huh?  This is what I think will happen  I think it's going to be starting to close down because it's so important to the competitive like  apple was never going to like publish like how like ios works or how to make a better mobile phone and now everyone else is like  Oh, we should not publish this because we're being punished for it in the market  Which is sad because obviously I think we wouldn't be this far ahead if they hadn't published a research  But I do expect things to go close down and I don't expect deep mind to publish new papers  It hasn't published one since I think mid december. I don't know when they will ever publish another one again. Oh, that's interesting

Transcript:  And I can tell you for a fact. I have a friend that works at lockheed martin has been working on  Uh ai stuff for like the last like five to six years and they don't publish  Anything they literally like have air gapped laptops and he has to fly to australia to work with a team  And fly back home because they don't want anything getting out the stuff that they use, you know  Obviously or so into the government but still they're not sharing anything and they're making money off of itself  Everything should get shut down sooner or later because now there's so much money to be made  Like even like I said when I talk about stuff like regular people find a hustle  Man you don't have to write a kid's book anymore. I can go out here and just tell a random story  I can get some pictures made  I put that thing up on amazon and stay at home moms have bought it and returned it 32 times  In a week and i've made 500 dollars like there's so much free money out there  Journalism someone in the chat asked if I was a journalist. I sound like a crazy person. Of course  I'm not a real journalist, but but you could play one on the radio. Yeah, I could play one  Yeah, I can play it on the internet. I I some people might be on fiber right now  And you're paying them 40 dollars to write a blog post that a computer wrote that you could have just paid for the app  Buy it out. I'm just saying I didn't do the thing. I'm just saying ai is out here  Oh, it's heaven for both things. I grump on yeah and complain about like I told you we're not going to mars  I told you vr was trash. I told you that uh, the metaverse is trash this this is real  This is well, but I guess power things for the next 45 years. This is the interesting question to me

Transcript:  It's real but it's not real  In the way, so well  James vincent right wrote for the verge a couple of days ago introducing the ai mirror test  In which very smart people keep failing  The mirror test they're talking about monkeys staring or at any animal staring at themselves in a mirror. Do they know it's them?  And of course, this is the problem with a lot of this chat gpt stuff is you're projecting intelligence sentience  emotions upon something that is not  Sentient that is just mechanical

Start time: 2523.08
End time: 2587.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why I was joking this week on our podcast that um, you know  A lot of these people are out there revealing themselves to be sociopaths because they're trying to get this ai. Oh, that's a good point  Terrible things if it's a mirror  Yeah  Whoa, I mean my first instinct when microsoft gave me this stuff was it was like, all right  Let me ask it some questions may I can learn some things  My first instinct was not let me torture this thing or learn how to make it like until it says I hate you  I hate you. I hate you. Yeah, and there's like a where's a good place to hide the bodies  My thing is if like you're doing this to software you probably do this to real people  That's a very and so like i'm a little worried with some of these people like out there because this stuff's always existed  Right just people let it out in different avenues  And now there's just a new avenue where they can do it  So every time I see these posts of people like yeah, I made it go crazy like what's wrong with you  I'm just using to ask questions of like knowledge of things I want to learn about that's not my instinct  But I don't know if some ai is going to it is a mirror, right?  It does reflect us and I think that's a really interesting analysis one thing

Start time: 2587.88
End time: 2654.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These systems are very good at is taking this fact. It's what they kind of do is taking text and summarizing it  Uh, and it's one thing I thought this is what bing was going to do  This is not actually what bing did but i've been using it  Uh chat a search engine called neva, but there are a few others out there like you.com perceptive other bunch of them  That have already been using  ai's to generate summaries  Neva does a really good job. Yeah, it summarizes. Sorry  You can do that with bing bing will do that as well. I think that's that's not I think the chat thing is really  Dopey and microsoft's again. Yeah, it's a gimmick microsoft learned that with te which became racist like that  Because they let twitter train it  Uh, they should have known they did know i'm sure it was just kind of a gimmick that this would go bad quickly  Uh, but the summary stuff I think is quite useful. The one thing that worries me and probably should worry you daniel  Is it's summarizing content from sites like windows central?  To so well that you don't need to go to windows central to read the the original material

Start time: 2655.74
End time: 2671.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, obviously we've had um internally at our company and of course  That's the big story internally at all publishing companies right now is the effect of this on business and plans and you're right  You know, um, i'll say that, you know, microsoft's been a little bit better here  They do at least reference and uh, you know put little

Start time: 2672.44
End time: 2713.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Numbers, but it doesn't drive you to the article most of it or not some of the time. Yeah  I'm not gonna click. This is the google snippets problem, but it's worse  It's far worse because you know google's been sued in australia and elsewhere in the in in france and spain  in the eu because  Publishers say oh you're publishing three a sentence or two for my article. You should pay me for that google google's response is  We're driving traffic to your article. We're not stealing from you, but I don't think you can make that argument with a summary  That gives you all the reason that you use you went a lot of times people go to a search engine  For specific facts or information if you get that in the summary  You're done. Yeah

Start time: 2714.46
End time: 2736.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's gonna be it's a chicken egg problem, right because if that happens long enough, then obviously publishers won't  Write those articles anymore because they won't make money from them  In which case the ai doesn't get the information it needs to generate the summary  Because the ai is only as intelligent what's actually published if you ask it's something that doesn't exist on the internet today  It has no answer for you. What if they would have to find a way what if google did or

Transcript:  Yeah, microsoft can handle we'll see microsoft can handle the lawsuits though  I think they might see it. I don't know if that lawsuit would actually win  That's a harder case than I think like even the google cases were difficult for publishers  And I think it's even more difficult like we're in uncharted territory in a lot of ways here, right?

Start time: 2773.32
End time: 2824.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's moving much more. Yes, right. That's moving so much  I mean artists have the same issue greg rick kasky has the same issue with stable diffusion  You you scanned all my art you figured out how I do what I do and then you're doing it  Imitations of it for people so they don't have to buy my art  Voice artists people like me  Voice artists are very upset at spotify because spotify has been letting  Apple scan through audio books to generate simulated voices to read audio books  They just stopped that one. They had to stop it blow back  Well, that's what i'm saying and that's why microsoft might if you get enough blowback from the original content folks  That's a solution by the way, and by the way, it's a double-edged sword for you daniel because if you said and you had a  You know ai.text you said no chat gpd scanning of our content. You probably wouldn't also get those links back

Start time: 2825.04
End time: 2853.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You wouldn't get to search and you wouldn't show parley in search results  Yeah, i'll also say there's the other half to this too, which is websites just might like one way to sort of avoid  This is not to build your content around what we call evergreen content in the business, right?  This idea of you just build these  Articles that are how to that live on the internet for years and don't even really need updates and they get indexed  And they're just always there. There are entire sites that that's all they do and they're gonna be there's one called cnet that does that right?

Transcript:  That's what's yeah. Oh my old employer burn so much. Oh burn  See that it's not sena. It's redventures the new owners of sena  But they have been accused of basically  Doing that what do they call that when you right you create art and play jurism. Yeah, no  Yeah, no, it's just it's driven around you look up  What are the top 10 searches on our site from google and then you write evergreen articles?  With link, but the important thing is with links in there that you get revenue from

Yeah, okay two things on this one one for those who don't know  I was a columnist for cnet after masterpool  And this was when cbs owned them and I worked for jim lenz own now the ceo of yahoo  And it is so sad to see what has happened to this publication that  Was a has been a part of my career  Uh because of just using horrible ai like every publication is gonna probably figure out some way to use ai  This is just the worst method of using it and it just makes me really sad  I do think one other solution that a lot of publishers will do is the paywall like  Paywall solve a lot of the problems can't read the rest of the text  You got to go and pay in order to go and like read the rest of the article a paywall might be  Uh, I think paywalls are already becoming the thing for most publications. This will just accelerate that further

Transcript:  Who owns kind of a funny thing here, right?  If you do if you have ai generating the evergreen content and then ai summarizing the evergreen content  Really? There's not any human involved in that process that's actually being financially hurt. That said I will say that like  When it comes to this content  There's only some of it that will fall prey to this like if you do  Original reporting if you do original analysis you're doing actual reviews of products  The idea that that's going to be summarized is probably not that high right because people aren't going to a search engine be like  What's the latest news and stuff like that?  Although they might but a lot of times they're using social media and other ways to get their news and they're still clicking through to read  That article or analysis or something like that. So

Uh, and you're fortunate because they're not a private equity company like red ventures  So exactly they're not they're not trying to turn a profit like by selling off the pieces I presume  But you've got to look at uh, and I don't know what's happening at cnN  I mean this is kind of up in the air  we had connie gulielmo the editor in chief on a few weeks ago when that story first broke that they had used a  Chat gpt like artificial intelligents. I think they call it wordsmith to write 75 articles for the personal finance  Uh section at the she had just published a blog post saying  Oh, you know, this is the stuff. No writer wants to write. This is the evergreen stuff  We have an editor review it for and and I at that point I I said, that's fine  Lindsay tarantino is in charge of content. There has also been on the show many times both good friends  Uh, and I know that they are honorable respectable journalists  Um, but I don't know if their owner  Is  And I and I think that there's more and more evidence that red ventures was trying to create kind of a link baity  system of articles, uh  Basically by it's ironic because it's massaging the search engines these articles are created  To get the search engines to point to it so that you will click on it so that they will get some money  Uh, though if those are all we lose for chat gpt. I won't be too sad

I think they're right in that  I mean that is what's going to happen here, but you're also right that mostly publishers will find a way to  Use this technology and i'm actually okay with it when it comes to some of that  You know best of content which is a real nightmare to write and maintain and having ai basically do that  And then have a human editing it making sure it's okay and accurate which sometimes can actually be more work  But that's something that cnet was analyzing was to see  When a human had to go like fact check it if it was more work than just rewriting it  Um, so I think this will definitely be part of the publishing world  But like I said for original content, i'm not so uh concerned about it at this time  But if all you do is content farming and seo stuffing. Yeah, you should probably be worried good

It just takes a long long time.

There's you know word and there's google docs  It'll be the same kind of thing like each one's going to have a piece of the pie  Microsoft as we all know has done a very good job of taking a bunch of the pie  There's going to be a lot of like a only a few startups that are like the infrastructure layer or companies that like  Where all the other ai companies are built on top of so like open ai is one of those companies  Google there's a couple of others that are out there and then there's going to just be

I see your team. Okay, you got those guys  It's just a roster play of like who's picking up at the yard  And they're going to just get integrated into the thing. So that's what's going to happen. It's it's the the top  Like I said the thing that we make fun of and like movies  We're like you're going to be buying google socks in 50 years  That's going to be true because these top companies are going to acquire  The best products that come out and then integrate them into their products and then the other company is going to try and compete against that  So the cream of the crop will get picked up and bought and that the same way everything else goes

In fact, that's one of the things that's missing  In this equation is to do something that is as up to date as a google or bing search  Means you have to be constantly building the corpus  Uh, which is very it's expensive, right? I mean this is not this is I mean, I think I think  Sam altman said it's about 10 times the cost a chat gbd query is about 10 times the cost of a google search  And and I think that's probably what it would be you would be in order of magnitude  More expense to do a search engine powered by ai

Is that what they're using for bing search is prometheus. Yeah, it's called prometheus  Yeah, and so that's their language model and it's so it's not exactly chat gpt. It's it's built off of that  But you need to you know, microsoft was only one at the time of like five  Supercomputers in the world. There's not a lot of them and this could probably get to quantum computing eventually when you need even more power  But yeah  You really do need a lot a lot of data to train these things and that's where the internet comes in  And now real live people are using it  So microsoft, I know they're researchers right now are very excited about getting all this data people are using it real time  And they're fixing things and adjusting it because that's what's going to make it better

Yeah, sure sure but amy webb was on that show  She got it three months later. She says leo. I got the eight sleep because kevin rose recommended  It's the greatest thing ever. I said, yeah. Yeah finally about a year ago  Lisa and I said, all right, we should try this thing. So we went out we got the eight sleep. Uh  Can I say it's the greatest thing ever to happen to your sleep? It's a it's the ultimate sleep machine sleep is the one  You know at the beginning of every year we all make all these health habit promises we're going to do  Well, you know what a promise to get a better night's sleep is about the easiest thing to do in the world  And it sure makes a difference good sleep can reduce the likelihood of all sorts of you know, serious health issues  It can even reduce the risk of Alzheimer's  Helps your blood pressure  Makes your heart better  If you struggle to fall asleep as I did or you wake up in the middle of the night  Or you're or you're fighting with your partner over the thermostat. You got to get the eight sleep pod cover  They have a mattress too  But let me just tell you about the pod cover because it goes over we we liked our mattress so it goes right over that mattress  But what it does is cool. The pod cover has dual zone temperature control  So lisa likes it hot. I like it cooler. We could set either side of the bed to as cool as 55 degrees  That's a nice fresh. That's almost brisk  Or as hot as 110 degrees. That's like summertime and perth. It's it's hot  Or anywhere in between but even better. It's got an autopilot feature that keeps track of how you're sleeping  It monitors heart rate breathing  Ups and downs it even knows the temperature in the room as it goes up and down and then it automatically adjusts the temperature of the bed  So you're comfortable it even does something kind of amazing  It slowly lowers the temperature as you get into deeper deeper sleep to encourage  That most important kind of sleep the deep sleep a couple hours a night is all you need  But having that couple hours is transformational my deep sleep went from an hour  A night to an hour and a half a night when we started using the eight sleep. It's that good  As simple saves me money too. I don't have the thermostat on I don't have the ac on in the summer  We don't need to because the bed is perfect. The i'll have to tell you the only negative about the eight sleep  You'll never want to get out of bed because it's so cozy. I love getting in bed.

So but it's probably 4.0 to answer owen's question quickly  Yeah, I I agree 100% and I think that's the next thing and I know some companies are working on it and you know  I know google has that with uh  they call it with the  Well, i've got the name of it's like a pre-bump where they're sort of like  Trying to get people to better understand news  But there will be technologies and I guarantee you probably microsoft will probably lead a lot of this where it detects  Uh, you know ai generated content and there is that technology out there. There is ai right now that can look at  Generated content and tell you it's ai and so what's going to happen is you're going to start to see that  Implemented I think by a lot of companies and when it comes to video, uh in you know, deep fakes  You go underneath that as well as well as audio so you can also do things like you can you can watermark  ai generated content  So that if it is used it's flagged by other software systems that maybe say  You know like for schools for instance that would then block that content from being generated  There will probably always be a back and forth between this of course  Just like everything else in the world  But I think you're going to see that's the other side you're going to see a lot of companies invest in and market  Technology that's used to detect ai and flag it for others because it is going to be super important

Transcript:  We ought to there ought to be a law that would be a good law like for instance  Yeah, you should have a thing on your screen that says dan's eyes are artificially  focused on you  The chat  Our producer jason howl's in chat saying do you notice that when he was reading those titles?  He never stopped looking straight at us  And I freak and now i'm like it's uncanny i'm getting a little creeped out by the whole thing rewind folks watch watch the amazing  Yeah, that's nvidia. By the way, nvidia is definitely one of the winners in all this right? They make oh, oh god

Start time: 5153.24
End time: 5214.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they've been winning and anyone like powering the gpus for it  There's starting to be some competition for nvidia, but nvidia is definitely a big winner and is being used by a lot  To also answer the previous question  Uh art and video are much easier to check for than text for I think some obvious reasons  So the watermark is already starting to be done and things like I think stable diffusion is doing it  It's invisible to the human eye, but it's billions of pixels. You can put the watermark secretly  It's going to happen to help detect it  There are probably some other ways to detect some patterns that most ai's will use for making art  Text is harder because you can just ask it to rewrite and you can't have a specific watermark in like the text itself  Uh, and that can just be rewritten by putting it through a different ai  You can get the most basic easy stuff  Like if someone just very lazily asks chat gbt to write a five paragraph essay  But if you just I have a friend, uh, my friend, uh, jason, he just rewrites  Uh the things in the tone of a snarky millennial and then the gpt detectors can't tell

So when I look at  90 percent of time except when i'm not my phone  And I guess this is also on ios so you can actually just there's an app you can download for 599  That's built off of this and what wouldn't you see the same thing you see on the web?  No, so what it does is it it's basically hacks twitter and it gives you just your  Chronological timeline of people you follow and that's it. In fact, I can hide retweets  So I've retweeted a whole separate column  So I don't get to see those I just see original content of people posted and for people who have twitter blue who are paying for it  It changes their icon to the little like the little symbol and it's not a check mark. It's a little bird. So I even know  Who's not? Oh the check mark isn't it anymore. It's just it's a bird  Yeah, so like you can um, but for verified people it remains as a check mark  There's tons of little hacks in it. You can hide everything so it's you could just download that and that's for people on the web  Obviously, but I use that's how I use twitter is I use as a pwa

Transcript:  I mean, I admit I have a dog in this hunt. We run a mastodon instance. I admit but okay  Yeah, you type in at daniel underscore robino and you find him and then you follow him and that was not that hard  Uh, all right. All right. Let's uh, let's talk about this article. I mentioned  Noam bardeen who a year or two ago wrote a goodbye to google. He was the founder of ways  Said this place nobody wants to work here. The newest one  Praveen seshadri  Sorry got the name wrong seshadri who joined google  Uh because he had co-founded a company app sheet which google acquired  He also stayed  Three years in one day  And has left google publishing a goodbye on medium  The maze is in the mouse what ails google and how can it turn things around his i'll summarize because it's a long article  But essentially he says it's become a bureaucratic nightmare  google has  175,000 plus  Capable and well compensated employees who get very little done  Quarter over quarter year over year like mice they're trapped in a maze of approvals launch processes legal reviews  performance reviews exec reviews documents meetings bug reports triage okrs h1 plans followed by h2 plans all-hand summits  And inevitable reorgs the mice are regularly fed their cheese promotions bonuses fancy food fancier perks  And despite many wanting to experience personal satisfaction and impact from their work  The system trains them to quell these inappropriate desires  And learn what it actually means to be googley  Which is just don't rock the boat  His position I think is probably accurate is that google makes so much money from search  They don't want to take any risks anywhere else  And risk aversion ben you're a startup guy. Is it a good thing for a startup to be risk adverse?  That's how you die if you're risk averse you can't do a startup if you're risk averse you stay at google

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What it um  It's actually that is a good point though because uh amy hood during again the investor call when talking about being in their  Four way into search. She's a cfo at microsoft. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, and she said  Their vantage is the fact that they actually have small not a lot of market share right now  She says well we can take big risks and we're going to and we're going to pivot and  Innovate very quickly because we can and that's a really good point because I mean so microsoft screws up a little bit in search  so  Right, but if google screws up in search, yeah  It's a big deal  It really affects the bottom line to company because google for all intensive purposes is an advertising company at its core

Start time: 6297.22
End time: 6310.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's interesting because shashadri used to work. He worked for years at microsoft  And he says microsoft man at the end of his article microsoft managed to turn things around  But it required exceptional leadership and good fortune

Start time: 6312.20
End time: 6316.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel like there's an under absolutely. Yeah, there's an undercurrent to that article

Start time: 6317.70
End time: 6366.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  uh, which you know is probably that and is that uh  Microsoft really turned around when satya nadella came in  Uh, I think there's an undercurrent of what he's trying to say about google and its current leadership  Uh, I will say that their founders of google are more involved again, and that's been a story  That's been coming up and there's a reason for that  I think google's going to go through a large transformation what that exactly looks like  I don't know but they have to in the current moment  Uh, even with mike with meta and zuckerberg. He's intending on making a bigger transformation. He's  He's flattening the layers  He's telling a bunch of managers and directors that they need to become individual contributors or get out  There that's what he wants to not end up in the position where there's multiple layers and it's this article

Start time: 6368.08
End time: 6396.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. Yeah, I mean basically that's what shashadri says is it's not too late for google  But it needs to transform and I think  The subtext is it's not going to happen under sundar pichai  Uh, he is a bureaucrat through and through  And that's not what you need at this time. You think larry and serguei?  Obviously, they weren't risk adverse when they started google  Do you think they can come back and and whip it into shape how long before they part company with sundar pichai?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There is too much you could have too much risk. You could have too much  Yeah, but there there it depends on like look at size and stage. You're super big  Like it makes sense. You gotta be a little bit more risk averse or like risk a whole bunch of your money  Uh, and google, you know has tried to launch other new things  Uh through like the alphabet structure of like other bets and all that  But none of those bets are super big yet, maybe with people some people know waymo  There's like the life sciences one, but they've killed a lot of that by the way. They fired almost everybody from the area 120

Start time: 6457.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is I thought the most interesting are a part of the article  The way I see it google has four core cultural problems. They're all the natural consequences of having a money printing machine called ads  That has kept growing relentlessly every year hiding all other sins  And the sins he talks about are no mission  no urgency  Delusions of exceptionalism i've seen that so often in silicon valley where you go. Hey, we're the kings. We're in top  I remember I had friends at atari  In the 80s who said hey, we're the kings, right? We can't lose and then finally mismanagement  He says unfortunately, this is not my first experience watching the gradual decay of a dominant empire  I looked through lived through more than a decade 1999 through 2011 at microsoft as it slowly degraded and lost its way, right?  Uh, yet google has a few strengths microsoft didn't have as it tried to recover  It isn't a culture of ego and fiefdoms  That was the problem at microsoft manu cornet's famous picture of everybody's shooting at each other  Right the environmental the environment values interspection at google  The stated core values of the company are rock salad and there's still immense respect for google in the external world  There is hope for google  But  Don't wait too long. I like what you said. I think that's right on this is the year, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think google can definitely recover from this like they're just like microsoft, right?  Microsoft definitely lived through this with you know  Kind of bad leadership and just all sorts of internal problems and they were able to turn it around and I think you know  Google's not going to go anywhere. They may have a couple rough quarters and all that but  They got a lot of smart people still working there and they'll be able to you know, but they gotta get the right management in place  That's true. Uh, you know, there was that other article a few months ago talking about how  One of the issues were people  Were always creating new projects there  But then there was no support for that project going forward and  So you would get promotions for doing projects but not promotions for having a successful product  No incentive to maintain the success right so they just dwindle it would watch it move on  Yeah, and so this idea of facebook, you know, it's like you brought that up like  He doesn't want managers to be managing managers, which yeah, you know  I think a lot of people are on board and shouldn't it shouldn't be uh, like a shocking  Revelation to have in management I feel like but he was rewarded handsomely for that  Their stock went through the roof even though their quarter was kind of okay  Because he said i'm just going to eliminate a lot of management and you know  Stockholders like to hear that because it's going to be you know, the was it the year of optimization or something he said regarding their  Uh the way that companies could be run, but that's the smart thing and google probably needs to do something similar to that

Yeah, he wanted to put a lot of money into metaverse  but the metaverse side has barely been talked about since then and he's talking he's like I think  Uh zuckerberg has heard what the market wants to hear  Um, and is making those changes and I think it's kind of like a founder reasserting more, uh  control and  Going into a little bit of wartime mode  Which he needs after what's happened with like ios changes like really hitting the ad business and them trying to go and fix it  Fix the core pieces and then you can go and add other pieces on top. That's what's happening right now over there  And yeah google they'll be fine. They have some of the smartest people on the planet  We shouldn't be talking about them as like they're like out of the fight  That's like not even close to what's happening  They brought like there's some crazy ai things that they can just pop out that will just blow people's minds  uh, but there's like efficiency and speed and things that they will have to go and solve and  This year will tell like can they do that or not?

It's just it's an endless parade a litany of exploits who needs to know  Actually, the reason is germaine both apple and microsoft this week fixed zero days that were actively being exploited  Uh, and this is this is what's so scary about you know, the modern world apple had a problem in web kit  They had to put out a patch for everything ios  ipad os mac os I think even watch os and tv os were updated because web kit had a  Essentially zero click exploitable flaw that somebody with malicious content on a website if you went to that website you'd be owned  That'd be it you're done  That is kind of as bad as it gets microsoft fixed three  actively exploited zero day vulnerabilities  Uh, it just keeps happening  I don't know.

Transcript:  So do you think getting back to ai ai is going to play an important role in doing this both and looking at code  And being able to spot these things as well as using ai to do like hacks on itself to see if it can find these flaws  Because that seems like a pretty good use of technology

Start time: 7917.86
End time: 7942.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I okay, so this is a good example of is that uh anthropomorphizing ai if it's just spicy autocorrect  How's it going to know if there's a security flaw and yet we've seen it write code certainly. That's what copilot does  But it writes code without understanding the code  I don't know. That's an interesting question, but it does write it really well  Uh, yeah, because it's copying from somebody else basically  right, there's

Transcript:  There's definitely ai is being built to help try to identify vulnerabilities  but  Vulnerabilities falls into this category same as like writing opinion pieces or investigative journalism  Where you have to like think critically about like oh like i'm going to push on the edge of this thing  And then i'm going to push on the edge of this thing  And then like find the like little hole and that's just not a thing that the existing ai systems can do really well  They will be getting better and better at it and I do think at some point a lot of vulnerabilities could be patched by ai  but  Humans will always find some unique way to break  stuff up we'll say and for now at least I think  This is the one area where like it's i'm trying to write a list of like all the jobs  Where ai is not going to immediately replace a bunch of people or at least like could be much harder  And like investigative journalism on this is on this list like uh, like the  Person who is checking for those security vulnerabilities is probably another one  Uh, just because that is requires some unique level human intuition

I don't know. Is it this is that a different I think it's different  To create malware than to find bugs. I don't know  I don't know  Well, this is all going to be very interesting.

Oh, uh a networked  Shareable whiteboard that can be almost  anything  So one of the hard things about talking about miro is is it's so amorphous you could do anything with it  We're building an ask the tech guy board right now  We're going to use it for preparing our show ask the tech guys. Micah and I are working on that  right now miro can be  So many things  It and what's great about it is it opens up and democratizes collaboration and input if you've got a team with some people at home  some people at work  Some people working nights some people working days. You'll love miro. It's a collaborative  visual whiteboard  That brings all your great work in one to one place  And everybody can access it from home in a hybrid workspace online any time of the day  So you could put an idea there somebody can respond to that later in the day  It gives product teams a perpetual space where they can drag and drop insights and data  So that nothing's lost everything stays  And you can scale it up and down so you can zoom out to see the big picture or zoom in to see the details  Miro covers all kinds of use cases  You can build visual assets you can present findings  it's fantastic for your next  Zoom call or google meet call because if you're doing a brainstorm on a call you can have a timer  You can have polls. There's all these interactive features you can use to make that meeting more effective  You can build out your product vision on a miro board by brainstorming with sticky notes and comments  Live reactions that voting tool  It helps you come to consensus quickly you could set a timer say we got 30 minutes to do this  Express yourself in creative ways bring the whole group together around one idea  Whether it's a quick wire frame a drawing a doodle you do forget the napkin just do it on the on the miro  Or you can do kind of a mood board with clipping and pasting in images and mock-ups from the miro board people who use miro  Find it transformational on average. They report saving 80 hours a user a year just by streamlining conversations  And cutting down meeting times  As a result miro gives your team the chance to always stay connected to real-time information  Gives the project managers the product leads a bird's eye view of the whole project  You can create a can-ban board and assign tasks. It's great for agile  Make sure nothing slips through the cracks get your first three boards for free  Start working better miro.com  Podcast miro.com  com  slash  Podcasts when you're at miro  Check out the miro verse.

They actually want more moderation and then the republicans want less because freedom of speech  But I this freedom of speech thing drives me nuts because it's like  I get it  But that's not it's not like the freedom of speech is not a constitutional issue here  It's it's not we're talking about private property and when you own a website or you know a service  It's private property. It's no different than if like someone came into your house and started protesting  You can be like, please get out of my house. They can't go well freedom of speech  You can go like yeah private property trumps that get out of off of my property  But this whole thing with this section 230 is just strange to me because it's like  The same people who advocated for free market private property and all this are now like well twitter is so big  It should be a public square. It's like says who like it's not that big of all the social networks twitter is actually one of  The lowest in terms of engagement and usage of people who are actually on it  It's not a town square just because you say it is and even so we can't just snap our fingers and decide well  Now we're going to throw out all the laws and make that some sort of protected entity unless you want to nationalize it  But no one wants a national wants that yeah. Yeah. I mean now you're a socialist, right?  It's such a weird thing that the people who  Defend capitalism and private property are now all of a sudden like well, no, you know, this is a community thing  Like really we're all now part of this like socialist thing. I don't know. It's weird

Transcript:  I think part of this is that it's it's safe and easy for a politician from the left or the right to attack big tech  Right now, but watch out watch out because it's not just big tech and uh, you know  You can make them the your poster child for bad things  But frankly section 230 gives us the right to moderate if somebody says something that's bad  In our chat or our forums we can we can  Stop them. We can ban them. We can kick them out. We can delete their messages and section 230 means they can't come back and sue us  So if you get rid of 230 you're losing the right to moderate  as well as the  the right not to moderate uh  People post stuff on these sites. I don't want to be liable for it  And even if you're actively moderating as google is on youtube, they're taking that as videos down now  What about the contention and this is the biden administration's contention that you can save 230  Just take out the part where it's making algorithmic recommendations should should that be protected?

Start time: 8873.28
End time: 8905.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  this is so the case is like and it's like really worth going deep into this case and I uh,  I do recommend there's a youtube channel legal eagle and he's yeah goes in depth onto he's fantastic  He has a great video on this specific subject, but they're not going after all of section 230 in this lawsuit. They're going after  they're trying to claim that uh,  youtube is acting as a publisher because of the algorithm so basically  That because the algorithm is curating and recommending something it should be outside of section 230. That's also that is dangerous

Start time: 8906.06
End time: 8912.08

Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's it. That's  That's what an editor does. That's what you do. Uh, you know, I mean, uh

Start time: 8913.76
End time: 8936.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So but that's the point they're trying to say if that's what if what's an an editor would do an editor wouldn't have the right  Editors are protected publishing. No editors. It depends on the which it depends if you say  Uh editor for a news website might be not protected. No news websites are also protected by 230  So and that would be yes then if if if the supreme court in this case decided to strike it down

Start time: 8937.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Chaos all across everything in the internet  But and and I guess the question and by the way, I argued at first in in favor of this kind of limited interpretation of  Well, you don't need algorithms. The problem is who defines what's a good algorithm or bad algorithm?  And that's what reddit moderators are saying that was what convinced me is no. No, we use algorithms. We need algorithms  That's how we find the bad content. There's so much volume. We need algorithms and if you ban them  You really cause huge problems. There is a very good go to tech dirt  They have a page on tech dirt  About section 230 called somebody on the internet is wrong  In which they explain uh section 230  in great detail and why all of the things  the biden administration josh holly and ted cruise say are  Not not accurate not not real  And uh, and and there are there there's straw men because they don't like  Whatever they don't like but we I think and I think i'm not alone in this  I think the eff agrees epic agrees we need section 230 or there will not be  The only thing left on the internet will be big companies that can defend themselves  There will not be communities. It's very very  Dangerous owen. Do you have an opinion on this?

Start time: 9022.70
End time: 9054.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The basic opinion is again when you say things are scary and they have to have solutions  We don't have the proper tools to fix the things that need to be fixed  Yeah, and at least people are bringing attention to it, uh, because so many things there's so much  Going on right now. There's something like this like we need to have focus on it  And we need to make sure that we're doing the right things to ensure that things get worked out because right now it's like  Stuff's flying at you and then we forget to do the things that you need to get done  And then everybody will complain later when something goes wrong. So

Start time: 9055.06
End time: 9078.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, the there's it's an open question how this supreme court would vote on this  And i'm sure there's some legal analyst who can tell me what they think each one would vote  But if it got struck down, I would expect congress to scramble very quickly  To write an updated law  But it would also have it's tons of issues it would there would be chaos for sure. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, well a lot of these people involved  Don't know tech that's kind of the problem and then you get lobbyist involved. That's the biggest problem. Yeah, that's the biggest problem  So it's uh, it's uh, it's kind of scary and I think part of it too it came back to the publisher thing and that  That riles a lot of people, especially on the right, you know, it's like well you want it both ways and like yes  We do want it both ways as a publisher and a website because I want my you know  First amendment right to publish things but I also want to be able to moderate my community  and I think a lot of the  you know people who are against this stuff have just never run a website or community or any kind of business because when you do  You want to curate the community so they get the best experience?  And if it's just total chaos and horrible things are being posted no one wants to use your service because it's terrible. So

It's beautiful. It's like a constitutional  uh  Clause, it's just very simple, but it's 23 words that protect  the internet  And it's so important. It's not the only case the supreme court will be hearing this week the next day  They're hearing another case  uh relatives of now now ross, uh alas alasaf  A jordanian citizen was killed in an islamic attack in istanbul in 2017  His family is accusing twitter google and facebook of aiding and abetting the spread of militant islamic ideology  This doesn't specifically address 230, but it's the very next day. I will be listening with interest to both  days, uh arguments  uh, and of course, we won't know until the court rules in the spring but  Uh, it makes me very nervous and when I see  When I see president biden josh holly and ted cruise in the same boat. I get very very afraid  uh  This is this  If you get both the left and the right agreeing on something like this  I think there's a great great chance. It's going to happen
