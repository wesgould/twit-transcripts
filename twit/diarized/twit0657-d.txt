Transcript:  A lot of real people doing amazing stuff, too, and helping each other, but also, like, you know, I mean, that whole, I mean, this year, Apple had to put out a press release, basically, because of Reddit, right?  Right.  This is pretty interesting.

Transcript:  All the time, news breaks on Reddit. In fact, increasingly, Reddit's become part of my regular beat check. You know, I go to Tech Meme, and I go to Reddit, and Nuzzle, and I think Hacker News, and those every single day.  And Reddit often is the best source of material for me.  Hey, before we go on down this line, let me say hello to Ant Pruitt, who is also with us from Tech Republic. Always a thrill to have the drone master on with us.  You're too kind.

Transcript:  It's great to have all three of you here. We just got back yesterday. We were in Austin for South by Southwest. Interactive started on Friday, goes through Monday.  Didn't wish I could have spent more time there. I would have loved to.  But we were there for a panel I did on Friday from the Capital One house with Stacy Higginbotham and a couple of security experts on real world security for real people, as opposed to, you know, all this sensational stuff you read. It was a lot of fun.  And by the way, we did make a special out of that panel discussion was a really good panel discussion with Stacy Higginbotham, Bo Woods from We Are I Am the Cavalry, which is a great site, and Wendy Neither.  And you can see that on our Twitter Live specials feed. It's on YouTube, but also on our website, Twitter.TV. It's number 328 practical security in a dangerous world. It was a really great conversation.  I encourage you to download that add that to your feeds. None of you are at South by though. What is South by no longer the show for geeks? Or you just didn't get the airfare?

Start time: 338.00
End time: 366.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we sent some tech republic people. We had a panel, but it was just not. It's I think you said like during the show open, it is it's a wonderful event, but it is not the place tech news or tech products happen anymore.  So so the value is it's a great value to attend, but the value to report breaking stuff is is less than it used to be. Yeah. And if you're a reporter, it's just pitch, pitch, pitch, pitch, pitch.

Transcript:  Well, it became I think a marketing show, really. And even marketers go.  The the onion had a good let me see if I can find the onion headline from South by Southwest. Oh, it's funny. It's already screwed. Very hashtag brands. Very hashtag. It's very hashtag brands. Something like South by Southwest is still real says junior marketing executive.  It really it's kind of but but at the same time, Austin is such a great location. We were talking about the last app that got launched there. Of course, South by is where Twitter made its bones in 2006. Can you believe that 12 years ago? Yeah, man.  Wow. That's where Foursquare launched a couple years later. What else?  Foursquare was oh nine. Oh nine bonkers, but a lot of fun.

That's happening on Tuesday, and I'm going to talk to Steve Huffman, the co founder. So just going down there for a day or so in and out. But there's still stuff that happens there. I mean, again, like you said, there's not as much product launches, but I think it's a good place.  Obviously, like you could you could throw a taco and hit a futurist. Right? There's a lot of that. A lot of that going on. And some of that's, you know, better than other parts. But I think there is some good folks down there.  There's great folks down there. Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 510.80
End time: 591.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I know somebody who did HBO took over two acres of land just outside of Austin to recreate Westworld.  And we have a friend who went and visited. You had to apply for a ticket. The tickets were gone in two minutes.  It's 20 minutes outside of Austin. You get on a bus.  They give you a cowboy hat, white hat or black hat.  You sign up when you get there. There's a letter waiting for you with your name handwritten on it.  There are there's a old railroad car with cowboys in it.  There's a there's a speakeasy with ladies of the evening there.  They've really recreated Westworld.  And of course, it's all a promo for the next year.  And I'm going to be talking about that in a minute.  Ladies of the evening there, they've really recreated Westworld.  And of course, it's all a promo for the next season of Westworld, which is coming.  Although it's not Westworld this year, it's still going to be called Westworld, but it's all it's the samurai world.  And apparently there were some samurai sitting around in the bars at Westworld.  This was the ticket to get. And so few people got it.  You know, you'd had to really be connected to get in there, I guess, or just fast on the draw.  But it looked like I would be so scared to do that.  Why? Why? You'd be afraid of getting sucked into Westworld?

Start time: 592.80
End time: 601.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's like I kind of like check the bullets to make sure they're real.  Those robots, who knows?  It's a head trip. You know what I mean? I'd be scared.

Start time: 601.84
End time: 638.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually it's really, really true.  But that is really what it's become. We tried to get into.  Let me see if ATX. Oh, no, he emailed them to him.  ATX food guy was my friend who got in John Kulo.  Nice. Yeah, I'm very jealous.  He takes pictures of barbecue. Apparently didn't want to intermingle it with pictures of cowboys.  So it's just smart man. Yeah, it's all algorithmic.  But what was what was I going to say?  Oh, as for Reddit, you said Steve Hoffman, but not Alexis Ohanian.  He's retired, hasn't he? From Reddit, the other founder.

Start time: 639.58
End time: 642.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he sort of stepped away. I think he's more involved in say that again.

End time: 712.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's awesome. Salute. We can.  No kidding. Now that that I'd be scared.  She looks like she could kick your butt, frankly.  In fact, she didn't look like it. She can kick. She can.  She can kick your butt. So he's going to be a good boy.  Yeah, he we've had both of them on triangulation.  I remember he told me Steve Hoffman wrote the original Reddit in Lisp.  And that kind of blew me away. I doubt it's still in Lisp.  Condi Nast is taking it. I don't think so.  I think we're doing a show about Reddit, which is really cool, Brock.  I kind of jealous, Ben.  I mean, I'm kind of jealous because we try to do a show about Reddit,  but they felt like there was so much great content there.  We just couldn't find a voice for it.  We couldn't we couldn't figure out where to go with it.  I think we just kind of we just was like a best of Reddit.  But you're doing more than you're digging deep.

Start time: 713.26
End time: 714.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 714.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this was a few years ago. Yeah.

Start time: 718.04
End time: 791.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really fun.  And it's really interesting to try to find stories and talk to people who  who really put stuff out there.  I think sometimes it's a little complicated because, you know,  one of the things that that lets people share really openly on the platform  is the anonymity.  So, you know, we've we've run into some of that,  but we've also talked to people, you know,  we had an episode a couple of weeks back where we we talked to this guy  and he used the used a subreddit to to recover from opiates,  the opiates recovery subreddit.  Wow. And he was a heroin addict for like, I think, six or seven years,  something like that.  And he and he used Reddit to help himself get clean and to stay clean and stay sober.  So we went and talked to him.  And so there's there's some really interesting stories that you find.  We did a story this week about this really weird someone was finding  Post-it notes in their house.  It's a sort of famous Reddit story now or infamous.  Someone was finding Post-it notes in their house with weird messages  and they thought it was their landlord like creeping in their house.  But another commenter said, I think you have carbon dioxide poisoning.  Sorry, carbon monoxide.  What?  And it turned out they did.

Start time: 791.80
End time: 798.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait, because they were stoned on carbon monoxide.  They thought they were seeing Post-it notes, but they weren't.

Start time: 799.77
End time: 802.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they were writing themselves Post-it notes.  Oh my God.  Yeah.

Start time: 804.93
End time: 810.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that a symptom of carbon monoxide poisoning?  You black out, you do things and then don't remember you did them.

Start time: 811.10
End time: 816.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can become forgetful.  You can hallucinate.  All sorts of things can happen.  And it's weird.

Start time: 817.10
End time: 818.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They saved this guy's life.

Start time: 819.37
End time: 864.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Supposedly. It's interesting.  The original commenter that this was happening to,  they sent us some messages, but they didn't want to talk to us.  This is again, the sort of anonymity thing.  But we talked to an expert and they said a bunch of things in the comments  that we reported on.  And we talked to the commenter who identified it as carbon dioxide poisoning.  And he had this had happened to him.  He lives on a boat in Seattle.  This guy is an engineer who works for a company that makes parts for Boeing.  And he almost killed himself and his wife and their dog on their boat  by mistake one night, leaving the stove on.  And so he learned about carbon monoxide poisoning,  which is why he left this comment.  So these weird sort of connections in the comment sections.

Start time: 865.32
End time: 918.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now I'm worried because I keep hearing Alexa laughing.  And I think maybe I have maybe I have carbon monoxide poison.  Amazon says they know now why Amazon's Echo was laughing.  Although I thought what was most interesting about this story was was not this.  I mean, it's pretty obvious if you understand how computers work,  that the Amazon Echo is not actually laughing at you.  But people were reporting it sounds like a child's laughing somewhere else in my house.  It just happens spontaneously.  If you want to hear what it sounds like, I do have this from the New York Times article.  This is Tal Goldfuss's Twitter feed.  He was smart. He was clever.  He heard the laugh and he remembered that you could ask Echo to repeat the last sound.  The last sound you heard. So he's going to do that.  Wait a minute. Let's get that video going here.

Start time: 919.42
End time: 921.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Let's play the last sound.

Start time: 922.94
End time: 923.91
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Whoa.

Start time: 927.31
End time: 929.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just slightly creepy.  It's a little creepy.

Start time: 930.80
End time: 932.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alexa play the last sound.

Start time: 937.00
End time: 997.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So as it turns out, Amazon. Alexa play the last sound.  Okay. Now mine's playing. Stop. Stop.  Okay. I think I'm a carbon monoxide.  Apparently Amazon added the capability to respond to Echo laugh.  I'm going to call it Echo instead of the A word to not trigger people's stuff.  Echo laugh. And that's such a short phrase.  It was accidentally getting triggered easily.  So now they've changed it to Echo can you laugh?  It's actually terrible if you ask it. It goes, can I laugh? Teehee.  I prefer the creepy laugh.  But what I find interesting, what I'd actually like to ask you guys about is this kind of,  all of a sudden there was this techno panic all over the internet this week  thinking that something creepy was going on with the Echo.  Like somehow this is Jeff Bezos listening to you.  This is a weird reaction to something that's just kind of obvious, right? Or no?

Start time: 998.72
End time: 1004.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Never mind the fact that you have a lot more creepy surveillance going on in your pocket as you walk in the room.

Start time: 1005.34
End time: 1015.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you, Aunt Pruitt. Exactly. You're carrying the phone around.  It's got a microphone. Who knows what it's listening to.  In fact, if you really wanted to spy on somebody, you wouldn't make the Echo laugh every once in a while.

Start time: 1016.60
End time: 1025.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I got to ask, what is the point of having that feature built in?  Is it just a little Easter egg Amazon thought people would enjoy?

Start time: 1026.38
End time: 1028.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To make us anthropomorphize artificial intelligence.

Start time: 1029.55
End time: 1034.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's it.  And in fact, it worked, right? Because people started assuming all sorts of stuff.

Start time: 1035.66
End time: 1086.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think that we can see this as a signal in the noise.  There is techno panic and some of it is hyperbolic and unnecessary.  And some of it is a symptom of mainstream adoption of not just technology,  but technology that happens and iterates very rapidly.  And with things that we call AI, although it's not really artificial intelligence or machine learning,  but consumer tools like Echo and all of our other listening things,  I think that we were sold on the promise of these great devices and we can use them for great things.  But there is also the after the fact, oh crap.  And I think that a lot of people are not as tech savvy as we think that our peers are.  And when we have this rapid iteration of gadgets and things that do improve our lives, there is a blowback to that.

Start time: 1086.92
End time: 1099.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Somebody in the chat room says, RF guy says,  the silly laugh feature distracts you from the real monitoring that's going on.  That's what I was going to say because...  Pay no attention.

Start time: 1099.82
End time: 1165.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's to make us...  Amazon is doing so much to market.  Yeah. No, keep going. Keep going, Ben. Yeah.  Amazon is...  The real stuff that's happening is happening on the Echo too.  Amazon is figuring out how to market you things all the time and try to get you to buy stuff.  And that's the thing that's actually scary is that everybody has these things in their houses.  To me at least, everybody has these things in their houses and they're sort of like,  oh, it's this cute little thing I have in my house. It's kind of fun. I can play music on it.  But really, it's just trying to figure out how to separate you from your money,  which is also interesting when you think about the fact that Amazon...  This Wall Street Journal report about the potential hybrid checking account thing,  which is another interesting part of this.  But I think the creepy laugh, I mean, that's just like...  Yeah. People shouldn't make a big deal about that.  They should make a big deal about thinking about what this thing is actually doing in their house  and what its main purpose is if they want to really get creeped out.  That's exactly right.

Start time: 1166.20
End time: 1251.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you actually really think about Jeff Bezos, who is clearly brilliant and is close...  I mean, I don't know if he's an evil genius, but if we have an evil genius, he's it.  He's the richest man in the world now.  And yeah, this is really interesting to watch as he puts Amazon's tentacles and tendrils  into different areas like Amazon Go, the store that has no clerks,  buying Whole Foods, buying Ring Video Doorbell, one of our sponsors.  And then you mentioned this checking account thing, which on any one of these,  on the face of it sounds like, well, that's just reasonable.  The checking account, he's doing this with JP Morgan Chase.  By the way, they have another partnership with JP Morgan for the Amazon Health Service,  for its employees, ostensibly, but they want to do a checking account-like product  that Amazon could offer customers.  They say for young people who don't yet have a checking account,  I really wonder...  Here's what I think is going on.  I think Jeff Bezos is saying, OK, clearly checking accounts are over.  Who writes checks?  So what's going to replace it and how can we be in the middle of it?  Because it's clear that Amazon's goal, and I'm stealing this from Ben Thompson at Stratecary,  is to take a cut of all economic transactions that happen in the United States, period.  Yes.  Every single one.

Start time: 1252.62
End time: 1256.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that more of a look like the folks at...what's that company, Stripe?

Start time: 1257.10
End time: 1298.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stripe does this, yeah.  And every credit card company does in a way, right?  But maybe the future of financial transactions isn't Stripe.  It's not Visa or MasterCard.  Maybe it's more like M-Pesa in Africa, where people don't have checking accounts,  they don't have bank accounts, but all the financial transactions are handed on smartphones,  kind of like a Venmo or Stripe's cash.me, and that becomes the bank.  And by the way, M-Pesa's made a lot of money as the middleman  in the vast majority of economic transactions in many countries in Africa.  I'm sure Amazon's thinking that, right?  I mean, who wants a checking account nowadays?

Start time: 1300.09
End time: 1327.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  And this is one front in a multi-front battle for, like Ben said, to separate you from your money.  But we can see everyone getting in on games that take percentages of transactions.  Apple, of course, is doing this.  Everyone is doing this.  Stripe is one vertical, but we see this war happening all around.  This is not a war for your money.  This is a war for your mind share.

Start time: 1329.07
End time: 1331.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And a small bit of every transaction.

Start time: 1332.13
End time: 1337.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  We don't want your entire mind.  We just want like two and a half percent on every thought.  It's interesting.

Start time: 1338.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Walmart, according to the Wall Street Journal, attempted this about a decade ago.  And they got a lot of criticism, the journal says, from a range of companies and lawmakers.  But, you know, that's actually let me make.  So last fall, Amazon asked for pitches from several banks for a hybrid checking account.  It's weighing pitches.  So it's not necessarily a done deal.  They're thinking about doing it with JP Morgan or Capital One, which was our sponsor at South by, one of our sponsors.  So it's not clear who's going to get this.  Capital One is a credit card company.  JP Morgan has a variety of different things for JP.

Start time: 1378.30
End time: 1382.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amazon's partner is JP Morgan as well for the Amazon credit card.

Start time: 1383.39

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, really? Oh, interesting.

Start time: 1387.16
End time: 1425.80

Transcript:  And also, I think something that's interesting here is Amazon gets to avoid some charges, right?  In theory, at least.  If you have a checking account with Amazon slash JP Morgan instead of Amazon, every time you want to move money from your regular checking account to Amazon to buy stuff, which you can also do, by the way, you can sort of bank cash in Amazon and then pay with, I think, Amazon cash.  I forget what it's called.  It's called like re-up or reload or something like that.  Then Amazon doesn't have to pay.  The financial transaction fee for Amazon is also lower, I think.

Start time: 1425.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, because you pay several percent on credit card transactions.  So Amazon would love to just eliminate that.

Transcript:  And this gives the company vision into transactions that are occurring not on Amazon.  Oh.  Right? This is one business that Capital One has been in for a long time.  They are a credit card company, but what they really do is see how and where consumer spending occurs.

Transcript:  I'm sorry, Ben, you're a little disadvantaged because Ben's got a lot of latency, I think, going on.  So that's all right.  Just when you start talking, keep talking and we'll shut up.  Go ahead, Ben.

Start time: 1477.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, Ben.  Sorry about that.  I was just going to say that this is, again, not to get technophobic at all because none of us are, clearly, except when we should be.  But I think one of the interesting things about this is if you think about how typically you would interact with an older school financial company,  at least in theory, they're pretty motivated to help you save or to help you do the things that you need to do as an adult.  And I think one thing that you have to think about here, again, this is all theoretical, but if you had a checking account with Amazon,  you have to think about the possibility that Amazon starts to learn how you act right after you get paid, for instance.  What do you buy right after you get paid?  Hugely fair.  What kind of bills are you paying?  Are you getting toilet paper?  And they talk about catering to the unbanked, so obviously this means young people, but also potentially it means lower income households.  And so I think there is a potential scary thing there where you think about Amazon basically really owning all of your financial behavior,  at least understanding it in a way that allows them to then market things to you more effectively.  How scary is that though?

Start time: 1561.80
End time: 1644.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think that's that scary.  Maybe your ads would be better targeted, but maybe there's a synergy of having Amazon be both my retailer and my banker.  I mean, maybe there's advantages to that.  But maybe banking costs less.  I think there could be maybe the goods cost less because you're eliminating the two and a half percent markup that the bank charges, the credit card charges.  There could be valuable.  I mean, what I'm thinking about is this is it seems to me that we do need to reinvent the financial system because the whole idea of a bank is kind of based on the notion that you would go there with actual money and they would hold it for you.  And then you could go and take it out.  It's a safe deposit box.  And you can go take it out.  And then eventually checks came along.  And so instead of taking money and using it, you could write an IOU in effect that the bank would make good on.  And that system grew.  Then credit cards came along that were basically completely separate from the bank.  You transfer bits of money out of the bank into the credit card as you paid the credit card and then transfer stuff from the credit card.  This is a kind of a crazy system that grew like topsy over a century or two.  That doesn't really make any sense in the modern age where you don't have stuff, piles of cash to bring to the bank.  You all you have is bits.

Transcript:  Is it safe to count out Walmart in this stuff?  I don't think so.  I think it's pretty powerful.  And everybody shops there.  I don't care how much money you don't make or how much money you do make.  You shop at Walmart for whatever reason.  And they're always trying to figure out a way to keep you coming back.  And then you mentioned this stuff about the Walmart pay and their little checking ideas and whatnot.  And I wouldn't count them out.

Transcript:  We really thought when Apple created Apple Pay that the next step was for Apple was to create a bank.  I think a lot of us thought, oh, that's Apple's long term goal.  I think they didn't maybe for regulatory reasons, not because they didn't think about this.  I'm sure the minute if Walmart hadn't already been thinking about it, as soon as they saw this headline in the Wall Street Journal,  they said, oh, yeah, we got to do that because anything Amazon does, Walmart's got to compete against.

Transcript:  Oh, my soul to the company store.  Yeah, exactly.  So it is just I mean, if if we were to start from scratch and rethink this banking system, I don't think we would design it this way.  This is this is more we've something we've inherited.  We would do something completely different.  And maybe blockchain has a role in here.  Do you think blockchain has a role?  A distributed ledger system?

Start time: 1733.67
End time: 1748.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it will have to be a different type of blockchain or it will have to be an optimized or a faster moving blockchain.  It's simply the blockchains that we have now are simply they can't process transactions at high scale fast enough.  But the blockchains are a technological solution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, your microphone just switched off from whatever it was to something else.  That was weird. Here's OK.  So this this conversation needs for people to understand what blockchain is and why blockchain is a solution.  Blockchain is a ledger, a distributed ledger.  Right. So what is a bank doing?  Really? Bank is just a ledger. Right.  You bring them the money.  Now they say you have this much money on account and you can then have them pay that money on account to somebody else.  If you overdraw it, you you pay out more money than you have.  They come to you and say, give us some more money.  It's a ledger system, but it's centralized.  What if this ledger system were decentralized using a blockchain like system that is more reliable?  You're right. There's big problems with Bitcoin.  I mean, the transaction speed and the transaction cost is at a you know, this takes forever and it's out of control.  I just got an I do I use this is completely out of left field, but I use a service called Keybase to distribute track of and distribute my PGP keys.  They have just announced that they are being funded by Stellar, which is a new cryptocurrency.  Stellar is Lumens.

Start time: 1819.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Stellar addresses this stellar.  This is not an ICO. No, you can.  All right. Thank God.  But Stellar is really and I had never heard of them until I got this email from Keybase.  But Stellar is essentially a blockchain system that's designed to avoid the problems Bitcoin has by reducing the cost of transactions, making transactions take seconds instead of what is almost days now, allowing micro payments, which is a big thing that we've all wanted for a long time and could save journalism.  I had never heard of this. I don't know anything about it.  I haven't done that much research.  I've just read up on it.  But this is very interesting.  And I do trust the guys at Keybase.  They're very smart and they're well motivated.  It's an open source project.  And they say that Stellar can fulfill Bitcoin's original goal of fast, cheap worldwide payments without a centralized bank.  You have to get rid of those transaction fees.

Start time: 1891.06
End time: 1912.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the thing that's killing all blockchains right now are transaction fees and the slow relative slow transaction fees.  And the slow relative slow speed.  Oftentimes a transaction fee can cost as much if not more than the item or good that you're purchasing.  For Bitcoin it's over $20 for many transactions.  Yeah, I think on Ethereum it's even higher than that.

Start time: 1913.08
End time: 1996.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is what they now again, this is I'm being uncritical.  And mostly because I know the Keybase guys and I trust the Keybase guys.  They say that Lumens, the currency of Stellar, transaction fees are basically zero, a tiny fraction of a penny, and will scale to far more transactions in Bitcoin.  It is fast. The average ledger time on Stellar is 4.74 seconds.  And they're planning to make it even faster.  And this is really...  Maybe they're just altruistic.  I mean, Keybase is a free service.  It's been free for a couple of years.  I use it all the time.  I mean, I suppose we should.  It's a good question to ask.  Let's put it that way.  Here's really an interesting point.  Bitcoin now consumes as much electricity as Portugal, about a 500th of all electricity in the world.  Wow.  This is from both mining and transactions because Bitcoin requires proof of work for transactions.  That proof of work takes electricity, takes computation.  And this is what's really scary.  The Bitcoin use of power has climbed 400% in the last year.  At this rate, Bitcoin will soon use more electricity in the entire US.  So is the price of consumer GPUs.  Yeah.  Yeah.  And you can't buy a GPU anymore.

Transcript:  So Stellar Protocol.  Now, here's one more reason to think about Stellar.  The Stellar Protocol is behind Moxie Marlinspike, the guy who created Signal's new mobile coin.  Kik is switching from Ethereum to Stellar.  So I'm very intrigued by this.  I trust Moxie.  I trust the Keybase folks.  I think this is very interesting.  So, I don't know.  Go to Keybase.io's blog and you can read up on Stellar.  It's brand new to me.  I thought it was very interesting.  And I think this is the reason I bring it up.  I think this might be the antidote to Amazon or Apple or Walmart saying,  No, we want to own all the transactions because blockchain transactions are fundamentally anonymous.  Right.  So you preserve your privacy.  If it's done well, they're decentralized and they're fast and they're effective.  Maybe we don't need a centralized banking system.  Maybe we don't need Amazon.

Start time: 2065.84

Transcript:  This really reminds me of, do you remember a year or two after the launch of the App Store and we had conversations about  walled gardens and the web going from open distribution stuff like XML and other in RSS to app based models and walled garden worlds.  This feels like that era for financial transactions or for fintech.  Yes.

Start time: 2091.16
End time: 2145.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it all comes down to, I think, just rethinking how this works.  There's a lot of overhead and slop in this system because it's just kind of evolved from 100 years ago that doesn't need to be there.  It could be much, I think it could be much more efficient, faster.  And I think it's really important to think of solutions that do, if privacy is an issue for you, you know, cash was private, but nobody does cash anymore.  And by the way, we've seen some evidence that it's possible perhaps to break through the anonymity of Bitcoin as well.  I think that was a recent story about hackers.  If that's the case, that's really going to be interesting.  So I think a solution that is anonymous, that preserves your privacy, that is efficient.  That would be very interesting.

I wonder 10 years from now, we're going to look back on this and I wonder if either we'll be dealing with a chaos that's been created by multiple cryptocurrencies, ICOs, rampant fraud, all of which is kind of what it looks like today.  Or if some of this, some sense will be made out of all of this.  This is the problem is that government is just out of the picture, right?  Normally you would expect government to get involved.  Nobody trusts the government.  The government doesn't seem to want to do anything about these kinds of things and frankly they're not sophisticated enough.  They are stuck in the 19th century with it where the current financial system is.

I mean, I went to an MIT blockchain conference, I think last year now, last summer maybe it was.  And the federal reserve, the head of the Boston's Federal Reserve was there talking about how cryptocurrencies could kind of change, make the process of paying, like buying a house easier.  And I'm not an expert in this, but I do think that there are some people in the government who are slowly becoming hip to this.  And I think interested enough that we might see some real solutions.  I don't know, maybe that'll be a hundred years from now.  But I feel like real estate is huge for blockchain.

And then you'll see the crypto community, the Reddit communities and those who don't want to to have their transactions in that world might gravitate towards cryptocurrency.  Cryptocurrency might.

And great to have all three of you here.  Thank you for for joining us today.  A show brought to you by FreshBooks, a great solution for anybody.  This is this is an interesting step forward in making money make sense.  If you're a small business or a freelancer, you know, come the end of the month.  You've got to do that chore called sending out the invoices.  We've all done it and it's a pain.  You fire up Excel, you fire up Word, you get the invoice, you print it out, you put it in an envelope, you stamp it, you mail it and you hope, you pray that you will get paid.  In some cases, in 30, 60, 90 days.  I got a better way.  In fact, a way I used for a long time.  I was suffering through all this when I used to go up to Canada to do call for help in Toronto.  And I was complaining to Amber MacArthur, my co-host, and she said, oh, there's a new company in Toronto just started up.  This was 2004 called FreshBooks.  They'll make it easy.  And they did.  They made it easy to invoice.  I didn't have to worry about currencies.  I could get my expenses in there just using the app on the smartphone to take a picture of receipts, put them in the invoice.  I'd send them out and something interesting happened.  I got paid a lot faster.  That was a mind blower.  People paid me a lot faster because I was using FreshBooks.  Now, because FreshBooks lets you accept credit cards online and you don't have to do anything extra, by the way, they'll handle that.  You'll get paid average on an average of twice as fast because it turns out your clients want to pay you.  Just make it easy for them.  So you don't have to chase clients for payments anymore.  You don't have to wait in line at the bank with a stack of checks.  You can accept credit card payments directly from your invoice.  You always know exactly what's going on with your money.  In fact, really FreshBooks, don't tell anybody, is essentially a full accounting system that starts with the invoices and the expenses.  Based on that, they know what your receivables are.  They know what your payables are.  They know what your they basically know what your profit is.  And if you're a freelancer, I never knew.  Am I making money?  I don't even know.  I won't know until tax time.  Now you know every step of the way because that great FreshBooks dashboard tells you exactly what's going on.  You see what invoices have been sent, which have been viewed, which have been paid, which are overdue, outstanding invoice totals.  They have lots of other features.  In fact, because it's a web app that's constantly being improved with new features, they added proposals with rich text content and images, customizable sections.  So you can now send off proposals to new clients.  They make it easy for you to grow your business.  You can bill by time.  Of course, hours.  There's a big button on the FreshBooks website or you can use their apps to time how much time you spent on a client.  You can even break it down by project.  It's multilingual.  They just added Spanish and Dutch, which is fantastic.  Take a picture of a receipt.  Upload it.  Payment schedules can be set up from the FreshBooks iOS app.  You can see attachments on existing proposals.  Push notifications.  I'm just going through the list of new features.  Additional push notifications on iOS.  You're notified when a client hasn't viewed an invoice.  If they haven't looked at it yet or an estimate or a proposal in seven days, you can get notified when a client makes a comment or when an invoice goes overdue or when the client pays you.  That's the best notification of all.  Set yourself up for a stress-free tax season from payment reminders to late fees.  Automate as much or as little as you want and get back to doing what you love.  That's why I love FreshBooks.  Get FreshBooks free for 30 days right now.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  Please, when they ask, how did you hear about us?  If you would just write this week in tech, that would be nice.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  We thank FreshBooks for their support of this week in tech.  We got into a really good subject.  I want to I feel like we should we need to dig deeper on this reinventing the financial system and whether blockchain can make a difference there.  I feel like there's there's definitely something going on.  And I like the now I'm kind of digging the idea that maybe we don't want to let Google or Facebook or Amazon or Walmart, any big company, kind of have all that information.  Maybe we want to be a little bit more private.

I just I kind of baffles me.  But weirdly enough, according to TechCrunch, Android beats iOS in smartphone loyalty.  Actually, they're they're quoting a study from Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, or CIRP.  If it's really a strange wouldn't have expected this graph here.  Android has 91 percent brand loyalty compared with 86 percent for iOS.  So if there is a switch going on, it's from iOS to Android.  You would who would have thought that?  Is it more of a switch from iOS to Samsung?

Transcript:  It is that Samsung has created some premium.  They have created iPhone analogs in the Android market.  I think that is it makes sense for Samsung to pursue their own Bixby and their own operating system.  It makes sense for Samsung to pursue their own Bixby and their own operating system that kind of floats on top of Android.  But it's really they have put in the hard work into creating something where you really can't switch and have a very similar experience.  And perhaps that although it existed in the market, perhaps the consumer top of mind awareness of premium phone, premium Android phones was not like it is now.  And in business, we see Knox.  I mean, I would only trust in a Samsung phone going overseas.  I wouldn't use any other Google or Android phone.  But Knox has come a long way and it is really secure.  And I think those two things, a premium consumer experience and a secure business experience are the things that iOS offers.  And perhaps Amazon is or Samsung is offering that.  I want to play a game.

Transcript:  I'm both.  I'm primary iOS.  And that's, you know, I was in Kiev last year.  And as much as I love Android, I always have an Android device around.  I will not trust an Android device overseas.  I will use a Knox device in Samsung, but I won't use an iOS device.  That's interesting.  If I'm going someplace where there are active.  You won't use an Android device when you're.  An Android device, I'm sorry.  I'll only use iOS and even that I'll wipe and get rid of immediately after going someplace.  Really? You think you're getting hacked?  Yeah.  Oh, I know. I know.  I mean, we don't have enough time to discuss this, but I wrote about this.  Look, this is not a plug, but if you want to read the experience, this is on.  I think one is pinned to the top of my Twitter.  But yes, we had look, we were traveling with diplomats last year.  We were traveling with the head of the former head of the NSA.  I'm a schlub.  Nobody cares about me.  But the people we were traveling and working with the Global Cyber Security Summit were not schlubs.  And there are look, Ukraine is a kinetic region.  There are actual kinetic attacks happening there and there are cyber attacks happening every single day.  As we know, they shut down the power grid.  Absolutely.  We were under attack from various threat actors.

There are look, the biggest hotel in Kiev is connected to a cyber facility at a Russian cyber facility that the Ukrainians don't really like.  Look, there's again, I'm a schlub.  I am a low value target.  But when you high value targets, it doesn't matter.  Second, I went on stage.  My fishing attacks, you're getting attacked right now.

So your phone joined a hacker network, including, you say, the device's MAC address, maybe even some encryption keys.  So what were they trying to?  Why were they doing that to you?  What were they trying to get?  Again, nobody knows who I am.

Yes, it is to to draw a circle around you and to find out who is this person, who is this agent, this person and and what what purpose are they serving here?  Now, the purpose we served in Kiev was was as a part of the Global Cyber Security Summit that had diplomats and other people who actually are targets.  So they can look at me and they looked at all of my social media accounts.  I got fishing attacks that were brilliantly.  I mean, anybody who knows burp sweet or any of the other tools that create fishing attacks, it's it's almost trivial to create some of these.  And I'm sure that they found this guy's a schmuck.  He's from the States.  No big deal.  And the other people we were with were had challenges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the Android look, I love Android.  But but you have a consistent state with iOS.  And to burn a zero day on me is ridiculous.  It's way too expensive.  But there are dozens of different Android devices, different flavors of Android in the marketplace.  It's just easier to find a crack in the in the wall.  Leaks, leaks, leaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Knox is the secure enclave within Samsung's Android devices where you can you can have a secure folder that's locked with biometrics.  You can have your business data separate from your personal data so that it has a security model, which in fact, I think the Department of Defense has approved for DOD use.  So it must be fairly good.  So Brian X Chen, love him.  He's been on the show many times.  He's on a couple of weeks ago, did his review of the S9 and he used the horrific.  He calls it the uncanny valley and a R emoji for his review.  And he he says it there.  He says Bitmoji does a better job.  Snap does a better job than these weird, uncanny, creepy emoji.  But he nevertheless decided to use them.  So he says, should I buy this phone for the A.R. emoji?  No. He does like the new placement, as you can see, of the fingerprint reader.  It's finally where it should be.  Instead of to the side of the camera, it's below the camera.  You're much less likely to smudge the you know, my my S8, my Galaxy Note 8 actually have a warning when you use the camera.  You might want to clean your lens because it's so easy to accidentally give a schmutz on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that this is look, this is not an endorsement of Samsung or Bixby.  Bixby is really not so super.  And Samsung's operating system is by far the most annoying part of the device.  But I understand why Samsung looks at themselves and says, hey, we're the biggest player in the block.  Why would we not create a competitive cloud platform?  It makes no sense.

Transcript:  I my this is just a hunch.  And I don't know.  But I would imagine a company the size of Samsung, you have executives and you have decision makers and and you also you have many, many moving parts.  And it's easy for one part of Samsung to say we need cloud services.  We need our own cloud services.  It's ridiculous for us not to play in like this is contemporary business tech.  We need cloud services.  And so let's build them.  And there's probably other components of Samsung that say, let's just make something with awesome hardware.

Transcript:  Well, remember, they had a music service called Milk, which they killed because it couldn't compete against all the other music services from a consumer's point of view.  I think don't you want a variety of companies to compete on any given platform?  You don't want to be all in Google's backyard and all are all in Samsung's.  And yet at the same time, you don't want two clocks every time.  When you Brian points out when you set an alarm on your on your brand new S9, it's going to before you can set alarms, which clock do you want to use?  Clock or clock?  That's not a good user experience.  That's not good.  Here's Brian's animated emoji for Bixby.  He's crying many, many, many tears.  Now I'm starting to like these emojis, by the way.

Start time: 3501.80
End time: 3532.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Because a plain Android is probably competitive with iOS.  iOS is certainly as secure because Google does monthly updates on the Pixel phone.  Most of the reviews I've seen of the camera on the S9 say it has its good points,  it's competitive with iPhone X and with the Pixel 2, but that ultimately,  and I think Brian said this too, the Pixel 2 is probably the better camera of the two.  But he did do a nice heart for the camera.

Transcript:  So is the S9, I mean most people say the S9 is great,  but only an incremental improvement over the S8 or the Note 8.  Is the S9 going to be a big seller or is it...  One of the trends we've seen is that people are not buying new phones as rapidly.  In fact, the Times had an article saying people are buying refurbed phones more and more.

Start time: 3568.36
End time: 3597.95

Transcript:  The pricing is so bad on phones today.  And unless you wait, which is...  I remember when the Pixel, the original Pixel came out,  I advised people to wait about three months and the pricing will be somewhat better.  And it was.  Just wait it out.  Don't go out and buy them on this launch day and spend $1,000 for a phone.  That's just too much.  And yes, the iPhone X is a beautiful phone and has great technology inside of it.

Again, your love of your old smartphone is a problem for Apple and Samsung.  Because of these high-priced phones, people are holding onto devices longer.  New smartphone shipments plunged to historic lows at the end of 2017.  And another trend is people are buying refurbished phones.  It's the fastest growing segment of the global smartphone industry.  One out of every 10 devices sold now is a refurb used phone, which are perfectly good.  And partly that's because we're not seeing big strides in the new models, right?  They're like the S9.  They're kind of incremental improvements over the previous models.  Nothing to get you all excited about.

Transcript:  It's great.  Maybe when we come back, we'll talk about the rise of the daily news show.  Everybody's got one now all of a sudden.  It's the big thing.  And of course, we canceled ours.  Well, I'll tell you why when we come back.  First, a word from our sponsor, 23andMe, a personal genetic service that helps you understand what your particular 23andMe  pairs of chromosomes say about your ancestry, about your traits, about your health.  It is really, really fun.  And they just got a very big news.  The FDA has approved their BRCA tests, which is huge.  They're going to be able to sell a test that tells people whether they're carrying genetic mutations  that put them at a higher risk for breast cancer and ovarian cancer.  So this is the first time the FDA has allowed a company to market a cancer risk text directly to the public.  And it shows really how much trust there is in 23andMe and the genetic testing that they do.  It is fantastic.  Right now, if you go to 23andMe.com, you can get their health and ancestry kit or their ancestry service by itself  that tell you so much about you.  It's fun and informative.  And in fact, I did it years ago when they first started.  I like this, by the way, is that I keep getting more information.  So there are new reports all the time coming through on my 23andMe reports.  You just say it's simple to do, no blood test, no blood draw, no doctor.  You just spit a little saliva, has enough DNA in it.  They can do all the analysis they need.  You spit in a little vial, send it back in the prepaid envelope.  You'll get a 75 plus online reports within six to eight weeks.  And it's fantastic.  You're going to learn more about your ancestry.  In fact, they have this new, I should log into it, this new ancestry wheel and the really interactive stuff that's really cool.  Let me log into my 23andMe.  I can show you.  They have the health and wellness reports that tell you about traits like coffee, weight, earwax.  But some of them are really serious that are really valuable so you can change your lifestyle to benefit.  Depending on if you've got sensitivities to certain things.  And once they get these BRCA tests, I think that's going to be, boy, is that going to be a revolution.  It's not clear yet whether that's a separate test or not.  But I just love 23andMe.  Oh, and look, my sister does too.  I sent her and my mom 23andMe for Christmas.  See, now she's joined up.  We're joined up in the 23andMe.  You could see all sorts of interesting stuff.  Let's look at the ancestry report.  This is a lot of fun.  You can see where your people came from.  Not only a few hundred years ago, but thousands of years ago.  So I am 39.1% British and Irish.  I have a little Neanderthal.  Okay, I'm going to admit it.  There's a little Neanderthal.  I think I'm 4% Neanderthal.  265 Neanderthal variants.  4% of my overall DNA.  Seventh place among family and friends.  So there's some with more and some with less.  My sister's a little less Neanderthal.  She's going to never let me live this down.  She's a little less Neanderthal than I am.  God darn it, Eva.  23andMe, it's so much fun.  I want to encourage you to check it out.  The ancestry reports, the health and wellness reports.  There's even a DNA relative fighter tool that will help you connect  with new relatives.  Buy your 23andMe kit today.  Spit in that vial and get those great reports.  23andMe.com slash twit.  To start learning more about who you are.  And by the way, a great gift for kids.  They're having a St. Patrick's Day sale right now.  You'll save some green on 23andMe.  I like that.  They have kits for...  If you get one for your kids, what's cool about this,  it's a great way for them to learn about the genetics,  which is going to be a big part of their world, isn't it, going forward.  23andMe.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support.  This week in Tech.  Having fun, Dan Patterson from Tech Republic.  Ant Pruitt from Tech Republic.  That was a coincidence.  We didn't plan it that way.  Everybody we know works for CBS Interactive in one form or fashion.  Except for you, Ben. You don't.  Ben Brock Johnson, senior producer.  Yes, sir.  WBUR. He's the Brock Johnson.  Let's see.  Should we talk about Apple?  We haven't talked much about Apple.  They have now signed yet another content superstar  to produce a new series for whatever the hell they're planning.  Apple says we're going to spend a billion dollars for original content.  They hired M. Night Shyamalan.  He's going to do a 10 episode psychological thriller.  Shyamalan, of course, the director and creator of Sixth Sense, Signs,  so many great movies with twists in them.  He did a show called Wayward Pines.  This will be a 30 minute series. He'll be executive producer.  They hired, they contracted with Steven Spielberg to reboot his amazing stories.  They're making a half hour comedy series about a morning show with Kristen Wiig,  Jennifer Aniston and Reese Witherspoon.  There's a show produced by Kamil Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon,  who did The Big Sick, called Little America,  an anthology series about immigrants.  This is pretty cool. They're putting a lot of money into this.  And yet, no word about how they plan to do it.  Is this going to be, do you have to subscribe to Apple Music  to see M. Night Shyamalan's TV series? I don't know.

They want to know where these are going to appear,  who's going to be able to see them.  I can't imagine really people of this caliber saying,  oh yeah, it's okay if it's only on an Apple TV.

Transcript:  How's Apple Music doing, by the way?  As an Android user, I admit I don't pay a lot of attention to how Apple Music  is doing in comparison to Spotify and some of the other services.  But I remember when Apple Music launched, it was like, oh,  14 million automatic installs or whatever it was.  And then I didn't get the sense that a lot of people opted into it.  So I feel like understanding whether or not Apple Music is a success  is a potential way to look at how Apple might be successful  in making this kind of content. Right?

Start time: 4231.04

It's not even close to Spotify's total users because they have,  I don't know, tens of millions, I think 70 million subscribers,  if you include the free tier.  But Apple's quickly catching up.  Apple said, they told the Wall Street Journal,  they have 36 million paid global users.  That's a growth in just a few months, I think,  but something like 5% growth in one month.  And Spotify growing 2% a month in paid users.  So those lines will cross at some point in the near future.  Yeah. So Apple's growing.

But you remember that Amazon video was gone from the Apple TV  for quite a while and it reappeared around the holidays.  And my theory is that this was a reciprocal arrangement.  So that just like you can have Apple Music on an Android device  that they will make a deal with or have made a deal with Amazon  so that it'll show up on the fire.

It seems like that's why we all assume  it's going to be an Apple TV exclusive.  Because what's the strategic goal here?

And that includes audio content, it includes video content,  and I think that Apple is not going to let,  like Ben said, there's a sexy hip factor,  and Apple is not going to let that go away  just because we don't feel like doing video.

I don't know why they picked the UAE.  Apple number one on the list again,  and both among normal people and young people.  Among millennials, Disney just falls off the chart.  Isn't that interesting?  Amazon goes up, and YouTube is number three.  So among millennials, it's Apple, Amazon, YouTube, PlayStation,  Starbucks, Nintendo, Google, Netflix, Coca-Cola, and Walmart.  And I guess if you look at that,  that kind of confirms what you're saying, Dan,  that if you want to be a brand that people love,  that they identify with, look at Netflix's on this list.  Look at YouTube's on this list.  Create content that they love.

The managing partner, MBLM, which does the study, says,  we are surprised and pleased to see YouTube as an addition  to the top three most intimate brand, intimate.  Why is Victoria's Secret not on here?  Intimate brands for millennials this year.  We believe its rise is due to our culture's continued need for escape  and the brand's immediate diverse content personalities  and growing offerings in movies and live TV.  I mean, this data point alone confirms, Dan, what you were saying.  I mean, that the sexy factor, the way to make your brand popular  with young people is content.  I guess you could argue that.  PlayStation's on there because of content.

This was years ago and it was a it was kind of a flop.  They brought in this was what in 2006.  All they asked was that the company's recommendation engine be 10 percent more  accurate.  And they had they offered a data set 100 million ratings of 17000 movies from  half a million customers.  They had all of these AI people working on this and they they had a winner.  They gave away the million dollars, but they never implemented it because it  wasn't that good.

I remember when my kids were little, I used to put a screensaver on their  computer called the Breve Walker, B-R-E-V-E, which was a four legged thing that  started just and flopped on the ground and then would try different strategies to  learn to walk.  And you just let it run on your computer for days, weeks, months.  It really took a long time.  And eventually it would look it would run to walk kind of like this.

Exactly what Apple needs, which is some rainbow Apple stickers.  Yes.  Right.  Just put those on the windows, Apple.  That would be it would fit in.  It would be beautiful.  Tweet.  Tell your boss it's job related.  It is.  It's job related.  Our show today brought to you by the Ring Video Doorbell.  Big fan of the Ring.  It's got rings all over my house.  I got a ring around my house.  I got Ring Doorbell in the front.  We put that in a couple of years ago and I did it, by the way.  I feel very proud.  I'm no handyman, as Lisa, my wife tells me all the time.  But I said, no, no, I can do this.  The Ring Doorbell comes with all the tools you need and a little level and everything.  It's easy.  You unscrew your old doorbell.  There's two wires coming out of the frame there.  It's actually much nicer installed than a traditional doorbell.  It's got a bracket, a mounting bracket and everything.  You put it in there.  You pair it to your Wi-Fi.  And now you've got eyes on your front door.  The Ring Doorbell pairs to your Wi-Fi and then communicates with the Ring app on your phone.  And anytime anybody walks by, it's got motion detection.  You can set the range in the area that it's looking at.  You can get a notification.  Anytime anybody rings a doorbell, you can get a notification.  And you can talk to them because it's got a speaker and it's got a microphone.  Actually, it's really fun to make people jump with the Ring Video Doorbell.  There are some wonderful videos on the Ring Twitter feed.  This is a good one.  Actually, I think turn on the audio on this one.  They're opening the box.  These are very dedicated.

Transcript:  Actual footage from an actual Ring Video Doorbell.  Twitter.com slash Ring.  It's always fun.  The doorbell is great because most of the time I don't have people stealing packages.  Although if you have a problem with that, it's fabulous.  A lot of the time it's just somebody at the doorbell and I can say, oh, I'll be right there.  Or if it's the UPS person with a package I want, I say, I am in the bathtub.  Joe, you know me.  Just leave it there.  I'll sign for it tomorrow.  And it always works.  Then you can keep an eye on the package.  You can also get the really great Ring floodlight cams.  And I've got a couple to replace the, you know, there's old cameras that, not cameras,  lights that you have on the side of your house that light up when you walk in.  So these replace those security lights.  They're better actually in a lot of ways.  They're LEDs.  They're brighter.  You never have to replace the bulb.  But they also have the Ring camera, high-def camera, speaker, microphone, motion sensor,  and 110 decibel alarm on there.  And now when somebody comes around the back of my house, not only do I see them, I can scare them away.  Actually, it's mostly raccoons for me.  But it's great.  Raccoons do not like the alarm I found.  So I have a couple of those.  Now I've got a Ring of security all the way around my house.  I love the Ring video doorbell.  You're going to end the Ring floodlight cams.  You're going to get up to $150 off a Ring of security kit for your house when you go to ring.com slash twit.  Thieves just can't hide with Ring.  Stop crime before it happens.  Make your neighborhood a safer place with Ring.  You can save up to $150 on a Ring of security kit at ring.com slash twit.  Ring, r-i-n-g dot com slash twit.  This is a great device for you.  And if you've already got one, consider it maybe for family and friends.  Older parents, this is a really great thing to have.  They don't have to get up and go to the door.  They can see who's there.  They can talk to them.  Ring.com slash twit.  And you'll save up to $150 on a Ring of security kit.  Actually, kind of as a news story, Ring got purchased last week by somebody we know pretty well, Amazon, for something like a billion dollars.  Recode said it was upwards of maybe $1.2 or $1.4 billion.  We had a conference call last week.  We were going to talk, as we often do with sponsors, we're going to talk to them.  It was the day after the announcement and they didn't show up.  And I thought, you know, they're probably a little hungover.  Shocking.  A little bit of champagne for Jamie and the crew.  So congratulations, Ring, on that.  I'm glad to see that one acquisition made by Google is now being cut loose.  Are you guys fans of the Zagat guides?  I am a huge fan.  Google bought them for an awful lot of money, hundreds of millions of dollars.

You have to be, I don't know if there's one for Charlotte, but boy, in New York or San Francisco or London or Paris, it's the best way to go.  And Google just, I don't know, let it die.  I guess they slowly rolled it into their maps, but then they decided instead to use their own ratings.  And so Zagat, which is a great brand, just kind of languished.  I'm glad the Zagat family got the $151, but now Zagat has been passed along for, I think, a considerably less lower amount of money to a company called the Infatuation.  I don't know who they are, but I hope they do.  Infatuation is, I guess, some sort of restaurant recommend.  Two music, former music industry executives wanted a way to recommend restaurants and bars to their friends.  So they created the Infatuation. Unlike Zagat, which uses real people for reviews, they had an in-house team of reviewers.  They were in New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, London.  You may remember them from hashtag Eats.

But of course, Google always put its own ratings above, and it always felt like a little bit of an afterthought.  The information around the Zagat rating that would pop up in the business profile was so minimal and was so different from the actual Google rating that I was always like,  I guess I'll use the Google rating because I can actually read the reviews.  It just never really made sense to me how Google was folding that in.

Facebook asks users, should we allow men to ask children for sexual images?  I think the answer is no. But yeah, might as well ask. It was a mistake. They had a survey question.  Is this more AI?  Yeah. Blame the computer. One question began, there are a wide range of topics and behaviors that appear on Facebook.  In thinking about an ideal world where you could set Facebook's policies, how would you handle the following?  A private message in which an adult man asks a 14-year-old girl for sexual pictures.  Just in case you're wondering, the choices are this content should not be allowed on Facebook and no one should be able to see it.

Yeah, over a decade.  2400 news stories, all of which had been either verified or debunked by at least one fact checking organization.  So they were really looking at kind of almost an epidemiological study, how far and fast each cascade spread.  True news stories, stories that were verifiably true, took six times longer to spread than false ones.

Transcript:  Well, and if we think about it, it's good that Twitter and other organizations are able to analyze their network and show results like this.  But if we think about bad actors, they've known this for a long time.  And these systems, Twitter, Facebook, the rest of the social web, has been easy, easy exploitation for a very long time.  And it feels disingenuous for these companies to say, oh, geez, we're just figuring this out now.  Yeah, they knew that.  Perhaps they are. Perhaps they... Yeah. Yeah, right.  I mean, again, I don't want to say anybody is evil or had malicious intent or that these are bad actors running these companies.  They're not. But it's ridiculous that they didn't know this long before these type of public studies are released.

It's been going on for a really long time and we don't know how to fix it.  Like, that's a more embarrassing answer.  And I feel like, I mean, did you guys watch that sort of like Twitter periscope chat this week and how that went like immediately into a dumpster fire?  Like, I feel like I just I just feel like they don't they don't know how to fix it.  And that's the that's the true and and maybe problematic answer.

You know, that's just not going to.  But that's always been that way. In fact, I think you could probably say that's that's that even predates social media.  That's just the way we are built. Conspiracy theories spread farther and faster.  You know, if you say Kennedy was shot by a lone assailant on the grassy knoll, that's so much less interesting than the Russians did it or the mob did it.  And there were 15 shooters.

Actually, during the Academy Awards, HQ gave away twenty five thousand dollars, which is their their largest prize ever.  And the idea was they were going to continue until just one player was left and that player would get all of the twenty five thousand dollars.  This was a bid to get attention right before they raised even more money.  Have any of you done this?  HQ, fifteen million dollars more in their don't think I have venture fund.  It's not I mean, it's it's it's fun, but I don't think it has legs.  Maybe it does.  The biggest benefit beneficiary of HQ is their host, Scott Rogowski, who's now become somewhat of a celebrity.

Transcript:  Oh, God, that was the one.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I didn't like that because I wasn't a I was never a suggested user.  Stop me cold.  Let's see.  Let's see.  We talked a little bit on security now about the largest DDoS attack ever.  First, it was GitHub.  1.3 terabits per second, an amplified memcache attack.  And then OVH and Arbor shortly thereafter, a similar attack UDP port 11,211 of 1.7 terabytes.  And this is all because of a flaw in the memcache protocol, which should never be a lap pointed to the public.  But because it was on many machines that were misconfigured, many, many, many machines that were misconfigured, people were able to send a ping to the memcache and get it to flood the target with a lot of information.  So these amplification attacks are powerful because you don't have to have 1.3 or 1.7 terabytes outbound traffic.  You don't have to have a giant botnet to take over this.  All you have to do is hit these memcache servers enough with small one or two bytes and they'll send out thousands of bytes.  Oh, man, that's brutal.

Transcript:  Our friends at CloudFlare, who are of course sponsors of our shows and longtime friends, point out that really the issue though isn't merely misconfigured memcache.  It is IP spoofing.  And this is why Steve Gibson's been talking about this forever.  If you can fake your IP address, it's very difficult to stop these kinds of attacks.  And really, it's ultimately going to come down to, in my opinion, networks saying, you know, you can't come out of my network with a fake IP address.  And there's no reason for a network to allow outbound UDP traffic either.  So there's a number of things that people could do.  Unfortunately, nobody seems to want to do anything about it.  And these DDoS stacks will probably continue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of...  Well, it's tricky, right? Because IP spoofing is going to, like getting rid of IP spoofing theoretically would basically, it would create some problems with things like VPN, wouldn't it?  Maybe.  If you completely stopped that.

Start time: 6617.86
End time: 6677.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, if you're running a VPN, let me think about that.  Yeah.  The thing is, if you're running a VPN, you're expecting that.  That's an interesting question.  I think it's, well, I don't know.  I'll have to read the blog and we'll see.  I think it's more an issue of networks, internet service providers not allowing IP addresses that don't belong to them to be broadcast out from their networks.  So a VPN, I don't think would be affected by that because you're going out with your IP address to a VPN.  You're tunneling and then going somewhere else.  That makes sense.  It requires network operators to block fake IP addresses coming out of their servers.  If it's not part of my range, it shouldn't come out of my server.  This is a little scary.  I'm more scared about this than artificial intelligence, but it's been going on in China for some time.  Pre-crime.  In China, they're using information that they can gather about people to block crime before it happens.

I'm not worried about ads.  This is what I'm worried about.  Police reports made on mobile apps from home visits.  If it flags anything suspicious like a large purchase of fertilizer, stockpiles of food considered a marker of terrorism like hummus, it notifies police who are expected to respond the same day and act according to what they find.

And one of the things that I've talked to people who are familiar with the culture there, the people in China sometimes embrace this because they prefer order.  They're willing, as long as you don't arrest me, I think this is a good thing.  So this is something for us to pay attention to.  Our desire for law and order.  We have to be very careful that it doesn't outpace our desire for freedom and privacy.  Right?  Sometimes people are so interested in order that they're willing to sacrifice rights.  That's not a good thing.

Start time: 6779.04
End time: 6792.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the primary tool for creating that situation is usually kind of fear, fear of terrorism, fear of things like that, at least in the US.  That's what it seems to be used for.  I mean, that's what we talked about with the whole cracking into the iPhone thing, right?

Start time: 6792.98

And the real problem is it means something completely different in this modern era of big data than it meant 20 years ago.  Governments have so much data.  This is a perfect example that they really can act on this stuff in a way that is very scary.

He he was working for the Marriott Corporation in the United States.  He actually he was only a fourteen dollar an hour job.  He ran social media accounts for Marriott and he was using an official company account to like a post on Twitter from a Tibetan separatist group.  Oh, man.  China complained and got the guy fired.  Marriott fired him on January 14th because Marriott's got business in China.  So it's not only that you can't speak freely in China, you may not be able to speak freely outside of China if the company you work for has some relationship with that.

Transcript:  Yes, I think there is, but I haven't really had an issue with that on Twitter.  On the other hand, I've had issues with people faking me pretending to be you.  That sucks.  I'm like, come on, man.  That's come on, man.

Transcript:  Reddit gets slammed a lot for whatever, the hate sites and Nazi stuff. And then some of it they've let sit there and most of it they've killed.  They've clobbered. It's a challenge. But I have to say, it's all up to you. If you follow great subreddits on Reddit, it is. For me, it's a huge resource. I love it.  And I follow some of the geek subreddit, like the ThinkPad subreddit. There's some fun entertaining ones like NoNoNo, which is videos of people doing stupid things and the results of it.  There's some fun stuff on Reddit. Turn your eyes away from the bad stuff and follow the good stuff and you're going to get a great feed. I really love Reddit.

Transcript:  I found a Gameboy. I found an old Gameboy the other day that I hadn't turned on in a really long time. And I posted it and I put some batteries in and it was working okay. But not that well.  The screen was garbled and stuff. And I posted that to the console repair subreddit and I immediately got like 15 answers of how to fix the thing, which is just amazing.  There's some cool people out there.

Where people just put up the worst diagrams you've ever seen.  I need to subscribe to that.  It's just... you look at these and go, what were they thinking? Really, what were they thinking when they created...  Somebody approved it too. That's the biggest problem.  Somebody spent a lot of energy on it.  Anyway, so great to see you, Ben. Thank you, Ant.
