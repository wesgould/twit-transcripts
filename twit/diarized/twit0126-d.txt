Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I saw Dvorak this past week, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From Modesto, California.  Yes.  You've defected.  You've gone over to the white, the light side.  The white side.  That's a very.  Not the white side.  That was a mistake.  The light side.  I'll ask you about that in a second.  He's on the line from Modesto.  He's sitting on the bed, his childhood bed, the bed he grew up on.  You call that the burning bed, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but I guess I could if I lived on fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also here, Don Risinger.  Hey, Don from CNET.  Mr. Digital Home.  He's got his own URL now.  CNET.com slash digital home.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, it's the digital home dot CNET.com.  Oh, of course.  What was I thinking?  I mean, what are you doing, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What am I nuts?  The digital home dot CNET.com.  Make sure that these in there too.  Yeah, because otherwise you get a digital home.  Yeah, something like that.  We want the digital home.  And also here, John C. Dvorak dot org slash blog.  Hello, John.  Hey there.  How are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Got his almonds.  So apparently macadamia nuts are good for you.  That's what they're telling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm getting so much email because I gave you a hard time for eating.  What were you eating?  You were eating macadamia nuts and.  Cashews.  The two best nuts.  I wasn't saying they weren't flavorful.  No, they are the best.  Because they're the fattiest.  Well, maybe.  I think he thinks they're not good for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello.  Well, you know, the weird thing about cashews and, you know, in Brazil, they grow cashews.  Right.  Cashews are fruit.  Yeah, it's a fruit.  And it's a big it's a weird kind of a nut because it's the seed is outside of the fruit.  It actually hangs from the bottom of the fruit itself.  It's a weird looking thing.  It's a mutated apple.  And it actually does look like that.  And the juice of the cashew, which is called the cashew, which is also drunk, mixed with  a bunch of cashew stuff, is the is the juice from one of the from one of the fruits.  If it gets on you, it did.  It literally turns your skin black.  Great.  And you can't wash it.  It creates permanent stains on anything made out of protein.  Really?  So if you get some on your shirt.  It's permanent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I mean, on your skin, eventually it'll slough it off when you get new skin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's like it's like a temporary tattoo.  You know, it comes off eventually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, that's a good idea.  Cashew tattoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That could be a business, Roger Chang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This stuff is nasty, though.  It is like anything it gets on it.  It stains it permanently.  Who needs henna?  We've got cashew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Cashew tattoo.  I'm thinking a franchise nationwide.  Roger, you and me.  Sure.  Cashew tattoo twins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I visited.  I was in Brazil and I visited something like a 10 acre cashew grove.  That was one tree.  What?  It's a weird tree.  The way it propagates is it gets really big and then the branches you get so heavy they  fall into the ground and they reroute.  Wow.  And so the whole thing just keeps getting bigger and bigger.  But it's not that all it's still attached.  Yeah.  Yeah, they are actually.  And so if you go when you go into the this kind of a forest, you can keep going to get  to the mother tree in the middle, which is huge.  It's kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you chop off the mother tree and have the other parts still live?  Yeah, because they're all rooted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Nature is mysterious in her many ways.  This is our Christmas Eve episode.  And we just did a little nativity story for you.  The mother root.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Leo, just real quick.  I actually called Brazil yesterday on Skype and not on purpose, by the way, but I was  trying to call my buddy and I call up and I got some reason I forgot to put the country  code in.  I guess I put the Brazilian country code in and I call up and I hear hello.  And I was like, I don't think you're my friend.  And I don't think she spoke English either.  And she kept on saying hello.  You apparently done.  So go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  What's that?  Neither do you apparently.  I'm sorry.  That was a cheap shot.  She speaks English.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't even know what to say to that.  She kept on saying hello to me.  And so I tried to say hello.  I was like, you know, is my buddy blah, blah, blah.  And she says something I didn't understand.  And I just I don't know.  I felt bad and I hung up.  But something you probably shouldn't do every now and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the nice thing about Skype, it cost you nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it didn't.  Because I was Skype out.  You know, I call.  You're calling a landline.  Yeah, it dropped out about, I don't know, about two dollars, about 30 seconds.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She could have been offering you sex for all you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She keeps she's going to her friends.  She's got a podcast down there.  She's going to her friends saying, I keep getting this call for one dash one nine three  one one one one nine one oh one.  What is that?  What kind of numbers that you know, you've seen that Skype caller ID.  I guess that was a very inside joke.  Yes, I got it.  You got it.  Yeah, I got both your jokes so far.  Two I've made.  So let me ask you a question.  Fake Steve Jobs really getting sued?  I doubt it. By who?  By Apple.  For what? Have you been following this?  It's actually he's I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he's creating because he's impersonating someone as a false identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know about fake Steve Jobs, right?  He's yes. Yeah.  Dan Lyons is the Forbes senior editor at Forbes who created the fake Steve Jobs  blog at fake Steve dot blog spot dot com.  He's written a book.  He was outed by Brad Stone, who's been on Twitter.  And so everybody knows who he is now, but it's still a great site.  In fact, I hear Steve Jobs even thinks it's pretty funny.  But after the ThinkSecret story, so I guess we should  I'll tell you the ThinkSecret story and then he picked up on it and ran with it.  ThinkSecret is the Apple rumor site.  Apple's been suing for three years, run by a college kid.  Finally, they reach a settlement.  This week, Apple's decided to drop charges.  There's some sort of settlement.  Of course, it's a secret settlement.  But the one thing that we know is true is that the main thing that Apple wanted,  which was that the tipster inside Apple be revealed  because ThinkSecret got a few pretty good guesses won't happen.  So that the tipster is probably his heart's been pounding for three years.  He's probably gets to continue working at Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You may have tipped it off on an anonymous basis.  I mean, by the way, if anybody out there is a tipster,  use anonymous email and back it up with a bunch of anecdotal information  that makes it appear to convince us that you are the real deal.  And we'll, you know, take it for what it's worth.  When I don't think you have to reveal your identity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then it's hard to validate it, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because look, if it's a gossip item, what difference does it make? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  True. Just a rumor.  But look what happened to Brian Lamac Gizmodo  because the Apple stock plummeted.  What was it? Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He made that. What did he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was that in Gadget? Oh, I'm sorry.  It was it was Ryan Block and in Gadget.  What am I saying? Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he said something about the delay of the iPhone or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Apple stock tumbled like, you know, a huge billions.  It cost him billions. It came right back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, hey, stop the presses. It recovered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, think secret, the guy who started it, who was a college kid,  I don't know, at the time, I'm not sure if he still is, is very happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He according to this, got a cash out settlement. They bought him off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would they pay him money? They were suing him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, how much they pay the lawyers.  Yeah. I mean, to go through the court case and have to pay for the lawyers  and all the court face and everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, not even counting the bad publicity that that they wanted

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to get him off the air and they wanted to, you know, so and they did a calculation.  And the cheapest way to do it was to give him some money  and tell him to shut down the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's and he, you know, did the lawyer who represented him said,  this is a victory for the First Amendment.  I don't know if I feel that way about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, my understanding was that maybe the First Amendment  of the Constitution of Venezuela,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which says no Apple rumors shall be allowed to exist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello.  Now, my understanding is that they're already going to that.  There was some ruling made or some law or loophole or something like that,  that Apple probably would have lost anyway.  So that's what my understanding was.  But, you know, whether or not it was.  But either way, I think, yeah, it just made more sense for them to to drop  a few, you know, a few dollars on them and walk away.  Probably what had probably happened was they said, OK, listen,  we'll just buy ThinkSecret and then they probably just close it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's an executive. He actually is a Harvard undergrad, Nick Ciarelli.  And he's an executive editor on the staff of the Harvard Crimson.  So he doesn't have a lot.  He's been doing this since he was 13.  I don't think he has a lot of time anyway.  They sued him when he was a freshman at Harvard, age 19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, something to think about.  Anyway, let's get back to the crux of the of the storyline that you began.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  After that settlement. Fake Steve.  Fake Steve, of course, has some things to say about the settlement.  But then he says he's been meeting with this is this is so convoluted  because it's now Dan Lyons writing his fake Steve, but he's Dan Lyons saying,  OK, yeah, I'm not really Steve.  And Apple has offered me a ThinkSecret type settlement.  I'm weighing an offer from Apple, he says.  So it's a complicated situation.  I want to keep everybody in the loop.  Bottom line is I've received an overture from the mothership  with a mention of a ThinkSecret type settlement.  If I'll stop impersonating dear leader on the Web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So basically, they're buying off their problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's but no, the general focus.  Yeah, the general feeling on the net is this is a parody of a parody  within a parody within an enigma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, there's no way that if he's a Forbes writer,  I can tell you right now that he cannot take a big bunch of cash from Apple  no matter what the reason. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And isn't this I mean, why is this so bad for Apple?  I mean, it if anything, if nothing else, it just kind of solidifies that,  you know, Steve Jobs is this godlike person and everything else.  And I almost think it almost helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course, it shows them to have a little bit of a sense of humor.  Well, but that's just the beginning.  So then now again, I don't know if this, you know, this this here's the drama.  So next posting just got an angry letter from Apple's legal douchebags,  a real letterhead legal letter, PDF attached to an email saying  if we're going to go forward, then we both need to be dealing in good faith.  And part of that is keeping negotiations confidential.  And the post I made causes them to question my sincerity.  And then another update.  Now they're really pissed. Just got another letter saying  in response to my last post about doing things transparently,  he wants to remind me while this course of action is mine to take,  he feels it's his duty to inform me.  Apple's lawyers have identified at least three posts in my archive.  They deem to be actionable.  It goes on and on.  And I think it's a joke.  I think it's a joke. He says the you can't take it.  Where'd he go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they had a call for Roger.  Yeah, no, it's my actual phone.  I'll get it later. Call for Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says he says that that he went to the EFF,  but he says they don't like me either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that would be, you know, now that's now that we can either prove or disprove.  I think it's a joke.  I think the whole thing's a hoax.  It's just a fun. It's more humor.  You know, I don't understand why he's still doing the blog.  We know we know who he is. We know it's a bunch of bull.  You know, why don't you shut it down?  I mean, what's the point? It's pointless.  Do a fake something else. Try something new.  I mean, this is not this is a beating a joke to death.  I mean, this beating a dead horse. I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to send him a note right now. Dan, dear Dan,  call us and tell us what's going on.  See if he has anything to say about it.  I've wanted to get him on the show for a while.  You know, he talked about me in one of his posts.  Steve Jobs, fake Steve Jobs, didn't want doesn't like me.  He called me Leo something less something was squirt.  I can't the squirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't remember what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh? All right.  A is offering special,  special news stories for local television stations,  many of whom have picked it up.  The video news release is about music piracy complete  with exhortations to buy iTunes gift cards and cell phone ringtones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Wow.  A video press release has commercials in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what they do.  These are not press releases. They're news releases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. But how many of those have actual commercials with embedded?  I've never seen one.  I mean, it's just like you want to hear it and why you're at it.  Get yourself an iTunes account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the way this works is they make it look like local news.  And then the local news stations who are too lazy to actually do real news  run these as if their own reporter is doing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think everybody out there is familiar with the with the with the video news

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  release. Holidays are a time for parties and family gatherings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is from the R.A.A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's also a time for stepped up law enforcement raids on illegal CD  duplicators that are costing the entertainment industry billions of dollars  a year. This is so cheap dollars that are going organized crime.  Is that an anchor or is that the person that's this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They couldn't even get a sound booth for a million dollars worth of counterfeit.  This is the R.A.A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a very busy time of year.  He's by the way, we will increase this guy talking is in front of a big poster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Frank Sinatra. I don't know what the subtext.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they reading from cue cards? I mean, what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the sad thing is local news channels run this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it just shows you the state of news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, what you mean to isolate those stations that run this crap  and we should excoriate them and embarrass, humiliate them in public  because that doesn't even sound like a decent report.  I mean, the freelancers out there that are getting paid next to nothing  do better work than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it sounds like it's one of those free weekend flyers  with all the furniture store ads and it's cheesy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you think the recording industry, they got some money.  They got two hundred twenty two million from Jami Thomas.  Spend some money on product, spend a million on product.  Here's some quotes from the piece.  Quote, audio quality on pirated CDs is usually atrocious.  Yeah, I actually I.  Huh? Make sure the music you buy is legitimate.  And then she goes on to talk about cool, innovative ways  to get your favorite music like iTunes and Christmas themed ringtones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, God. Ringtones are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would love to find a list of the stations that have run this.  Folks, if you've seen this, if you've seen this, this junk.  And usually they say our reporter, Leslie Takanawa, has the story.  And then they'll go to the fake news story.  Oh, that's just dirty. So awful.  Roger, you've you've left  mainstream media mainstream.  Well, that's more mainstream than anything else.  ZD, you've got you've said goodbye to.  DLTV, haven't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, at the end of 2007, I am no longer employed by Ziff Davis.  Where are you going?  I'm going to work with Patrick and Jim.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What a surprise.  Yeah. So poor Robert is left holding the bag.  It's how long a shocker.  How long before?  When's Robert coming over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I haven't done it all.  Robert's Robert's.  Job at Ziff Davis is he has a real job.  Yeah, his real job is actually to do HDTV reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so is he going to keep doing DLTV or are they going to shutter it?  What are they going to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they will.  They will continue DLTV.  However, they have not told me explicitly of what they  know, the direction and the style that they intend to go forward with.  Start after starting after CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you doing your own show, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hopefully one day, but for now, I'll be working on Texel and System.  OK, so I will be producing or at least co-producing those.  And hopefully, as the as the months turn into years,  I might be able to get something that that I'd be wanting to do for a while,  which would be like my own sci fi kind of magazine oriented show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that. Do sci fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that would be totally cool.  Chang in space.  Well, I actually I actually I kind of wanted to do it  the way Leonard Nimoy used to do in search of.  Remember, what will you be searching for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's searching for a career, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Search for a career.  I don't know what I want to do when I grow up.  Is that so wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it's great.  And now everybody's working at at Revision three,  except for you and me, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I know that, you know, the thing is that they got so many guys there now.  I want to see how fast they slough through that money.  Yeah, that eight million.  Oh, whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I found I got 15 million.  I was kind of shocked to learn this.  Remember that Will Ferrell site Funny or Die?  They had that one really funny land.  The landlord where his partner's two year old daughter.  But the one that was the one good bit, one good bit.  Turns out they received 15 million in venture funding for creating this YouTube.  You know, the idea was it was a YouTube for real comedy.  One good video and that's it.  There goes the 15 million.  That was it. They're done.  Well, I don't think they've closed the doors.  But have you been there lately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think I've only watched the Will Ferrell.  That's all anybody's watched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And is for you.  I think real comedy is pretty much crap in nowadays anyway.  So I'd much rather watch some person try to be funny on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'd rather watch the piano playing cat.  Really? No, no playing cat.  Oh, that cat's fantastic.  Is it on YouTube?  Yeah, the piano playing cat.  Are you kidding me?  You're the only guy who's not seen it, apparently.  I haven't either.  Well, it's not good to devorek.org slash blog and you'll find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've been. Oh, wait, it was like a year ago.  It cat playing piano.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that it? It's an old one.  Yeah, it's got a little cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's old. It says caused an Internet sensation.  And this article is from April.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what is that Nora practice makes perfect?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Check Nora looks cool as a cucumber as she wows her audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you just run around or does he play a song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, here you go. Here's.  Yeah, she plays a song.  Here's Nora, the piano playing cat.  Ladies and gentlemen, we've really sunk to a new low on this show.  And she's not making us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a cat for God's sake.  How good do you expect it to be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So why is it so why is it so cool if the cat actually plays a song?  I mean, some notes for Mozart or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not music. That's typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It can't even do chopsticks.  If it did chopsticks, that would be awesome.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's pathetic.  OK, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to stick a parakeet on a piano and see how many notes it manages to walk over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the point is, it's got more views than the entire funny or die site combined.  Well, they really haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They really haven't flogged funny or die.  Fifteen million. What are they spending it on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Obviously, not on limos and limos and hookers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, of course. Hey, if I had 15 million.  You, me and Don, we'd be off in Vegas.  Right now.  Speaking of which, I saw Charlie Wilson's war last night.  What was it? What a disappointment.  Well, you have Aaron Sorkin, Mike Nichols directs it.  Aaron Sorkin wrote it.  Tom Hanks.  Yeah, he's not so good at it.  You know, who's good at it is.  What's his name? Philip Seymour Hoffman is very good at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that guy's amazing actor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually, I should say he's a good actor.  He's great. He's a great actor in this.  He does. He's wearing a clown mustache.  That isn't quite believable.  The whole he's got this.  It's like he's wearing a costume.  He might as well have a red nose.  But his acting is good.  It's a bizarre. It's a terrible movie.  Getting all the hype that they've spent huge money making this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you just cost him a few million bucks right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I was very disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was it was it just boring and not interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's boring. It's all about some congressman, Texas congressman.  You couldn't care less about because he likes to draw.  Lee Wilson, Charlie Wilson.  He likes to drink and hang out.  What made me think of it is it starts off in Vegas.  He's in a hot tub and he's surrounded by three naked women.  And a producer is trying to talk to him about making a Dallas  that takes place in Washington, D.C.  He despite the fact he's surrounded by three beautiful naked women  in a hot tub, he can't help but be glued to the TV watching Dan  rather in Afghanistan in a beard.  And it's downhill from that.  Hmm. Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A downhill from that.  Yeah, it's believable. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I want to go see I Am Legend and I'm dying to see that.  Oh, I hated it.  I thought it was the one of the worst things I've ever seen in my life.  You're kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it is it supposed to be a remake of Omega Man?  It's been made seven times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This movie's been made so many.  It's a 1954 book.  It's been made so many times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I hated it.  I just I sat there and I looked over my girlfriend.  She was you know, she I don't think she liked it too much either.  But I was all I want to do is get up and walk out.  And everyone sitting around sitting around me is captivated by it.  And just saying, I don't know, maybe just me.  But I don't know. I just thought it was a little bit of crap.  I'll tell you. That's disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about No Country for Old Men?  Everybody says is. Oh, I loved it.  Yeah, that's the movie to see this holiday season.  It's festive. It's light. It's lively.  Santa Claus is in it, right?  Yeah, it was wonderful. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the last movie I saw was The Golden Compass.  That stunk.  Yes, it was it was the most disjointed fantasy oriented  movie of the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is there any more tech news here before you get off the deep end here reviewing movies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no. Napoleon is especially cognac, which really which is kind of  it's a little better than VSO, but you want an XO cognac.  Those are the ones that are always good.  And they it's a very protected appellation.  So if it says cognac and it says XO, you can pretty much be assured  it's a decent product no matter what brand you buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  See, I love this.  John doesn't want to talk about movies, but you get them started on wine, cognac,  that kind of thing. Alcohol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I have to clear it.  You think so? It says the EU has set a deadline of April 2nd to complete its review.  Wouldn't that be lousy if those stupid Belgians could stop the American enterprise?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Eek. Am I the only one who thinks Microsoft is freaking out right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they remember Microsoft was very worried about this.  They went out and bought some unknown company to compete with Google.  Why is Microsoft care what Google's doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't see it either.  You know, Microsoft should just concentrate on their own business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's ego. It's ego.  I mean, think about it for years and years.  Microsoft was top dog and they like to bully people around.  And also Google walked in underneath their nose.  And and and now it's now it's one of these things where, you know,  now it's a heavyweight fight and they don't like that anymore.  And they like being the only big guy on the block.  And it's not happening anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microsoft after shortly after Google's double click acquisition,  Michael, Microsoft paid twice as much for a quantitative.  And then Yahoo bought right media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's like, you know, with all the money these guys,  some of these companies are accumulating, I expect one of one of two companies  either Google or Cisco to develop an operating system.  Cisco for the PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You sound like you know something, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, there's just been peculiar rumblings about Cisco's  doing some sort of operating system.  And they have the expertise to do it.  I mean, you know, they know how this stuff works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got smart people in there.  Hmm. Gambling ads are going to cost Microsoft, Yahoo and Google  thirty one point five million dollars.  The feds went again, went to said that this suit them saying they took ads,  illegal ads for gambling, actually, the US attorney for eastern Missouri.  There you go.  US attorney Katherine Hannaway.  Hey, you can laugh.  But Rudolph Giuliani was a US attorney once, too.  So the investigation conducted by the eastern Missouri branch,  along with the IRS and the FBI dates to 2000.  They've been doing this for a long time.  Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, taking ads for gambling.  Shocking. I'm shocked.  Microsoft has to pay twenty one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do they got to do? Why are they getting sued?  What difference does it make?  Is it got money?  Yeah, that's the reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello. That's that's that's the prime reason is because they have deep pockets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, look at these guys.  I wonder if it's worth their well, their while to give us 30 million dollars.  You know, this bogus suit by the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a here's a here's a little pork barrel.  Microsoft's paying 21 million,  seven and a half million, of which goes to the International Center  for Missing and Exploited Children.  Does that have anything to do with gambling?  I'm sorry, did I miss something?  It must gamble. I don't know.  Maybe that maybe that's why they're missing there.  Maybe they're lost in Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Their parents sold them off to slavery after they lost all their money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then nine million dollars.  Get ready, because they're going to spend nine million dollars  on public service ads aimed at informing college age and younger folks  that online gambling is illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like what that deal they wrapped up with R.J.  Reynolds and their whole thing.  Tobacco.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, for college age kids, too.  And that doesn't work.  So I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yahoo has to spend four and a half million on public service ads.  So let's see, let's add that up.  Now we're up to 13 and a half million.  Google has to pay three million, which isn't much because you guess.  Guess what? It's guess what Google's daily profit is.  In the billions, 11 million dollars.  So basically this is like three hours.  Can you believe that?  She's. That's not so much as a slap on the wrist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Slap on the wrist.  Typical, you know, just like grabbing some grabbing some easy money  from these big companies because they got so much money, you know,  they can't fight it.  So what are you going to do?  I want to know how they're missing and exploiting kids get that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should set up a charity.  From Live Science comes this interesting story.  Smart drink coasters.  This would be you should cover this in digital home.  Do you see that have a digital pub?  I wish they did.  Be right there.  These are the Centilla coasters.  When you put them on the bar, they form a wireless mesh network.  Oh, brother.  The coasters know when a drink has been placed on top of them  and whether or not that drink is empty and will notify the bartender  if you've run out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's what I want to say when you pull the.  I'm sorry. What happens when you pull the drink off and it's a boy?  This guy's what happens if you drop the glass?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It knows it says, oh, you need a new drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, nice.  The kid can't tell if someone drops a roofie in your drink.  Now, that's that we need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would be so maybe maybe the missing and exploited kids could donate  some of their nine million dollar windfall to that.  You wouldn't.  So the idea is it's written in a Java development environment, by the way.  Wow. So it's going to be slow.  Yeah, they've written some coastal.  There's some coastal libraries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If that guy run out of his drink now, he left an hour ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So basically, he's going to take all his action sequences.  He's known for and all his movies and they're just going to turn him into a video game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He didn't say what kind of games he would create, but something with explosions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we can guess it will suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He said he expects them to mirror his work in film and television.  Like I said, explosions, explosions and car chases  and pirates.  Have you played you must have played rock band, right, Roger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the whole point is that you play it with, you know, that's the band portion of rock band.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. It's totally cabbage patched.  Two thousand eight or seven or whatever.  Yeah. Two thousand seven.  Tickle me, Elmo. All I mean, the thing is, it's interesting is like  how many people actually buy games after they own a Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because they play that Wii sports. That's all they play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Nobody is the answer, really.  I mean, you probably buy Super Mario Galaxy, you know, maybe Mario Party,  because, you know, everyone buys that, I guess, if you're a Nintendo fanboy.  But other than that, no one's buying games for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about Wii Fit?  Would you buy that balance board, do the yoga, do the Wii?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, please. No, there's a lot of good games people buy.  You guys are full of crap.

Transcript:  Yes. At that age, isn't it?  Just now, here's the thing.  Do you think that she that gets good exercise from the Wii sports,  the boxing, the bowling, the tennis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think that's just, you know, I think you get a good shot  at Carpal Tunnels Syndrome playing those games or Tendonitis.  I got Tendonitis playing the bowling game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To prove that they're really working out when they're doing these dorky games,  they go, oh, no, the next day I was sore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what they need?  I'm just waiting for the lawsuits for someone who gets some sort of  repressive stress injury and they can blame it on the Wii.  I was so sore.  There's a settlement waiting to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they did a study.  Researchers at Liverpool, John Moores University and colleagues  in the British Medical Journal writing, they took a bunch of 13 to 15 year old kids,  six boys, five girls.  They played four Wii games, 15 minutes each while wearing monitor devices  to record how much energy they burned.  It adds up to about, get this, if you do all the Wii sports stuff.  About two percent more energy over, you know, a Gameboy.  Two percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's kind of, yeah, that's interesting, Leo,  but that's kind of a specious thing when you start really looking at burning calories,  you can get one of those exercise bikes and you really don't burn that much.  It takes hours and hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I know, I know.  But this is they burned about 60 calories an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's better than eating peanuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. You might burn more calories eating peanuts.  I'm not sure. 60 calories an hour.  You take a walk, you're going to burn three times that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but any game council, nobody's like, I wouldn't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're putting the idea that this, you know, these these sports  make or exercise for the kids, which is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, yeah, I don't know who's pushing that.  But yeah, that's nonsense.  Nintendo. Yeah.  You want to exercise, go outside and run around like a maniac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know. Yeah. Tie a bone around your throat and have the dog play with it.  It'll be all right.  Have you done this, Don?  Well, no, my parents did a long time ago.  They were hoping for something good to happen.  It didn't work. I ran away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tie a bone around your throat and the dog chases you and you go.  OK, this is an interesting form of parenting and explains a lot about it.  It's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's that was actually a pro.  If I'm not mistaken, what Don described is something that you have to have done  to even work at CNET. Oh, well, yeah, it's a rite of passage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is. They tie a bone around your throat.  I think Halsey Halsey Minor used to do that.  Before he left, that was kind of his thing.  You know, Jeff Bezos asks you who would win in a fight, a gorilla.  And Halsey would just tie a bone around your throat.  I used to work for Halsey for one week.  I worked for Halsey.

Transcript:  Well, as a matter of fact, many people don't know what the Queen is.  Serves many ceremonial functions.  Yeah, she does. She does.  He's right. That's why her face is all over the place.  She's there on the money.  She's on the she's even on the Canadian money.  She's posing a lot.  She spends a lot of time posing for pictures.  I'm kind of sad about this.  Chuck Norris is suing a publisher, not for the for what?  Well, it's for a book that he says unfairly exploits his name.  It's the the Chuck Norris lists.  Publisher Penguin published a book of the Chuck Norris mythical facts.  I always thought I always figured Chuck,  you know, like this, wouldn't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It gives the background on this.  I didn't know about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Truth about Chuck dot com.  It's a website's been around at least seven or eight years, I think.  And and it's hysterical.  And I always assumed, well, Chuck Norris must know about this and like it  because it's it's kind of, you know, it's promoting Chuck Norris.  Read some of go to go to truth about Chuck dot com.  You'll see what I'm saying.  Is it the site that's being sued?  No, Penguin compiled 400 facts from the website.  Actually, the author was the guy who runs the site.  And and it's called the truth about Chuck Norris,  400 facts about the world's greatest human.  And he says them.  The lawsuit says, yeah, read some of them.  They're very funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is that word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you haven't you read?  Haven't you guys seen these?  These are great that you really don't follow his career anymore.  No, no, no. It has nothing to do with Chuck Norris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Chuck Norris's tears cure cancer to daddy has never cried.  Yes. Now you're getting the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come on. Give me. I guess it's funny.  It never seemed like somebody with a with a huge sense of humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently not.  I think if somebody write a book about me like that, I'd be very.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Associated Press article trading karate chops for lawyers.  Tough guy actor Chuck Norris is taking on a new book  titled The Truth About Chuck Norris, saying it's a big lie  and he wants to stop its distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Of course it is.  You know, apparently unclear.  All right. They just call it fact.  Chuck Norris facts.  Guns don't kill people. Chuck Norris kills people.  There is no theory of evolution, just a list of animals Chuck Norris allows to live.  Chuck Norris, Chuck Norris does not sleep.  He waits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you know he he's currently suing NBC, claiming law and order  or trademark names for his left and right legs?  I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is when the book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little interesting tidbit at the end of this AP story,  it says Norris has been in more than 20 films.  The actor was a six time undefeated world professional middleweight karate champion  and in 1997 became the first man in the Western Hemisphere  to be awarded the eighth degree black belt grand master in Twyke Taekwondo.  I'm telling you, you don't want to muck with Chuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. When the boogeyman goes to sleep every night, he checks his closet for Chuck Norris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Usually a guy who would have to get the eighth degree belt wouldn't have a sense of humor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. Chuck Norris is the reason Waldo's hiding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, after all, his chief export of his pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anyway, I just I mean, I've I've known about these facts for a long time.  There's a lot of parodies of this.  And I just always assumed that Chuck Norris must know about it and think it's funny.  I mean, why wouldn't you? It's it's very flattering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's possible that he didn't know about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's a busy man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says, according to the lawsuit,  some of the facts in the book are racist, lewd or portray Mr.  Norris as engaged in illegal activities.  Like this, Chuck Norris can charge a cell phone by rubbing it against his beard.  I don't know if that, you know, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the funny thing is, you really can't sue over over, you know, parodies,  satire, humor, things like that.  He doesn't have a leg to stand on in a lawsuit like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even if they're named law or order, either leg wouldn't.  He couldn't stand on that.  So in a man in Chicago, he's now suing the city of Chicago.  He's an attorney, of course, over its anti cell phone bill.  You know, we're very close.  I think about six months off before the bill takes effect in California  and 30 other states nationwide to prevent to make it illegal  to talk on a phone while you're driving.  But it's 2008, isn't it?  Next year. That's what I said about six months.  What did I say? Six months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no, I thought it started at the end of 2008.  Oh, at the end of OK.  I think it's sooner than that.  And no end of like when 2008 swings around that's when soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, but it's been that way.  Yes, let's not compare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's just go on. What's the story in Chicago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been the law for a couple of years.  They've actually raised quite a bit of money.  This guy's suing saying, hey, they should have put some signs up.  It's illegal.  What if you're out of town?  He wants them to return the two million dollars in fines.  He says I agree with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, I've been to Chicago a number of times.  I didn't know they had this law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but as Alderman Bernard Stone points out, we can't put signs  on, you know, for every law.  Every wacko law you should.  It's not a wacko law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Talking on a cell phone while driving.  No, you've been talking on a cell phone while driving for the last 15 years.  And then they change it at the last minute out of the blue in some town  that you only visit once in a while.  Give me a break. Well, you're going to like this then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then I doubt it in the UK, where it's been illegal to talk on a hand  held phone. You can use a hands free, but illegal to talk on handheld phones.  It's 2003. Nobody's paying attention to the law.  So they've decided to up the punishment.  It was it was a fine.  They say about half a million Britons violate the law daily.  The fine was 60 pounds.  They are now increasing it to an unlimited fine, depending on the judge,  up to the judge's discretion and up to two years in jail  for talking on a cell phone or using an MP3 player,  a GPS device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, using a GPS device like them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Two years. The only way to stop it is to make them watch the Queen's Channel.  That's the only way we're going to stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm watching the Queen's Channel.  You can't you can't ticket me.  I don't know.  What do you think is that on the other hand, if you've ever been run into  by somebody on a phone as I have.  People who are on the phone are not very good drivers.  No, no, they're just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's distracting.  Some of them have the double the double whammy.  They're on the phone and they're women drivers.  Oh, God.  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Hey, you know, we have like two women listeners so I can get away with this.  It's actually true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Both of them are offended now.  So now we have one one left.  We have one left.  Please don't leave.  Actually, the Queen has an iPod.  Maybe she listens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She could.  She might have one of her assistants downloaded and sync it onto her iPod daily or weekly.  She could be a secret geek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She is the second richest woman in Britain.  All right, I'm going to wrap this up because it's just not going anywhere.  And everybody wants to everybody wants to go have cognac and eggnog.  Do you put eggnog?  What do you put in your eggnog, John?
