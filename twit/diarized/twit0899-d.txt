So I can see every time you've appeared on our show, by the way,  the database is churning.  So it's been, it's been, uh, it's been a while here.  Let's, let's go back in time.  I can find your first appearance was 2014.  No, that doesn't seem right, but maybe so eight years.  Oh, and look who was on with you.  Neil, I Patel.  I don't know who that other guy is.  Well, a great piece he wrote about, about, okay, let's talk about that.  That was the best piece.  Wasn't it?  Welcome to hell.  Elon.  Uh, I think, I mean, many, many things have been written about Elon Musk, uh,  buying Twitter.  Who would have thought that by the way, six months ago, he fought a tooth and  nail, he did not want to buy Twitter.  Right.  Well, his joke.  Well, he did.  And then, yeah, well, he did breathe like, like for five minutes agreed to it  without any due diligence.  And then almost instantly back in April was writing his lawyer saying, can we  hold off on this, uh, that his excuse then was Putin's going to speak and I don't  want to own Twitter during world war three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think maybe even Elon underestimated, uh, the consequences.  And now that he owns Twitter, it's going to, it's going to get real.  As the kids say, Neil, I, uh, peace.  Welcome to hell.  Elon subtitled you break it, you buy it.  And you have to real good kiddo Twitter is I'm reading Twitter is a disaster  clown car company that is successful despite itself.  And this is the salient point.  And there is no possible way to grow users and revenue without making a  series of enormous compromises that will ultimately destroy your reputation and  possibly cause grievous damage to your other companies.  And that's just the first paragraph.

Transcript:  Read the bit about moderation.

Start time: 458.95
End time: 572.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Cause I think he makes the really excellent point.  People think, oh, and I think Elon thinks based on his immediate actions  that the product of Twitter is code or engineering or even the users.  He, uh, Neil, I says the essential truth of every social network is the product.  The product is content moderation, whether it's YouTube, Facebook, Twitter,  tick tock, the, you have people's posts, but it's how you control it, moderate  it, offer it up to the users.  That's what you're getting from Twitter.  And he says, and every, and this is important.  Everyone hates the people who decide how content moderation works.  It's a no win content moderation is what Twitter makes.  It is the thing that defines the user experience.  It's what YouTube makes.  It's what Instagram makes.  It's what tick tock makes.  They all try to incentivize good stuff, disincentivize bad stuff and  delete the really bad stuff.  Uh, he says, that's the business you're in now, Elon, the longer you fight it or  pretend that you can sell something else, the more Twitter will drag you into the  deepest possible muck of defending indefensible speech.  And if you turn on a dime and accept that growth requires aggressive content  moderation and pushing back against government speech regulations around the  country, and by the way, and he makes this point really important, not just  the U S around the world.  Elon's got big business in China with Tesla.  Is he going to listen to Chinese regulators about Twitter?  He is.  Uh, we'll see how your fans react when you do that.  Anyway, anyhow, any who writes, Neelon, welcome to hell.  This was your idea.  Philip, what do you think?

Start time: 573.30
End time: 584.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, first of all, um, he's right about content moderation.  I've done it, uh, four or five different venues.  This one, I solved it by requiring people to pay.

Start time: 585.22
End time: 592.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, you, you, you nailed it when we are discord, which is for club only.  We don't have to moderate at all.  There are no moderators because people pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 600.82
End time: 611.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't need to do that.  Uh, I don't think I just, the fact that somebody paid seven bucks to be there.  It doesn't have to, it's a one buck wouldn't matter.  It just does a little bit, just a little bit.  Yep.

Start time: 612.18
End time: 693.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  My other thought is, uh, Musk is often compared to Steve jobs.  I hear that a lot.  And, and what the thing about Steve jobs is he was such an, when he was first at  Apple and, and then he got pushed out and then, you know, he was out in the  desert for a long time and he learned a lot.  And by the time he came back to Apple, having, you know, failed at next, uh,  he was a different person and he was, he was brilliant.  And we were all, we're all the benefits of what Steve jobs did after  he learned the big lesson.  Well, Musk hasn't learned anything that I can tell, except, you know, he makes  good products and he knows how to take on big challenges and how to attract  talent and that kind of stuff.  But, but I think twit may be his waterloo.  Twitter plays.  Twitter.  Twitter.  It's already.  I'm the chief to it now.  Go ahead.  I'm sorry.  Well, this, this, this seems insolvable.  What he's up against.  Just that was Neely's point is you can't win.  Yeah.  He's stuck.  Uh, uh, and, uh, it'll be interesting to see if what comes out of this and if he  comes out of it, uh, he's got a lot at stake, all the, all, you know, he may be  the richest guy in the world, but that can go really quickly.

End time: 716.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There was the best, I would say the best, uh, Steve jobs biography is not the Walter  ISIS and although it's worth reading, but the, the one that talks about how Steve  changed after getting kicked out of Apple.  And I'm trying to remember who wrote that, but it was easily the best one.  I have it right.

Start time: 718.59
End time: 746.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Yeah.  Uh, and, and that was, to me, that was the most interesting story was that you  could take a guy who really, he was a jerk and, uh, became somebody much better.  The is called bread slender and Rick Tetz, Tetz, Ellie, who I think were,  weren't they at the Seattle times anyway, becoming Steve jobs, the evolution of a  reckless upstart into a visionary leader.

End time: 756.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even though there, there's still so many stories of him being an  asshole after that.  Oh, he didn't stop.  You know?  Yeah.  Yeah.  And in a way, the more successful one, I guess, in a way, Steve has given

Transcript:  permission to a whole series of famous, uh, terrible leaders, or maybe.  I often wonder this.  They've always been that way.  Edison was an ass.  Henry Ford was the worst, but they didn't have to like myth of genius.  Yeah.  They didn't have Twitter.  We didn't know.  Uh, we really know now about our guys.  So Devendra, um, are you going to leave Twitter?

Start time: 784.94
End time: 844.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I, I've certainly been thinking about it.  I was a Twitter blue subscriber and I'm no longer that because I don't  want to give you a lot of any money.  Um, but this is, this is kind of a sad story.  You know, this whole thing, first of all, I was championing this, uh,  Neil I piece because I feel like it channeled all the rage I'm feeling.  And a lot of other people are feeling I could, I could almost like see him  like writing that with pure rage fuel, uh, because everything he's  saying is absolutely true.  I think normally I would, um, I would kind of embrace watching Elon just  kind of, uh, drown himself in a really bad decision, but at the same time,  I think Twitter is so it is my favorite social network.  It's such an essential part of the way I use the internet.  It is terribly sad to see it kind of go down this way because we're seeing  the effects of what's happening now.  Immediately.  A lot of people who were banned and kicked off were, were kind of  welcomed back onto Twitter.  Is that true?  Cause I know that Cal Rittenhouse has reactivated his account and has been  very public about like the worst of the worst, a murderer who got away with

Start time: 844.56
End time: 847.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  murder and then championed.

Start time: 848.66
End time: 888.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Championed as is a total celebrity, uh, for, for many folks, but also the  rise of hate speech, like incredible rise of hate speech.  Like people are just like out there celebrating this and it, it's sad to  see because I think when I started using the internet in the mid nineties,  like I've always envisioned like having direct access to everything happening  in the world and I feel like Twitter is the most, uh, kind of like most  successful product that can give us that, that can connect me with people  instantly, even if I don't know them.  It is so much more public facing than Facebook or anything else.  And it's, it's going to die.  It's going to die because of one billionaires toilet tweet decision,  basically to, to, to buy this thing.  Like, Oh, wouldn't this be funny?  Um, it's, it's maddening.

Start time: 888.96
End time: 977.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's infuriating.  There was some debate about whether Kanye got his, his account was never kicked off.  He just was silenced.  And it was a temporary ban, temporary suspension.  So I don't know.  And, and Elon says I had nothing to do with that, but Kyle Rittenhouse, by  the way, look at this guy's, uh, this is a terrifying, uh, profile picture of him  with an automatic rifle sitting in a helicopter looking out the door, the open  door, apparently ready to take action against anybody he disagrees with.  And his banner is, uh, him actually shooting out that door with the  American flag behind him.  That is not a guy you want to celebrate.  Uh, not at all.  And, uh, so that's scary.  But I, on the other hand, I have, I'm still a Twitter blue pay payer and I'm,  I'm withholding judgment.  I want to give, I don't know.  I want to give it a chance.  I, I like you.  I don't want to lose Twitter.  I I've left and come back a couple of times because Twitter has always been a  bit of a cesspool, but there is such a value to it.  Uh, as when Queen Elizabeth passed away, her family, normally what was supposed  to happen is the BBC would play somber music and do an announcement.  Uh, then they put an announcement on the palace gates.  No, it was a tweet.  The family tweeted it before the BBC, before anybody.  I mean, that's in a nutshell, kind of.  Twitter's not the town square, but it has, it's, there's, what does it  talk about Twitter that's important?

Start time: 978.32
End time: 1054.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter's a news router.  Um, that's basically the biggest function of it.  I'm not going to leave it.  Um, I'm pleased enough with it there.  The angle on, on Elon, I haven't heard, I haven't read much about yet is that  this is his first acquisition.  You know, he, he kind of built, you know, Tesla from the ground up.  He built, uh, SpaceX, no ground up starling.  No, he acquired both Tesla.  He acquired Tesla.  You have it still.  It's the Tesla we know today.  It was, it wasn't a test that we know today.  And, and I mean, I give a giant hats off to him for the, for the original stuff  that he's done with those, with those companies.  Um, and I agree that he, he kind of bought this thing on a lark, I mean, and,  and got stuck with it and I agree with everything that he says as well.  I think there's the odds are really against them making it work.  I actually wonder whether social media, as we know it now is already kind of stale.  It's pretty damaged, isn't it?  I mean, it's really, it's really old, it's old stuff.  And, and I'm not sure the new stuff that we really want or need is here yet either.  So, um, we're, you know, the older I get, the earlier it seems, and we've only had  the internet in its current form where it's commercial, the commercial internet  since really April 30th of 1995, that's 27 years ago.  What happened on April 30th?

Transcript:  In the pre.  They had an acceptable use policy that AUP, they call it the acceptable use policy.  And, and, and it forbid commercial activity.  There was some commercial activity.  They weren't able to police it or anything, but as soon as that went down,  Amazon explodes, eBay explodes, ISPs everywhere.  You know, it was just, suddenly we had the beginning formation of what we have now.  It's kind of like, you know, we entered the, you know, a geologic era where life  exploded and the Cambrian explosion.  Yeah.  I mean, I remember the dinosaur days of the web.  Yeah.  You remember when you were all microbes, you know, but, but, um, but I, I,  I have to say, I mean, I, I have very mixed feelings about Twitter in a way,  because, um, I was a very active blogger and, um, and an early blogger.  And I had up to 50,000 readers a day on my blog and Twitter came along.  Facebook came along.  It was down to dozens in about a year.  And so you didn't stop.

Transcript:  Hmm.  Yeah.  And, and my companions, if you look at my old blog,  it's still up, uh, it's a slightly different URL, but it's there.  It's preserved.  Um, there's a blog role.  Everybody had a blog role on the right.  It was, it was a social network, but it was a really small one, you know?  And, um, that's right.  Every blog, most of those people are blogs.

Transcript:  So, you know, the funny thing is that that's as, if you could just go to  searls.com that HTML has been there since 1995, you know, it looks like it.  Yeah.  It looks like that's what it is.  I mean, it's the, the art is, is new.  It was drawn by a friend a few years ago, but I think it's weblog.searls.com.  That's the short, short link to it, but there's a blog roll on that.  And most of the people, some of them are still there, but most of them left.  And most of them, um, went to Facebook and Twitter and there's some brilliant  people writing now on Facebook and it's all what I call snow on the water.  It all kind of floats down, hits the water and is gone.  And, and, um, I just think it's a lousy way for people to be smart and  there have to be better ways.  And Twitter fills a, an essential role, I think for, as a news router.  Yeah.  You know, and people call it a cesspool, but you know, I, I follow 5,000  people on Twitter.  I see no politics because they don't respond to any, you know, so, so by not  responding to politics, not playing politics, not doing any political blogging.  I mean, I mean, uh, tweeting, I kind of relieve myself of that stuff.  So it's kind of interesting that way, the way, you know, following works.

Start time: 1257.00
End time: 1293.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And having followers can be a cesspool, right?  Like I think that's the ultimate thing.  And the argument with Twitter was that they just did a bad job with  moderation for a very long time.  Um, but to what you guys were talking about, I think the best response I've  seen to this is so many people saying like, we got to go back to the old ways  of the old web, you know, like rebuild my blog, rebuild my website or something.  Because Twitter fulfilled this like instant gratification, you know, before  you'd make a blog post and maybe occasionally you'd look at your traffic  and be like, oh, 50 people read that today.  That's interesting.  And you move on with your life with Twitter.  It's just like instantly you can see what's happening.  And that was too addictive for too many of us.

Transcript:  Well, blogging has been taken over to some degree by Substack and, and by, by  newsletters in general, but my problem there is that what I love about writing  a blog is that, oh geez, I want to change that.  I can change it with, with Substack or any of the newsletter outfits.  It's already gone out the way it is and you can't go back and correct it.  So that one is sitting in people's mailbox.  So I, but it's, and I kind of, I just hate that it's in yet somebody else's silo  again, you know, Substack is another centralized system and Brian Bellendorf,  who's been a guest a couple of times on, on Floss Weekly, talks about what he  calls minimum viable centralization.  I think that's really the best way to look at it, you know, and maybe we'll  always have that kind of centralization for something.

Transcript:  What about the open source alternatives?  We had Rabel on, on Wednesday on this week in Google, he was Jack  Torsey's boss when Twitter started.  He was the lead engineer on ODO, which is Ev Williams podcast directory  that he shut down to start Twitter.  Rabel talked a lot about the history of Twitter.  In fact, one of the things he told us, you should get them on Floss Weekly.  One of the things he told us is that in the early days, the SSH password for  Twitter was the company name and the year it started on all of Twitter.  So you could get root on anything.  He said they had no, no security at all, but he has started or participating now  in something called Scuttlebutt, which is an open source, there are actually  several open source attempts to create some sort of decentralized social network.  Scuttlebutt.NZ is one of them.

Transcript:  accepted yet, taking a beta testers for some sort of decentralized net.  Jack wisely, before he left as CEO of Twitter, funded that to the tune of  $15 million irrevocably.  So that's enough money for them to keep going, I think, with or without  Elon's support, I doubt Elon even knows about it or cares.  There's also Mastodon and we have a very, I think, a great Mastodon instance  that I actually have some hopes for because ever since Elon bought Twitter in  the last three days, we've had hundreds of new people join.  And I think that's true for all the Mastodon instances.  This is a federated, it's actually not using, there's no Mastodon protocol,  it's using Activity Pub to make a Twitter like clone.  There are other Activity Pub users like Pixel Fed, Pluroma, and you can follow  anybody on any of these servers on any other server, you join one server, ours  is twit.social, and then you can follow anybody else's server.  What about something like that?  That's what Blue Sky is intended to be, is some sort of federated thing.  The one thing that Rabel said was that's missing from Mastodon is portability.  So the way Scuttlebutt works, you have a key, basically a public key, you can  bring anywhere, a private and public key pair that you can bring anywhere and your  entire persona moves there.  Mastodon is a little harder to migrate.  What about that, Doc, as a possible solution?

Transcript:  I've tried Mastodon several times and every time I, I mean, it's great.  Here's the problem.  Every one of us has a pie chart in our life, which is a time that we have.

Start time: 1510.58
End time: 1514.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And is that a pie chart or a bar chart or maybe a line graph?

Start time: 1515.94
End time: 1551.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's a pie chart where we're a quarter of it or to a third of it is  sleep, you know, and the rest of it is, is obligations.  And, and those of us who are already writers and writing, they're obligated  to do things, they have other things they're doing, like I do Floss Weekly.  There are other things I do.  It's like, how, how, how much can we split up our time?  You know, so Twitter actually doesn't take up much of my time.  It's actually, again, it's just something I kind of look at for some stuff.  And if it's there, it's there, it's not, it's not.  Um, uh, Dave Wander just created a new thing called Feedland, which  I advise people to look at.

Start time: 1552.00
End time: 1571.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Um, Dave has always been a pioneer in all of this.  He's a huge pioneer.  Uh, he's a guy we owe, uh, uh, we get a gratitude for, uh, for podcasting,  but he created RSS.  He was the one who added, uh, binary attachments to RSS that made  podcasting possible in 2004.

Start time: 1572.02
End time: 1578.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1578.82
End time: 1617.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he's, he, one of the things Dave does, which is great is he's always  starting little experiments and I've actually participated in quite a, quite a  few of these, I haven't seen Feedland yet.  Let's go see, uh, please sign on.  Oh, of course.  And this is unfortunate, but Dave does this.  With Twitter.  Sign on with Twitter.  But Dave always does that.  He's always easy.  It's easy.  And I'm sure it's easy for him.  It's using OAuth.  So it's fine.  It's yeah, it's an OAuth pack.  Uh, so subscribe to a few feeds to get started.  Okay.  Uh, he just added without me knowing 44 new feeds.  Okay.  That's good.  I'll, I'll, so is this a Twitter?  What is, oh, look, this is a RSS feeds.

Start time: 1618.28
End time: 1622.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's all RSS feeds.  So I follow something called sumi.news.

Start time: 1622.62
End time: 1632.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's very similar.  I wonder if Dave knows about it.  Same idea.  You add RSS feeds, then you have a webpage with stories in it.  So this is interesting.  He's had some really good ones.

Start time: 1632.94
End time: 1674.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's had a little cabal of people working on it.  I'm not working on it, but just sort of testing it out.  I'm one of them.  Um, and, uh, something, I don't think Dave is also like the father of outlining  online and he did OPML, OPML is what this runs on, but when he had some  clinical more, which some of us remember very fondly on the back, back at the  turn of the eighties and nineties, um, that was really the first outliner  that turned into a presentation.  And in some ways, uh, persuasion and PowerPoint knocked it off.  So he's one of the fathers of, of, you know, presentations as we know them as well.  So that's, you know, these, all these, it all kind of fits together.

Transcript:  There's no doubt.  There's a lot of ideas.  Uh, there's a lot of creativity.  But there's, they're all lacking the network effect.  Can you

Start time: 1684.08
End time: 1707.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's a mastodon problem too, right?  Because it's, it's there.  It's been around for a while.  I know pockets of people who are testing it out, but it's not, it's not like at a  global scale in a way that I think is as addictive as Twitter was.  It's also really confusing even like from when you first sign on, like, what am I,  I'm making a name for a specific mastodon in another way, but I could talk to  people on other mastodons what's happening.  This is, this is the problem with scuttlebutt as well.

Start time: 1707.58
End time: 1749.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's even more confusing.  Uh, uh, Twitter works.  That's the problem is that you're making solutions to something that  that's continues to work now if Twitter doesn't work down the road.  And I think people are concerned about that.  I saw Annie Lamott, uh, really I thought of great tweet.  She's the novelist.  She said, I'd miss Twitter so much if for some reason we had to walk away.  My Twitter people are so good, brilliant and funny and the pundits I follow or how  I make sense of the chaos and I'm uplifted by their insight and great humor.  So I'm going to assume we can work this out.  She's not leaving Shonda Rhimes quit though.  A lot of people are quitting.  I'm not quitting.  Um, I think we, I think we all hope it won't become a hellscape.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I thought that quote, you know, that he let's, let's not let it become a hellscape.  Where has he been?  It is a hellscape depending on how you filter it.  Uh, before we leave Elon, I wanted to talk a little bit about his motivation.  Um, I think it was a little bit more than a toilet tweet.  Uh, the, I've been reading a lot of history lately.  I think someone told me that as you get old, you stop reading fiction and you start  reading history to figure out where, where you fit in.  Um, and he, he, the, the princes of the middle ages were always looking for ways  to project power.  Uh, and for like Edward the third, when he conquered Wales was to build these  horrible, ugly castles all the way down the coast or, um, you know, in the, in  the Renaissance you would get a Michelangelo or a Da Vinci to paint your portrait.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Venetians.  Yeah.  Uh, anyway, he's like a modern Prince.  He's the, he's the richest guy in the world.  He's, he's, uh, you know, how do you project your power?  If you're in the digital world, you buy the biggest thing you can get your hand on.  And, and, you know, he, he claims it's too important.  Uh, he wants it because he wants to save the medium to save humanity.  Uh, well, as Neelai points out, he's got a few things to learn.  Anyway, I do think it's, uh, there's a lot of ego is a lot of I've got the money.  I can do it.  I'm going to do it.

Start time: 1853.26
End time: 1885.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I also count that as toilet tweeting though.  Like just surely, oh, this is a good idea.  Like what do I think for many people, your best thinking is done on the toilet.  You know, you're just away from everybody.  You know, it's a shower, but okay.  Yeah.  Whatever works, but that is a good point because, uh, Elon's cars are taking over  the roads, the star link, uh, satellites are destroying our skies, right.  And bad for astronomers and everything.  So yeah, there's the, he, his influence is far reaching and everywhere.  And Twitter just seems like the easiest way to like take over the conversation.

Transcript:  He's not born in the U S so he can't become president.  And you might argue that being the owner of Twitter might be more  powerful than the president.  He is a national security risk.  Yeah.  He is going to face a lot of trouble overseas though.  The EU, China, India, uh, all are going to say, no, no, uh, this is what we, this  is what we want Twitter to be.  And they have some clout because Elon has other businesses.  That's some of Neil's point is that Elon, for instance, the Chinese are very  important to Tesla, they build them there.  They sell a lot of them there.  He says, if the Chinese government says to Elon, you know, we don't want you  banning our propaganda arms.  They won't call them that.  Uh, what is he long going to do?  Is he going to give up his business in China?  No, he's going to cow towel just by the way, just like Apple does.

Start time: 1975.52
End time: 2005.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  They want.  And so watch closely because you'll know that's imminent.  If you start seeing tweets and tick tocks that are in some way insinuating that Taiwan  has always been China, it's always been a part of China.  It's a culturally same thing.  Putin said about Ukraine, right?  It's culturally and, and, and ancestrally a part of the Chinese mainland.  And, you know, we just want to, we just want to bring them back into the fold.  If you start seeing a lot of that on Twitter, uh, then maybe that's the answer.

Transcript:  I think that's the thing.  Most, most people have no clue about, by the way, like I'm not.  I'm no expert on Taiwanese history, but I have gone there a lot because of Computex,  which is a thing that still happens and was a, is a very important, uh, you know, event,  but they do the, the air drills every time we're there.  And it's a terrifying reminder of like, Oh yeah, China could, could at any second,  just be like, you're mine again.  And it would be hell for everybody in Taiwan.  So, well, yeah, worse than that.

Transcript:  Uh, you know, I think in the seventies, the United States ended the mutual support  treaty with Taiwan because it was obvious that we weren't going to send troops and  launch bombs if China invaded Taiwan.  But of late, president Biden has twice now said, Oh no, we'll send troops.  Uh, that's a, so it's more than just something between Taiwan and China.  Oh, absolutely.  That's world war three.  Uh, so that's a terrifying prospect in the U S the question to me is, and this  is the interesting thing you both raised is Elon interested in political power, in  which case he doesn't care if it makes money or is he a businessman first?  And his primary interest is getting that $44 billion back.  Historically, he hasn't been to that great of a businessman, you know?

And I think only decided to complete the deal when it looked like you were going  to go to court and he was going to be forced to, uh, to be deposed and then  there'll be discovery and it was starting to look bad.  Uh, I think you could say he was, he was forced into this purchase, but now  maybe he's, he's kind of recognizing, okay, well, maybe it's not such a bad thing.

Maybe if he is a businessman, polish the turd as best you can, and you'll see a  lot of action in that direction and then IPO and he knows probably in his heart,  I'm not getting my 44 bill, but if he IPOs, by the way, he can maintain control.  If he does what most founders these days do and have super voting shares,  he can have his cake and eat it too.  He could still have Twitter as a personal possession to some degree, but also  Philip, you, I know you're all over the stock market.  That's a lot of what your website PD 30 is all about.

Um, yeah, it's going to be interesting.  I am not quitting Twitter.  I still pay my five bucks to, uh, for Twitter blue.  I will watch with interest.  I will come crossing my fingers at Twitter becomes even better and more useful.  It certainly is useful today.  Uh, that he doesn't, you know, take it down a strange and weird roads.  He's not, it's not looking good so far.  There's a great site by the way.  I just want to mention.  So one of the, there's so many rumors swirling around.  One is, you know, remember he fired.  Parag Agrawal, the, uh, Agrawal, the CEO, he fired the CFO.  He fired the chief counsel and maybe even more, most importantly fired the woman  in charge of trust and safety.  The, uh, there is a rumor floating around.  Uh, we know at least that Agrawal, uh, had a $40 million golden parachute.  The rumor is floating around now that he is claiming that he fired them for cause  and they will deny them, uh, any severance, which would be.  Wow.  There's also rumor going around that there, he wants to fire a lot of  people before November 1st, November 1st is a day after tomorrow, right?  No, Tuesday, Wednesday is a deadline.  That's when stock options are typically offered and he wants to cut that off  and get people out of there.  In order to do that, he's looking to fire people for cause because he's asked  everybody, initially asked them all the coders to print out everything you've  done in the last 30 to 60 days.  Cause I would like to review it.  He brought in Tesla engineers.  We were told again, it's hard to confirm any of this.  I'm so a lot of what I'm saying might just be rumor.  Uh, then he said, no, no, you don't have to print it out.  You can show it on the screen reasonably.  You're not going to be able to look at this code, walk in the door, look at  the code and say, that's good code.  That's bad code, but you could perhaps walk in the door saying, oh, you're  producing, especially in the last 30 to 60 days when everything has been up in  the air, uh, when you're not producing.  And maybe he can use this as a way to fire people for cause and save  himself a pocket of money.  This is a comedy site, Elon code review.com print your code for review by Elon Musk.  Most codes reviewed in GitHub, GitLab, or somewhere online, but that's too efficient.  Why not print out your code and submit the printout by facts for review by  Elon personally, I was curious.  I got to watch the video on this.  They've made, they've made a lot of money.  Uh, it's a Rick roll.  Nevermind.  Ah, they got me.  Uh, get six months free.  No fuss way to review your code, print your code facts.  You can show it again.  I got rid of, uh, asked it facts.  Your pronounce wait for the mailman, send your code to space.  Uh, all code reviews merged after review by Elon Musk or automatically reprinted  and send to space aboard a space X rocket at a price plan only get printed.  And send to space aboard a space X rocket at a price plan.  Get printing today, get six months free.  And by the way, here's some tweets from happy developers.  It used to take me forever to get my code reviewed since Friday.  I've been printing it all out and getting Elon to look at it.  And my God, it's been amazing.  And, oh, you might want to check the pricing.  Um, starters, $15 billion, $44 billion for the tweet level, $120  billion for the enterprise plan.

Transcript:  So it's, uh, oh God, that got really dark.  Very fast.  Uh, let's talk about our fine sponsors.  Cause, uh, uh, you know, these are the people who make this show happen and I am  internally grateful to them, uh, as always for their great support.  Our show today brought to you by my beautiful eight sleep.  And if I am at all coherent today, it is because I had a great night sleep on my  eight sleep eight sleep makes mattresses, but I have, I don't have, I like my  mattress, we have a very nice matter.  So I got the pod, which is a cover that goes over the mattress and it does  something very interesting.  It both heats it and cools it.  Go either way as low as 55 degrees, which is chilly or 110 degrees, which is hot  or anywhere in between.  Why would you want this?  Oh, you do.  Let me trust.  Let me tell you, trust me.  In fact, normally Lisa gets up early.  She's a very early riser.  She likes to get her coffee, go to the, go to the gym, work out, you know, have  some me time.  So she's normally up six o'clock.  I got up about eight.  She was still in bed.  I went and had my coffee.  She was, she didn't get up till nine 30.  I said, what happened?  She slept.  She said, well, I woke up at seven, turned my eight sleep up a couple of degrees,  went back to sleep all cozy, woke up at eight, turn my eight sleep up a little  bit, went back to sleep.  Well, cause she slept an extra three hours and that's what the eight sleep does.  But you know what?  She needed it.  It's her day off.  I'm glad she did.  I'm really glad she did.  Eight sleep is the only sleep technology that dynamically cools and heats each  side of the bed.  So her temperature was different than mine.  She likes to sleep warmer than I do, but it maintains the optimal sleeping  temperature for what your body needs.  It knows the room temperature.  It knows you it's got sensors to notice if you're sleeping well, if you're  tossing and turning to know how deep your sleep is and literally optimizes  the temperature for you.  For instance, I like to start warm.  I get in bed.  It's toasty and cozy, especially in the winter.  Uh, but the eight sleep brings the temperature down slowly because I go  into a deeper sleep as a result.  That deep sleep is so important for your health.  A sufficient deep sleep can reduce the likelihood of Alzheimer's, decrease  the risk of heart disease, lower your blood pressure, yet more than 30%  of Americans struggle with sleep.  I bet you do.  We all do, right?  Feeling hot at night.  One of the primary reasons people don't sleep well, waking up with a sweats.  It's the worst.  In the summer, we had a really bad heat wave.  I had my eight sleep and it did automatically cool me off.  It kept me cool.  I never got hot.  It warms me up in the winter and it cools me off as I sleep so that I have the  optimal sleep clinical data shows eight sleep users experience up to 19% increase  in recovery, up to 32% improvement sleep quality.  And for me, the big one, 34% more deep sleep.  If you sleep an extra half hour of that deep sleep, that sleep, that  cleans the brain, you'll feel so much better.  You will be sharper.  You will feel better.  Everything is just nicer.  Eight sleep.  We have the original pod.  They have actually, we have the pod too.  I think they just launched the next generation, the pod three more accurate  sleep and health tracking, double the sensors.  It is the best sleep experience on the earth.  It's not magic.  It feels like magic.  It's incredible.  Soft, comfortable, warm when you want it cool when you need it.  I can't recommend it more highly.  And I'll tell you, when we went on vacation last week, went to Vegas for a few  nights, I really felt the lack of my eight sleep.  We've had it for a year now.  So I've been through a winter and a summer.  We're going through another winter.  Maybe hotels will start getting eight sleep, eight sleep.com slash twit sleep.  Cozy this fall.  If you're in Australia, sleep cozy this summer, you'll save $150  a check out on the pod.  I apologize.  That was terrible.  Eight sleep currently ships in Australia and the U S and Canada, the UK and select  countries in the EU.  I should say, I really love this.  I it's something you should check out eight sleep.com slash twit.  And when you, if you do, please use that address so they know you saw it here.  Eight sleep.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for supporting the show.  Let's talk about Apple.  Philip Elmer Dewitt's here.  This is the time Apple did two things.  They said on Thursday, their quarterly results came out.

But if, can I ask the, the, uh, tech guys to pull up the chart for, uh, one of the  charts I sent shows what Apple did compared to the other tech companies.  Yeah.

Start time: 3251.00

Transcript:  There you go.  This came from the wall street journal.  Uh, there's meta that lost a quarter of his value in, in one day.  One of my, one of my subscribers who, who, uh, he says, you know, I  should have shorted it the day he changed the name, cause I knew he was  panicking and then I finally shorted it, uh, just before the earnings.  I shorted it at 135 and it went down to 99.  So the guy made a bunch of money betting against this thing.  And, um, you know, uh, look at these steep declines.

Start time: 3290.30
End time: 3301.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What you're seeing is the money pouring out of those other three companies and  into Apple, they needed some place to go.  And, uh, so it was Apple's only Apple's second best one day game in, in  January, they had another big pop.

Start time: 3317.66
End time: 3347.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was after they announced their results.  Yeah.  Wow.  Yeah.  So, but explain to me, cause I do not buy tech stocks, uh, and for good  read, you know, as a journalist, I don't want to have a dog in this hunt.  Um, and I, and I have some interest in the stock market, but I'm not an expert.  Explain to me that the tech companies had a big boon in COVID, right?  They all did great.  Isn't this just somewhat of a correction after this growth?  Are they below where they were before COVID?

Start time: 3374.16
End time: 3397.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  them, you know, execute because they're making a long bet.  Metta is saying, look, we know the social is dying.  They're agreeing with what we said last break.  We know the social is dying.  We think the metaverse is the next big thing and we're going to pour all our  energies into that if they're right.  It's like, it's just a startup.  You're buying low.  What could be the biggest company of 2028?

Start time: 3400.41
End time: 3432.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A couple things.  Jim Kramer was on and literally cried, apologizing for having believed,  having believed in Facebook.  And he said, when I found out how much they were spending on Metta, I thought  there was an adult there that could control this, but they've took,  they're just out of control.  So he, this is, this is an important, this is an influential guy, the most  influential guy on CNBC, which all the investors watch and, and he's saying,  you know, tearfully that I screwed up.

Start time: 3433.48
End time: 3473.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me answer my question.  Cause I have the alphabet stock.  Uh, Valentine's day, 2020, right before the pandemic, they were at their peak  for the last many years of $76 pandemic.  They go down to 53.  They've climbed back.  This was, of course, the pandemic was very, very good to alphabet.  They've dropped since, but they're still well above their pan,  their pre pandemic peak.  They're at $101.  So this is what I say when I, or 90, I'm sorry, 96, 58.  This is what I say when people say, Oh, they're tanking is well, they're just  recovering from what was a big run-up because of COVID.  Right.

Start time: 3474.02
End time: 3490.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true.  That's true.  The, the, what's scary about, uh, Facebook and alphabet is that the, the  cloud numbers are going down.  It looks like, uh, they, they bet on the cloud and the cloud, the investment  in the cloud seems to be Amazon's eating their lunch, right?

Start time: 3491.03
End time: 3492.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is that what's really happening?

Start time: 3492.78

Start time: 3498.05
End time: 3510.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But again, I think you have to look at historic.  Now here's historic five years for Facebook and yeah, they're well below  their peak before the pandemic, which is $214.  They're down to 99, $99.

Start time: 3512.94

Start time: 3523.16
End time: 3528.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they were, it was a Friday morning, I believe.  Okay.  So they're still above.

Start time: 3528.56
End time: 3548.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, okay.  That's interesting.  So they're right at their peak pre-pandemic.  Their peak pre-pandemic was 104.  They're now 103.  So they look at, I mean, this is this big, this devil's mountain here.  It's COVID, right?  But yeah, it was inevitable that this wouldn't last forever.

Start time: 3549.05
End time: 3576.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  And that's, and that's what was impressive about Apple, despite they got pushed up  with COVID as well as everybody else.  And they've managed with, you know, the iPhone sales are down a bit  and services are down a bit, but they've got, they've got so many cylinders going  that, that they, you know, I don't know, it's, it's like printing money.  Can we show another chart, uh, that I offered?  It was the mountain of cash.

Start time: 3576.98
End time: 3579.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have as much cash as they've ever had now, right?

Start time: 3581.31
End time: 3596.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Uh, no.  Oh no.  They've been, they've been, uh, they made a commitment.  Remember in 2016, they buy back stock, which Trump was going to let them repatriate  all the cash that they had overseas.  For all that, all that tax bill.

Start time: 3596.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep.

Start time: 3596.81
End time: 3615.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So they started bringing their cash back and, uh, buying it is they're all,  everybody who works for Apple and especially the chief, uh, people have a lot of  stock and if they got dividends, they'd have to pay taxes on it.  But if they buy back stock, they, they don't pay taxes.

Start time: 3616.12
End time: 3628.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I should point out some say, I don't know, again, I plead ignorance that  buying back stock is in a way inflating the stock because you're reducing  the pool of shares out.  No, it's the opposite.

Start time: 3628.88
End time: 3644.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the opposite.  It's making each share of stock represent a larger part of the company.  It's deflation, I guess.  Uh, we end up with more valuable stock.  Okay.  If they, if they buy it back.  So it doesn't make that much.  Let me put it this way.

Start time: 3645.18
End time: 3649.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're artificially improving your stock price by buying back stock.  That's right.

Start time: 3649.76
End time: 3682.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.  And the, you know, the argument is if you have all this money, can't you find  something better to do with it?  Invested in new products and do some research, something.  And IBM made the mistake of rather than investing in the future, buying  back their stock and it hurt them.  Uh, they, you know, their shadow, their original shelf sells.  Apple, they've got some very smart people, uh, smart money people managing this.  And I have to laugh when I watch the, the analysts, you know, second guessing  Tim Cook, they have no idea what he's.

Start time: 3682.65
End time: 3686.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  Uh, missing by the way, in the, in this chart of companies is Microsoft.  And I just, I was peeking at their earnings this week and they also took a  hit, but not, not as badly as everybody else.  They kind of went halfway because, uh, Apple, Apple gain, right.  But Microsoft took a smaller hit than most of these other pre pandemic

Start time: 3704.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But look what's happened in sense since Satya Nadella and the focus on Azure and  the cloud, which is I think been a very smart move in pandemic.  Yeah.  They're down a little bit now.  There's, you know, there's a little bit of a recovery.

Start time: 3770.76
End time: 3793.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It gets hit periodically.  Yeah.  It gets hit worse.  Like Microsoft was a smoother curve than this.  Um, I can't really understand it, but it, but it's like the people fall out of love  with Apple or they find it's, you know, the, the, I'll tell you what it is.  Apple is doomed.  I tell you what it is.

Start time: 3793.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, I should, behind the scenes, Philip asked me to join your crowd.  You have some sort of broad thing you do.  And I didn't understand that they were all Apple investors.  So I'm joining and I'm going, oh, you know, there's no way this company has a few.  And they're like, what are you talking about?  And, uh, I was really the cheese in their gruel, but, uh, I understand.

Transcript:  Uh, but I understand that what from the outside happens periodically.  And I'm the, I'm the poster boy for this as you go, well, they've saturated.  They couldn't possibly find anywhere else to grow.  There's no, and they consistently make me wrong.  Now they've done it with services, right?  They, you're right.  They can't sell any more iPhones.  They've, they've that's, they're going to sell the same number every year from now on,  but they're making money in services.  This, this quarter though, service is not so hot.

Start time: 3855.18
End time: 3861.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3861.60
End time: 3866.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 3866.86
End time: 3889.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have a, except in the U S they have a, a small market share everywhere else in the  company.  Right.  So there's potential.  Yeah.  There's space to grow and you know, the watches it's unbelievable.  You know, I was in a hoop shoot with girls and boys, uh, six to 13 and half the girls  had Apple watches.  Where's that at?

Start time: 3889.98
End time: 3918.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's well, that's the trick for Apple, right?  They've got to find new product categories because I mean, yeah, okay.  There's growth potential and China kind of saved their bacon for the last few years  because suddenly that market took off.  But at some point you sell an iPhone to everybody who's ever going to buy an iPhone.  You're not going to have that same kind of growth.  You want to find the next big thing.  And it turned out watches, which at first were really kind of laggard has, has turned  out pretty well for them.  Notice I'm wearing the $800 ultra.

Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  Yeah. I mean, I, I'm not reviewing phones and stuff anymore, but certainly once I  started with smartphones, like the Apple ecosystem made the most sense.  iPad was always the best, like, oh, forget about Android tablets.  Oh my God.  For the past decade.  Um, if you wanted anything decent, the Apple ecosystem made the most sense.  And now I can imagine why, uh, parents would be buying young kids, Apple watches.  Uh, my daughter is four now, but when she's six or seven, when she's going to  school, having a lifeline to her, you know, being able to see where she is, that  is something a lot of people would really be interested in having.  So I can imagine that's being super successful.  I'm also getting more into like car tech and stuff these days.  And, uh, I can clearly see like why there have been all those rumors about Apple  and car stuff, because that is a whole platform where Apple, um, is basically  partnering with companies now, but having a total solution or having something with  more of the Apple branding on it, that would also be another huge hit for them.  So yeah, I'm in the ecosystem and yeah, we'll see how far it goes.  So they do need another product, right?

EU can get stuff done.  Uh, Congress, it turns out cannot.  That thing died.  I have to add one theory I have about Facebook.  Um, you know, the next product that we're supposed to get, according to  Bloomberg, it's coming in the spring is, are these goggles.  I have a, I have a very hard time seeing goggles as an Apple product.  It just doesn't seem to have the mass market.  Well, I felt that way about the car too.

Um, the bet on that market seems weird and maybe out of place, but the idea  of having maybe something you slip on or maybe even your own current glasses  that could extend your displays, maybe when you're actually sitting at your  own desk, that is a really interesting idea.  Like right now, it's hard to do, but it does seem like the quest pro is doing it pretty well.  This is, this is like a five, 10 year problem.  Uh, but the stuff I've seen, like the magic leap to stuff and even a bit of the  HoloLens too, like it can be magical.  The question is, who is it for?  Will people actually want this?  Um, it still seems more like of an industrial trend, like not really what  Apple tends to do, like they are a former consumer focus, but I could, I  could see it being a thing eventually, you know, at least for some people.  Yeah.

The reviews of the people who actually went in that space where they don't have  legs and you bump into horizon world and they're mostly kids that, Oh, that looked  like such a loser.  Yeah.

I remember I really wanted to watch the trailer for Mortal Kombat in like,  before that movie came out and I had to enter this long website, not the  correct, like not a branded domain, domain name.  It was like a dash tilde, like 10, 30 seconds later, once I was done  entering that URL, I had to wait 30 minutes for the 1996 grade web video to  load too.  So this stuff is really bad, you know, until, until like there is a shift and  there, there's like something that kind of makes a big public hit.

So I haven't seen like the way normal people have using it, have used it.  There is potential there.  Like when I'm, I'm living outside of Atlanta now, I'm not near my normal  coworkers to be able to hop into virtual space and just like have a meeting with  people could be useful.  Um, I don't know if you guys have seen some of the footage from that, but I was  also in a space where Zuckerberg's avatar appeared right next to me.  And, uh, it was, it was, it was a very weird thing where it was like, oh, when  people see this video, it's like, I'm sitting next to Mark Zuckerberg.  I should probably be really chill right now.  I should probably not to like, don't stare too much because it did feel like I was  like, gotta be cool.  Got to be cool.  Mark Zuckerberg is right there.  Um, if you look at playback of that video, my avatar is just doing crazy wild  stuff because they're tech for managing my arms and everything just didn't work  very well.  So I both see the potential in it.  It's clearly early days, like it's early days and even they can't make it work  when you're sitting next to Mark Zuckerberg.  Wait, I gotta find this video.

Transcript:  I want to see the video of that.  That's well, maybe better just to imagine it.  Yeah.  I have to say, have it, I have the quest pro, uh, and I, you know, no one should  spend 1600 bucks on this product.  That's not what I would say at all.  I mean, no review really should ever say this is a worthwhile thing, but I  want to give VR a chance.  I want to, you know, I bought the first Oculus Rift on Kickstarter and then, uh,  you know, I got HTC five.  It's never, it's always been a cool demo that you lose interest within a day or two.  And I'm, and I don't see anything that changed my mind on this, but it's pretty  amazing.  I don't think I'd want to be in a team's meeting for more than 10 minutes on this  thing.  Sure.  Sure.  Yeah.  That's part of the problem.  I mean, we got a long way to go.  There's a, I've talked about this before.  There's a game called Richie's plank, which is just, it's very simple.  You go up in an elevator, the door opens, you're at the 80th floor.  You look down and there's a little thin plank and you're supposed to walk out  along it.  Now I know in my brain that I am in my living room.  I'm not going anywhere.  I could, my body said, no, no, no, you're not going.  No, no.  And my brain said, okay, fine.  I could not walk out on that plank.  Much like you thought you were sitting to Mark Zuckerberg next to Mark.

Transcript:  but I've, you know, so I've been covering VR stuff since like the consumer stuff  has launched too, and I did, um, Sundance has just some really good work in terms  of getting the, an experience of the festival in VR with your headsets and  you could put that on.  You can go look at some VR, like, um, like VR projects that people have created.  And normally you'd have to go to physical space and put on a VR headset to do that.  Why shouldn't you just be able to do that?  You know, from your own home, there are VR chats and stuff where you could go  actually congregate and talk with other people.  It gave me a sense of community that I really have missed from not being able  to go to film festivals and things like that.  Um, maybe conversely South by kind of did the same thing and their VR, uh,  interface was a ghost town.  It felt very lonely because I was there just staring at these, this like towering  virtual Austin by myself and there was nobody with me.  So there, there are like, there's like costs and, you know, costs and  consequences of going VR in this way.  But I wanted to say, we really need to separate the idea of AR and the idea of  VR and what these two things can actually mean.  Cause the pass through in the quest pro looks really good.  Like it does, like you can actually see, like see your desk.  And I'm imagining like maybe, maybe someday if I just want to throw up a 50 inch  or 70 inch video above my monitor, uh, when we're watching the Apple live stream  or something, um, I'd love to be able to do that.  And that's weird corner window with the quest pro.

So they're transparent and clear, but they've created a way to black out  what you're seeing.  So they can, it can like, it's almost like a cloud enveloping your vision and  just blacking out the real world to like give the virtual objects more, more of a  focus, but in a way it was almost like semi VR when it totally blacks out an area.  And that just feels like an interesting space, like being, being able to hop  between an AR and VR like experience could be cool, but it's not for everybody.  It's not going to be a thing anytime soon, but these companies are investing  because it's going to be something you don't ignore the internet in 1996.  When it's terrible.

John Heilman, who went on to become a big political reporter, came to time and said,  he could give us a cover story on this thing that Steve Jobs is going to be the next big  thing.  And they sent me up to New Hampshire to check it out, to kick the tires.  And I went to the, I went to their headquarters and I took a little ride around the  thing and I heard the pitch was their pitch was we're going to solve China's problem.  They all, everybody in China is going to want a car and it's going to destroy the  planet.  We'll give them segues, but at the price, it just didn't make sense.

You know, when, when the iPhone came out, my, my wife, who's like a not a tech  person at all, very retro about everything, took one look at the iPhone and said this,  I can work with that and, and got one of the first ones.  That was a hint right there.  And, and I don't think Apple, I think Apple likes to make things that are  inventions that mother necessity.  You take one look at it and say, I can use that.  And that's what we don't, we don't have that with the VR headsets yet.  Maybe Apple will make one where you get, you'll take one look at it and it's  like, oh, I gotta have that.  But I can't imagine that, you know, but I remember being at one of Esther  Dyson's things a thousand years ago, back in the, in the, in the pre Cambrian times.  Um, when she said, nobody's going to write on glass.  Well, what was she wrong?  No.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But I mean, she's, you know, she's right about a lot of other things, but that was,  you know, I want to say something.  We didn't know the thing about Apple though, which is that, um, you look at  point of point of sale, point of purchase things, I go through airports and there  are restaurants that have easels with iPads in them, you know, Apple's doing  hugely well in business with iPads and, and they're, and they're, and they're,  you know, there are lots of different Android pads, but there's only one iPad  and there's stuff being written for iPads.  And you think about, um, Microsoft, you know, they just made the operating  system, they didn't make the hardware.  They didn't want to do vertical integration and Apple's doing it brilliantly.  And I'm just, you know, that may be a saturated market at this point, but I  think Apple's probably doing better in business than they ever did before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hard to tell like when something will take off, you know, too, because I,  you remember this Leo, the early criticisms of the first iPhone, I think  we're really good at it.  It couldn't make much money for an, it couldn't copy and paste.  Uh, it was an edge phone when three phones were coming out.  It wasn't three G.  Um, I remember that year technology review, like put on the front cover, the,  the Helio ocean, which was a phone I ended up buying.  Remember that was the one that like it flipped two ways.  It flipped a vertically and horizontally.  And it was a beautiful, beautiful phone is three G.  It had, it had so many of the features of the iPhone, but it didn't have a  touchscreen, it didn't have like a, you know, even the first iPhone didn't have  an app store, right?  Like that was a whole thing.  There's the, there's the,  Oh, this was like the sidekick.  I bought a side.  It was like the site, but it also flips up vertically for the number pad.  It's so satisfying.  Like, I think that was the best slider phone ever made.  It's still in a pocket here, but yeah, we looking at the first iPhone had so  many issues by the next year.  Most of those things were ironed out.  Like Apple started to see like, Oh, we can't just rely on web apps.  We need apps and we need a centralized app store.  We need three G and Apple learned cause even Apple didn't have that at the  beginning.  Um, I just reviewed the surface pro nine with LTE and talk about, I called it a  lie, but talk about a company that has been hammering this idea, tablets as  PCs, tablets as your laptop for 10 years.  And I don't think really making it happen.  You know, like the sales had been okay.  Like it took a year.  It took a couple of years, but they started making billions in revenue from  surfaces, but you only ever really see those things on TV when a show, you know,  has a merchandising deal with Microsoft.

I don't want to have a kickstand on my knee.  I want to have a stable surface.  And also like laptops have gotten so light and so, you know, uh, so easy to  use where the idea of having a tablet PC just doesn't, there's no real wind to  it, but Microsoft is still doing it.

Transcript:  So this also shows how hard it is.  I mean, Esther Dyson, that makes perfect sense.  Nobody wants to write on glass.  I think she was right, but there's so many other things.  It's so hard.  This is why it's so hard as a pundit, all of us to, to, to know if something is  going to be the next big thing or not.  It's very hard to know.  All I can do is like tell you all, but they do.  Right.  Yeah.  I thought QWERTY would be dead by now.  This is, this is the worst.  John C.  Dvorak famously wrote a column saying, nobody wants to use a mouse.

Transcript:  Nobody wants to use a mouse.  I remember that.  Yeah.  Um, but also like, I remember the Dvorak like pundits too, were like, ah, this  is clearly better.  You know?  Um, it's hard to predict consumer usability.  What I can say, like from my reporting is if I put something on and I'm like,  that's cool, that's interesting.  I could potentially see how that's useful.  Like that's all I can do.  That's all I can convey.  So like the magic leap, nobody is taking magic leap seriously now, but that  headset is interesting on the industrial level.  Who knows like where that tech is going to go from there?  I just, I think it's cool.

The Dvorak keyboard is an old school keyboard designed, not like QWERTY, but  designed to be more efficient.  Apple just added the Dvorak keyboard to its iPhone lineup in iOS 16.  Oh, wow.  So, and you know who loves it?  Steve Wozniak.  Who knew?  Steve Wozniak is a Dvorak keyboard fanatic.  He said, he said, he said, thank you very much, Apple.  What I liked most about Dvorak then was the feeling of using  less energy with your fingers.

You better send, you better send an ambulance.  And it turns out the guy was just on the six flags roller coaster.  Right.  All they have to do is say, is it a six flags?  Oh, it's a roller coaster.

Right.  So 10 years ago, I was like, USB-C is right there.  Everyone is going to be moving to USB-C.  I don't know why Apple's doing this other thing.  Now they're kind of forced to do it.  I think the lightning connector is kind of, uh, at least for me and my  phone's kind of a disaster because I don't know if it's my pockets or what,  but there's always like a ton of lint that gets in there where that's right.  Lint gets in there and my, the connection with the cable is always a little  finicky.  So now on my, on my, in my car with car plate, no matter which cable I use, if  the phone shifts just a little bit, I lose my car play entirely because of the  way lightning is constructed.  So yeah, get rid of it.  USB-C is at least a little stronger.  I think.  Yeah.

Your, your point is interesting doc, because actually that's what Alex Lindsay  on Macbreak Weekly says all the time is you don't want government to get involved  in mandating user interface features, but at the same time, I, I argue, and  I'm not, I don't disagree with that.  I mean, the government's the last people.  It should be specifying tech specs, but at the same time, there is a benefit.  Isn't there to having, remember when laptops, every one of them had a proprietary  charger that was awful.  Yeah, it was horrible.  Should it, but the market solved that, I guess.

Start time: 6269.44
End time: 6289.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sort of like USB-C itself is a, is a messy standard.  And a lot of people have written about that, like different voltages.  It's hard to tell like, well, my laptop charge on this phone charger, that's all  unclear.  So USB-C is not a huge win, but I think overall like, okay, I can plug my phone  into this thing.  Let's see if it charges.  Like at the very least I could do that, you know, and that's better than  lightning and everything.

Transcript:  I had a caller on the radio show asking that perfectly legitimate question.  He says, I bought a, a dongle, you know, a lot of ports on it and it had a little  tail.  He says, I can't reach the back of my computer with his tail.  So I'm going to get a USB-C extender, but how do I know if the USB-C extender will  do all the things the dongle will do?  And I said, well, in theory there should be a silk screen logo that tells you what  it does, but nobody does that.  So the standard calls for it, but nobody adheres to the standard, I guess.  And so yeah, you don't know.  And, and, and it's, and it's not just will it carry data.  It's well, what speed is it Thunderbolt 4, Thunderbolt 3, USB 2.1, USB 2.  Does it charge?  Does it do video?  What does it do?  I don't know.  No one could tell.  Just plug it in.  That's your solution.

Transcript:  You mean you're, oh, your headset.  Oh, good.  Okay.  Yeah.  My segue is down to zero.  I'll tell you.  This Week in Tech brought to you today by ExpressVPN.  What if there was someone out there who kept a log of all the things you did  online, like you don't even have to show them your internet history they already know.  Well, guess what?  Yeah, that's exactly what's happening.  If you don't use ExpressVPN, your internet service provider, not only does it, it's legal.  They're allowed to log every website you've ever visited.  And it is also allowed, in fact, legal to sell that data to anyone, to marketers.  Anyone will pay.  That's just one of many reasons why ExpressVPN is a must.  Even if you're at home, ExpressVPN reroutes your internet connection through their secure  servers.  So it's scrambled the minute it comes out the back of your computer.  Your internet service provider can't see, can't log what you do online.  They don't see anything but random noise.  Now, this brings up an important question.  Well, if I'm routing all my data through a VPN, doesn't that just mean the VPN can see  what I'm doing?  Can't they do the same thing and log my data?  You're right.  Many VPNs claim to have a no log policy, but they've been caught logging customer activity.  Even worse, free VPNs, how do you think they pay for that server?  They're selling everything they can.  But I love ExpressVPN because they don't.  It's in their privacy policy.  We don't log.  We know they don't log.  They go the extra mile not to log.  We know they don't log because from time to time, they're not logged.  We know they don't log because from time to time, it's happened many times, especially  in countries, authoritarian countries, where they don't need a warrant.  They'll just come.  They happen in Turkey.  They seize the server.  No knock.  Just come in, take the server.  There's never anything on it.  They're frustrated every single time.  And that's because ExpressVPN goes the extra mile to really protect your privacy.  They use something they designed called Trusted Server.  In fact, they were the first major VPN provider to engineer all their VPN servers, these  Trusted Servers, to run in RAM only.  They're running completely in RAM.  When you open the VPN connection, it spins up the Trusted Server in RAM.  It's sandboxed in RAM, so it can't write to the drive.  And when you close the server, it goes away.  It's yours and yours alone.  No one else is using it and it goes away and there's no trace left.  Nothing left.  Furthermore, they use a custom Debian install that automatically wipes the entire  drive every reboot and they do that every single day.  So even if somehow they were able to write to the drive, there'd be nothing left the  next day.  It is impossible for their VPN servers to store any data, including logs of any  ExpressVPN customer.  So your privacy is absolutely protected.  They know that's their business.  You don't even have to take my word or ExpressVPN's word for this.  They're so confident.  They know they do this.  They've actually had PricewaterhouseCoopers, one of the biggest assurance  companies in the world, audit it and PricewaterhouseCoopers said,  no, you're right.  Trusted Server works as explained.  With their privacy policy is absolutely 100% adhere to.  They do not log.  That's why CNET, Wired, TechRadar, countless others, RaidExpressVPN, number  one, it's why I use it.  It's the only VPN I use.  It's the only one you should use.  Stop letting people log what you do online.  Start watching content without any geographic restrictions.

Like we're not as cool as like some of the other PC hardware folks.  But once I saw that was coming, I was like, okay, well, I have a 7,150  watt power supply right now.  That's probably not going to be enough.  And also I was rebuilding my system for the new AMD chips as well.  So I was doing this whole rebuild.  I was like, got to get at least a thousand Watts.  What's that fine.  That was fine.  Like setting that whole thing up.  The 40 90 required four, four of the power for, and we've heard from some  sources that these melt sometimes the adapter they're using because it's just  so much power coming out of that thing.  For a couple of people has melted.  That's impressive.  Newer power.  If you melted your powers, it's too much.  It's, it feels like you're, you're, uh, you know, dock in back to the future.  It just feels like a crazy thing.  I don't, I don't know if I should be plugging any of these things in because,  uh, this, first of all, this graphics card is so big.  It's almost as wide as my entire case.  Uh, it's, it's just a crazy experience.  If you have a newer power supply, you can use one cable and actually just  learned my modular power supply has like, I can buy an extra cable to kind of do  it for the power supply standards.

I'm sure you'll be able to do that.  I'm sure you'll be able to do that.  I'm sure you'll be able to do that.  I'm sure you'll be able to do that.  It was so cute.  It was so fun.  Wired Magazine in their ideas section.  And I thought I've got two senior statesmen of the technology industry here.  Three, if you include me.  Now that we got rid of the kid, we could talk.  I want to talk about this.  Doc Searls, Philip Elmer DeWitt.  I thought this was a really interesting article that really pinpoints, I think, a larger problem  in the tech industry.  Oh, now I have to, by the way, here's another problem.  I've got to log in.  Okay.  I should have done this beforehand.  But the premise is when you have an entire tech industry set up along the notion that  in order to make it, you have to raise money with VC companies who then are going to put  a lot of pressure on you to make an exit, that maybe ultimately this isn't the best  way to run a company.  And it kind of got me thinking not just about that and tech companies, but companies in  general that are motivated, that feel like their business is to make money for the stakeholders,  not to serve customers.  Now that's not a problem when those two goals are aligned.  But if they're not, and sometimes they're not, then it's bad for customers.  It's a bad experience.  The author of this, actually authors, there's three people, Pia Mancini, who's the CEO and  co-founder at Open Collective and chair of the Democracy Earth Foundation.  That gives you an idea of where we're going with this.  Alana Irving, an open source developer who also builds tools for communities for radical  participation and cooperation.  And Nathan Hewitt, who's a New York City based fiscal sponsorship professional, governance  nerd, local activist, and ambient musician, all three I think very progressive, say startups  find themselves stuck between a rock and a hard place.  They need funding to make something special.  But their only options are infinite growth or to escape, to sell.  The options for selling, also known as exiting, are limited.  Companies can either go public via an IPO or work to be purchased by another company  through an acquisition.  In both cases, if that's your target, the company's at risk of losing focus and being  beholden to stakeholders that do not include the communities served.  They propose, and Open Collective is behind this, a different idea where essentially the  exit is you sell to your customers.  So the example here with Twitter would be instead of selling to the richest man in the  world, what if Twitter somehow could figure out a way to sell it to the users and then  be responsible for serving the users, not the financial markets?  What do you think, Doc?

Transcript:  The first thing that jumps back to me with is I was at a party in like 1999 and there  was this guy who was a young entrepreneur and he said, and he had, I asked him what  he was doing.  He said, Ivan, we're an arms merchant to the portals industry back when portals were a  thing.  And I said, that's an industry?  And I asked him a bunch of tough questions.  I finally asked, how are sales?  And he said, they're great.  And he just closed their second round of financing for $25 million.  And even though I already knew this, what came across to me is that, wow, every company  has two markets, one for its goods and services and the other for itself.  And what happened is that this happened in Silicon Valley for decades, where the second  one where the value of the company itself overcomes the value of whatever the company's  goods and services are.  So that's one thing that just sort of sticks in my mind about this.  Another is that there's there was this state.  I mean, I don't think most investors want necessarily you to go straight to exit, although  often you get that question.  What's your exit?  You know, like, I don't have an exit.  I just want to grow the thing.  Is it?  But there are these stages that companies go through, which are like new, hot and big,  and they're very different.  And I think most of the time when you're talking about exit, it's when things are not going  that well.  So I wonder, Philip, is that true?  If you look for the like a word cloud where exit suddenly gets really big, is it not when  companies are in trouble?

Start time: 7191.50
End time: 7253.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't think it's necessarily that it is.  I agree that it's not a good situation because if you're aiming for an exit strategy, well,  if an IPO, at least the product continues, if you're looking to be acquired, often the  product disappears.  They're buying the IP or they're buying the talent.  So it's very, very far removed from serving the users.  I hate to keep going back to Apple, but that's what I know about.  One of the one of the things that made it great was they're focused on the user experience.  They made an effort to make it make this stuff relatively easy to use.  They had they had what it was, what your experience was going to be like as part of their  design strategy.  I think they've gotten away from that.  The iPhone is incredibly complicated now and has a much higher learning curve than it did.  But at least they were initially focused on that.  Now they're more about money.

Start time: 7256.78
End time: 7329.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead, Doc.  Thinking about your premise that the exit to sale is always a sign of a company not  doing well. I'm thinking about some of the big exits we know of YouTube selling to Google.  That probably was necessary.  You couldn't succeed as a small company because they're going to get sued out of  existence. Maybe not WhatsApp, which was a tiny company selling to Facebook or Instagram  for a billion dollars to Facebook.  Again, tiny companies probably very glad to get the big check.  Here's the counter example, though.  This is more recent.  Adobe just bought Figma for 20 billion dollars.  Figma was not suffering.  Figma was about to kill Adobe.  Now there's always I'm sure the founders had reasons.  Yeah.  You know, but the reason wasn't, oh, God, we're in trouble.  The reason probably was more like 20 billion six comma club.  It was so much money that they couldn't say no.  And I think that happens, too.  So it isn't an exit.  And now I don't think Figma was built to be acquired, by the way.  I doubt very much it was built to be acquired.  I don't know what their plans were.

Start time: 7331.36
End time: 7353.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they certainly had a big payday.  It's just a sense that I had.  I don't know.  I mean, there's plenty of examples of all these things.  And of course, I've dealt over the years with a lot of startups  because I kind of like push along new ideas that some people pick up on them.  Most of them fail.  And they're always looking for an exit before they hit the ground.  Oh, so you have a lot of experience with that.

Transcript:  No, exactly.  It's when there's not an IPO, it's like, well, maybe there's, you know,  you know, some money company or something could buy us or there was some other exit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, but no, I, you know, being a founder myself,  there was never going to be an IPO for Twit.  But as headwinds started to stir up with the ad market  because Spotify and I Heart and Amazon were killing the RSS podcast  market by taking these buying up these companies, buying up these shows  and making them exclusive.  Advertisers suddenly said, well, you know,  I can tell you exactly who's listened to my ad on Joe Rogan  because it's through Spotify, the app.  And so it's worth a million dollars.  And I'm not going to buy Twit because all what do you know about your audience?  Nothing.  They I know they're I know they subscribe to our RSS feed.  So we, too, for that very reason, kind of seeing these headwinds coming,  unfortunately, pandemic killed us.  But we thought about, you know, we should probably try to get acquired  by these guys because at some point it's and that point is rapidly coming.  Where it's almost impossible to sell ads because any advertisers  is going to say, well, why should why should I buy an ad from you?  You can't tell me anything about who's who's listening.

And then pulled the plug for us.  They said, no, you can't use us anymore.  So they're going vertical and exclusive.  Yeah, they're killing.  They're literally killing RSS based podcasting  by acquiring it all.  And you don't spend half a billion dollars to acquire stuff like that.  And you let you have a pretty good plan to monetize it.

Transcript:  Well, you know, so OK, so I listened to a bunch of ringer podcasts, especially.  And all of the ads that I don't think there was any of the ads  that I hear there are personalized.  They're they're generally people like like if it's Bill Simmons, he's like,  you're talking about ExpressVPN or one of the other sponsors.  And, you know, a lot of them are fan duel, of course, because  but they're kind of gambling oriented.  But I have a sense that they're personalized at all to you.

And I don't know what they do.  I don't know what the feedback there is.  You know, and I mean, if because I'm listening generally on Apple's thing.  And though it's sometimes I listen to overcast to one of the others downcast.  So as long as you can still listen to ringer on something besides Spotify,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know they want to they want to suck in the market. Right.  And one of the reasons that I, you know, I mean, something I have a trouble with  it less with sports than with some other topics  is that and only because sports is evanescent  and it's of no interest two weeks or five weeks from now.  But I don't like that.  All of a sudden, all of the archives are available only to subscribers.  You know, I don't like that.  And and I suppose that's the case with Joe.

Start time: 7602.82
End time: 7672.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I it's hard to confirm this because it's an internal thing.  But I have seen some evidence in its kind of inductive reasoning  that Joe Rogan's influence has dropped when he went exclusive,  which they think is evidence that the audience dropped  because there are many people who would not continue to listen  if you had to get a podcast app to listen other than the one they liked.  Yeah. Maybe that would happen with Ringer, too.  Maybe in fact, that's why Spotify hasn't moved Ringer to an exclusive deal yet.  They did right away with Rogan. They even took him off YouTube.  So to get back to my original premise, Figma,  which has devoted users, loved it, sold to Adobe.  Adobe had to make the acquisition  because Figma was basically eating their lunch.  Users are unhappy about this. This is how it works.  Wouldn't it be nice if there had been some sort of way  that the community that uses Figma could have acquired it and control it  and keep Figma focused on its customers instead of focused on making money for Adobe?  That's the premise of this Wired editorial.

It's anti-competitive. Facebook slash Metta.  Yeah, maybe Figma, maybe that'll be stopped. But let's face it.  If you're relying on the US government or EU or the UK  to protect consumer interests in these acquisitions,  you've been mightily disappointed over the last 40 years.

Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think it's a real option.  But a related fact, though, it's not a fact, it's a supposition on my part.  But I think it's correct.  Is that Wired has gotten better lately.  And I think it's really interesting piece.  I agree. It's really it's gotten better and better.  And it's since Gideon Litchfield got there, he was at courts before that.  I knew him through that.  But I actually have one laying over here.  There's a Wired that I I've been meaning to write a story about.  Wait a minute. What a magazine.  They still have a Wired. They still do.  I still get it. I get that.  Yeah, I get that.  It's not real thick, you'll see.  But but they're actually selling actual ads to companies, you know,  and and that's that's cool.  The but the quality of the of the of the editorial is getting better and better.  And here and I like that.  I just want to salute that.

At least I know you are, Leo, which is that I what I like about the Wired  magazine, like any print magazine, is that I'm not being followed.  You know, I'm not being spied on with that thing.  And I have to well, I'll praise  Conde Nast for, you know, managing Wired well and hiring the right people and all  that. Their subscription system sucks.  Oh, it's awful. Horrible.  And on top of that, they track the living out of you.  And and it's just wrong.  It's just wrong. And you know, but that's the way advertising is done right now.  I actually wonder, going back to the start of the show, whether or not that stock  drop for Metta and Amazon and and an alphabet  had anything to do with the fact that Apple is doing a really good job  on at least talking privacy well with ATT.  And yeah, you know, yeah.  And yeah, I mean, to tell the truth, I mean, I'm an absolute  centist. There should never have been an advertising ID on a phone ever.  It should never have been there.  They put it there when they were in the business.  You know, here's your advertising identifier.  I don't want that.  I think most people are actually wouldn't.  But there it is.

I mean, I and I and I think that  I mean, there's a wonderful piece written by Ambler and Hollier,  two two researchers, like 20 years ago, called The Waste and  The Waste in Advertising is the part that works like I know the 15 minutes  will save me 15 percent with Geico.

Transcript:  And I mean, the insurance people are doing the best job.  I mean, Geico was nowhere before they advertised like they do.  And it's I mean, the creative advertising actually works for making brands.  Most of the brands, you know, were made by advertising.  There are a few exceptions like Trader Joe's and Zara.  But for the most part, a lot of advertising bought that.  And because they sponsor shows, it's what pays too much money  to all the athletes you like. Right.  That's that's old fashioned advertising.  But it's it's because the world is digital now  and because we could be spied on everybody in the ad business.  I mean, the most quoted thing I've written in the last few years was  Madison Avenue fell asleep.  Direct marketing ate its brain and it woke up as an alien replica of itself.  That alien replica is running things right now.  And I mean, behind me, you can see it, but over my head there,  just back there on that on a on a blanket.  I'm in a basement in Indiana right now.  But the that's a there's an L.A. Times that I saved.  It was on somebody's front lawn when I was in L.A. this spring.  It had two ads in it. Oh, my God.  Just two. And they were small.  One was for a lawyer and one was for  the art theater chain, the Lemley Theater.  There was nothing else. Nada.  And they were like, well, they still have like one hundred  and fifty thousand subscribers to the physical paper.  That's not nothing.  It's just nobody knows how to sell it.  They don't have a staff there selling it anymore.

Transcript:  That's exactly what's happening in podcasting.  You know, we have advertisers and the advertisers we have.  Know that their ads work.  I mean, they're going after a tech audience.  So you notice they're all tech companies. Yeah.  But they know they work.  They most of them have been with us for years.  Audibles with us for a decade. They know it works.  And so this lure of but you could know more about the people  listening is really specious.  It's it's it's kind of evil because what does it matter?  As long as it works, it's working.  And this whole idea of targeting and all this stuff  is, I think, snake oil.  And unfortunately, people fall for it.

Transcript:  Because because there is lots of tendentious math  that you could put together to say that it works.  And for the most part, it does not.  There's a  a really great  section of the book, The Filter Bubble by Eli Pariser,  they came out back in 2012, I think it was.  And which he said that all this is based on what he calls  a bad theory of you, you know, that that you're buying something all the time.  You're not you're not buying something all the time.  Yeah. But you might buy something you've heard about a lot  when it comes time to buy that thing. Yes.  Yeah. When it's time.  But you're not buying something right now.  We're owning things all the time, but they make it really difficult  to own something. That's one way that Apple just kills.  I think their service, there are glitches.  Their times is not great.  There are they're not those are aren't all geniuses behind the bar.  But I know I could get help.  I know I can call those guys up and I get a good answer.  And nine times out of 10, I do.  To the degree that companies

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  are serving their I think serving their customers,  even though the market would like them to maximize profits  and sometimes screw customers.  To the degree that they win the customers loyalty  and they serve their customers, I think in the long run,  maybe not in the quarterly run, but in the long run,  that's how you're going to succeed.  Amazon very, you know, that was Jeff Bezos's credo super serve  the customer. I'm not sure that's the case anymore.

Twitter is strongly considering making its users pay  to remain verified.  You like your blue check platformers learned  if the project makes forward, users would have to subscribe  to Twitter Blue at four ninety nine a month or lose their badges.  I'm sure this is just being workshopped, like about a thousand other ideas.  Yeah. Well, they have maybe they didn't fire the people who were workshopping that.  You're paying for yours, you said.  Yeah, but not for the check.  I'm playing for the other features.  And I actually like probably like you, Doc, paid for Twitter Blue  because I wanted to support Twitter. I never did.

I don't even know how you get the blue check or what that's about.  I mean, I know it's called verified.  Yeah, but I didn't know what the process was.  It looked like work.  I didn't need the work.

And by the way, one of the reasons I bring up these deep philosophical things  about the future of, you know, investing in and companies and community  ownership stuff is because Doc wrote the definitive book  on companies and their relationship to their customers.  It resonates 20 years later.  Clue Train Manifesto. You can read it online.  Get on the Clue Train.  David Weinberger, also your co-author.  Yeah, because I co-wrote it with two other guys.  And brilliant. Just brilliant.  And and still true.  And I've told you this, Doc, but I'll say it to our Twitter audience.  When I was at Tech TV, I really felt like they didn't understand their business,  what business they were in.  And they and they were really struggling.  I remember the Tech TV guys coming up to me because I said, look, you got to reach  your you're you're talking to an enthusiast audience.  You're acting as if you're ESPN, but you got to explain what football is.  This audience knows they're enthusiasts.  Serve them. Super serve them.  There are 14 million programmers in the United States.  Serve them.  And this is what the the boss told me.  He said, Leo, Leo, I got to tell you this.  And every advertiser knows it.  Brand is the refuge of the ignorant.  Wow.  Advertisers, he said it was his contention, believed that you don't want a smart audience.  They won't fall for it.  If you want your brand to succeed, you got to advertise to dummies.  So that was their reasoning for not going after the tech enthusiast.  You guys are too smart. Wow.  Can you believe that?  By the way, a tech TV long gone, purchased by Comcast merged with G4.  Their gaming network form G4 TV fired me.  I was gone.  That went out of business a few years later.  They tried to bring it back last year.  They just announced this week.  Now it's over. G4 is gone.  So I I've survived.  I have outlived now  tech TV G4, and I'm hoping to outlive the chief twit over there at the Bluebird site.  I am going to outlive you, Elon, if it's the last thing I do.  Our show today.  Our show today brought to you anyway, everybody should read the clutrain.  I bought the clutrain after he told me that brand is a refuge of the ignorant.  I bought him clutrain about everybody at tech TV.  A copy about 20 copies gave it to all the executives.  I doubt they read it.  They certainly didn't learn a thing from it.  What can I say?  Our audience and our advertisers know that marketing is a conversation.  The way we've always treated our advertisers were very careful.  We pick advertisers we like.  And my attitude is I'm introducing this company to you, our users.  I'm making an introduction.  I'm starting the conversation.  Our show today, this week brought to you by Melissa, for instance.  You've heard me talk about Melissa before.  It's awesome.  A leading provider of global data, quality and address management solutions.  Now, if you're in business, you have address lists.  You have supplier lists, customer lists, so forth.  Those lists are rotting away every single day.  You're ignoring them, but they're rotting away.  And poor data quality can cost organizations a lot.  Average of $15 million a year.  The longer the poor quality stays in your system, the worse it gets.  The more losses you accumulate.  Email addresses change, addresses change, names change, phone numbers change.  How are you keeping that data, that most valuable data you've got,  your customer data up to date?  Melissa.  Melissa will never cost you more than you're going to save.  To ensure your success, your customer information just has to be accurate.  High quality data saves you money.  It doesn't cost you, it saves you.  There's another side to inaccurate data.  Customer service.  If a customer already upset with something about your product or service  calls up and you address them with the wrong name or verify the wrong address,  things can go from bad to worse.  Check out Melissa's cloud-based data cleansing enrichment tool.  Easy to use.  You upload your file, you choose the data quality service, you map the input  fields, process your list, you get it back.  It's fresh, clean, sparkling.  Melissa's data quality suite also helps eliminate clutter and duplicates.  For a long time, I was getting three or four catalogs from Restoration Hardware.  These are the big, thick, full color, expensive catalogs to the same name and address.  They didn't obviously, they didn't have Melissa because they didn't know they  were mailing me four copies of the same thing.  Imagine how they could have cut their postage and mailing costs.  You need this stuff.  Batch address, cleaning process, an entire address list for accuracy and completeness.  You can do name verification, parse and standardized first and last names.  You can analyze your data to improve its quality over time.  They have email verification.  They can remove 95% of bad email addresses just like that.  Melissa's flexible deployment options let you do it the way you want.  You can have it on-prem.  You can have it as a SaaS product.  They even have a secure FTP server.  You can upload your customer list to, and then download it.  They've got an app on iOS and Google.  It's called Lookups.  It'll let you search addresses, verify social security numbers, access  detailed property data, and more and all at your fingertips.

Worked at the British Rubber Producers Research Association.  That's where she met her future husband, mathematician Donald Booth.  In 1940-  He's famous.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Probably, of course, because he's a guy.  Right?  Right?  In 1946, she collaborated with Britton.  I don't know who Britton is.  Another, another, oh, wait a minute.  That's her maiden name.  Sorry.  Kathleen Britton and Booth, they weren't yet married, collaborated at Birkbeck on  the automatic relay calculator, founding in effect the Department of Computer  Science and Information Systems.  If there aren't any computers, you can't really have a computer science department.  They built it.  She and her fellow researcher, Zina Sweeting, built the hardware.  They often did have women build these because they had finer motor skills and  they were able to do the fine wiring and so forth on the early computers.  Plus, women were the first computers.  Back when it was pencil and paper, women were computing the trajectories of  mortar rounds and things on pencil and paper, even if you saw that wonderful  movie about NASA, even doing planetary trajectories.  What was that movie?  Hidden Figures.  Such a great movie.  Hidden Figures.  Hidden Figures.  Yeah.  So eventually, she actually, Bernal got funding from the Rockefeller Foundation  for Booth and Britton to visit the Institute of Advanced Study at Princeton.  That was where, of course, Albert Einstein was.  The only person who talked to them at the time was this guy named John von Neumann,  who explained his concept of computing, which we now call the von Neumann  architecture, the kind of the archetypal computing architecture.  They heard this and said, oh, went back to Britain, redesigned their calculator  as a von Neumann machine, inventing the first drum memory.  In 1948, they moved on to this next generation, the third generation,  the simple electronic computer, and then the all-purpose electronic X-ray computer,  or APE-XC, later sold as HECC by the British Tabulating Machine Company.  There it is.  There's a HECC with Ray Bird right there.  She married Booth, became Kathleen Booth in 1950, got a PhD in applied  mathematics from the University of London.  They built the hardware.  She wrote all the software for the ARC-II and the SEC machines in the process  inventing what she called contracted notation.  We know it better now as assembly language, writing at the level of the actual processor.  She also invented asynchronous operation in a book she wrote in 1958 called  Programming for an Automatic Digital Calculator, one of the first programming  books written by a woman.  We talk so little about the women who were so important to the early days of  computing, and I had never heard of Kathleen Booth, but I think we should,  on her passing, mark her mass, really amazing contributions to the science.  100 years old, Kathleen Booth, one of the last of the early computer pioneers.

Transcript:  One story about John von Neumann, who was Hungarian.  He also, he didn't think that we should be afraid of nuclear power.  And he was invited to watch the bomb go off and he actually exposed himself  purposely to the radiation.  He flashed the flash?  And died of cancer.

Transcript:  Yeah.  But he worked on the Manhattan Project.  I just read a really good book about him.  They didn't mention him flashing the bomb.  Wow.  So it cost him.  What was the book I just read?  It was, it was really-  Hold on, maybe I'm wrong.  Maybe I'm wrong.  No, no, no.  I think they probably thought that was maybe a little too salacious of a detail.  The book actually was only about half about John von Neumann.  It was mostly about his era and the Hungarian geniuses who, you know, came  out of Hungary pre-war, who were really massively important to everything that  we know of his modern physics, modern computing.  The book was by Ananyo Batacharya called The Man from the Future.  And quite, I highly recommend it if you haven't read it.  And since you sound like you're interested in John von Neumann and his genitals,  you might want to read this.

He was the guy who thought of stored memory, programs load from stored memory into RAM.  None of this existed.  Run in RAM.  He thought about that whole thing.  That's the architecture we know as modern computing.  So anyway.

So what did you talk about when you were on?  I have no idea.  Probably Clutrain.  Clutrain.  By the way, I'd rather plug the more recent book which is The Intention Economy.  I wrote that one myself.  That is not a bestseller.  Screw Weinberger.  Yeah.  Let's screw him.  We actually...  Weinberger and I together wrote, if you add new clues, the word new clues to the URL  for the Clutrain Manifesto, in 2015 we wrote some additional clues to the Clutrain  Manifesto, which are very optimistic.  And I think we were right.  People should listen to what you guys said, not with just Clutrain, but with The Intention

Actually, I wanted to point to, before we're off, but maybe it doesn't matter, we could  bring it up another time, to the Linux Foundation has the Open Wallet Foundation, they want  to start up.  Google has a wallet.  Apple has a wallet.  They're not compatible.  They both work.  But I think we need our own wallets that are not given to us by companies.  I think that's possibly the most leveraged thing that we can have since the browser.  So I'm writing about that right now.  I love this.

Actually, on Floss Weekly this week, we had Hart Montgomery, who is the CTO for the  Hyperledger Foundation, which is under the Linux Foundation.  And deals mostly with blockchain related stuff.  We talked a lot about the wallet and it got me going on it because they are a...  Linux Foundation is a collection of businesses.  It's not necessarily you and me.  Okay.  So they work for the companies that pay them in a way.  And though they're great with open source, I love them for a lot of things.  We need something that's on our side with that one.  I agree.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree.  Lots of great interviews on Floss Weekly.  I must recommend you go to twit.tv slash floss.  Listen every Wednesday morning, 9 a.m. Pacific, noon Eastern.  And go back through the catalog because some of the most important people in this space,  you and your co-hosts have interviewed some of the best.  And it was one of the reasons...

And he's talking about authentic data and verified data and data provenance and  other stuff like that.  He's not...  He's complicated, but he's really bright.  And these are...  There's a lot of these people here out in the future.  You know?  So there's a lot of coming distractions.  This is the time to think about the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, we don't, you know, we talk...  Of course, we talk about what happened this week.  But the few...  But it's not just gonna...  It's not gonna happen willy-nilly.  We can influence what happens next week.  And I think it's really important, especially as users, that we do that.  And of course, I hope you will all vote November 8th.  That's probably the most valuable, powerful way you can influence your future.  But participate in these other activities like the Linux Foundation, like IndieWeb.org.  And there's so many people who I think are deep thinkers and are really trying to  influence this for good, not evil.  Because technology is neutral.  It's amoral.  But it can go either way.  And we've seen it.  We see it all the time go both ways.  It's important that, you know, if you care that we influence it in the right way.  And that's why we talk so much about Elon Musk.  Thank you.  Thank you, Doc.  Thank you, Philip.  Thank you, Devendra.  So great to have you all.  There's another way you can influence the future of technology and that's support us.  I talked a little bit about how difficult it's getting to be an independent podcast  network.  We want to keep bringing you great shows like this, like Floss Weekly, Windows Weekly,  MacBreak Weekly.  And for us, I think the best way going forward, if I think about five years out, it's the  club.  It's supporting Twit through your direct contributions.  And it's very affordable.  Seven bucks a month gets you all the shows without ads.  We don't need you to listen to ads if you're paying us.  You get a Twit Plus feed, which includes a bunch of stuff we don't put out anywhere  else, plus access to a remarkable Twit Discord server, which I think is honestly  the future of social.  These are just all of the...  Now, by the way, this week we passed 5000 members in the club.  Not all of them in the Discord, but a good number of them, all with kind of the same  interests, the same passions, people you want to talk with, you want to learn from.  There are unique shows that we don't put out in public like Hands on Windows with Paul  Thurotte.  Micah does Hands on Macintosh.  Jonathan Bennett, your co-host on Floss Weekly, does the untitled Linux show every  Saturday.  That's a great show for Linux users.  The Giz Fizz with Dick DiBartolo Stacey's Book Club.  We had to put it off this week.  I can't remember.  I guess Aunt couldn't make it.  So we will reschedule that and we'll bring that back.  But those things are only available on the Twit Plus feed and almost all of them are  live.  I think they are all live.  So you can watch live, participate live.  The club is the future of Twit and also I think the best damn deal out there.  Seven bucks a month.  Find out more.  twit.tv slash club.  And you know what?  If you've got a geek in your life, that would be an excellent gift.  We do have year long subscriptions.  I think that would make an excellent gift for the holidays to come.  Just a hint.  Just a hint.  We do Twit every Sunday, 2 p.m.  Pacific, 5 p.m.  Eastern, 2100 UTC.  It will change, by the way, after in the U.S.  We're still on summertime.  But next Sunday, we will be back to standard time.  We, I'm going to have to do some math now.  I didn't, they told me there'd be no math.  So that we are falling back.  So we're moving backwards an hour.  So I think we're UTC minus eight.  Is that right, John?

There's live audio and video.  twit.tv slash live.  If you're watching live chat live, the IRC is open all day and all night to  everybody, to all comers at IRC.twit.tv.  There's also of course the discord for club members.  After the fact, get your copy on demand, add supported at twit.tv or on the YouTube  channel, all of our ad supported shows have YouTube channels dedicated to them.  That's a great way to share content because you can easily clip it and post it on  Twitter or whatever.  That helps us by the way, by promoting the show.  And of course the easiest way for most people is to subscribe, find your favorite  podcast program, like overcast or pocket casts or Google or Apple's podcast app  and subscribe and that way you'll get it automatically as soon as we're done here,  which we will be soon.  We just have to cut all the profanities out.  Thank you.  Thank you everybody for joining us.  We'll see you next time.  Have a great Halloween by the way.  Nobody wore costumes today.
