This is TWIT, Episode 121.  And I think a really great panel.  We have some real smart people today.  John C. Dvorak cannot be here.  He is acting as the minister.  He is marrying his stepson today.  And apparently he has one of those paper licenses that allow, I have one too, allows you to  marry people.  He is a member of the Universal Life Church, a pastor.  So Reverend Dvorak will be out.  It's possible, a possible Patrick will stop by.  He said he would.  He of course has a new baby and is a little busy.  And we'll just leave, like Elijah, we leave a place at the table for Patrick.  You never know what's going to happen.  But we do have the kid from Brooklyn, Jason Kalakiannis.  This is the kid from Brooklyn.  The kid from Brooklyn.  He's Mr. Mahalo.  And by the way, we had Veronica on last week and I've been loving it.  You launched Mahalo Daily and I love it.  She's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish I could take, you know, like 1% of the credit, but we have an incredible producer  named Tyler and we have an incredibly talented host.  So I am drafting on their success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, yeah, you had the good sense to bring him in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I pay for the meals.  Craft Services is my tunnel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's okay.  You know, that's a useful thing to have.  It's always good to have somebody to pay for the meals.  Also with us, Jerry Pornell, ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Chaos Manor.  Love Jerry.  His work in Byte Magazine for many years made me a better geek.  He still writes from Chaos Manor online at JerryPornell.com and we love having him on  Twitter.  It's good to see you again, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And celebrating with his new iPhone, legally purchased this time from Oxford, England,  Will Harris.  Yes.  Hello.  Channel Flip.  Hey Will.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So did you go, did you get in line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  You know what?  There just weren't any queues really at all.  It was actually kind of unfortunate that I had to get one because actually the one that  I had from the States I broke last week.  You know how you just like drop it and suddenly the screen smashes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this is a conclusive proof that British people are more intelligent than Americans.  They did not queue for the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  It was a big, it was just a big let down.  If you read some of the reports, it seems like, you know, the Apple store was basically  like full of press and then like one guy outside.  What happened?  Was there just a, why?  Well, we're not used to, you know, over here we're not used to paying for a phone and paying  for a contract.  It's like you either, you know, you pay for the phone and you don't get a contract or  you pay for the contract and you get the phone free.  The idea of paying for a contract and paying like 300 pounds for a phone is completely  alien to 90% of the British population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that how much it was, 300 pounds?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's 270.  It's expensive.  Yeah, it was 540 in dollars, which obviously is a lot more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little more interest in Germany though.  T-Mobile says there were some lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, T-Mobile says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think it's interesting how the iPhone has kind of taken back seat and now  that Google, this is the week Google announced Android, it's a telephone operating system.  I think there's a lot of eyes now.  We've moved on, haven't we?  We're looking at the next big thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But don't you think Android, this whole thing, wasn't it like just a complete letdown?  I mean for months and months and months has been, you know, Google phone and we're going  to have all these awesome Google things.  An actual fact, A, you're not going to get anything until the second half of 2008 and  B, you're still reliant on handset designs from third parties who have consistently shown  that they can't design anything, you know, at least in hardware terms, match Apple.  And I think most people were thinking like if anybody can out beat Apple, it's Google.  But Google has basically like, you know, passed on the whole thing to the third parties.  It just seems a bit of a letdown.  HTC might be saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I wondered about that myself.  Are there any third party designers out there who are making phones that you actually want  to use?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like HTC's phones.  They do the tilt for AT&T.  They do...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the Helio is a great phone.  I mean, people, I was at, I was playing poker last night with these like young celebrities  in Hollywood and a third of them had Helios and they love them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw you were on Twitter down 400 bucks.  Did you come back?  I got brutalized.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pocket Aces beat you two pair?  I have Pocket Aces and like this kid is betting, this kid from like one of these TV shows on  Fox is betting like $100 at a $5 buying, a $5 ante table with Queen 2.  It's like fold and he's betting $100 and I just, it all made no sense.  So I can't take it.  I should know better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't play with the big boys.  So now who makes, who makes the Helio sets?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Helio is, I guess they have the investment from the Korean telecom company.  I think they actually make the handsets, but I think actually what Google is going to do  is I would look for Google to create a fund.  You know, they've been investing in companies a little bit and VCs are getting a little  dicey about that.  Like, Hey, you know, aren't you supposed to be buying the companies, not investing in  them?  But I wouldn't be surprised if Google just sets aside a hundred million dollars and says,  Hey, we'll invest in people who want to make hardware.  Why not?  You know, if they don't get the results they're looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Which is a bigger announcement, open social or Android?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Open social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or is Android just nothing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think they're both going to be very important.  You know, like all these open platform things, you know, you have to wait and see.  I mean, Jabber was supposed to change the world and if people don't participate, it  doesn't, right?  It's not like your aim is talking to, you know, your Yahoo messenger or whatever, unless  somebody hacks it.  So it really depends on buy in from people.  But I have to say, you know, I have this like Facebook group for Mahalo Daily.  It's got a bunch of people in it and it's nice.  But then I started playing with Ning over the last week because I've been trading emails  with Andreessen on some things and it is brilliant.  I mean, you have absolute total control.  I think it is.  I understand why people put in whatever, $50 million until the last round.  It's going to be huge and people are going to want to own and control their social network.  I'm talking about companies and individuals.  And it's going to have a huge impact, I think, on Facebook's business because once you get  to the point at which your Facebook group or your business's presence there or your  presence there becomes truly important to you, you want control of it back.  You want to put your advertising on it.  You want to put your collateral on it.  You're going to want your statistics.  Like, I have no statistics.  I can't see how many times video is reviewed on Facebook.  And they're not going to give control of that stuff.  So I think you'll start seeing like the top people jump over to services like Ning very  quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ning is a partner in OpenSoft, or a signatory, whatever you would call it to OpenSoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Andreessen is driving the boat.  Really?  Well, you remember he came out with that post about two months ago where he was like, oh,  Facebook's open platform is fantastic, but it's a level two and there is a higher level,  level three, and here's what that would be.  And he sort of just primed the market like level.  He basically described it.  So he basically, I think that was the setup.  Obviously, they've been working on this for months.  I wouldn't be surprised if it's his idea.  And he drove the ship on it, got everybody's buy-in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it was there.  It was at Google for a while.  But Brad Fitzpatrick of LiveJournal, I think, really kickstarted it at Google.  He has to get some credit for it.  Absolutely.  I mean, he's been big on this space for some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's obvious what Google's doing, right?  I mean, it's like, if you can't own a space, what's the next best thing to do?  Create a standard.  No, fragmented.  Fragmented.  So you look at what they're doing in mobile and you look at what they're doing in social  networking.  Very interesting, yeah.  They couldn't buy either.  They can't displace the iPhone and they're not going to displace heads up and they're  not going to displace Facebook heads up, right?  They tried already in terms of social networking with Orchid.  They know they can't win.  So fragmented.  It's a brilliant strategy, divide and conquer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think they will not buy Spectrum in the auction in January?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That seems to me like a high-risk poker game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why do that now, right?  If you can do this strategy.  This is kind of a different play.  You never know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was talking about they could start investing in smaller companies and creating like a thousand  flowers blooming and just make the whole thing open like the internet.  Those guys are very principled guys and Larry and Sergey run that company and they're visionary  guys and it's obviously they're not motivated by money.  They're motivated by making an impact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that true?  Really?  You know them better than...  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you've dealt with them directly in business.  I'm not like best friends with either of them.  I met them both a couple of times when they were starting the company and later on.  I think that they are guys who are driven by innovation and changing markets.  I think it's probably very exciting for them on a very personal basis to evolve the phone  market.  You remember Larry went to CES two years ago and gave a keynote.  He basically was telling the electronics industry like, get your act together.  Why do I have to have a thousand different plugs for all my different devices when I  travel?  Now the USB standard has evolved.  He didn't do it but those guys I think can dictate good behavior and they did that with  the recent rejiggering of PageRank.  They said you can't sell links.  Everybody said I can do what I want.  It's my company, right?  It's my website.  They said, okay, do what you want.  Boom, gadget loses four points on their PageRank and guess what?  I stepped in and other people stepped in and were like, hey, time out.  We'll do what you want.  Whatever you want to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, do you think that PageRank, boy, that was a big issue last week.  Do you think that really was?  Is it a big deal when you lose PageRank on the Google toolbar?  What does it mean even?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was there a way of saying how important you are related to other sites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On a scale of zero to 10, Google being 10 by the way, Yahoo being nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Netscape being a nine, whatever.  Getting a blog up to six or seven is incredible, let alone eight.  I think I'm a six or seven somewhere.  Which is incredible.  It means you've been around for a long time and you're an authority, but they've played  that down a little bit.  They look at other things like ...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't mean you rank that highly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It helps.  It's a number.  It's a number.  I've often wondered about those numbers.  I have verified about somewhere around 150,000 unique visitors a month, which is not a bad  circulation for a magazine.  And that's several million hits, whatever that means.  But I have never ranked anywhere on any of those things that show PageRank and so forth.  I don't even appear.  And yet I know I have more readers than a number of the people who ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's because nobody links to you, right, Jerry?  I mean, that's what they're looking at.  It may be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, they read my stuff and probably.  I have quite a few subscribers on the voluntary subscription plan, you know, if you like what  I'm doing, send me money.  And if you don't, then don't.  But it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes sense what you're saying because here it is you have something that's widely  read.  I mean, 150,000 uniques puts you in wired magazine territory.  I mean, it's widely read.  And yet because you don't have incoming links, Google says, well, you're not as important.  But obviously, incoming links isn't the only thing that's important.  That's what Google has verified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have never been able to figure out how those ratings work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's by design, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think Google doesn't want you to know necessarily how it works because then, you know, if you  know the special source, then you can mess with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google's...  Oh, I understood that.  And what I mean is I don't think they work.  I think either people are paying to get those ranks or there is something strange going  on and they favor people for some reason other than their circulation and popularity.  You're exactly correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of gaming that goes on.  It's called SEO, search engine optimization.  And it would be incredible if somebody would come up with a solution for this.  I don't know how they could ever neutralize SEO and create a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But isn't the solution to pay no attention to it at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, except they have 60% market share and probably about 50 to 85% of people's traffic  comes from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, you have to have...  I didn't pay no attention to those page ranks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You have to have some...  When you're talking about search, you have to have some algorithm for determining what  comes in first, what comes in second.  Page rank works well.  That's why Google has 60% market share.  It works.  It may not map to popularity.  It may not map to other things, but it does work for search, right?  Or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, again, Leo, there are some topics that if you look them up, I am the first because  I'm probably the only guy who wrote about the Macaulay and the ladies of ancient Rome  or something of the sort, or at least who's done so.  And very many people paid me attention.  So it's not as if I don't appear on the search engines for a lot of stuff.  So I'm just not sure I know what is the bubbling.  That's not me, surely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I see, by the way, before we go on, I just want to make sure...  I see Patrick just called in.  We'll see if we can get him into the mix.  It'd be very nice to have him here.  Patrick, are you there?  Hey.  Hey, Mr. Patrick Norton, ladies and gentlemen.  Hey!  Hooray!  The new papa.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I bet you're not getting much sleep.  Oh, what sleep?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember getting much of anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So how's it going?  How's Seamus?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's good.  He's good.  A little concerned that people keep trying to put details of him in my Wikipedia entry.  We were talking...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's funny, we were talking about that off mic ahead of time, and I won't say  with whom, but about privacy and protecting your privacy.  Jerry, like me, has been in the past, we've been fairly forward about our families, sometimes  to my regret.  So you don't want any personal information about your family to go out there.  You've always been very private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'd like as little...  It's my wife and I would like as little as possible.  Yeah, I don't blame you.  Well, the other thing is, we've had stuff like our wedding pictures are now anchoring  a link to somebody's eBay page in Oklahoma.  So next time I drive cross country, I have to go visit them and politely ask them to  quit it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  Your wedding pictures are anchoring somebody's eBay page?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's a link to their eBay page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's weird.  I just removed it from your page, just so you know.  And I put the reason it was removed is because it's not cited, it has to be cited, number  one, that's an easy way to get something off of Wikipedia.  That's great.  And then number two, it's not relevant, is what I put.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't looked at my Wikipedia entry in a long time.  Every time I used to look at it, people would have in their details about my life that never  happened.  They once had me getting a battlefield commission in Korea, and I think the only battlefield  commission I ever heard of was Audie Murphy in Italy.  And these are obviously not people who dislike me, but they seem to have made up details  that they wish were true or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, can somebody put on my page that I dated Sharon Stone in the early 90s?  That would be perfect, right?  If I say right now, I dated Sharon Stone in the early 90s.  There's a citation.  There's a citation, so therefore it can be on there.  So can somebody please do that during the show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I shot a man in Reno just to see him die, by the way.  I just want everybody to know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When was it that her husband got his foot eaten by the Komodo dragon?  That wasn't so long ago, yeah.  It was a few years ago.  Her ex-husband.  Her ex-husband.  Is it an ex now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is now, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, well I guess that happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who is the editor of a San Francisco newspaper?  Of The Examiner, yeah.  Phil Bronstein.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I meet those people at agent parties sometimes, and I never know what to say to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was an odd marriage.  I mean, he's a very smart, macho, cool dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I liked him.  I remember him, and I was thinking, boy, it's really something to get your foot bitten off  by a Komodo dragon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's actually a page of people who've had their foot bitten off by Komodo  dragons on Wikipedia.  It's a category page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's been four, actually.  I shouldn't laugh.  I really shouldn't laugh at this.  They did get divorced, though, but it was an interesting relationship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, Jason, it seems that your Wikipedia says that you once dated Sharon Stone.  Is that correct?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go figure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I don't think gaming Wikipedia is really the right thing to do here now.  Although, again, if you choose to, you can say I shot a man in Reno just to see him die.  When you joined us, Patrick, we were talking about Android and OpenSocial and Google's  bid.  I think very astutely, Jason's pointing out to kind of fragment the markets that they  can't buy into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's worked so well for Microsoft.  I don't know that Google is no longer practicing good because they folded over in the face  of what was obviously the right thing to do for shareholder value and pimped themselves  out to the government of China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason disagrees.  He thinks that Sergey and Larry are basically good guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Sergey and Larry are great guys, but you know what?  It's a publicly held company, and they have to do what's in the public interest, or excuse  me, in the best interest of the shareholders, which means they have to do business in China,  and they have to do some things that I don't consider to be particularly great things.  Well, is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, if you're in the slave trade, you have to do certain things, but nobody forced  you to be in the slave trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I understand that, but nobody in the slave trade says, hey, you know what?  Google, what's the Google we're not evil line?  How's that go?  Oh, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at Netflix.  They're publicly traded, and they don't rent porn.  It would be a huge thing for them.  It would probably be bigger than Netflix.  And the guy who runs it doesn't want to rent porn, so he doesn't.  Good for him.  Good for Reid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  Now, I remember I defended Google at the time, given the information we had, that they hadn't  been told that this was a political crime, and I could see how that could work.  But now it begins to come out that I was dead wrong, and they kind of-  Well, this is Yahoo.  I think you're talking about Yahoo.  That was Yahoo.  Yeah, that was Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think this is actually really interesting.  Yahoo's basically admitted that they knew.  They hid it from Congress.  They never told Congress.  Or anybody else.  They did.  Didn't they sell Yahoo to- was it Baidu?  Who did they sell it?  Not to Baidu, the other Chinese search engine.  But they still have a big stake in it.  Alibaba?  Alibaba.  They still have a stake in it, though, I think.  So they're still doing business in China.  They have a front man for them.  What do you think of this, Jason?  I'm sure it disappointed Yahoo.  Yeah, I think it's very disappointing.  We talked about this back when it happened, both with Google and Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think I was on your shoulder.  I actually defended them at the time.  You did.  Here's the thing.  Given what I knew, I could see why they made that decision, but it turns out they knew  things they didn't admit to knowing, and that just disappoints the heck out of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the thing.  There's no correct way to answer the question, like, what would you do?  At the Deconference two years ago, they asked Terry Salmo about this issue, and somebody  in the audience said, hey, if you were in Nazi Germany, would you have fought the Nazis?  They asked you to turn people over.  He's like, well, we all have to think about what we would have done.  The whole audience was like, oh, no, he didn't just say that.  There's only one correct answer when somebody brings up Nazis, which is-  Of course I'll fight the Nazis.  I will fight them to my last dying breath, and that's it.  That's the answer, and you stop, and he didn't, and it has become-  But in China-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Albert Speer at the Nuremberg trial said a wife and 14 children is sufficient reason  to collaborate with anyone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was his defense.  And see, Jerry, there's where you get to the nuance of this.  The people in the Yahoo office, if they didn't turn that stuff over-  They go to jail.  They could have gone to jail.  It is one of those absolutely no-winning situations, and there is another layer to this which gets  even more fascinating, and again, business is personal.  Jerry Yang is Taiwanese.  Yahoo has like 87% search market share in Taiwan, specifically because he is a hero  there, and this is a very layered issue, I think, for him, and he got his butt kicked  at those hearings.  I think it's actually going to result in all of the companies changing how they deal with  China on an ongoing basis, and you see that with Google already.  They put their servers in Taiwan for YouTube specifically so they don't have to give stuff  over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's the right way to do it, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely, and so that's what's going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Singapore, or Taiwan, or-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And if you get shut off, you get shut off, you know, and it's like, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying don't do business in mainland China?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, don't put your servers there-  Don't do business under their terms.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, at certain point you have to say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know?  I mean, the flip side of this is China's buying up, you know, huge amounts of the debt that's  being run up in the United States now, and there's so many layers of this to go into,  it just gets more and more depressing the more and more you look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You remember, you guys are probably not old enough to remember the times when the Japanese  were buying huge amounts of American debt.  They bought Yankee Stadium and houses all over Hawaii, and it turns out that the Yankee  traders ate their lunch when it was all over.  It turns out maybe Americans are not as bad at dickering and horse trading as everybody  seems to think we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love this show.  Wow, how do you follow that?  I just can't.  Great changes.  What do you do?  Thank you, folks.  We'll be here for three more nights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, we're going to say goodnight now.  We're here all night.  Maybe I'll just say this, it's time for our commercial.  How about that?  That's what commercials are made for.  I'd like to read the commercial live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's no copy.  What do you think about Prince suing his fans?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prince went off the deep end.  First, he gives away his album.  Maybe this is an old story, but he gives away his album.  Then, all of a sudden, he's suing people right and left.  Now, he's suing fans on the internet for putting images of him on the internet.  Putting images of him on the internet.  That's crazy.  Bad policy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The guy is trying to protect his copyright, but he's trying to do it in all the wrong  ways.  When you're suing someone for putting your song lyrics on the internet, it's like, okay,  so technically you might own the copyright in your song lyrics, but how good an idea  is it to sue your number one and two fan site for doing it?  What's really funny is that these fan sites now have banded together to form this anti-Prince  association.  We hate Prince.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  PrinceSucks.com.  It's very simple for them.  They can absolutely get around this copyright issue.  All they have to do is do some criticism of it.  If they went through it and put a paragraph of lyrics and then wrote some critical analysis  of them, after each paragraph, they would be protected under fair use.  Interesting.  They could just solve the whole problem.  Game over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If it was considered an educational site and not a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not just lyrics though.  They sent cease and desist letters to remove all photographs, images, lyrics, album covers,  and anything linked to the artist's likeness.  Pretty much puts you out of business as a fan site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it doesn't make any sense.  Of course not.  It's the same.  He's not protecting anything.  I thought he was crazy like a fox with that business of the artist formerly known as Prince,  got out of all of those terrible contracts that he had with the recording studios.  Or this one sharp guy.  Didn't hurt to write slave on your cheek either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That certainly goes a long way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But he was really a sharp guy and now he's doing really strange things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe he just wants to get out of the public eye.  This isn't obviously the move of a guy who wants to build his business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you don't protect your rights, the sad part about all this stuff is if you don't  protect your rights, then you lose them and he probably has contracts where he's contractually  obligated to protect them.  Somebody may own the rights to those or he may have loans against them and all this kind  of stuff.  So it's usually that's what it is.  Back to the Kleenex problem.  Look at Dig.  Dig has to sue people who use Dig in their name of their domain.  They don't like to but you have to protect it.  How you do it is the nuance.  He should have just went to them and said, hey guys, you can't put all my lyrics up  there.  Put the five songs up that you like best.  Put some criticism on it and let's call it a day.  I would like to have you guys all over for a private concert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think that that's his motivation.  I really don't think he's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What goes on in these people's minds?  So who's the sponsor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Audible.com.  Audible.  Oh, how I love Audible.  You don't have to say that, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I do.  I have an Audible account.  Hey, this is Jason Calacanis, the CEO of Maula.com and formerly of Weblogsync and Silk and Iron  Porter.  I'd like to let you know about a service that I use and I love Audible.  Audible.com.  The largest collection of audiobooks on the internet.  All with simple, easy to use, non-DRM MP3 files.  It is DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, there is DRM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're making me sick, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not paying you any more, Jason, just because you're doing this.  You understand that.  Nothing from nothing, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With the lightest DRM package that you can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's good.  Yes, there you go.  Easy to use DRM.  You can burn to CD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And burn to CD and rip so you don't have any DRM and you can send to your friends on BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is going downhill.  Well, just make sure when you buy a book from Audible, you get Star Swarm by Jerry Pernell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is in fact our book pick.  Star Swarm is about Kip, a young boy who lives with his uncle at the Star Swarm Station  research outpost on Planet Paradise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all about computers in your head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the idea.  I can't wait.  I haven't read this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how old are your kids?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  15 and 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They'll both love it.  Oh, that's great.  I will guarantee you, Leo, they will both love that book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They love books about boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They love audiobooks in print.  They will love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they loved Ender's Game.  Books about kids, of course they love them, right?  Lloyd James does the reading.  Jerry says that he does a great job of it.  It is unabridged.  Of course, we wouldn't recommend anybody read an abridged Jerry Pernell novel.  Yeah.  Yeah.  We want all 10 hours, Jerry.  Yes.  Yes.  It's great.  It's the first time we've had an Audible pick and actually had the author on during  the Audible pick, Jerry.  This is fantastic.  Good.  Please don't threaten to sue us.  Star Swarm is our Audible pick.  This is the fabulous CEO of Mahalo, Mr. Jason Califkanis, did say it is a huge collection,  45,000 plus titles.  You know, when we started doing Audible ads almost a year ago, it was 35,000.  I mean, they're adding new books all the time, hundreds of different devices, including of  course, all the iPods.  Or listen on your computer, burn it to a CD.  I have literally in my library now hundreds of Audible books.  I just love them.  I've been listening to the Aubrey Maturin series.  I just did a lot of the research for my talk at Blog World Expo.  I did an audio form.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's what I do, Leo.  I don't even know what I'm going to want to listen to.  So I just go on.  I buy like five or 10 of the top, you know, business selling books, put it on my iPod.  And then, you know, when you're on a plane and you're bored or whatever, you got them  there.  So I suggest everybody go out today right now, get on Audible and just buy five to 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good idea.  Just put them on your iPod.  It's kind of a surprise.  You turn on the shuffle, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll never know what you'll get.  Absolutely.  And if you can listen to the end of the chapter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shuffle by paragraph or by chapter?  By chapter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be fun.  You know what I got off there?  I got Shadow Divers off of Audible.  Oh, isn't that great?  That is the best audiobook.  It is unfrickin' believable.  This book, Shadow Divers, if you go buy it and you don't like it, I will pay you for

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it.  I read it.  It was one of our Audible picks a couple of months ago and I got a lot of email from  people who said exactly that.  This turned them around.  This turned them on to Audible.  Star Swarm will do the same.  Look, here, I'll tell you what, we'll make a deal.  You could pick one or the other.  You get a free book.  All you gotta do is go to audible.com slash twit and you get a credit toward a free book.  It could be either one.  Both are really excellent and we do thank Audible for their great support of This Week  in Tech.  We really like having them aboard because everybody loves Audible.  It's an easy thing to do ads for.  We don't accept stuff that we can't do ads for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It doesn't even feel like an ad.  It feels just like love.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My problem is that I don't talk about things I don't like.  That's not a problem.  Not really, but if you go to sell ads, it turns out to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the reasons I loved Chaos Manor and always read it is because it was very clear.  In fact, you really inspired me in a great degree to my career because you represented  users.  It was a user column.  It was about a user experience and it was stuff you really thought.  When Jerry Purnell said highly recommended, we knew it was good.  I've made that kind of my watchword.  It's represent the consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a neat niche and you get to sleep at night.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you who's sleeping better at Nyer.  Maybe not.  Maybe he's tossing and turning.  Our good friend Kevin Rose.  Did you see this, Patrick, that the rumor is flying that, well, Valleywag, I guess that's  It must be true.  It must be true.  It's in Valleywag.  $400 million.  Oh, so it's up $100 million.  It was $300 and it was $200 the last time I heard.  It goes up a lot.  Maybe it's $300.  Anyway, a lot of money, $300 to $400.  Here's the reason.  Actually, this makes sense.  You tell me, Jason, because you're a businessman.  They're basing this on the fact that Microsoft has done a deal with them for $100 million  worth of advertising, $30 million a year.  That's a 10 to 13 multiple.  They're saying it's the Times Company and the Washington Post Company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so confused.  Roll that back again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  According to Valleywag, Digg's always been in play.  In fact, Jay Adelson is.  I love getting Jason to comment on this, but Jay Adelson has said that Digg's always in  play.  We're always talking.  Valleywag recently said, because of this deal with Microsoft, they've got two big players  now who are talking to them.  Speculation.  Patrick and I, of course, are good friends with Kevin.  We watched him come up and surpass us and make millions.  Now you're working for Kevin again, Patrick.  Is that a little weird, by the way, working for Kevin?  No.  Because he was like a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some people still think I'm a kid, which I find tremendously amusing.  Basically Kevin runs Digg full time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he doesn't show up over at revision three?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not too often.  And the truth is, I don't have a problem working with him.  He had a good idea.  He followed up on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like working for smart people.  We love Kevin.  In fact, he's a compadre and a longtime Twit guy, although we haven't had him on in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do think though that-  Now I remember this article.  This is the one that suggested Jason has marital relations with farm animals.  Oh, I missed that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that in there too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would like to deny that FARC will be sold for $750 million.  I cannot confirm talks at this time.  I also cannot confirm, et cetera, et cetera.  That's what happened.  That's when, okay, Drew Curtis from FARC emailed Valley Wag after the rumor of the $300 million  sale went out.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Jason, let's get your take on this.  First of all, do you want to deny the farm animal thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm going to just, I don't respond to rumors about a personal life specifically regarding  farm animals.  However, Sharon Stone is true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sharon Stone is no farm animal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's a couple of things here.  You have to look at, it is a valuable site.  However, it has not gone past its core audience.  What are the uniques?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's a huge number, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say it's like 20 million or whatever, and that makes it two-thirds the size of Facebook.  But I would be surprised if less than 50% of that came through Google because DIG is  highly ranked and you'll see stories breaking in Google and it sort of just flowed through  traffic.  So I think it's definitely worth $100 million.  It might be worth $150.  I don't see somebody paying $300 for it unless they have some sort of a theory as to how  it gets bigger.  And that's the key thing when you're acquiring these things.  You have to have some sort of a thesis of how this gets bigger because DIG has not been  able to build out past the core audience of tech, right?  It's not that big in the other spaces.  So I don't see somebody spending three or four hundred million on it.  Maybe if somebody had a lot of cash and felt a little desperate, I could definitely see  somebody spending $100 million, $150 million.  I know when I was at AOL, I tried to buy it at AOL and I was talking numbers in the $50  million range with people and trying to float that internally, which obviously they weren't  interested in selling at that time.  And that was two years ago, so 18 months ago.  Yeah, you can't take the basis of the story right now is the uniques when compared to  Facebook's.  And that is Facebook's.  You have to start with Facebook's metrics.  That's farcical.  You know, like Facebook is not worth $15 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There aren't independent sources, both putting Facebook at around 20 million uniques and  DIG at a similar number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's that Comscore ranking that came out a couple of weeks ago where they're talking  about social networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if I believe it.  I'll be honest.  I don't know if I believe the number.  I mean, and I think a lot of the numbers probably flow through traffic from people coming through  search engines.  And so whoever buys it's going to look at that and probably discount that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know who's going to buy it, though?  So it makes sense.  It'll be an old media company that just is desperate at this point to look hip and new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, these things are being right now.  Old media companies don't know how to run out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What exactly do you mean by flow through traffic?  Because are you saying that enough people are linking to stories that are linked on  DIG to actually impact Google rankings?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I just I do a lot of searching on news stories and daily tech stories, but I rarely see a  DIG link at the top of the search results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'll see it all the time.  I mean, if you type in the name of almost any phone, it'll be there.  And if you do something more recent, like something that's breaking, it will be there  because what does a site owner do the second they have something breaking?  They put it into DIG.  Therefore, DIG has a higher page rank than a lot of the destination sites.  Therefore, DIG gets the higher rank.  And so you have that sort of flow through traffic as opposed to direct traffic, people  typing in the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I know I don't visit the DIG site that much.  I look at DIG's feeds all the time, and then I click the links and go to the sites they're  referring to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right now, people are investing in things based upon non, you know, they're investing  not on earnings or revenue.  They're investing on other metrics.  And that's when things get a little frothy.  But hey, congratulations to the Facebook guys for getting that done.  And congratulations to DIG if they get it done.  I'm psyched for them if they sell it for three or four hundred million.  Go tell them somebody's got to figure out how to get it to that valuation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go tell Mark Cuban that froth isn't valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, listen, hey, it's a frothy time right now.  Who knows?  You know, tomorrow might, you know, we're taping this on Sunday.  It's OK to say that, right?  I mean, tomorrow might be Black Monday.  And we had a brutal week last week in the tech stocks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fortunately, we've got Veterans Day.  I don't think the markets open tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Tuesday could be a disaster.  So, you know, what happened?  Why were the stock?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's your take on what happened to the tech stocks last week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I just, you know, people are getting nervous about obviously all the housing issues  coming home to roost and they're serious and people are covering them up.  Sounds familiar, right?  Sounds like Enron time.  And so, you know, we've all seen this move before.  Bad news.  Everybody expects bad news is coming.  And the extent of the bad news was played down.  The malfeasance was greater than people thought and it would, you know, existed.  And then that puts people into a mode of paralysis.  They don't want to spend money on marketing.  Already the second and third tier advertising players are saying, oh, you know, it's a  weak market and that's why we missed our numbers.  Well, usually the weakest members of the herd are the ones who feel the advertising pull  back first.  Right.  Google will fill it last.  And so what you're going to see over the next six months is the advertising market is pulling  back.  And so probably the reason why things are getting sold right now and these deals are  getting done at high valuations is because people know now is the time to sell.  That's probably why DIG is selling now because they know this is the peak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I just want to say we have had more.  We have more ads now than we've ever had before and we have more contracts coming in.  So we must be in the right business.  I don't know what business it is.  You're a first tier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you have the largest podcast in the history of podcasting.  So like that exactly conforms to my theory, which is the third tier people feel it first  and then the second tier people feel it.  It's like in the conference business.  So like, you know, some C level conference, all of a sudden nobody shows up and pays $2,000.  There's no sponsors.  Then the B level conference gets hit and then maybe Web 2.0 gets hit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So when should I prepare for the downturn?  Just so I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think the other way around.  Post Christmas.  Dane?  Post Christmas, you're fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  Just my assistant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think what happens in these situations is the fourth tier outfits lose everything and  people still have the money and they want to put it somewhere.  So you probably profit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the Amazons of the world survive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well it's a flight to quality.  How long have the Amazons been saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In the novelist business, for instance, I mean the storytellers do very well in the  downtime.  People standing on the unemployment lines need something to read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is something to say for the sense that the writers strike, do you think might help  a little bit in the content market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Might help readers if people know what books are anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know that Storm Swarm is a wonderful novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Star Swarm.  Star, Star, Storm, Swarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Star Swarm.  Love that book.  Is it also available in print format?  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah, and very much so for tour books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And better bookstores everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Absolutely.  It's going to be, listen, bottom line, it's going to be very interesting.  Six months.  Will we see a crash?  Smoke them if you got them.  Really?  No, it's not going to be a crash.  What it's going to be is, you know, there's a lot of smaller companies right now, you  know, Web 2.0 shops that are two people, three people, and they might be able to just live  off their Google AdSense, you know, and what's going to happen is the people who have overbuilt  and who have huge staffs and not enough money and who are counting on a third round or a  fourth round, you know, like mid-tier things like a Tecna Rati or something like that,  it hasn't gone one way or the other.  Six apart.  Hasn't gone one way or the other.  Hasn't gotten bought.  You know, it's still in growing mode.  So those are the people who would be at risk.  I don't think six apart will have a problem, but obviously Tecna Rati's got problems.  So you know, those people who are in what I call in the trench, they're between funding  rounds, they're between profitability.  Their next round of funding just may not be available to them because what's going to  happen is the VCs feel less optimistic and they say, we have to protect the strongest  members of the herd.  And you know, like the mama with the babies, the mom and the fastest cattle run and one  or two get left behind for the lions.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I got a question just to bring this back to the original dig valuation.  So in the last year, they've gone up by what?  Almost a factor of nine or 10 in terms of uniques by at least two or three different  ranking systems.  You don't consider that going beyond the original core audience or do you think there's a lot  of people spoofing their...  No, sorry.  Now I'm just starting to look at this and get a few more numbers in here.  It seems like they've grown quite a bit beyond the original million.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The question is, are those people typing dig.com in and are they real members who come back  over and over again or are they pass through traffic?  Are they people coming through a search engine?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As an interesting question for everybody in the audience who isn't really familiar with  selling advertising on websites, what's the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The difference would be that it could go away very quickly.  So if all of a sudden Google says, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google could go away if somebody could come up with a better search engine.  Google ain't going away.  Facebook is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, Google's not going away.  But Facebook is not reliant on Google in any way.  Hey guys, remember Alta Vista?  Yeah, Alta Vista, yes.  Google's vulnerable.  Google's absolutely vulnerable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think somebody was creating like a brand new search engine.  Like Mahalo maybe or something.  Maybe it was like human powered or something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The truth is people use like three or four search engines a month so there's going to  be plenty of food to go around.  But in answer to the important question about dig, I just wonder about that because if that  went away, you know, Google decided to take out comparison shopping engines and their  whole businesses went flat line.  If Google said, you know what?  All of these social bookmarking sites, Propeller, formerly Netscape, Reddit, and you know, these  people who are getting high rankings because they're linking to something else on an intermediary  like that, they might pull them out and then you have a problem.  I don't know that they're going to do that, but that would be the risk that somebody would  have to risk when you're selling something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't that make you a little nervous that Google has that kind of clout?  I mean they could put whole industries out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the good news about it is that when you have a big sword like that, if you use  it unfairly, people are going to revolt.  So you know, when you saw this whole thing happen with the links, Google responded very  quickly to reinstate people who they felt had been, you know, caught in the dragnet  unfairly.  The page rank thing you mean?  Yeah.  I mean, I dealt with, you know, a bunch of people who asked me like, hey, can you forward  me on to somebody at Google, which I did as a favor.  And you know, not that I have any influence, I just happened to have a contact or two who  I said, hey, this person's a good person.  They probably shouldn't have lost a rank.  They want to do the right thing.  Please tell them.  And Google went and told people, hey, here's the right thing to do.  Here's how to avoid the problem.  Interesting.  So Google, you know, with great power comes great responsibility.  They're not going to abuse it.  And Google's in the business of making everybody money.  People forget majority of money that Google makes is not made on their sites.  It's made on AdSense and other people's sites.  So they are in a symbiotic relationship with the content providers.  If they were to be heavy handed with blogs or New York Times or whoever, I guess, or  it is, you know, people might revolt and remove Google AdSense, which I think during this  whole link thing, a couple of people said, I'm not using Google products anymore.  I don't think that'll happen.  There's a natural stasis that occurs, you know?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's talk about Palm a little bit.  If we're talking about a downturn.  Who?  Palm.  Remember them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't we talk about General Magic instead?  Do you think it's that bad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think it's that bad?  Smartphones obviously have hurt PDAs, but the Palm Trio was the smartphone of the last  year or so.  But what happened?  It's like a little longer than that.  Well, what happened then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, where do you start?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Palm.  Don't start crying on the call.  Getting emotional.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Palm hasn't released a new PDA in over two years.  It has 44% market share, but that PDA shipments were 728,000 units last quarter globally compared  to say a million iPhones in a couple of weeks.  Blackberry sales of 3 million.  So it doesn't look good for PDA.  PDA sales down 43% over the year.  That's the 15th consecutive quarter in decreasing sales.  So the smartphone is the big thing.  But Palm's in the smartphone business, aren't they?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of quiet here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can tell you what my son told me just at breakfast this morning.  He raises money for the rocket industry and increasingly the capital is coming in from  overseas and he'll have to do more overseas trips.  And he's been a Trio fan from the beginning, but he says he's going to have to go to something  to Blackberry because the Trio doesn't work outside Mexico in foreign countries.  It's a CDMA.  And it's just that simple.  It isn't going to be useful where he's got to go chase the fish.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now what's interesting is that they canceled the folio and yet there is so much excitement  over this Asus EEE PC, which in many ways is about the size.  You've played with the new PC, haven't you, Will?  I just ordered one and it's going to come next week.  I'm excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, it seems amazing that everybody was ripping on the folio.  This is the folio.  It is awesome in that Asus has succeeded in doing a lot of great cool things.  Wait, are you talking about the EEE PC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The triple EEE PC, this little two-pack.  I'm sorry.  I spent three days with it.  It's got a lot of hackery potential.  It's cute.  But I don't know if, personally, I think the folio was probably a better idea for a lot  of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I think the thing I like about it is that, A, it's made Linux pretty usable.  It's just really dead simple to pick up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As long as you only want to use the applications they preload, you're comfortable with it.  I'm comfortable with OpenAuth.  If you're thinking of this as the classic grandma or grandpa PC, it's great as long  as they only do things that are on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I ordered one.  I want a small Wi-Fi PC.  I could do email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait till you use the keyboard.  I got to say, it's like going back to the old Toshiba portages.  It's going to be a two to three week learning curve for most touch typists.  It's that bad.  It's that small.  I grabbed the smallest people with the smallest hands I could find, and the spacing on the  keyboard was difficult even for them.  It's a neat device.  It's a fun device.  But I think the hype on it has been all out of proportion for what it is, especially when  you realize for $400, you've got four gigabytes of storage, a 900 megahertz processor.  Unless you're a Linux hacker, you're not updating with any software.  You're not putting any software on there that didn't come with it.  It's a neat piece of hardware.  I see a lot of people doing some fun stuff with it, but you're still going to ... It's  kind of like an overpowered ... It's more powerful than a PDA.  The screen is smaller than a full-size notebook, and it's not that much cheaper than a full-size  notebook at the low end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tell me what it's got that the old iMate phones didn't have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's not a phone.  It's a Wi-Fi laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I understand, but the jazz jar iMate was a lot more than a phone.  In fact, its problem was that ... It's too much more than a phone.  It was too much more.  It was everything but a phone.  It wasn't very good as a phone.  Otherwise, it was a heck of a nice little thing to carry around with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a notebook with a seven-inch screen and about two hours of battery life if you  leave the Wi-Fi on.  Basically it's an 800 by 480 screen.  It's a usable screen, but a lot of the websites have gone to 10 by 7, so it's a little small  for browsing.  It's got a Mozilla browser, which is excellent.  It loves me some open source, especially since the Mozilla browser is popular enough to have  plugins for pretty much anything you're going to try to run on the browser.  I've got to say, yeah, it makes Linux very usable as long as you're comfortable with  not having a desktop and you accept their metaphor for interacting with the applications  and storing your software.  For us, it's probably not going to be too big of a problem, although we might find it  annoying.  For newbies who don't spend a lot of time with computers, they're probably going to  be okay with it.  For people in between who are used to the desktop metaphor and the way icons and applications  work, they may find it a little confusing.  Desperately, it could really use more memory.  It's only coming with a half gigabyte of memory.  You can upgrade it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you need more memory for, though, out of curiosity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does it feel slow?  Yeah, it's slow.  It's pig slow.  I mean, I like it, but it's not a ... I'll say this.  It's faster than a PDA, but it's a slow ... it's a Celeron M or a Celeron Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It felt slow.  I mean, I understand that the specs are low, but it felt slow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it felt a little slower than the N800 or the N810.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, Will, you played with it a little bit.  Was the keyboard too small for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's one of those weird things.  You sort of think it's too small.  It does feel too small at first, but you sort of get used to it.  I mean, I remember the closest thing I can describe it.  It's sort of like almost typing on the Cyan 5.  You see, I loved my Cyan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you a touch typist or two finger?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Touch.  Okay.  You can't do it with just a touch.  You can, but it's going to take getting used to.  I'll tell you what ...  Do you remember the Atari portfolio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I loved it.  It was wonderful.  It was wonderful, but you had to be a two finger typist to use it.  I remember sitting in a bar in Moscow, and Tom Bethel and I, each one had one.  We pulled them out, and Tom sat there and wrote his column doing two fingers, and I  couldn't write on the thing because I am a touch typist.  My fingers just aren't that small, but I loved it.  That's what always bothers me.  The only one of those things I know of that I can use is the Mobile Pros from NEC.  They have a keyboard I can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, man.  I just like little things.  I mean, I'm getting one in the next couple of days.  I already bought it, so it's too late for me to cancel, but ...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but Leo, you buy a cell phone at the drop of a hat.  Well, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I buy everything I see.  It's fun.  I'm very curious about it, and I love the idea of having something small enough to kind  of carry around with you, and you could do email surfing and maybe write some stuff.  I wish I could be awake to report.  By next week, I'll have a good report for you.  By the way, I love the Scion 3A.  I would type with my thumbs, and I wish there was something like the Scion still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wish they'd started with a $300 version instead of the $400 version.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, remember, you could spend $100 more and get an OLPC, and in fact get two.  You get one for yourself.  The One Laptop per Child program actually starts today, and they're in manufacture.  You'd get one for yourself, and one would be given to ... Actually, it's the same price.  It's $399.  One to a needy kid in the developing world.  These are very interesting laptops.  I've been tempted to get one of these, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you played around?  You can actually download and emulate basically the Linux version and run it on your machine  if you want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Smalltalk, and it's a Squeak OS.  You can actually ... If you download Squeak ...  Oh, it is?  Yeah.  If you download Squeak, you can download the Squeak virtual machine and run it.  It's very cool.  In fact, Max has just announced they're going to donate SimCity for it.  The old version of SimCity for it.  I don't know.  I like these little guys.  Now, this one is mesh, which is interesting.  It has Wi-Fi, but it's mesh, so one computer can have the internet access, and then it  can be spread by the other computers.  Which means the whole classroom could use one slow access point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're vastly different products, too.  That's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  I'm not ... Only in price are they comparable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When do you guys think millions of people will be carrying devices like that, whether  it's this one or something else like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be a phone, obviously.  This is what Google's doing.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When will that happen?  Because the day that you have millions of people routinely carrying something like that  is the day the paperback industry collapses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's already starting to happen.  I mean, like what William Gibson said, the street finds its own use for technology.  It's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The street finds its own use for things.  Sorry, it's one of my favorite quotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever.  I've never been one for details.  I think it's going to be phones.  The weird thing about the OLPC is I wonder, and I think a lot of people, other people  wonder, why is Negroponte limiting himself to one form factor?  Would it not be better to make a $50 device that was more like an iPhone and have four  times as many kids having it?  Maybe you can give countries a choice.  You can buy 10 laptops and you can buy 100 of these PDA type things with a thumb, like  the sidekick.  The economy's of scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hardware is on economies of scale.  You need to have a single design and you need to basically turn eight chips on the motherboard  into two over the course of the lifespan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is a mini laptop the best method?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When did they start planning this?  I mean, the whole idea of a ... First of all, a touch screen is expensive.  It's more expensive than a regular screen and they wanted a self-contained unit.  Remember, the original plans had the crank on the side to be able to generate power for  the battery to really take it completely off a grid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  At this point ... I'm glad they dumped that crank, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if you talk to people who've come back ...  I guess if you're not on the grid, it was a good thing.  Yeah.  A lot of the world is not on the grid.  It makes me wonder how they charge their cell phones.  That's a whole other line of conversation.  I think the real reason for that, Jason, is to get any kind of economies of scale, you  really have to have a single model and dump all of your potential purchases into that  to basically make it as cheap as possible, as quickly as possible.  Having multiple units like that, unless you could do it with the existing case and molds  and stuff, just becomes more expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to wrap this up because we're getting long here.  I hate to stop because you guys are so great and this has been fascinating.  Before we end, though, I do want to talk a little bit about Facebook and these social  ads.  Oh, it's really good.  What did Facebook announce and what are they doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, so a couple of things.  One, they've launched their own Google AdSense style ad buying, automated ad buying.  If you sign up for it, on the top left of your Facebook, it will say ads and pages.  You can basically build an ad and you can say, I want only people in Florida, I want  only women in Florida, I only want women between the age of 30 and 60 in Florida, and I only  want women.  As you're doing it, it says, okay, you're starting with 30 million members and then  it's like now you have 1.5 and now you have 300 and now you have 30,000.  Then you can say, I want to pay by the impression or by click and it's only a penny a click  is the minimum bid.  Although when I did some testing, I couldn't get any clicks out of penny.  I think I started getting clicks at like six cents or something and I did some at 12 cents  and started getting some traction.  I'm looking at it now, I had eight clicks on 13,000 impressions, which is a click through  rate of 0.06.  So it's pretty dismal, but it puts these ads on your page and this is the thing I've  always said is if that ads on your little page there in the middle, it's one of 50 clicks  above the fold.  The chances of somebody clicking on it are extremely low.  However, there's a lot of pages going on, so maybe they can make up for it with volume,  but the system is so elegant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I make any money on my Facebook page?  No.  Or it all goes to Mark Zuckerberg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's basically how it's going to go, but I think for applications they're going  to come up with something.  I think that that's the issue.  Who owns the domain name and who owns the ad revenue that's going to make a site like  Ning really start to shine for the high end.  There's also this-  Just like some blogs.  When you started your blog, it was probably leo.blogspot.com or leo.werbrez.com or werbrez.org.io  or whatever.  Then all of a sudden it's like, you know what?  I need this money.  I want the money.  So now it's dacorak.org.org.blog.  I'm going to take the time to get my own software and put it on my site.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got to plug in even without being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dacorak.org.blog.  My name's the frog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I got minima.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually have a recording of him somewhere.  I'll pull it out here.  What is the deal though with-  Adam Curry.  There's recommendations in here too though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're talking about the whole thing with the New York Times has been covering?  Yeah.  This is it.  Here it is.  Social ads.  I was just talking to a professor at the university.  Basically there's a New York privacy law that says your name and likeness cannot be used  for advertisement without your permission.  Oh.  So-  Part of the social ads program which would insert endorsements from your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I just watched this movie and they know this about me because I put it in my Facebook  and now they're going to send to my friends spam saying, you know, Leo really loved whatever  and Kearney 4 and you should go see it too.  Wow.  I think that's brilliant though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's brilliant but how do you make any money?  I don't make any money apparently.  So apparently they get to use your name and endorsement to make money for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except in the state of New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're definitely pushing the envelope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why would you be interested in that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not interested in it.  Facebook is.  The question is will people stick around if Facebook starts doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, Facebook is going to make it one out of literally 150 links on the page.  So it's so subtle right now.  As a matter of fact, I don't think people can tell their ads if you, I don't know if  anybody's seen them yet but if you go to your Facebook profile and you know, the Facebook  homepage-  No, they look real.  Yeah.  They look like regular things.  The content.  Up in the tiny right hand corner it says like sponsored something, you know.  I hate that.  It's very, very confusing.  I don't like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Isn't it worthwhile having a Facebook page?  I never bothered with any of that stuff.  Oh Jerry, you're over 30 Jerry, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm well over 30.  Believe me Leo, I am over 30.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Jerry, you'll sell 100 books a day.  Really?  Really?  Yeah, absolutely.  You probably would, you have tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of fans.  You'll have them all friend you.  You'll have 5,000.  Every time you post something like a photo of the new book cover or you post five photos  of different book covers, people will click on that and then you put on there, hey, go  buy the book and put your Amazon affiliate on it and your Amazon affiliate obviously  pays you more than the publisher.  Yes, yes it does.  Great irony of ironies.  Amazon cares more about their authors than the publishers.  And then you can start making money and you're getting paid twice.  So you would, yeah, absolutely.  I have-  Is that how you use your Facebook page, Jason?  Do you friend everybody?  I accept every single person who asks to be friends with the exception of like obviously  models and strippers who like on MySpace try to add you and then you have all strippers  and stuff on your MySpace page.  Not good if you're married.  But I accept everybody because of social cost.  Wait, honey, who is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why is she your top friend?  Hello, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you know, the big, for me the social cost of saying no to somebody and then them saying,  oh, you don't remember having lunch with me back in 1998?  I mean, it happened to me once or twice.  And then I had somebody who wanted to meet Adam Dell, who is Michael Dell's brother.  And I met Adam Dell like twice in my life.  You know, he was a VC in New York.  So on LinkedIn, somebody was like, you know, I declined forwarding the thing.  And I said, you know, I don't think it's a fit.  And the person's like, you have to forward it.  You can't not forward it.  The social contract of LinkedIn is that you add your friends, I add mine, then we share  them.  He added me probably by importing his whole address book.  Right.  And number two, I don't know him that well.  Certainly not enough for you to go bust his chops.  And you're probably 99% want to meet his brother anyway.  So that's why you're doing it, which I have no connection to his brother.  So you know, go find him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, I don't add everybody, but maybe I'm not.  I don't know.  I add my friends.  I don't add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Boy, you guys are making me feel old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's easy, Jerry.  You go to Facebook.com and you sign up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, Theo, what will happen is that when this tweet is broadcast, I will get two or  three people who really know a lot about this who will send me detailed instructions on  exactly how to do it.  And I thank them and I probably will do it.  But it's sort of the nice thing about being me is that there really are a lot of people  out there who are willing to help me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We call them minions and I use them.  No, they're not minions.  I use many minions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Fans, fans.  Readers, not me.  Good heavens, no.  Friends, colleagues, readers.  Hey, it's mortgage, man.  Yeah.  Mortgage payers.  Don't follow that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I call them the twit army.  How about that?  Is that safe?  Yeah, there you go.  Mobilizing the twit army.  Yeah, we have mobilized them in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Except everybody because you would be the number one user on a lot of these services  or like Scoble level.  You realize like if you hire Scoble to work at your company for $100,000, let's say, and  he would probably bring you 20, 30, $40,000 worth of value just in the marketing of his  social presence.  Think about that.  So as a company, if you were to hire him, you would get like a 20, 30, $40,000 discount  on his presence.  That's a really interesting phenomenon.  That is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that's what, obviously, PodTech got a huge bump from having Robert there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody would.  I mean, yeah, of course.  And we have a huge bump from Veronica's social presence.  And I told Robert, hey, if you ever need a job, become the abuzzman from a hollow and  just tell us what we're doing right, what we're doing wrong.  And just every day talk about how we could do our job better and talk about the search  space and social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right.  It's advertising.  I mean, it's just bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he could just do it credibly and just talk about it.  And that's why I said abuzzman because he could just kick our ass if we needed to have  our ass kicked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm famous so people can use me for traction and pay me a squat load of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Basically, everybody who's in your social network is worth a dollar to the employer.  $0.50 per dollar.  I'm starting to add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, I just want everybody to know I will add from now on.  Everybody I turn down on Facebook, I am so, so sorry.  I will add you.  But the problem is Facebook stops at $5,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Currently.  Then what do you do?  Currently.  Then you start something on the Patreon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just killed my MySpace account because my son got into it.  And I think if you know all these strippers are on the front page, I don't understand  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So maybe I should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Facebook, Twitter, Facebook, Twitter, create a name group, create you have a delicious  account.  What I realized was you can actually build your network on delicious and have a bunch  of people who are in your network there.  And when you share stuff, you know, people have opted in.  So they listen.  And, you know, my my blog, the number one, two, three, four, four, four is our social  networks, whether it's Facebook or Twitter or Pounce or Jaiku.  The only one that's greater is Google.  Even YouTube is an incredible way to get traffic.  Like we we we started making recordings of video games that we're covering on Mahalo.  And we put them on YouTube and they get 40,000 views there.  You know, 10 percent of people wind up clicking back through to Mahalo.  So YouTube is actually a marketing vehicle for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Social networks are amplifiers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many click throughs are you getting on that from YouTube?  Like five or 10 percent.  OK, sorry, I thought you said 40 percent.  I was like, oh, my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's I mean, that's Jerry.  Jerry, have you talked about your book and what you were thinking and made a little video  and put it on YouTube and then syndicated that to your Facebook page and other places?  People would read it and they would click through and you'd have thousands of people.  I mean, it takes effort.  But if you look at Scoble, he's a machine.  When he mentioned something, it gets 10, 20 thousand people know what it is.  Right. Maybe 50,000 sometimes.  Right. He sent the switch bike when he did that whole like Facebook and Mahalo  and are going to change how people search.  Oh, yeah, that was good. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Technical here. Is it in doing that, is it worth going through and doing it in high depth or?  Doesn't matter. That doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not important at this stage in the game.  Probably better not to. It's going to be flash anyway, so it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, everything. Everything that goes through YouTube gets recompressed and they're relatively low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For essentially a regular JVC $500 camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Fine. Fine.  You know, I saw somebody just sent me a Vimeo.  Vimeo is doing HD flash now.  And actually, I was surprised how good that can look.  But who cares? It doesn't. You don't need that.  It's just you. It's you talking.  Look, we're sending out here. We're sending out 64 kilobit audio.  People listen to it. It doesn't.  I don't think the quality of the audio or the video is what matters.  It's the content.  I am going to wrap this up.  And this has been one of the best shows ever.  I really thank you all for being here. Fascinating stuff.  I hate to stop.  Two parter.  We could. Yeah, we don't do two part tweets, but I'll tell you what, I will invite you back next week.  How about that?  I'm in. I'm in.  Jason, you're no longer on the B list.  I'm going to promote you up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? But why don't you wait to see how much now you get for this one before you make that offer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff or Jason still smarting from episode 57.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Classic. What are you talking about?  Smarting was like a virtuoso performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought it was great. And I loved it.  And you know what? Many people's eyes.  That's an example of it doesn't matter what you do.  I still get email people saying that was a great episode of that episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course. Andrew Barron telling me that I was a failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And he was going to be the next Rupert Murdoch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. Oh, man.  Yeah, I get conversations about that show, too.  Is that funny? I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I love. That's why I love this business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People know that. Let me point out that this time I reset my Vista machine before we started.  It works. And it hasn't died on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It worked great. My Vista machine.  There's a rigging endorsement.  My machine hasn't died.  It hasn't crashed in an hour, ladies and gentlemen.  Steve Palmer is breaking a desk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you may remember last time I was owed, it crashed twice.  I know. I know.  And I could hear you, but couldn't talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was awful. It was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Windows Vista screwing up podcasts everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everywhere. Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever,  our audible recommendation is somebody who's actually on the show.  And I love that.  Jerry Pornell has written so many good books.  He's working on the sequel to Inferno, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Inferno. I will get it out the door this week.  Oh, this week? Inferno.  Inferno 2, it gets to the publisher this week, which means you'll see it in stores in about a year.  I got to talk to you about that.  Yeah, publishers are very fast.  They live in the modern age, right?  You know, I turn it in now and it'll be a fall book next year.  We're going to work on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Star Swarm is our audible pick by Jerry, by the great Jerry Pornell.  If you haven't read any of his books, you said this is one of your best, you said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love it. It's my best juvenile.  Great. And, you know, like all juveniles, it's like online juveniles.  Adults can read them.  But I think your teenage kids will love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't wait. Can't wait to get it for them.  Thank you so much for joining us, Jerry.  Don't forget, JerryPornell.com.  That's where the best of Chaos Manor still goes out.  You do. I get it in the email.  It's so nice to read it.  I've been reading it for, gosh, has it been 30 years now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unbelievable. So almost 30 years.  And it is still, it's the column that inspired me.  JerryPornell.com. Thank you for joining us, Jerry. Really appreciate it.  Thank you.  Jason Calacanis is at Mahalo.  M-A-H-A-O-L-O.  And that's, of course, where you can see the Mahalo Daily.  That's Veronica's new show. Huh?
