Start time: 299.00

Start time: 300.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Personally, I don't think so.

Start time: 305.40
End time: 310.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he's been there for, he's been there for 13 years as CEO.  And then since the beginning.  Yeah.

Start time: 311.00
End time: 325.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He was Bill Gates' roommate at Harvard.  I don't think it has to be either or.  I think it can be both.  He was quit fired.  Fire quitted.  Fire quitted.  It was time.  It was clearly time.  He knew it.  They knew it.  That's probably it.  I mean, nobody, I don't think anybody has ever.

Start time: 326.00
End time: 341.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And myself included.  Yeah.  He's not.  And then in the last quarterly report, Microsoft had to take a $900 million charge for Surface  RT.  That after a billion dollar charge for the Xbox Red Ring of Death.  An overture, a billion dollar charge.  He's not been a great CEO.

Start time: 342.85
End time: 359.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's kind of kept the ship roughly on course.  I mean, they started out with a huge product, of course, that being Windows.  And they were doing very well in that area.  And then they've come out with a lot of different products over the years.  He inherited that.  He inherited that.  So that has continued to be the moneymaker for them.  And they've come out with a lot of different products and a lot of different things over  the years.

Start time: 360.06
End time: 360.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Windows and Office.

Start time: 361.04
End time: 373.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Microsoft was a big hit.  There were some forays into the phone world, like the Kine, for example, and then like  Surface tablet.  So there's been some highs and some lows.  Mostly lows.  But the problem is they haven't.

Start time: 374.06
End time: 376.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One thing, name one thing Bomber did that you could say this was a hit.

Start time: 377.66
End time: 387.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the only thing that really happened during his tenure that was really a hit was  Xbox.  But that wasn't really even.  Yeah, but that wasn't really his like thing.  You know, Robby Bach.

Start time: 387.45
End time: 427.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, Xbox.  I mean, so he allowed Xbox to exist in the way they made it possible for it to become  what it is, which is they allowed them to take that Xbox and turn it into kind of an  independent division in the company, the entertainment and devices division.  And that was what it required.  It needed to be outside the box at Microsoft in order to become successful.  If it was a product of Microsoft's normal process, it would never be able to compete  in the video game market.  And so, you know, that's why it's the exception.  They did something very different there.  And yeah, they took a write down on the Red Ring of Death, but that's done now.  And now they're the most successful video game console in the market.  And they're making a ton of money.

Start time: 428.88
End time: 437.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Bring this is the biggest hit that Steve Ballmer ever had.  Chasing a cake at CES.  That's it.  We now know this is his story of his.

Start time: 437.00
End time: 442.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And, you know, I just think that makes me think that he's not a developer.  Developers, developers, developers, developers.

Start time: 442.00
End time: 449.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I got to praise him for that, because that's the thing that I think he did that  was most interesting and most atypical of a CEO is he was enthusiastic.  What's wrong with that?

Start time: 450.82
End time: 458.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But there's a difference between enthusiastic and crazed, like rabid, like like unhinged.  I think that was just his way, though.

Start time: 458.10
End time: 458.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that is just.

Start time: 459.26
End time: 481.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The thing is, he comes off unhinged.  And I actually I got privy to an internal Microsoft video a couple of years back that  it was never it's never been released to the Internet.  And I saw it and he it was like an internal all hands.  And it was a developers, developers, developers like moment.  And he was totally unhinged.  I mean, I could not believe that this man is running anything like even a household is crazy.

Start time: 482.32
End time: 483.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, OK. We don't have to get like personal.

Start time: 484.60
End time: 489.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, but I'm just saying like he he is really was he was he Microsoft's crazy uncle?

Start time: 490.64
End time: 503.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think so. Oh, I've also often called you my crazy uncle.  Oh, thank you. Well, I've run around saying developers.  He remember that one moment at the Seattle at the Superdome where it was a guy in the front row who had an iPhone and he took it and he put on the stage and stomped on it.

Start time: 504.38
End time: 515.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, he actually fakes that he put it down, but he made like oh, and then he like kind of fakes.  He didn't actually destroy. Yeah, he didn't actually destroy it, which is kind of even more sad.  I mean, if you're going to do that, just actually stomp on it.

Start time: 516.30
End time: 518.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can afford to give him a new one.

Start time: 518.12
End time: 543.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What I was trying to say earlier is that there hasn't been I mean, there's been innovation, but there hasn't been some a lot of crazy outside of the box thinking.  In Microsoft's part in the last 12 years, and so they kind of need it.  But what worries me is that it's still the same board of directors.  So and Balmer is still going to be on board with them while they go through this process of finding a new CEO.  So it doesn't give me a lot of hope that there's going to be a huge shift in direction for them going on this current path.

Start time: 543.40
End time: 554.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't the problem really that Microsoft is at the end of the line in general?  It's very difficult to take a company like that and reinvent it, retool it, live in the new.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, yeah. What about it?

Start time: 555.08
End time: 561.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a company that has was kind of on a decline and now they've brought in some some major new talent to change the direction of the company.

Start time: 562.08
End time: 569.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They still have a tough time defining what it is that they do.  Like, I don't know. Yeah, I'm sure there's a mission statement that's put somewhere, but I don't think anyone really knows what you're out on.

Start time: 569.20
End time: 584.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I mean, success, but it might not throughout their whole process of finding their new CEO.  They were trying to decide if they were going to be a media company or if they were going to be a product company.  They've never decided on a company and they haven't, but they're leaning more on the side of the product because Mercer Mayer is not a media person.

Start time: 585.00
End time: 614.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you been to Yahoo lately? Do you know that they have a Google toolbar at the top of Yahoo?  I mean, it doesn't say Google, but they've duplicated the Google bar.  Go to the top there. If you scroll up, Chad, see that it's the Google bar.  It says home, email, sports. And this is on if you go to Flickr, it's on Flickr.  I think Marissa's innovation is taking stuff that she did at Google and applying it.  Yeah, well, yeah, I want to get that. That's a search to Microsoft.

Start time: 616.28
End time: 653.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, they were doing a search. I don't know what. Anyway, I think the problem with Balmer is that he is not a product guy.  He doesn't understand product. He doesn't know a good product if it dropped out of the sky and hit him.  And this is why the surface and the can and all these different things were allowed to exist.  And they existed right alongside the Xbox, actually genuinely good products with great strategies.  So they need somebody who understands what people want. If they can get that, if that is the only thing that changes and the board stays the same,  Balmer still on the board and Bill's still on the board and the only thing that changes, they get a product CEO, they will be in such better shape.

Start time: 654.00
End time: 677.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's more than someone who understands what people want. I think that's one step.  And then the other step is to understand what can be developed that people don't even realize that they want.  That's the really, really, really hard part. That's like, yeah, that's when you go all the way back to the Steve Jobs thing.  Here's a tablet. People are like, I don't need a tablet. And guess what?  Now it's like the largest growing market in the mobile computing space, which is not even the mobile computing space. It's just the computing space.

Start time: 677.48
End time: 683.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  From day one, that's all Microsoft ever has done is imitate others.  Catch up playing catch up. Even Windows was imitating the Mac.

Start time: 683.34
End time: 712.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they bought the they bought an OS or they know they licensed it. Seattle DOS. Yeah, was MS DOS.  But you also you have to stay ahead of the game. I don't think anyone realized what the cloud was going to be.  They just Microsoft didn't realize it. Everyone knows now because it seems it's so ubiquitous.  That's what's going on. But like, you know, Google didn't need to create office an office suite per se the way Microsoft did.  They just created something that works online and is an office suite.  It's all great at Google. I actually acquired Google Docs. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 712.46
End time: 775.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, Google buys stuff. Yeah. Yeah.  But they're very strategic and they they buy things that they they actually see a future in and they are more often than not.  Right. Right. Google Maps. Another good example.  Microsoft's problem is that they they actually do. I think they their R&D side is massive.  They test all kinds of crazy ideas, ideas that are so crazy that they shouldn't even be testing them because they're like the courier, which was well, no, that's not what I mean.  That is not what I was the fold open tablet. That might have been interesting, but they didn't they didn't actually.  Yeah, they didn't actually agree like that. I mean, the Microsoft R&D group does all kinds of crazy stuff, but they don't actually productize any of it.  And so what they wind up with is a very like watered down milk toast version of their R&D products that come out before their time, but not quite ready for the market.  And then they miss and they miss every single time. And it's such a simple pattern to watch happen.  They need, as Dave David said, they need a product guy.  Well, I said they need a product guy. He said they need a product guy who understands what people want when they don't even know they want that thing yet.

Start time: 776.46
End time: 784.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the key here. But there's little nuances like when they the Microsoft surface  and the first time anyone saw that, I think most people like, wow, that's amazing the way that you can manipulate what you're seeing.

Start time: 785.20
End time: 799.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they announced that right after Apple's iPad announcement.  No, I thought they did. Are you sure?  Yes. Apple announces the iPad and Microsoft says, no, we've got a big ass table.  I think the table was out there before the iPad.  Oh, the table, not the tablet.  The big ass table I'm talking about.  Yeah, yeah. The original surface.  That's what I mean. Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 799.18
End time: 800.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was out before the announcement of the iPad.

Start time: 801.20
End time: 810.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This was a labs project. Apple said we're going to do the iPad and Microsoft said, oh, unless I'm completely wrong, chat room will fix me.  I know. I'm like looking at it.  Watch for your correction.

Start time: 810.02
End time: 810.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The table comes first.

Start time: 811.18
End time: 824.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think so. I think that they maybe the iPhone came first.  They the touch came out from Apple. I'm pretty sure it was the iPhone, not the iPad.  And as soon as they announced the iPhone, Microsoft said, well, we've got surface in the lab, which they probably did beforehand.

Start time: 825.06
End time: 827.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that would have been cool to see more of if they hadn't done it right.

Start time: 828.00
End time: 829.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the iPhone had come out in 2007, 2008, the surface.

Start time: 830.40
End time: 832.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I liked the surface table. I thought it was awesome.

Start time: 833.38
End time: 835.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 836.04
End time: 842.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Japan, you can order food off of your table and it's awesome.  I want to do that here. Is it a surface?  It's not a surface. It's there. It's different.

Start time: 843.18
End time: 853.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's surface in Vegas at hotels, on cruise ships.  There was some surface. And when if you've ever played with it, it doesn't work so good.  It's a it's a neat idea. That's just not OK.  What do we got here? History.

Start time: 856.23
End time: 858.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's great. Like you've got the idea of real time fact checking.  Conceived in 2001. Yes, of course.

Start time: 861.70
End time: 886.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It predates and this was Microsoft's point was they didn't announce it till 2008.  After they saw the Windows phone, they had to say, oh, wait, we've been since 2001.  You know, they were doing tablets since 2001, too, by the way.  Yeah, very publicly.  Well, it seems to me that some have said this is the case.  The problem with Microsoft is structural that you have structure.

Start time: 886.20
End time: 906.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's culture. It's culture.  You know, it's less wood, fewer arrows.  And you know what companies like Google are moving towards and Apple is always saying no to the right product.  More wood, fewer arrows. Yeah. Yeah, I got it.  It's picking the right thing. Yeah. Right.  They don't say no. They say yes to everything. Right.  And is it any wonder? None of it's very good.

Start time: 907.00
End time: 920.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fiefdoms like office that are powerful and say to other products.  I think Courier was an example.  I think they're going to do that because it will eat out our core product and they kill and they kill products because of this, you know, infighting.

Start time: 921.10

Transcript:  So what Palmer said is that we're going to become a devices and services business.  We're going to get it. You know, we're moving away from PCs.  We're going to do devices like surface and we're going to services like Azure.  The transition is going to happen. It's going to take longer than I can be here.  I'm 57. So I want somebody in now who can take that through all the way.  Mary Jo Foley of Windows Weekly got to talk to end all about Microsoft.com.  Got to talk with a bomber the day of his announcement.  She said, what's your biggest regret? He says, oh, you know, I've actually had it.  He was, by the way, very folksy with her.  It's kind of an interesting interview.  I've actually had a chance to make a lot of mistakes and probably because, you know, people all want to focus on period a period B.  But I would say probably the thing I regret most is the what shall I call it?  The loopity Lou.

Now, it's funny because that mistake, while people were paying attention in the business, knew about it was not a public mistake.  Microsoft had announced Longhorn its next generation windows.  And, you know, a year or two into the project said, oops, we can't do it.  So we're going to rewrite everything from scratch.  Then Vista came out, which was a public failure.  He's not talking about that. He's talking about the failure of Longhorn as if anybody even knew that happened.

I think it became very apparent to the board that Windows eight had failed and that Bomber was leading the company in a in no particular direction.  And they said, we need to have somebody in here who at least can make an effort at this.  By the way, Mike Bomber made more money that day than he has in his whole career.  700 and some odd million dollars.  Another billion dollars.  Seven percent jump in his stock value.  Yeah, seven million dollars, almost a billion dollars just for quitting.

Transcript:  Well, because people are excited that maybe, you know, a big deal is like Microsoft.  I mean, it's kind of like, you know, you can fire even if you say he was an amazing CEO.  Sometimes, you know, he could be a good CEO of another company and in a sports team might fire a coach who's good, but they just need to hit the reset button.  I mean, with a lot of strategy.  So it's going to be really tough for them to you know, there's a lot of talented people, but for them to find a CEO that's worthy of of writing the ship.  And there's a lot less work that needs to be done there, I think, than at Yahoo, I think.  But, you know, it's a it's a huge task to find someone who's both a savvy businessman and extreme product visionary because you don't always need the CEO to be the visionary.  But at a company like Microsoft, I think it requires that kind of a visionary or businesswoman or businesswoman.  A good point. Let's get a woman in there.

But anyway, Bill, I'm reading the transcript.  Bill respects my decision.  I mean, it's one of those things when if it's, you know, ultimately, these kinds of things have to be one's own personal decision.  In other words, Bill did not try to talk me out of this.  Right. So at the very least, the board didn't say, oh, please, Bill, Steve, please stick around.

I mean, if you look at their stock price over the last 10 plus years, it's flat and flat means down because your stock has to rise at least with inflation in order to be keeping the dollars level.  So, you know, he it's it was time.  It's time. I think, like I said before, the board knew it.  He probably knew it. It's it's the right moment.  I agree. It's the right moment. It's past due.  Let's not drag this out any longer. So who do you hire?  I don't know. Maybe Jay, Jay, I'll bring him back.  Maybe Robbie Bach. Some both those guys did not get along well together at all.  It's got it's not it's not both.  It's one of the other. I would love to see Jay Allard in there.  That'd be pretty. Jay Allard is the guy who convinced Bill to bet big on the Internet.

Transcript:  We're going to take a break. We've got a good panel here and a good story.  I think that Steve Ballmer story is great. The rest of it's all downhill.  So thanks for watching. We'll see you all next time.  Our show. No, I'm not going to say that because we want you to stick around because we've got four ads to do.  Our show is brought to you by...  Hey, I'm honest. I'm the Steve Ballmer of Twitter.  I don't know. Advertisers. Advertisers.  He did that, you know.  He actually responded to his developers' developers and said, it's advertisers.  Our show today brought to you by an advertiser we love, squarespace.com.  You know, earlier today I brought Google down on the radio show and I just wanted to tell Google,  you should probably go to Squarespace and ask them how they do it because you cannot bring...  I was showing your set-top box spreadsheet on Google Docs.  I mentioned on the radio show. Now, admittedly, the radio show is in 200 stations and probably like a million people.  If so, if maybe 20,000 people tried to all visit that spreadsheet, it probably would bring it down.  I don't know. It did. Whatever happened. Maybe it was coincidence.  But Google's CDN in Mountain View went down.  So Squarespace, go ahead. Everybody go, let's say, to inside our blog, insidetwit.tv, inside.twit.tv.  That's our Squarespace blog. If you all go there at once, all... everybody watching, still you can't bring it down.  Squarespace is the best hosting plus the best content management system all mixed together into one.  Now, I admit we don't... we haven't really taken advantage of the great Squarespace templates there.  We've got to update that. It's pretty straightforward.  If you visit squarespace.com, you'll see these new... gorgeous new templates.  Click the Get Started button and you'll get to select a template to start.  They have designers working all the time to create new templates.  The newest is Momentum, which is a full-bleed, gorgeous website for a photographer or a designer who really wants the images to stand out.  But then if you scroll down, you'll see all the different customers using Momentum.  And each one is unique, different, beautiful.  Squarespace.com. Here's the deal. Go there right now. Click the Get Started button.  You've got two weeks. Just mess with it.  You can import data from your existing site. They support all the blog APIs.  You can set it up. Play with the templates.  The nice thing is the templates are decoupled from the content.  So you can try every template, one after the other.  It's just... press a button, it switches.  If you decide you want to stick around, I want you to try it. Great prices.  Starts at $8 a month.  The commerce is only $24 a month for the annual plan.  When you get the annual plan, you do get some additional features, including a free domain name, and they'll hook it all up for you.  Unlimited bandwidth. You'll never get a bandwidth bill either. I love that.  Squarespace.com.  Do tweet us with your Squarespace website so we can highlight...

End time: 1705.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But as soon as Google bought them, I noticed that that search worked almost every time.  Yeah.  So they must have fixed the back end on that.  They bought them in June for more than a billion dollars to keep them away from Apple and Facebook  and everybody else who was courting them.  Actually, I think Waze already had turned down Apple.  Apple didn't want to spend enough money.  And now we're starting to see the traffic alerts.  But what's not in there is the ability to add a traffic alert in Google Maps, right?  Right, probably.  You see that there was an accident, but you can't.  In Waze, you can wave your hand over it and say, you know, there's a cop.

Start time: 1705.38
End time: 1709.49

Transcript:  What?  I love Waze though.  I'm actually kind of glad though that it's not in main Google Maps because I think so  many people use Google Maps and there's just, it opens up.  People who use Google Maps are not used to using it the way that people who use Waze  are used to using Waze.  Right.  And sometimes when you cross the streams, you get wonkiness.  I'm glad not to have like all that junk data.

Start time: 1740.00
End time: 1745.78

Start time: 1747.08
End time: 1761.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google's had a lot of difficulties with traffic in Google Maps over the years.  Remember, they were shutting down the traffic data for a long time.  And I guess they're bringing it back now with Waze because they have a better traffic data  system, but they've had difficulties getting it right.

Start time: 1762.00
End time: 1774.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is funny because it wasn't, was it Garmin or TomTom that was using the Google Maps traffic  API?  A lot of companies.  A lot of companies were.  And it wasn't very good.  So that kind of ruins the whole.  You drive a Tesla, right?

Start time: 1782.08
End time: 1806.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And what actually we were complaining about on the drive up here, that you can get the  road sensor traffic data through onto the map in the car.  But when you're doing drive time predictions, it won't add that to it.  So like if I open my phone and go to Google Maps and say, how long does it take to get  from Petaluma to San Francisco based on the traffic?  And the phone will say it's going to take you over an hour.  The Tesla would say, no, it'll take you 40 minutes.

Start time: 1807.90
End time: 1824.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The reason why that is, is because they use Google Maps, but they use their own actual  navigation system.  Meaning like the actual drawing of the route and where are you going to go and how long  is it going to take.  And should you avoid this street and take that street?  All that is done on the Tesla side and it sucks.  It's bad.  I think you should send the car back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Burn it.  But I think it's cool that there's so many amazing features in ways and people don't  want to have that as ways by itself.  And I think the slow integration of the things that might enhance Google Maps is the smart  way to do it.  Because most of what people are talking about and seeing some of this is just they're trickling  in small elements that they think will enhance it slowly.  And so then hopefully that allows them to, as they start taking more of it, allows them  to be smart about the implementation and also even seeing user feedback.  Yeah.

Start time: 1861.60
End time: 1863.66

Transcript:  And by the way, the ways Street View is ending up in the ways map editor, which is really  weird, but I guess it helps you do a better job of fixing the map if you could see where  you are.  Now, apparently the FTC is retroactively because the deal has already gone through reviewing  the deal.  Can the FTC after the fact say, oh, give them the money back?  It's no good.

Start time: 1885.33
End time: 1906.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Awkward.  That is awkward.  So normally when you do a deal like that, there's a kill fee or some kind of a fee associated.  So yeah.  So if the deal falls apart for whatever reason, then Waze gets a couple hundred million bucks  for their trouble.  I don't know if they can, but I mean, I would imagine the FTC can do whatever the hell the  FTC wants to do.  Just put them all in jail.

Start time: 1907.00

Transcript:  That sounds like the right course of action.  This is escalating quickly.  Burn the car, put them in jail.  I'm going to take charge.  I want to be the kick-ass CEO at Microsoft.  That's how you handle these things.  By the way, Google is apparently now, no, no, Google won't admit this, but according  to sources and this is Peter Kafka, who's pretty good at all things.  D Google's CEO, Larry Page, Robert Kintzel, who's the boss of content at YouTube, met  with the NFL recently, led by Commissioner Roger Goodell.  Apparently there might be some bidding.  Google might bid for the Sunday ticket package.  Currently, DirecTV has that for a billion dollars.

Start time: 1945.26
End time: 1986.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's extremely smart on both sides.  Wouldn't it be cool?  Because it's clear over the top, I guess that's the word, right?  It's clear that people get their entertainment and they're used to getting their entertainment,  getting more and more used to getting their entertainment.  Over the internet.  Yeah, over the internet.  Disintermediated.  So, I mean, the thing for the NFL is I think that it behooves them to make sure that they  also have a deal so that it can be seen by people that don't necessarily have, I mean,  I think they want it to be seen by as many people as possible that are willing to pay  for it.  So like the way it is right now for DirecTV is I could stream any football game on my  phone if I either one have a DirecTV account or B can prove to DirecTV that I am not capable  of getting service via one of their settlements.  Otherwise, I'm not getting NFL Sunday ticket.  What would the third have been in that list?

And it could be, this could be the turning point if you can get something like this to happen.  I had a guy called a radio show today.  He says, I want to watch Pac-12 football and it's not on Time Warner.  It's not on Verizon Fios.  You can't watch it.  And even though it's streaming on the Internet, they all do this.  HBO does this too.  You have to sign in using your cable company.  Prove you actually pay for it on regular TV.  This is an example of how we're stuck in the Middle Ages.

But the way that you can use HBO Go and you can watch any episode of any series that HBO's ever made, ever.

Transcript:  So Spacey, it's too long to play the whole thing.  I highly recommend you watch it.  He was speaking in Edinburgh at the International Television Festival presented by YouTube.  And he talks about the House of Cards Netflix deal.  One of the things Spacey says is that we shopped.  Well, he said, here's one problem.  Pilots.  He said hundreds of millions of dollars are spent every year in the pilot system to make TV shows, of which fewer than half ever get produced.  He said we didn't want to do a pilot on House of Cards because it's an artificial constraint in that first episode.  We wanted to do a tell a story that would take 12 episodes to develop that was very subtle.  You can't put enough in a pilot to tell.  We didn't want to do a pilot.  So when Netflix said, you don't not only do you not have to do a pilot, you can produce all your episodes.  We'll put them all on the Internet at the same time.

Transcript:  They're still lucky.  Very lucky.  Well, so hard to make like everyone was giving.  I love Netflix and I think they did a good job with this.  But when they developed House of Cards, they did the same formula that any other good TV series is.  They, you know, they came up with a good script, got some good actors and they created the same same methods of making.  Except they did.  But except they did, their distribution model was different.

Transcript:  And it's also a totally different method because they have the ability to create an entire season up front of the content.  I mean, a lot of times when a show goes to television, it gets cut off halfway through, it gets canceled or it makes it through the first season.  And then the second season gets canceled.  Suddenly the whole show is changing.  It's very format.  It's changing its storylines because of these restrictions based on the season lengths.  So this actually gives storytellers the opportunity to tell the full story without having to worry about getting canceled.

Damn it.  Kevin Spacey.  He's saying it right.  No, wrong.  That a blockbuster movie could only dream of.  And all we have to do is give it to them.  The prize fruit is right there, shinier and juicier than it's ever been before.  So it will be all the more shame on each and every one of us if we don't reach out and  seize it.  This guy speaks like an animal.  And I want to leave you with the words of a man as good as any to address the nexus of  commerce and art, Mr. Orson Welles, who once said, I hate television.

All of a sudden, Ryan Block.  I'm not a pipe guy.  OK, good.  But there's so many different models.  Get off the pipe.  We're content creators.  And we shouldn't have to worry about pipes.

Transcript:  Netflix has already made the money back for House of Cards.  They said because of the number we got something like six hundred thousand new  subscribers for Arrested Development that paid for Arrested Development.  It's been a very effective strategy for Netflix.  I agree.  Orange is the new black.  Another example of somebody who has a track record.  And this is one thing to point out.  In every case, these guys have a track record.  It's Jenji Cohen.  She did Weeds.  She's really, really good.  Right.  And it was a it was a good book that they're basing it on.  And I agree.  I love it.  Can't stop binge watching again.  You can't stop watching it.  And in fact, that's a good example.  I think that show of all of them was most crafted for that model because the way that  show is done is each episode is about one of the people in prison with her and their  backstory.  And so there's it's an it's it probably wouldn't work as well weekly.  I don't know why, but I just feel like it's designed for Netflix.

Transcript:  Well, you know, that's interesting that you say that because actually I would think that  a more self-contained episode would be more, you know, network TV, you know, normal, because  that way if they do cut off a season, you have more the episodes are more encapsulated.  But yeah, who knows?  I mean, they did a lot of interesting stuff, I think, with that deep pain in our chat room.  Alex isn't coming back.  She's not going to be on the show.  The character plays Alex.  Why not?  Laura, what's her face from that 70s show?  She's got busy.  She's only going to be in a couple of episodes next season.  I'm very sad.  Very sad.

And pocketing more of it.  And they'd get more?  Maybe the NFL should become a broadband provider and then just distribute their own games.

But we would quote, never automate the cool part of driving, which obviously is getting  out of the parking lot and merging.  Exactly.

Yeah, but imagine how cool it's going to be when you, even if you're driving off the,  you're mainly driving off the freeway, as soon as you merge, you join the quote unquote  network.  So you're not only making the car able to be using its sensors with precision, but it's  also able to see what the other cars are doing through a network.  So it allows it all the traffic to flow extremely efficiently.  So you can have a packed freeway and still be driving 70 miles an hour.

That's the way of that's the American way, but you don't really need to own a car.  You just need a car a little bit.

It would be a little awkward to me if the third leg that they added to that stool was  gold.  It's a little weird.  And nothing else.  It's a little weird.  Right.

Make it champagne.  And then people will look at me with envy and awe.  That's why people do that, right?  The other thing that I also poo-pooed, but now I'm thinking, because everybody seems to  agree, is thumbprint or fingerprint in the home button.

What if I, instead of even seeing all that, what if when I hit the home button, it just  Oh, I see it's you, Ryan.  I like that.  I think for thievery, it's good.

Start time: 4311.52
End time: 4338.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  I actually don't know yet.  It has to be their goal.  I think we got to find out.  I think that they want to offer something in the same vein as the five, but maybe- so  five form factor, so taller screen, but not have it be as expensive as the five.  Right.  So maybe it will sit alongside the 4S, right?  Because every year they take last year's model and they make that the free one.  So there's a free, a 99, and a 199.

It's possible they can do it.  And if they did do it, I wouldn't be surprised because I'm never surprised when they do anything.  They like to throw curve balls.  But I think what the system they've got is working and if they can find a place in that  lineup for a 5S device that does not cost as much-  Will they call it the 5S?  The 5S.  Yes.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I don't think so.  No, because I mean, at that point it literally has to be, if you're going to sell it to rural  India or sub-Saharan Africa, it literally has to be a $20 device.  There are only a handful of companies who can make phones that cheap.  And they're the dumbest of dumb phones.  They do nothing effectively.  So Apple is not there yet.  This phone is not the answer to that.  It will just be a cheaper iPhone.

We've got to move people a little faster forward because we've got to have LTE, we've got to  have lightning, we've got to have the new aspect.  So in some ways it's a bridge product.  That makes a lot of sense.  Or it could be.  iOS 7.  A lot of people are saying this is going to be the real surprise.  I know some people at this table have used iOS 7.  What's the surprise?  Surprise!  It's totally different!  We've seen 7 betas.  By now we have a pretty good idea of what it is.

At least he would if he had a lot of mailing to do.  He probably doesn't have a lot of mailing.  It wouldn't really be good if you just, you know, want to mail a postcard once in a while.  But if you're in the business like you're at Etsy, you know, you're going to get a  lot of mail.  You're going to get a lot of mail.  You're going to get a lot of mail.  You're going to get a lot of mail.  If you're in the business like you're at Etsy seller or an eBay seller, if you say if your  business sends out mailers, flyers, invoices, you shouldn't be going to the post office  to buy postage.  And you really shouldn't be using a postage meter.  You know, postage meter ink is 100 times more expensive than inkjet ink, which is already  100 times more expensive than blood.  So don't.  That's science, by the way.  That's science.  So don't be doing the postage meter.  Just be doing Stamps.com.  It lets you buy and print official U.S. postage with your computer, your printer, no special  ink needed.  Stamps, whenever you need it, you never have to go to the post office.  I mean, never, because everything you do at the post office, you can do at Stamps.com.  You can print right onto the envelope.  So your logo is there, your return address.  It'll pull the address of the recipient from your address book, from QuickBooks, from Etsy,  Amazon, eBay, PayPal, you know, it just, it could suck that right up if you're doing international  mailing, fills out the forms for you.  In fact, we asked people how they're using Stamps.com and Veronica Lucas, no relation.  No relation.  She has a business called Poppets Pockets.  They make reusable cloth items, reusable cloth diapers, that kind of thing, do a lot of international  mailing.  She said before she used Stamps.com, it was such a pain for her.  She's filling out forms, waiting in line whenever she had to ship to Canada.  She had a lot of customers in Canada.  It was a real pain.  She heard us talking about Stamps.com.  She actually heard about it on the show.  She says, shipping to Canada is the reason we started using Stamps.com and the reason  we continue to use it every time we ship.  The customs forms are simplified at my door pickup.  It's awesome.  It's awesome for you too.  Here's the deal.  You can go to Stamps.com right now and get a very special $110 bonus offer.  Includes $55 in free postage coupons.  You can use those over the first month or two of your Stamps.com.  I think it's like over several months.  You also get the really great digital scale.  You get a supply kit.  Now here's the key though.  Click the microphone at Stamps.com in the upper right hand corner and enter our offer  code TWIT.  The $80 value on the front page turns into that $110 bonus value, including a four week  free trial of Stamps.com.  You got to try it.  You're going to love it.  Stamps.com.  Then the mail carrier comes to you.  They pick it up.  You never have to go to the post office again.  I see people waiting in line at the post office with a postage meter and I just think why.

Within five to 10 years, by improving the efficiency of networks and mobile phone software.  If Mark puts up, if he puts a few billion into this for research and development, I  can see this could happen.  And it's certainly in his interest, as it is.  Let's face it, Google's not being completely altruistic.  Project Loon is about people using internet more, where they make some money.

Transcript:  It doesn't look like a comfortable position she's in.  I liked the profile very much in Vogue, actually.  I just read it.  And I also read the Business Insider article that Nicholas Carlson did was amazing.  It's long, but I highly recommend reading it because it was just fantastic.  What did he say about Divo?  It was a lot of first person accounts of her rise to CEO of Yahoo.  It goes back and forth between a lot of people think she's a very cold, very calculating  person.  She's very shy, but a lot of people say that she's very good at her job.  She's not a cold, I can't remember what the word is.  She's an introvert is what she is.

There's a new biography, which I don't know if I'll read, the unauthorized biography.  Is that what he was talking about?  Yeah, it is.  Nicholas Carlson in Business Insider.  I think people don't expect a CEO to be an introvert.  I think she's a little shy.

Start time: 5684.34
End time: 5715.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently, once you get her talking though, especially about stuff she's passionate about,  which is usually the consumer facing side of things, the customer experience.  I think that's really where she shines.  That's why people were worried about promoting her to CEO of Yahoo or bringing her in as  CEO because they wanted someone who was very ingrained in the corporate mythos, who knew  how to run a business from that point of view, from the business point of things, which she  stayed out of at Google.  Now she always paid more attention to the experience for users.

Start time: 5717.92
End time: 5729.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's how I would take that any day.  I would take somebody who's quiet and cares deeply about user experience over Monkey Boy,  who doesn't care at all about her.

Start time: 5729.24
End time: 5740.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's why the board was so divided on that decision because half of the board really  wanted someone like her to come in and shake things up and the other half was not interested  in that kind of CEO.

Transcript:  It was Dan Loeb who was really a contrarian and an activist investor who said, you've  got to get somebody good in here.  And I think while it's too early to say she's succeeded, it looks good.  Yahoo, for the first time this month, beat Google in the number of impressions.  First time in seven years that they've done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The thing is, it's so hard for Yahoo in a day where it's so easy for Facebook and Google  to kind of poach really talented product people and engineers and developers.  And she's kind of making the corporate culture exciting enough that people want to stay now.  She's becoming like, I don't want to say she's becoming their Steve Jobs, but from everything  that I've read, she's kind of starting to get that excitement within the corporation,  within the young people who are working there.  They're really excited about her as CEO.  And I think that can only lead to good things.

Start time: 5813.84
End time: 5826.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is exciting.  Now, this is behind the scenes, but you fist bumped me when we were talking about the picture  of her dressed in this beautiful designer gown.  I said, I think that that's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what I loved about that profile especially was there was a lot of, she got a lot of hell  about requiring Yahoo employees to come in and not work remotely.  Right.

Start time: 5873.12
End time: 5875.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which was seen as kind of a slap to work at home.

Start time: 5875.26
End time: 5902.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially considering she was a new mother and she had the capabilities and resources  to have a full-time nanny, to have all those resources available to her 24-7.  But she just was like, I just want Yahoo to do better and people do better when they're  here in the office.  And so when you kind of break it down, she's looking at those reasons.  She's not really thinking about the other reasons, which may or may not be a good thing  at the end of the day, but it kind of lets you see what her point of view is.

Start time: 5902.84
End time: 5938.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it was mishandled.  It probably could have been done more privately.  But as a company owner, I really like to see employees in there.  There's a synergy that happens when employees are talking to one another.  A lot of our people are, like Tom, work out of their home in LA and that's something we  have to put up with.  I would far prefer to have them in studio, but just because there's a synergy that happens  when people are all together.  But the nature of this business and the fact that we're in the middle of nowhere requires  that many of our people are in fact not in the same studio.  But I'm a little sympathetic.  I understand why she would want everybody.

Start time: 6010.18
End time: 6035.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I well, I think for this kind of a metric, it is reliable.  I think in most cases, com score is not reliable because it uses a sample based sampling based  collection, which means that they're not really counting.  That is not an actual number of visitors.  That is what they believe the number of visitors to be.  And usually, I mean, I've seen variation of 10 to 20 acts in terms of what it actually  is in reality.

Start time: 6036.38
End time: 6060.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, yeah, because you've seen actual, you know, the actual numbers from sites and compared  to what com score is saying.  This does not include Tumblr, which is a number of 38 on the list.  So or something like that.  So if you add 28.  So if you add Tumblr's 38 million uniques, then they're pretty strong.  That's and it shows you the strength of the Tumblr acquisition.  You know, that's it adds another third or something to the total.

Start time: 6060.48
End time: 6086.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's interesting that O'Malleyck from Giga wrote this scathing article saying like they've  got these numbers of web has be a com score.  But if you look at like their digital ad spend that the money coming in, it's gone down 3.37%.  It's got like all of their mobile, all of their mobile is gone way down, even though  they want to focus on it.  It's on and on and on, but he just tries talking about other numbers that they're not performing  in and how many people aren't doing using them for search.  Obviously, how many people aren't using them.

Facebook showed that mobile can they they're succeeding in major area of growth.  And that's important.  So Yahoo has to show everybody has to show that and gadget has to show that mobile is  where people are getting online now.  That's true.

The people we work with these days, we're just talking about this, are not in the office.  They're on the go.  They're traveling.  They're all over the place.  Clients, you can't make clients come in for a client presentation.  So to work efficiently, to keep that strong connection with your team, you got to get  some way of meeting that's like face-to-face, as good as face-to-face.  We actually use GoToMeeting for all of our meetings.  Even if it's just going to be a phone call, we set up the GoToMeeting.  It's very easy to do.  It's a click of the mouse.  Send them the link.  That way we can have a phone bridge as part of the GoToMeeting service.  But if I want to show them a screen, a PowerPoint presentation, if we want to collaborate, if  I just want to see their face, because there's built-in HDFaces video conferencing now too,  it makes such a difference.  It is the way to meet online, to be on the same page literally, to see each other face-to-face.  Meetings are so important.  I know teams that actually run GoToMeeting all day so that they can collaborate.  It's like they're in the same room.  One of the nice things about GoToMeeting is that one flat rate gives you unlimited meetings  as often as you want, as long as you want.  I want you to try it free for 30 days.  You can get it on your Mac, on your PC.  They've got free apps for all the mobile platforms.  You can even present from an iPad.  You can be sitting at the pool and just show yourself from the neck up.  No one will know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing.  The thing I'm really curious to see is if Samsung and if Apple, for example, come out  with some kind of wearable tech like that, is it going to be the kind of thing that is  widely adopted by men and women both?  There's a problem I had with the Nike Fuel Band and some of the other band type devices.  And I know this is not true of every woman, but for me it just didn't really go with my  look.  It is ugly.  No, it's ugly.

I'm never drinking wine again.  I'll drink my luts up.  They're saying that a lot of fashionista types are picking up the Fuel Band because they  like tracking how much they're walking.  And then they also had a full spread with all Google Glass in the entire issue.  You kidding?  Yeah, there's a four page spread with Google Glass in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe there's an opportunity, as everyone sees, thinks that, not necessarily wearable  tech, but there's going to be more watches.  Samsung's got one.  They're coming out with another one.  Different looks, you mean?  Sony's made one.  There's going to be more watches that are sick to your phone.  But I bet you more of them down the road are also going to have capabilities that might  rival the likes of what the Fuel Band does and the likes of what the Fitbit does.

Start time: 6645.80
End time: 6664.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's why I'm hoping that if, you know, Samsung and Apple, in my mind, usually do  some of the best designed products out there in the space, in the consumer space.  So I'm hoping that they either have a variety of different style options available or, you  know, if somehow they can get that magical single device that looks good on everyone.

We think.  That's the rumor.  I'm waiting for Apple.

Transcript:  I interrupted you.  Some people.  Selfies are addictive.  But I think this whole study on the internet makes people depressed or Facebook, I think  it just harkens down to the fact that human beings are social creatures and you need to  have something of substance.  So if you're going to be doing stuff online, you have to be doing it with real people that  you give us about.  And if there are people that you just have these basic like coincidences with, like your  acquaintances with them.  You happen to go to the same high school.  It makes you depressed because you're not getting what a human being needs, which is  like real contact with people.  It can be virtual contact, but it has to be someone that you legitimately have a real  relationship with.  Otherwise, you're going to be lonely.

This is what I've been told.  If you live, if you attempt to live on rabbit, you'll die.  You think you're being nurtured.  You're being sustained.  You're eating delicious, roasted rabbit meat, but it will kill you because it's so lean.  And Facebook is like that.  It's the appearance of connection without.  I think you're exactly right.  Without actual connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if that's, I think that's more just the way you interact online.  It's not Facebook's fault.  It's the user's fault to some extent, I guess, because they think that they're getting it  from it when they're not.  But then it's just also the ways that you are interacting.
