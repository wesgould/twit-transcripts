I'm a podcaster. Yes, sir. And I was thinking the other day, because I used to when people said,  what do you do? I always said, oh, I have a radio show. I would never say I'm a podcaster because  I didn't want to get in the long conversation of what is that? But I realized we're, as you said,  Ben Peak podcast. People know what it is now. Yeah, man. We're hot. They're like, they're surprised

We're flying out to  the podcast movement, the expo in Orlando in August, where the feels like temperature is a balmy 105  degrees. But it's going to be fun. I think this is this the first podcast movement since we became  peak podcast? I think maybe. So it'll be interesting. Be interested to see how people,

Transcript:  I think that was a Serenity Caldwell who was debating whether to spend that money and make  her own lightsaber. I believe it was anyway. She did. What's the debate? If you're there,  you might as well. Do you get to take it home? I'd be afraid if it were a real lightsaber,  I know I'd cut a hand off before I even got it out of the place. We just like, oh, darn it.

Start time: 439.44

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, video games don't cause violence. Or do they? Actually, this is a timely conversation.  Brianna Wu just wrote a piece, an opinion piece for the Washington Post. And this comes up because  after the tragic shootings in, well, I should start with Gilroy, although you start going back,  you'll go back a long, long, long, long way. But Gilroy and then Dayton, Ohio, and of course,  El Paso, Texas. And unfortunately, two things are blamed immediately. Video games and mental

Start time: 494.46
End time: 504.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  illness. Except that they play video games in countries all over the world. And they don't  have mass shootings like this. That's a good point. So Brianna's piece is titled, video games

Start time: 504.76
End time: 515.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't cause mass shootings. But, and this is an interesting take on it, gamer culture does encourage  hate. And you were, of course, the subject of a lot of hate during Gamergate. Yeah. I mean,

Start time: 516.20
End time: 569.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  HM was literally formed to target me and other industry women. Yeah, Leah, this is  some really serious subject to talk about. But I three times over the years have gotten threats  from HN so serious about conducting a mass shooting, I've had to talk to the FBI about it,  because I found it extremely credible. One of these was just a few weeks ago. So, you know,  this is a very, very, very serious topic. I come from the game industry, I really wish I could sit  here and just tell you there's no problems. We're doing great. But it's not the case. And I think  when you're seeing repeated mass shootings, planned executed, you know, manifestos posted on  HN, I really think it's time for our industry take a very hard look in the mirror. I think this is a

Start time: 569.76
End time: 621.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  really interesting take because generally it comes down to, yes, they do know they don't.  They cause violence, they don't. And of course, there's examples, plenty of examples,  right here in this studio, of people who play violent video games and are not even angry,  or, you know, let alone slapping anybody. So it obviously, in the vast majority of people who  play video games are not violent people. But I think your take is unique and interesting, which is  the culture of video games is a little, and any, all it takes is a minute in a, you know, in any  game, if you're listening to the back chatter and the taunting to kind of get this, that is pretty  ugly. You don't think that it leads to violence or do you? No, I think that our culture somewhere

Start time: 621.22
End time: 760.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  along the way became very fundamentally broken. I didn't get into this in the piece because it was  already almost 1500 words when I turned it in. But I want to take you back in time a little bit.  When Xbox Live, the very first generation of Xbox, the one before the 360, we take it for  granted now, but it really led the way for online multiplayer and matchmaking in a really seamless  way. And the man that was in charge of that at Microsoft, his name was Steptoe. He's a fantastic  guy and industry leader. And when Microsoft was kind of setting the norms for what matchmaking  was going to be on the consoles, they took very, very, very aggressive policies for the first  generation of it. They had a one strike in your out policy that they considered reading the terms  of service to be a warning. And they actually made the outcomes of bands public for people to go look  at. I met with Steptoe and I got to know him a bit before he passed two years ago. And he was telling  me about all the battles he had with Microsoft behind the scenes. When they moved over to the  Xbox 360, they were looking at the human cost of basically looking at all these automation reports  and looking at the loss of a player base from banning people for harassing behavior. So they  moved to kind of an automated system and they decided to kind of pit the jerks with the other  jerks in games. And we kind of laughed at it at the time, but I believe that one decision really  set our industry down a very different path. Because if you look at what started happening on IGN with  the comments at that time, if you look at the policies PlayStation adopted and later Steam,  there really became an expectation that you could say anything and behave in any way on these  platforms. And I feel like today it's gotten to the point where no, video games do not directly  lead to violence, but it is kind of a chamber where people are so furious that they are amplifying  each other. And it's very directly leading to recruitment in these kind of white supremacist  chat rooms. And I think we can see it directly leading to school shootings.

Start time: 762.22
End time: 856.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's interesting how it starts to become a safe space for hate, right? And this is,  in my mind, a problem in a lot of kind of closed communities or communities online that can be a  little bit insular. And video games end up building these platforms, not purposefully, obviously, but  multiplayer online video games end up building these platforms that can make it a lot easier  for people to kind of gather around specific ideas, even if that's kind of a bug, not a feature  of the game itself. And I think it's been really interesting to see the debate around this,  this around HN and Reddit and other websites. And it's really problematic, I think, for the  companies that build these platforms, because they still don't know what to do with it or seem to  know what to do with it. They try to build out their trust and safety teams. You have Facebook,  another place where hate groups can organize and have organized in safety,  trying to figure out how to build algorithms to catch stuff. And it's really, I just think  it's really, really tricky. And weirdly, a lot of these tech companies really need to think about  just building out their trust and safety teams even further than they already are. And that's  expensive. And tech companies don't always want to do that. But it really is becoming a bigger and  bigger problem.

Start time: 859.74
End time: 890.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to be careful because you don't want to get a bunch of old male senators  to say, oh, we figured out what the problem is. It's video games. Let's just ban violent video  games. All done. Definitely, definitely not. Because there's clearly many, many causes to this.  You could replace video games with Twitter and YouTube and a bunch of other things and say,  including bad parenting. I mean, you can go on and on and on. There's a lot of reasons this happens.

Start time: 891.14
End time: 910.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when you start to combine all of those factors together, when you have a confluence of bad  parenting, the culture, the games, the social media channels, the means of communication,  all of it starts to amplify. And that's where the problem starts.

Start time: 910.52
End time: 938.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It feels like a modern problem. It feels like something that we have as technologists,  but also society as a whole has been going in this direction for some time. And we're now  sowed the wind and we're reaping the hurricane. It feels like this is something we've been  building up to. But let's talk specifically about games. And then I would like to talk about YouTube  and other platforms. Brianna, what should gaming companies be doing differently?

Start time: 939.84
End time: 1045.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I really just before I say that, I want to echo what you're saying, Leo. It is unbelievably  critical that we don't take this too far. The liberal right to free speech in this country,  it is one of our greatest achievements as a culture. And we need to think extremely carefully  when we're talking about anything around here. That said, the conclusion I have come to through  direct interaction with HN for years and years of violent threats is I don't consider them different  than ISIS or ISIL, where we do freely take down those sites for recruitment. I do think it's  become a haven for terrorists, in my opinion, as far as actions that the game industry needs to do.  Again, I want to take you back in time. When I was thinking about starting my game studio,  there was a podcast on IGN called Girl Fight, where they got some of the best known women at IGN to  basically put a podcast together. It wasn't political. It was just about the games that  they liked. When we made Rocket, we actually took the Girl Fight formula and just copied it  and made it for wider tech. And in that era, IGN was very unwilling to go through and moderate the  comments and ban people for acting in bad faith and basically harassing these women.  I think what has happened is we've created a culture where there are no consequences  for that kind of behavior. So I think first of all, across the industry, not just in games,  but for game journalist sites and on Reddit, I want to see a lot more investment in the  terms of service. If you're threatening to murder someone, that's not a free speech issue.  Your account needs to be banned. And I do think that law enforcement needs to look into some of

Start time: 1045.32
End time: 1100.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the more serious threats. There is a legitimate concern and we're seeing it already because  8chan, which CloudFlare pulled the plug on finally last week, and Two Cows, their domain  registrar pulled the plug on. So everybody went to 08chan. And this is part of the problem with  this. You ban a Twitter account, they create a new account. You ban somebody on Reddit, they create  a new account. It feels like whack-a-mole. It doesn't feel like this is too easy to do.  It seems like a hard thing to shut down. And there's even this larger concern. There's the  motherboard article about 8chan moving to the, and I hate the use of this term, dark web,  because it's a silly term. But my fear is you force this underground, then it still goes on.  It just goes on underground. That didn't solve anything. But you don't want them recruiting.

Start time: 1100.56
End time: 1115.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is that the point? I do think in 8chan's particular case, forcing them to go into different,  again, I also hate that phrase dark web, but it does make it harder to access. So  I do think it's a step in the direction. We don't have a-

Start time: 1115.78
End time: 1119.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So put it back under that rock. We thought for a long time light would disinfect.

Start time: 1119.60
End time: 1153.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's apparently not the case. I think saying you cannot operate  this kind of website in a reputable company like Cloudflare or Reddit or something like that,  I think that's a reasonable step to say. But I just want to stress, Leo, this is not something  I say with any joy in my heart. It's a very serious action to take. But again, I had to  report to the FBI a credible mass shooting where thousands of people could have been killed just a  few weeks ago, Leo, from 8chan. I mean, this is serious stuff.

Start time: 1154.54
End time: 1222.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but that's part of the problem is it's impossible to distinguish the serious stuff.  Clearly El Paso, Dayton, we're serious. But it's impossible to distinguish the El Paso  shooters manifesto on 8chan from a dozen copycats who are just kids in their jammies.  I don't know how- I mean, that's when you send out the Secret Service or you send out the FBI  and you have them go interview on my guest. But I also really worry that- so one of the things  you're talking about, I take it, is this notion of domestic terrorism and red flagging. And this  is a debate that's going on in Congress right now and nationally right now. As it happens,  law enforcement, it's difficult for them to red flag an American because of this fear of chilling  effect on their First Amendment rights. And so family and friends who are saying, this guy is  nuts and has guns and I'm worried, can't necessarily go to the police and say, do something.  Is it the fact- is it the case, Brandon, that often the local police can't or won't do anything?

Start time: 1223.46
End time: 1269.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's just been my experience. I also think you cannot overstate just how poorly prepared  local police jurisdictions are to deal with online crimes. Here in Massachusetts,  we're relatively well-funding. I can tell you our cyber division is much more effective today  than it was at the start of Gamergate, but it was a ramp-up process to learn that.  These are very difficult problems, Leo, and we don't have one 100% solution, but we have 101%  solutions, if that makes sense. We have a lot of little things that we can do to make this better.  It's going to be federal laws, it's going to be local laws, it's going to be state laws,  but bullets don't care if you're a Republican or a Democrat. They're going to harm you either way,

Start time: 1269.18
End time: 1316.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and we've really got to tackle this. The other thing is, you talked about red  flagging a minute ago. You have to be careful, even if you are going to have law enforcement  go in and investigate these kinds of threats online, you have to be careful about how they  do that, because then you end up in situations like these swatting scenarios. Far too often,  our police in this country have become way too militarized and way too ready to pull the trigger  before actually investigating something. If we're going to take a more aggressive approach  to investigating these kinds of threats, at the same time, we have to reign in the law enforcement  and make sure that they're doing it in a responsible way.

Start time: 1316.82
End time: 1345.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and furthermore, I worry about government efforts in general. It's not too far from that  to go to the Chinese social credit system where suddenly you lose rights and privileges because  you're not a good member of society. Or in Turkey now, where they're requiring licenses  for streaming broadcasters, including podcasters, before they can make shows.  And almost always this is done with a very plausible rationale that, well, we're protecting

Start time: 1346.12
End time: 1491.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  public safety. I was thinking about this the other day. I mean, Leo, I think your point about  asking government to come up with tech solutions, which often gets really tricky, is really  interesting. I think, at least in my mind, you could see a scenario where you see more regulation  in terms of the government actually saying, stipulating to tech companies saying,  you have to spend this percent of your revenue on solving this problem. Basically saying,  more of a budgetary measure. You have to build a division within your company to solve this problem.  And I wonder if that would be a way forward in some scenarios. Basically, forcing tech companies  to look at this stuff more carefully and leverage resources towards it.  I think there's also an interesting culture conversation happening here.  On Endless Thread, in the beginning of the summer, we did a big series on vaccines and anti-vaxxers.  And what we found on Facebook was really fascinating because you discover on places like  Facebook, which has now actually sort of updated their policy on this stuff, people become more  radicalized. This sort of natural inclination of some of the algorithms that serve the information  to people who are not radical at all and are just kind of curious about X, Y, and Z is that over and  over they get further and further radicalized by the information that the platform serves them up.  I think even at that level, some of these companies have to be thinking more carefully about how they  serve information to people who are trying to access information. I know that that's a little  bit different than what we're talking about in terms of the gaming industry, but I feel like  there's a broader cultural conversation here about avoiding people becoming radicalized by the  information that pops up in front of them when they put in a simple search term.  And I think that's, I don't know, I feel like these two things are connected and  we should be thinking about it. Clearly there's a problem. But I also fear that there are people,

Start time: 1492.02
End time: 1579.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and there are people in every country, but in this country, who will take advantage of the fear we  are now under to create, I think, really egregiously awful laws. According to CNN on Friday,  the White House is proposing to have the FCC and the FTC police social media. And in fact,  what they want to do is they want to basically undermine section 230. And the name of the  act, according to CNN, and this has not been confirmed by the government at all, is the  Protecting Americans from Online Censorship Act. It would be an executive order that would force  the FCC to cut back on CDA Section 230 protection for internet platforms. And I think you can,  he's proposing this because it's his contention unproven that there is a prejudice against  conservative thought on Twitter and other social media. But I think you could also use this to say,  well, these platforms are being used to spread hate speech, and we need to have more control  over this. And that's what I worry about. This is a very challenging problem. And we're clearly at  a point where we all feel like something has to be done. But I worry about what we might do.

Start time: 1580.88
End time: 1643.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I would say this, Leo. I mean, you know, I'm running for Congress because we have to have  people thinking about these actions in a thoughtful way. I read what the Trump administration is  proposing. I don't mean this as a left versus right thing. It doesn't strike me as a thoughtful  solution that takes into account the entire problem. We need leaders, not just in Congress,  but at the state level, at the local level, thinking through this and addressing it. And  it's going to be a gargantuan challenge. But when you think about it, this is the information age.  These tools, these systems, they define our society. They define our friends. They define  how we get our jobs. We cannot shirk from taking this on. So I just think it's incredibly important  that we get technology-illiterate people making those decisions. Is that the problem with this?  Is that it's technologically illiterate? I think so. I think in terms of regulators, yes,

Start time: 1643.18
End time: 1665.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think most of the people that are in a position to regulate this are technologically illiterate.  And most of the people that are making proposals like Josh Hawley and the White House are  technologically illiterate. But at the same time, I think we also have a problem where the people  running these platforms and these companies are ethically illiterate. They are—

Start time: 1666.14
End time: 1669.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. They're technically illiterate, but they completely have no moral compass.

Transcript:  Exactly. And this is part of the problem. And they're willing to let anything go.  In fact, even in the cases of certain individuals, they're even exempting them from their rules.  In the case of Twitter, they have explicitly said that, no, we're not going to ban a certain  individual whose—the things that he has been saying are often quoted in these manifestos that  go—have gone along with these acts of violence. This actually—this proposal from the Trump

Transcript:  White House—and again, it has not—a draft circulated according to CNN, but it has not been  signed. Who knows? It could be a tribal one. But probably would have the opposite effect,  making it harder for sites like Twitter or even HN to ban violent speech.  So basically, under the draft proposal—this is CNN—the FCC will be asked to find that social  media sites do not qualify for Section 230's good faith immunity if they remove or suppress content  without notifying the user who posted the material or if the decision is proven to be evidence of  anti-competitive, unfair, deceptive practices. Ron Wyden, who wrote Section 230, said the whole  point of 230 was to allow platforms to get slime and hate off the platform without consequence,  without liability. If you undermine 230, it's going to make it very difficult for platforms to

And I just, I hate that they're forcing  us to go down this road because it's, as she said, this is, it's unbelievably serious. But  it's also at a point where we have basically been ignoring this for at least the last five  years since GamerKate. At the end of this month, it is the five-year anniversary since GamerKate.

When you think about the fact  that, and obviously the first amendment part of this conversation is also really interesting  because I do think actually that even, even though we, you know, I think we can all agree that tech  companies are probably underfunding their, their ethics departments, right? But, you know, I do  think there's been this interesting transition where you, you, you think about a KKK march  20 years ago or something like that, right? And that was happening on a public street.  There were rules about where those, those people could, could march. Police are, are there sort of  enforcing, et cetera, et cetera. And in some ways the public square has now moved online,  but it's no longer a public square. It's on private platforms, right? And, and it really does seem  like these private platforms need to now enforce some of these regulations that sure, if you want  to preserve the first amendment, okay. But if, if, if you're going to do that, you really need to  coordinate off in a way that, that preserves the safety of other users.

Transcript:  Ben, I have to say something about that because I went to the university of Mississippi and I've  seen the KKK march the streets many times in my life. One of the most inspirational things I ever  saw while I was in Mississippi was the KKK came to march at Ole Miss. This was around 2003, if I  remember correctly. And I want for you to imagine hundreds, hundreds of conservative Southerners  standing out there, turning their backs to that, them making it clear that they didn't stand with  them. It was, it was, it was such an inspirational thing. That's not something you can have online.  Also, when the KKK came to Ole Miss to protest, the police were there. And I can promise you,  if any one of those KKK people had done something that threatened a person of color,  someone would have gone to jail. I can promise you that as it is, law enforcement treats these kinds  of, of this kind of online activity much differently than we, we do the KKK. And I think that's why,  you know, we make people go before a judge, do process, follow the law, probable cause,  all of those things. But it's very clear to me, we need to fund more law enforcement online.

Transcript:  And totally, I totally agree with that. And extremism of all stripes, regardless  of political stripe, extremism feeds on fear. You know, whether, you know, whether you're talking  about the far right or the far left or anywhere in between, they're always feeding, they're always  using fear to build support for extremism. And that's, I think the key, and I don't know what  the answer is to get away from it. I think, you know, part of what you said, Brie, about  people turning their backs on the KKK, that's, that's an, you know, a tangible example of people,  you know, rejecting fear. I think that's what we need to do broadly is we need to come together  and reject fear, fear of the other, you know, fear of the unknown. And we need to find ways to say to  leaders that are trying to foment fear, you know, by, you know, by whatever means that, no,  that's not acceptable. We will not be afraid. And it's, I think it's only then that, you know,  we start to solve this problem. Let's take a break.

Transcript:  It's such an important discussion. It's such a difficult  problem. And I don't know what the solution is at all. And I somewhat fear that every site is going  to use it to exploit, is going to exploit it to push their own agenda, whether it's gun control  or banning video games or mental illness or whatever. And I don't know if there's any one  solution. I think social media is equal as as much to blame as video games. If you talk about,  it's not more, if not more, if you talk about somewhere that's, that's fostering a culture  and propagandizing and I mean, it's doing all of that stuff. It's a chance social media. It's not  a video game. It's social media. But I, you know, do you banning Twitter is not the solution either.

I didn't get into technology  journalism because I wanted to talk about this. I wanted to talk about the latest computer chip,  you know, but unfortunately the consequences of what we have wrought are starting to outweigh the  actual hardware. And I don't know what the answer is. I don't think we're well equipped to,  to solve it. Maybe we just have to ride this ride to the end to see what happens. I just don't want  the wrong solution to be promulgated. And then five years from now we look back and say,  well, that didn't work. Well, that's worse. We'll let's talk about chips.

Hiring used to be hard, right? In  fact, you're always hiring at the worst possible time, especially a small company like ours. You're  down a person or two and you've got to fill positions. Plus, I think for us, and I bet it's  true for your company too, I always feel like the right person is there somewhere.  The question is how you reach them. There are hundreds of job boards. How do you know which  job board they're on? How do you know what they're looking at? So it all starts with Zip Recruiter  because you post a job on Zip Recruiter, it instantly is posted on over 100 of the web's  leading job boards, including Twitter and Facebook, the social media sites everywhere. I mean, this is  going to maximize the chance of your getting to that person who's out there just waiting to find  out about your job, but they don't stop there. They go even farther. With Zip Recruiter's powerful  matching technology. See, a lot of people come to Zip Recruiter applying for jobs. They'll scan  those to find people with the exact experience you're looking for and then say to them that  they'll invite them to apply to your job. And then as the applications come in, they don't come into  your email box or your phone. They go into the Zip Recruiter interface. Zip Recruiter analyzes  each one automatically, spotlights the top candidates. You never miss a great match.  They pre-format their resume so it's easy to scan them. You can even have screening questions that  help you eliminate candidates that aren't right for the job. Zip Recruiter works so well, and  this is out of our own experience, that four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter will  get a quality candidate through the site within the first day. In our case, Lisa posted at breakfast  by lunch. She had three candidates. They kept coming in. She go, oh, this one's good. Oh,  this one's really good. Oh my God. It really was an eye opener. Right now, this week at Tech Listeners  can try Zip Recruiter free, but you have to go to ziprecruiter.com slash twit. And that's a great  way to show your support for the show.

And this is why I bring up these tough questions like how do we solve  the gun violence problem? Because if you guys can't solve it, I don't know anybody who can.  Right?

Transcript:  You don't know. If only rich people can buy bullets, then only rich people will be outlaws.  No, that doesn't make sense. Well, perhaps they should be.  Rich people already are outlaws, right? They just have more subtle ways of prosecuting their agenda.  Speaking of rich people, Goldman Sachs, Bank of the Rich and Powerful,  is according to CNBC, dipping into sub-prime lending with the Apple card. Goldman does the  back end of the Apple card. It started to roll out. I haven't got mine yet.  Apple focused on the fact that it's a titanium card, the privacy, there's no number on it,  the wallet that lets you plan your future. But really the most important part of the  card is the back end, which is Goldman Sachs. They decide who gets it, by the way. And  what I found interesting, Laura Gill knows somebody who had a, what was it, 730 FICO score,  which is not the best in the world, but not bad. And he's paying the top interest rate.  I think it was 23 or 24% is the top interest rate. So I'm not sure how this is going to work.  According to CNBC, Goldman is accepting some applications from users with less than stellar  credit scores, partly, I think, because of pressure from Apple, which really wants to  which really wants as many people as possible to be using Apple Pay.  I was absolutely shocked. I got it, says one early user with a FICO score of 620. Is 620 that bad?

Transcript:  I think it's so surprising Apple is operating in this space. I just don't get it. When there were  rumors about Apple doing an Apple car, my first thought was, wow, is this what Apple wants to be  associated with? Your iPod doesn't run you over in the street, right? Or the headache of going  and getting it repaired. It just seems really off-brand. And today, Sony has basically, the  last time I looked, two profitable divisions. The first one is their PlayStation division,  and the other is their consumer finance division. So for a company like Sony that doesn't really  have the hottest products right now, I understand it. It's a bizarre place for Apple to be operating  in because the stories of people getting into tons of debt on this card are just, they're incoming.

Start time: 2769.68
End time: 2814.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're inevitable. So I don't get it. This is part of Apple's becoming a service company,  right? When the iPhone sales start to taper off, Apple says, well, we're not going to sell as much  stuff, so we need to figure out a way to make more money per customer. And that is going to be through  a constant revenue stream on services. And I think Apple looks at Apple Pay as the prime way they can  make money. Right now, it's the app store. They get 30% of every sale. It's Apple Music. It's  successful. It's no Spotify, but it's doing all right. iCloud, which they push on everybody all  the time. But really, if you think about it, if everybody would just start using Apple Pay on  their phone and their watch, Apple would get a percentage of all the transactions. That's real

Start time: 2815.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  profit. Well, it's like what you've been talking about for years around Amazon. Amazon getting into  all these different businesses where for every transaction in the economy, they get a small  percentage. They get a cut. I think Apple's trying to go in that same direction. And most  companies are trying to move away from a model of sell something once and then forget it, move on,  try to sell the customer something else at some later date to continuous recurring payments.  You know, because that's what you want. As you've talked about with Microsoft, you want that steady  revenue stream coming in every month. Because once it gets going, it's really hard to stop it.

Warren Buffett drives a Chevy Gio or  something. I don't know what he drives. I mean, that's the so yeah, I mean, it's interesting. I  feel like you raised an interesting point with the Apple car. Do you want the guy who designed the  iPhone to be designing your car? And it's funny you should say that because we had a really good  conversation on Friday with an auto writer. You know him.

And his, I thought, you know, by the way, you think it's, you think being  a female game designer is dangerous? Writing about Tesla and anything that's not 100% positive.  Yeah. You are going to get flamed. And poor Ed has just hammered by this. But I think he's tried  really to be very even handed. And I think the conclusion he came up with is the problem is  Tesla is being run, intentionally being run like a Silicon Valley startup, like a software company.  But cars, the demand of a car, first of all, it's a very expensive, durable good. It's one of the  most expensive things you buy in your life. Second biggest after your house. And it's safety is the  number one job. It's got to get you to work and back, not only with not breaking down, but without  the wheels falling off or veering into the wrong lane. And so car, real car companies have spent a  lot of energy on process so that they can make a product that reliably make 10 million of them a  year reliably, and they're not going to endanger people's lives. And the Ford Pino Nauvulu is

Transcript:  standing. They do a pretty good job. Well, I mean, there have been plenty of examples over the years,  including most recently GM with their ignition switches, you know, in the past decade. You know,  car companies make mistakes. They do it on a fairly regular basis. You know, the Volkswagen  diesel gate scandal. Well, that wasn't a mistake. That was on purpose. But they do things. They  make decisions that they shouldn't make. Let's put it that way. They're not perfect. Yeah. But they  do have processes and they do understand that safety is crucial. But compare the number of

Start time: 3046.62
End time: 3071.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mistakes they make to the number of mistakes a software company makes. And this is the difference  is that the prime motivating factor with a software company, just look at Facebook's  motto. What is it? Fail fast, fail fast and iterate and move and move fast and break things.  Break things. When you're driving a car, failing fast and breaking things is not a good motto.

One of the chapters in there, he talked about, you know, car companies  should build beta vehicles. And that's exactly what Tesla has done. It just never got to the  final version. Well, yeah, you know, and it, you know, it hasn't worked out so well. You know,  in fact, I wrote a rebuttal on autoblog. I was writing for autoblog at the time. I wrote a rebuttal  to to there was an article, I think in Business Week, you know, that was basically an excerpt from  the book that was focused on that aspect of, you know, that they should build and car companies  should build beta vehicles. And I wrote a rebuttal, you know, saying no, they should not. This is a

End time: 3154.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  betas, but they don't sell them publicly. Right. They do internal betas. And the difference between  the software business and, you know, building vehicles is the consequences of failure are very,  very different. You know, if Instagram crashes on you or Facebook won't load, you know, or Twitter,  you know, is offline and showing a fail, well, it doesn't matter. There's no real consequence to that.

Transcript:  wrong kind of at Boeing? It's a very big part of what went wrong at Boeing that, you know, they did  not. Well, there's a number of factors with Boeing. One is the problem of, you know, this increasing  trend over the last decade or two towards allowing industries to self-regulate and the FAA, you know,  giving up too much responsibility to aircraft manufacturers like Boeing for doing self-certification.  And this is actually a problem in the auto industry as well. A lot of the regulations  around the auto industry, the manufacturers actually do the certification tests and they  submit the documentation to NHTSA or the EPA. And those agencies audit a certain percentage of the  new vehicles that come out, you know, to verify that, you know, they actually meet what's in those  documents. But the whole trend towards industries regulating themselves is a terrible idea.

Transcript:  In any industry. Yeah. All of them. So Sam, I was so happy that we were going to be on this  on Twitter this week together. Did you see the fully charged video that came out fully charged  as a YouTube channel? It covers electric vehicles and they finally got the new electric Porsche,  the Taycan and started doing watch and control. Did we see it? Did we see it? We watched it over

Start time: 3268.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 3277.08
End time: 3286.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  interesting is they've created, they've engineered it in a way where it's got liquid cooling for the  battery. So it's not like the Tesla in ludicrous mode where you can only do it once and that's it.

Start time: 3286.56
End time: 3291.44

Transcript:  running at high speed for long periods of time and at least in the Tesla but in other electric

Start time: 3295.40
End time: 3359.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  vehicles have overheated. The motors and power electronics are where it starts to overheat and  that's what causes them to go into limp homes. Will the Taycan not have that problem? If it's  engineered correctly, no it shouldn't. We'll see. Based on that video, it appears that Porsche has  done a more solid job of engineering that aspect of the vehicle. So that shouldn't be a problem.  Porsche has committed that the Taycan should perform in every respect as you would expect  the Porsche to which means sustained strong performance. And that's actually part of the  reason why this year Jaguar, for example, with the I-PACE, launched the I-PACE e-trophy series  as a support series for Formula E so that they could demonstrate that these cars can run  on the track at high speeds lap after lap for sustained periods of time without going into  limp home mode. Something which has been an issue for Teslas. Teslas are very quick launching once  or twice and then they start to slow down until everything cools down again and then you can do

We will never beat the official cannonball  for what's his name, the guy that does, no, Vin Wickie, the guy, Ed, oh I forget his name.  We'll never beat that one because he was driving 120 miles an hour the entire time,  but we could do an electric cannonball. There actually is an electric cannonball record

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's been broken a couple times. First though, Ed Boylan, first we have to buy a Taycan.  So I'll sign up for that. Okay, I'll do some driving for you. Thanks Leo.  If Lisa lets me. Actually it's going to be hard to get one. 30,000 pre-orders,  they claim sold out for 2020 next year.

Transcript:  You have to be amazed at that though, right? You have to at least give Tesla credit. I'm not a Tesla  owner. I don't care about Tesla. I mean, I can't afford it so I don't care about it, but you have  to at least give Tesla credit for kind of pushing other car makers into this world.

Transcript:  I've always given Tesla enormous credit for demonstrating that electric vehicles can be  something that an EV can be truly appealing in its own right, regardless of its green credentials.  I don't ever want to drive a gas car again. I love EVs.  On its own merits, based on design and performance and everything else, an EV can be something,  it doesn't have to be a glorified golf cart like it was in the old days. But now, okay, great,  we've got that part. Now let's make it so that it has all the other attributes that we have come to  expect of modern cars, that it's reliable and safe and gets you where you need to go every time,  doesn't not start half of the time. The kinds of things that especially mainstream consumers  expect of their cars because they rely on them to get them where they need to go.  That's where Tesla has fallen down is on the fundamental components of creating a product  that consumers can use as intended. And Boeing.

In this case, it's the M96 motor,  which isn't that reliable anyway. You can convert it into an electric vehicle. So I am ultra serious  about doing this to this car because I think it will make it more reliable. It will just  stop destroying the environment. I think it would be a real cool project.

But that said, engineers are  working on alternatives. They are trying to develop alternatives to using materials like cobalt.  New batteries are coming out. They are using less and less cobalt in them.

Speaking of credit cards, if you had an Amazon.ca rewards visa or a Marriott Awards Premier Visa  in Canada, good news. Chase Bank wants so badly to get out of the Canadian market,  they're actually forgiving your debt. They are forgiving your debt. This guy, this picture,  this smiling guy, he owed $1,645 on his Amazon rewards card. Chase said, you owe zero, zip-o,  zippity-doo-dah. They said, it's cheaper for us to do this. It's faster. It's the only way we're  going to ever get out of Canada. They're giving, they're just saying, you don't know. It's fine.  You don't know anything. Wow. Go get that. Now you can get an Apple card. No, you can't.  You're in Canada. You can't. Sorry.  Run away.  Run away. It's interesting. I didn't know this, but according to CNBC, it was Steve Jobs' idea  to create a credit card. When Apple held discussions with Capital One about creating  a joint card in the late 1990s, Steve Jobs had an aversion to rejecting any customers.  They tested a card but didn't roll it out broadly and partly because I think Steve said,  you can't turn anyone down. And so that's-

It's probably that. It's like, well, you kind of have one. So finish up.  Finish up. As long as we're talking Apple, one more Apple story and then we'll move on.  Apple is apparently, this is according to iFixit. We love iFixit, former sponsor,  I really like their right to repair platform. Apparently, Apple is locking iPhone batteries now.  There's a software lock on the newest iPhones and if something other than an Apple battery goes in,

Start time: 3844.60
End time: 3863.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll get a service message and it's not a bug, it's a feature Apple wants. Unless an Apple genius  or an Apple authorized service provider authenticates the battery to the phone, that phone will never  show battery health and always report a vague ominous message unable to verify this phone

Start time: 3863.46
End time: 3893.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  has a genuine Apple battery. I have to say, when I'm elected to Congress, the first thing we're  going to do is pass a national right to repair law. This makes no sense. It's consumer hostile.  If it's something for a fingerprint scanner, I get it. It at least has an argument for security.  The battery is a fungible part. This is bad for the environment. It encourages people to throw  things away rather than repair them. And it's a consumer rights issue, frankly. So even if you

Start time: 3894.18
End time: 3964.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  put in a verified Apple battery, you're still going to get that message. If you do it yourself.  Yeah, that is nonsense. Apparently, and this comes from a YouTuber,  Justin at the Art of Repair. There's a Texas Instruments microcontroller. I knew we'd get  a chip in here somewhere on the battery that provides information to the phone like battery  capacity, temperature, and how much time until full discharge. Apple uses its own proprietary  version, but pretty much all smartphone batteries have some version of this chip.  The newer iPhones, though, have an authentication feature that stores the info for pairing the  battery to the logic board. And that's the thing that the genius can do, but no one else can.  We've seen this go on for years from printer companies that put chips in their ink cartridges  to make sure you don't use a third party ink. Keurig does it with their coffee makers.  That's the wildest. That's wild. I mean, that's just the thing that you punch a hole in the  foil on the top and put water through it. Anybody can make these. Keurig won't work if you have a

Transcript:  It just looks like a Porsche. Our show today brought to you by Wasabi. There are places where  the software mentality makes a big difference. And I think this is one example. My friend,  David Friend, and his buddy, Jeff Flowers, some years ago created a way to write to a hard drive  where you'd lay the data on the disk just sequentially instead of by sector by sector,  as opposed to blocks. Seems like a simple thing, but it was incredibly efficient. That was the  foundation for Carbonite. They founded Carbonite. A couple of years ago, they said, you know, we  could use this other ways. They created Wasabi, hot cloud storage that's 80% less expensive.  Because of this patented technology, they're the only ones can do it six times faster than Amazon  S3 and fully secure. I love this. This is innovation. This is doing it right. Now,  a lot of people, we know businesses are moving to the cloud. This is the next big thing. Everybody's  going to be in the cloud. And sometimes there's concern that, well, as the cloud is secure,  I would submit the cloud is more secure than that hard drive you have in the closet or the data  center you have down the road. This is a better way to do it. In fact, according to Gartner,  10% of all enterprises have traditional data centers today. 80% of those enterprises will  have shut them down and moved to the cloud. This is a big transformation, the way people do business.  And let me tell you why you want to look at Wasabi. I know you're going to look at Google and Amazon  and Microsoft. I know those are the big three. You're going to have those on your list. Just  add a fourth name for me, Wasabi. Not only is it faster, six times faster than S3, not only is it  less expensive, one-fifth the cost of S3, 11 nines of durability, plus they have built-in integrity  checking on your data to check it automatically, to make sure it has not been modified. But my  favorite feature, and this will appeal to anybody who's worried about ransomware, you can designate  some of your data immutable, or all of it if you want. You can say that data can't be changed,  not by ransomware, not by a fumble-fingered employee. That data is golden, and that's  fantastic. Immutable storage, redundant data centers, of course. HIPAA compliant, yes. FINRA,  CJIS compliant, yes. And there's no charge for API access, and unlike Amazon, no charge for egress.  You can download free. So in every respect, this is a better solution. I know you've never heard  of them. I want you to think about Wasabi hot cloud storage. At least do this for me. Try it.  You can get it for free, unlimited storage for a month for free. So you can really bang on it.  If you go to wasabi.com, click the free trial link and use the offer code TWIT to make it unlimited.  Join the movement, migrate your data to the cloud, but do it without worry, without confidence,  and tell the boss it's going to be one-fifth the cost and 600% faster. And it's the Amazon S3 API.  So you already know how to use it. Wasabi.com, offer code TWIT. We thank Wasabi so much for  their support. And I thank you for supporting us by using that offer code, letting them know.

FedEx wanted to raise prices and Amazon, of course, you know,  take no prisoners. They said, fine, see ya. And they were able to negotiate a great price,  but I have to feel like FedEx and UPS have for a long time ago in line. We got to get out from  under this. This is FedEx error was discontinued some time ago and now no ground. Two months after  FedEx said its express units wouldn't extend an agreement to fly Amazon's packages, but Amazon,  see, this is why you don't mess with Jeff. They already have their own planes, their own fleet of

They've got decent benefits.  They train their drivers in safety extensively. They do. They're only allowed to make, if I  remember, it's right-hand turns or left-hand turns. I think that's not true. No, actually,

And it's actually saved them about between 10 and 15 percent in fuel consumption.  Sometimes you have to make a left-hand turn. Yeah. Occasionally. If you can avoid it.  Right. But there are times when it's actually, especially in certain cities, where it's quicker  to make three right-hand turns than it is to make one left-hand turn. Wow. Yep. So sometimes I feel

They're  complaining that, actually PillPack is complaining that CVS and Walgreens will not forward their  customer's prescriptions to PillPack. Because PillPack is a pharmacy, but it's an online pharmacy.  I think PillPack is really cool. I was using it for a long time. I use it too. Yeah, it's really  great. It bundles up your pills into little pouches. It's great for somebody like you who  is on the road all the time. Yeah. Because it's already ready to go. According to PillPack,  CVS and Walgreens are rejecting an increasing number of those requests for prescription transfers,  claiming PillPack isn't getting proper consent from patients. PillPack says, well, no, we always  get patient approval before making transfer requests and blames the pharmacy giants for  unfairly refusing to honor the requests, sometimes hanging up on PillPack's pharmacists or throwing  the request forms in the trash. Wow. I mean, it makes sense. Retail war. Yeah, it does make sense.  Because remember when Amazon bought PillPack, the stocks for CVS and Walgreens dropped dramatically,  just like when Amazon bought Whole Foods, the grocery stocks plummeted. Yeah, you're not really

But of course, Twitter has a presence there and every show has a presence there because you're  right. That's where the audience is. Yeah. So it's a luxury for me to say, oh, I'm not on Facebook,  but my company is. And if you're running for Congress, you'd be nuts not to be on Facebook.  In fact, I'm going to bet you're buying some Facebook ads. Yeah, you better believe it. I  mean, we'll talk about the most efficient. That's how Donald Trump got. You could blame Russia.

And I'll be honest with you, Leah, this time,  I've spent five hours a day in this exact chair calling people. It's just the job. So you got to  put in the work because you have to respect the process. But at the same time, I've definitely,  I see a culture of being very not concerned with people's privacy in the way that you should be.  And I've had to, I've not hired people when they've said things to me that make me feel  like they're not going to respect people's data. And I've told my team, anyone that's sharing email  addresses or information of anyone we talk to is going to be fired on the spot. We can't run on a  privacy campaign and then do this.

So children as young  as 16 recruited by Foxconn to work for Amazon grueling and illegal hours, sometimes through the  middle of the night on school nights on a school night. The teenagers drafted in from schools and  technical colleges around Hangang are classified as interns. Their teachers are paid by the factory  to accompany them. Teachers are asked to, teachers are asked to encourage uncooperative  pupils to accept overtime work on top of regular shifts. They're making dots. They're making your  echo dot along with Kindles.

Amazon says, if we find violations, we take appropriate steps, including requesting  immediate, immediate corrective action. Amazon uses independent auditors to monitor compliance.  So they said, we're investigating and additional teams of specialists arrived on site yesterday  to investigate and we've initiated weekly audits of the issue. It's embarrassing to Amazon, but I

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

It's not just those recordings,  you know, anywhere where data is being collected, there are, there are humans that are looking at  that data, listening to that data, you know, training data for autonomous cars, you know,  any type of AI system, machine learning system, somebody is looking at that data to label it  and, you know, so that it can be fed back into the system to train these systems.

I wonder if,  you know, like Apple gotten a bunch of stuff recently because it was found out that  humans were auditing some of the Siri requests, but I looked more deeply into that and I'm like,  well, they took away anything, could personally identify the person that was talking before it  was audited. And this just seems like error checking to me. I wonder if you had federal  regulations kind of bringing in differential privacy because it's, it's not the fact that  people are listening to it as much as it's trackable and attributable to it.

Start time: 5657.86
End time: 5686.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So even if you're listening to it, I mean, you know, human voices are distinct and, you know,  if it's images, you might recognize it. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, there are going to be times when  you're going to recognize somebody or, you know, even if you don't know who it is, you know,  if you're listening to a bunch of these clips and you hear, you're going to be able to correlate,  you're going to hear the same voice sometimes. And when you start, you're going to be able to  correlate, oh, that's the guy who said this and this, you know, and you can start to make connections.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

But I think like something like mandating a differential privacy for large data sets like  this, I do think it would, it would certainly would make it much, much, much harder to say this  comes from this person here because you're, you're, you're taking in the middle, you're  scrambling it, you know, it's, it's harder to figure out the entire piece of the puzzle.

Euro, Pill Pack, Audible. Amazon's got good taste in this case. Audible. We are huge Audible fans.  I live on Audible books. I first started, I've been an Audible subscriber since the year 2000.  I first, 20, almost 20 years. In fact, they should, I should get a prize on my 20th anniversary.  It was before, you know, you had to get special hardware to listen.  You know, they had their own Audible Otis player and all that. Now Audible couldn't be easier.  There's Audible apps on iOS and Android. I have it. I keep Audible on everything on my computer.  I can listen. I really like it on my iPad Pro because the speakers are good and it's got lots  of storage. Audible is awesome. Whether you're listening to nonfiction to learn, I'm listening  to some great books by the linguist John McWhorter about English language. One of them recommended to  me by Jeff Jarvis, who's a fan. I'm listening to McWhorter's great courses on English, but he also  wrote Our Magnificent Bastard Tongue, The Untold Story of English from Audible. There is so much  great stuff. I like fiction too. In fact, I just finished, let me go to my library, which is now  more than 500 books. I just finished Neil Stephenson's newest Fall. That's a great 31 hour  lesson. But you know what I'm interested in is Audible originals too. Audible's recording a lot  of original stuff. Did you know that William Gibson, our favorite science fiction author creator of  Neuromancer, wrote a script never produced for Alien 3? Never produced. Audible has produced it,  dramatized it to mark the 40th anniversary of the Alien franchise. It's a full cast,  including Michael Bean and Lance Hendrickson, who reprise their iconic roles as Corporal Hickson.  Bishop! Bishop is back. This was written in 1987 as a sequel to Aliens. Never made it to the big  screen, but fans know about it. It's become a cult thing and now you can actually hear an Aliens  installment written by William Gibson. Is that awesome? That's an Audible original. I love  Audible originals. I get two new Audible originals as part of my subscription every month.  So Audible members choose an audiobook every month plus two Audible originals every month.  You can't hear anywhere else. Such an Audible fan. Let me see what's in my library. What am I  listening to right now? Oh, Quicksilver. After reading the newest Neil Stephenson, I thought  I should go back and do Quicksilver, which I skipped because it was so long. This is another  Audible original I'm really interested in. The man who knew the way to the moon. This is about  a guy who worked at NASA, John Hubolt. When NASA was thinking about going to the moon, they thought,  including Werner von Braun, thought the best way to do this is you get one giant spacecraft  that goes all the way there, lands and returns like a cartoon. But Hubolt said, no, you need  a lunar orbit rendezvous. You need a lunar lander. And of course, that's how we landed on the moon.  So for the 50th anniversary, Audible has offered this book, The Story of the Man Who Knew the Way  to the Moon. You see all the great stuff you get from Audible. Would you like a free book?  We can do it for you right now. If you go to audible.com slash twit two, A-U-D-I-B-L-E dot  com slash twit two, or you can text twit two to 500 500. Text twit two to 500 500.  And you'll get that free book. You're going to love the Audible originals. I feel like the Audible  originals are kind of like so cool. I'm so, I mean, it's like, this is a free gift. I get two  new books every month as well as my regular subscription. I love my Audible. You will too.  Audible dot com slash twit two, the number two, or text twit two. You can do this. In fact,  you might want to do it because then you can, you can do it on your phone and get the, I mean,  that's basically where the books are going to live anyway. Text twit two to 500 500. Audible.  I love Audible. I'm a huge fan.  Let's see. The Galaxy Note 10 was announced this week. I know I already have a Galaxy S10 plus,  but I ordered a Note 10 plus. So did Jason from All About Android. But I didn't pay enough  attention. We streamed the event on Wednesday. Jason Howell was with me. So was Jeff Jarvis. So  was Stacey Higginbotham. We're talking about it. We're talking, but we missed, I think, a fairly,  couple of fairly important points that kind of surprised me now that I think about it.  Samsung, number one, Samsung for years has run ads mocking Apple  for losing the headphone jack, right? Courage and all that.  And now they deleted all those ads, right? They deleted the ads from their YouTube channel. They  deleted them because guess what? There's no headphone jack. That's awkward. Awkward.  Be careful what you mock because you might be doing it. But then another thing. So there's,  so every, every, yeah, there's, there's one of the headphone jack ads. Every one of the Samsung  phones for the last couple of years has had this vestigial extra button. The Bixby button. This is  my S10. The Bixby button. You press it and Amazon's assistant Bixby pops up. Amazon, I mean,  Samsung, Samsung not only didn't mention Bixby, but they didn't neglect to mention the fact the  Bixby button's gone. Bixby is now in the closet with Cortana, Siri's next, voice assistants who

They, there were three things they didn't mention. Oh,  the A word. Samsung never mentioned Google or Android. Despite the fact that it absolutely is  an Android phone, but they did mention Microsoft. In fact, and this was surprising,  Microsoft CEO, Sacha Nadella strides up on the stage to talk about their partnership.  So forget Google. We got Microsoft. It's not like they're going to be using a Microsoft operating

But clearly the phone is the platform  of computing people use more than any other. If they don't run windows, what can we do? And actually,  I thought the announcement, they didn't really, I think there's more to be seen. And it's one of the  reasons I bought the Note 10. You connect a Note 10 to your windows or your Mac, by the way, with  a type C cable. And all of a sudden your phone is on your computer. You can run the program,  Android programs from your phone. You can text messages. You can read text. It's kind of an  interesting thing. That's the dream, right? It is, isn't it? That's the dream. And it's weird that

You could take a picture on your phone and it goes immediately to  your Mac. You can do Apple's iMessages work fine on your Mac. So really you don't need to on your  Mac. But those are all features that are absent on Windows and Android. So I think this, in a way,  this is a response to what Apple's doing. And what's nice is it's not an ecosystem play. You know,

Transcript:  I think that speaks to them. Yeah. So I'm going to, we'll have September, I think a week from  Thursday, my Note 10 will come and Jason's will, and we'll be talking a lot about it. And I will  demonstrate it. I don't know if you, for those of you who watch this show, and that's a small number,  I've always had a Surface Studio on the desk in front of me because it's a big screen. It's easy.  I could telestrate it with a pen. I replaced the Surface Studio this week. This is a new machine  from Lenovo. It does the same thing. It's a Lenovo Yoga 940, D940. And it does the thing that was key  for me with the Surface, which is tilts back. It's not quite as flat. Surface Studio goes to  15 degrees. This is 10 degrees. This is 15. But still, I think it gets out of the way. I have a  pen, comes with a pen so I can telestrate it. And it's half the price, which is a big selling point  for me. So I'm really so far very pleased. Much faster. It's an i7, a real i7 processor. It's got  two drives, an SSD and NVMe M.2 SSD in it. It's very fast. Mine, I paid $1,800. I got it on sale.  And maybe because it was on sale, they forgot to put the second drive in. But fine, I don't want  a 5,400 RPM drive anyway. You can keep your stupid drive, Lenovo. I'll put a nice SSD in here later.  But yeah, I just mentioned it. It also has a knob. So the Microsoft had a free floating  knob you can even put on the screen. This one's a USB device. But it has two scrolls. So I can use  one scroll to scroll up and down and one to make the text bigger or smaller, which is really handy.  And then it has a button which I can use to mute. You can program it to do other things, but I use

So when you're using a 3D development engine, I have to tell you, Leo,  if you've ever read the mouse commands for Unreal to navigate a space in 3D and 2D,  it's not just that you have to have a three button mouse. You have to memorize the most  Byzantine shortcuts. And what I hear from everyone is the surface knob is just, it's really,  really great for that because it's just more innovative. It just feels more natural. So

Start time: 6530.98
End time: 6617.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd love to play around with that. Lenovo's doing, I think something similar. The knob  senses if you're running Adobe Lightroom or Photoshop, changes to a different color for  each program you're running and has different commands. I know, isn't that cool?  Whoa. Yeah, it is cool. I like, I have to say as much as I love Max and I use Max,  and I'm kind of a Linux fan, I have to say the PC space is by far the most hardware innovative space.  There's anything you would want. Whatever crazy thing you could think of, you can get as a PC.  And then I just put Linux on it. The other reason I like Lenovo is because I can put Linux on it.  So I'll be happy. Here is good news for all of you stoners. And I'm doing it just because the  register's headline is so good. Let us be FBI NSA to hackers. Let us be blunt. We'd need your help.  We'll hire you even if you've smoked a little pot in the past. In the past, if you were applying for  a job at any of these agencies and they ask you, did you ever smoke pot? And you said, yes, that's  it. Goodbye. Marijuana is now legal over much of the country. So I guess Uncle Sam had to,  so an NSA representative told the register, look, I used to actually said it like this.  Look, dude, I used to smoke weed in high school. Now, so long as you can pass a drug test, don't  do many more. It won't hurt your application. That's a really good Spicoli. That's a solid

You know,  here in the United States, we do not have enough trained people in information security and cyber  security. We've got to expand our workforce. And it's a real problem that some of the best  candidates are going to Facebook, they're going to Amazon, they're going to Microsoft.  There are many ways to serve your country. And I absolutely think that working on cyber security  for the United States is a way to do it. But I think you're really, I think what this article  points out is how we're really behind the times in the culture and standards we're expecting people  interested in cyber security to come from. So this just makes sense to me. I think it should be,  if you're using this in a place where it's legal, it should just be completely normalized. Like it's,  if you're able to do your job and smoke marijuana, I just, I don't think it's anyone's business what

Alcohol has been  fine for decades as far as that part of the line of questioning goes, which I just, yeah, obviously  they're catching up to the times here, but you know, in some scenarios, I'd much rather have  a pothead than an alcoholic dealing with, you know, issues of national security. I'd rather  have neither, but if I had to choose, you know, I don't know, I'm not sure I'd prefer as somebody

We haven't heard yet about how many of  these machines were hacked, but I'm glad to see that one of the machines at voting village this  year was DARPA's prototype $10 million voting machine DARPA trying to create a secure voting  machine. We're learning that we just learned recently that many, many of these voting machines  being used by States today are still on the internet. Bad idea. Bad idea. Yeah. Yeah.  DARPA is trying to create an open source voting platform built on secure hardware.  And in fact, you can actually use it. If you're, if you were at DEF CON,  you could vote on one of two important issues, which is the best Star Wars movie  and our hot dogs sandwiches. And so it was, yeah, yeah, it was a touch screen system. I presume as  any good voting system, it will have a paper, a valid way to validate or audit votes. Paper trail

And one  of the things we advocate is reviving the office of OTA, the office of technology assessment,  which was dismantled in the 1990s, just as we needed this. I don't think 99% of voting machines  could pass the OTA if we put it back into, if we put it back into work to look at this. So I think  we need a total ban until we can verify that these machines are safe. It's clear that they're not.

Transcript:  for this DARPA voting system is online at securehardware.org. And in fact, the guy, Dan  Wallach, who wrote it, said there's a terrible vulnerability in there. I know, cause I wrote it.  It's a web server. Anyone can connect to and read and write arbitrary memory. That's so bad. But the  idea is even with that in there, an attacker still won't be able to get to things like crypto keys or  anything really, all they can do is crash the system. So he actually put a flaw in there  expecting DEFCON attendees would find the bugs and have some solutions. But he was very curious  if they could still get in there and use the flaw to cause a problem. And then there's this guy.  This may be the last year he does this, Mike Spicer. He is wearing what he calls the  wifi cactus. It's made up of 25 pineapples, wifi pineapples. You can see the pineapple on the top.  Pineapple is that hack five device that you can intercept and manipulate network traffic with.  He says it weighs on his back, weighs about 35 pounds, which is down from the 60 pound version  he wore some years ago. And it also looks pretty prickly. I wouldn't, gosh, I hope he, you know,  he's not giving himself some sort of sterility treatment. He is collected. So he's going around  DEFCON collecting data from wifi. He says he's already got 427 gigabytes of network traffic.  Yeah. Eight gigabytes an hour. What he didn't say is how much of that data is encrypted. And I think  that'll be interesting. He presented his findings at DEFCON. I haven't seen it yet. Looking for  insecure apps that leak personal information attacks could be easily avoided. But I would  bet nowadays, and this is the really good news, a lot of the data he's getting, a lot of those 427  gigabytes are well encrypted using HTTPS TLS. And that's probably good news.

I started contributing to her campaign when I read this because I think this is really important.  I really like what she said. Whether it's doable is another matter, but we'll talk about that  in just a second. Our show today brought to you by Captera.  If you are in business and you have a... We all have in business line of business software we  have to use. If you're in real estate, the MLS, if you're managing a veterinary office, you've got  your software for booking clients and appointments and ordering supplies. But for a lot of us,  those programs are pretty darn old. You know, because one third of all the machines in the  United States are still running Windows XP. The only reason one third of all the machines  in the United States are running Windows XP is because they got some dumb program.  The boss's nephew, Joey, wrote when he was on summer break,  Joey went off to do something else, but the whole business runs on the software and they don't dare  take it down. This is Captera is doing its part to get Windows XP and Internet Explorer 8 out of the  ecosystem. Captera is the leading free online resource to help you find modern software for  your business. There really is something better. It'll run on a modern operating system. It'll  run securely. It'll do a better job. It'll run faster. But how do you find it? You don't Google  it. You go to Captera. Captera has 700 categories of software, all the big ones, project management,  email marketing, CRM, but also a lot of specific line of business software. Carson always takes  this as a challenge when he's doing the show to find the craziest business. Farm management software,  what are you? Fax server software. Yes, it still exists. So you can go in there, find software.  Here's the best part. You can check boxes to select the features you want, the reviews it's got,  the quality of the software, all of that stuff. Narrow it down, get a side by side comparison  chart of up to four different programs. And then the best part of all, because you're getting all  the information you need, the best part of all, reviews. They are getting close now to a million  real reviews from real users. 975,000 reviews or the thousand new reviews every single day.  Those reviews are critical because you can see how actual users are using the software,  whether they like it, whether it does the job, whether this is exactly what you want.  As if you've got a million friends who are helping you choose the right software, no matter what kind  of software your business needs. Captera makes it easy to discover the right solution fast.  Millions of people use Captera every month. That's why there's so many reviews.  And can I tell you the most important part? It's free. Not free. They're going to charge you later.  Not free. They're going to upsell you free like free period done. In fact, the only thing I'd  suggest if you've, I mean, this is such a great service for free, leave a review, pay it forward,  help the next person choose the best software. Captera believes that software makes the world  a better place because software can help every organization become a more efficient,  effective version of itself. You should see this site. It's awesome. And if you do go there,  go there using this URL so they know you saw it on Twitter. captera.com slash twit.  C-A-P-T-E-R-R-A captera.com slash twit. captera.com slash twit. Captera is software selection  simplified and it's a really great site. I'm really glad to have their support.  On medium, Team Warren. My plan to invest in rural America and there's a lot to this. I'm very  curious what you guys think of this. But the thing that attracted me, I mean, everything I thought  in here was very thoughtful as usual from Elizabeth Warren. But I thought that some of the things she's  proposing for the internet were really smart. She wants to invest $85 billion. She says the  internet is crucial for rural America. It's for economic security, for participating in our  democracy. The internet is important. We know that. One of the best tools for unlocking economic  opportunity and advances in healthcare, she writes like telemedicine is access to reliable,  high-speed internet. In the 21st century, every home should have access to this technology. We're  not even close to that today. According to the FCC, which by the way, has very low standards for  what broadband is, 26% of people living in rural areas, 32% of people living on tribal lands  do not have access to the minimum speed broadband, which is 25 megabits.  Given the notorious loophole in FCC reporting requirements, that's something else she wants  to address. These figures underestimate the gap. She wants to earmark a significant amount of money.  I think this is partly the key to what she's doing compared to what other candidates have proposed.  Now, this one thing maybe I'm not crazy about is create the Office of Broadband Access.  That's in the economic development department that will manage an $85 billion federal grant  to massively expand broadband access across the country, kind of like the rural electrification  program of Great Depression, where we decided as a country, you know what, everyone should have  electricity. You shouldn't be left out. And the Tennessee Valley Authority was created.

No, this is, you know, your very first sponsor on this show was about finding jobs online, right?  So this is access to the internet. It is a fundamental right as much as access to electricity  or water is a right. And I just want to say this is a plan that is not really going to help  blue states that much.

There's a lot  more that's there. I do want to say, you know, you referenced the Tennessee Valley Authority. And yes,  some of that was corporate subsidies, but it does, it makes me go, are we just going to be  subsidizing Comcast and Verizon for them to build infrastructure in the middle of America?

You cannot make your  money back. That's why the government has to do it. And the government would, yeah, you're right.  There are subsidies, you know, they're going to basically pay 90 cents on the dollar for  construction under these grants. But in exchange, applicants will be required to offer high speed  public broadband to every home in the area they're applying for. At least one plan with 100 megabits  per second symmetric and one discount plan for low income customers with a pre-paid feature or  a low monthly rate. Five billion will be set aside for tribal lands, which is very important.

And these communities really,  really need it. I mean, I have friends who live in upstate New York who, I mean, you know, they have  plenty of economic opportunity themselves, but they talk about how hard it is to get access and  to do their jobs from there. And it really is true that it's an economic driver at this point. It's  essential. And so I think it makes a lot of sense. So you're lucky that Leverett could do that,

And it started in Philadelphia, started putting in municipal  Wi-Fi in Comcast's backyard. And they said, uh-uh. So one of the things also important plank in this  is make it clear in federal statute, municipalities have the right to build their own broadband  networks. It's 26 states, it's illegal. That's a whole different conversation. Can this happen?  Could she do this? The president isn't a dictator. You can't just write a law and say, that's it.  You got to get it passed Congress. So we got to elect Breanna Woo.

Transcript:  I would vote for this. I would absolutely vote for this. I do want to say there are two other issues  here. 18% of people that do not have internet access is because they can't afford it. So I do  appreciate that she has a plan there to help give low income people access to this. The other thing  is I feel like people that don't live in Massachusetts conflate Boston and the rest of our state. And we  have real problems in Western Massachusetts with access to broadband. Over 10% of our population  does not have access to DSL. And if you count cable in some ways, you can fudge that number and  say it's 2%. But the reality is there are hundreds of thousands of people in our state, one of the  richest states in America that don't have access to this. So, you know, this does primarily affect  the middle of America more, but everybody's going to win from a plan like this. One other thing I

Things like  she wants to return control of utility poles and conduits to cities. Prohibit landlords  from making side deals with private ISPs to limit choices in their properties. I talked to some of  the other day who hates the ISP and wants to bring in his own internet. I said, well, I got bad news  for you. Your apartment complex negotiated that deal with that ISP. That's your one and only choice.

I forget what  the technology was, but they were essentially trying to make inroads into housing in Boston  in order to use their technology as an ISP. I think it was almost antenna-based yet again somehow  that they were picking up the signal. I wonder how 5G changes this equation.  Yeah. Right. Yeah.

Of course, information  coming from Motorola, consider the source, obviously, but it's certainly, it's interesting.  It's really interesting because it has two modes. You've got this really, really fast local mode that  rival broadband, and then you've got this long range mode that could be used to help spread  internet access for the rest of the country. I have to say, we've heard this story before. Remember

So the first place Wimax rolled out was major  metros. It's actually a good thing because Wimax was a flop. But it didn't go to rural areas first,  and I'm sure 5G won't either. It's just not worth it. She also says, we'll make sure that  landlords, oh, ban companies from limiting access to wires inside buildings. All new buildings are  fiber ready so any network can deliver service there. We'll also enact dig once policies. I love  this one. To require that conduit is laid anytime the ground is open for a public infrastructure  project. That makes sense. I don't expect a lot from politicians. Please forgive me, Brianna.

I would certainly never suggest that everybody getting  online will solve that problem. But I think it's a bigger thing, Leo. But I think the bigger thing  in America is I think the irony is we're more connected to each other than ever before. And we  all feel so isolated and alone at the same time. So I think there's a conversation to be had about  that gap that all of us are feeling. It's hard to solve. It's about two years ago that the USS John

Transcript:  McCain collided with a Liberian oil tanker. Remember this off of Singapore? The crash killed  10 sailors, injured 48 aboard the McCain. They lost control of the ship, putting into the path  of the tanker. And it turns out that happened when crew members tried to split throttle and  steering control. These are computer controlled ships these days between consoles. The report  that just came out said that while fatigue and lack of training played a role in the accident,  it was the design of the control console contributed to it because the ship's control  console features a pair of touchscreens. Both on the helm and the Lee helm stations,  crews use touchscreens to steer and propel the ship. The crew would place it in backup manual  mode that removed the computer assist because they wanted more direct communication between  steering and the ship's control console. As a result, they're going to replace touch screen  controls on naval vessels with mechanical ones. No more touchscreens.

It doesn't necessarily mean, he said,  if the NTSB said if they'd had throttles, regular old mechanical controls have been present,  the helmsman would likely have been alerted that there was an issue early on  avoiding the collision entirely. They're going to put back throttles.

Transcript:  I mean, this is like fascinating conversation.  Yes.  Yeah. The most fascinating conversation I've ever had in my entire career regarding UI was with  someone that helped design the UI for basically military vehicles, like helicopters, fighter  aircraft, all of that. They have a really well done standard for all of this. Think about the  movie where they're opening up the cover over the switch and they're flicking it or you hear the  alarm going off. There's a ton of UI thought around that. It is all to only alert you when  things are really, really, really critical that you can't screw them up. So if they have all this  wonderful design language, it just seems bad to move over to a touch screen.

Actually, I just did a two-parter about a mysterious mountain  of dishware in the woods.  That's Reddit in a nutshell. It's a mysterious mountain of dishware in the woods.  Yeah. And we solved it. This week's episode, which you're looking at right now is about  the growth in the audio erotica industry and the huge, huge, huge, huge community on Reddit  called Gone Wild Audio, 300,000 subscribers. Really interesting conversations about both  the most basic part of this, which is audio erotica, but also how some members of that  community are using some of the content to move towards better sexual health.  It really runs the gamut for us every week, all the way from mountains of plates in the woods,  that a bunch of map nerds are trying to figure out where the mountain of plates are to audio porn.  And there was an example of this audio porn that we described that was based on a Next  Generation episode where there's a transporter issue and you get two different versions of Riker.  In this fanfic, I guess we'll call it, one of them is a female. It doesn't have to be, obviously.  Do they both have beards?  No, one of them doesn't have a beard.
