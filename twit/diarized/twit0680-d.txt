Transcript:  Made you come to work on a Sunday afternoon or evening. Man.  Although I don't feel as bad for you as I do for Patrick Beja, frenchspin.com.  He's not Patrick on the Twitter. He's joining us from just outside Helsinki where it's like middle of the night, but the sun's still out.

Transcript:  Well, it's artificial light. I have those.  I've heard of that. I've heard of that.  Yeah, it's pretty handy. Yeah. Yeah. It's one in the morning.  And as when I'm on the show, it's the best reason to stay up so late. Thank you. Thank you for staying up.  You know, when the baby's crying, that's another good reason.  How's the baby? How old is the baby now?  He's six months, seven months almost.  So he's at a point where he is trying to crawl, not managing, so getting angry, teething and also discovering object permanence.  So he's panicking when we're not in the room. So one of those lovely times. But he's cute. So it's OK.

Start time: 208.12
End time: 233.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's really that's it's fun because until you're a parent, you don't know anything about things like object permanence.  But then you learn the Piaget stages and the object permanence.  And it's so much fun. He thinks that if you're not there, you don't exist.  I've been I've been loving the pictures. Here's a great picture of Patrick and his six month old.  Oh, it's all. Oh, it looks like a Gerber, baby.

Start time: 237.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's been away for a few days. So looking at the picture, I'm going all misty.

Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, baby food label fodder.

Start time: 245.32
End time: 290.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It really looks like the Gerber baby, like you could put use them on baby food. That's nice.  That's from Patrick's Instagram. He's also not Patrick on Instagram.  So let's start with the week's news.  Elon Musk in the news this week. And I don't really want to say anything except just leave Elon alone, folks.  Poor guy has just been going through hell.  Elon Musk, according to the New York Times, details excruciating personal toll of Tesla turmoil.  Nice alliteration, New York Times.  He says this has been the most difficult and painful year of my career was excruciating.  In this, he talks about working 120 hours a week. Is that even possible?

Start time: 292.16
End time: 304.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just barely. Three normal work weeks. So that's three times eight hours a day.  That really means no sleep at all. Well, you can take weekends off. Oh, weekends.  You work continuously from Monday to Friday.

Start time: 306.48
End time: 335.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He also admits to taking a little ambient from time to time to sleep because he can't sleep.  Maybe explaining the weird tweets. He scared. I mean, investors were a little nervous after this interview.  They were also nervous after his tweet in which he said, I've got money to buy, take Tesla public, private.  And it turned out the funding secured wasn't exactly true.  But apparently it was investment by the Saudi Government Investment Fund.

Start time: 336.92
End time: 346.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't there some kind of rule that says he can't make these kinds of announcements over Twitter?  Oh, yeah, he's being investigated right now by the Securities and Exchange Commission because the stock price,

Start time: 347.78
End time: 366.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he said we're going to buy him back at four hundred twenty dollars a share, which sounds like he's a stoner.  But anyway, and all of a sudden the stock price, which is at what, four fourteen or something, went up and he made lots of money and then didn't do it.  And SEC says, dude, can we just say let's just everybody stop tweeting right now?

Start time: 366.24
End time: 391.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is not ending well for anybody. Well, for Elon Musk, certainly. I mean, anybody calling people pedophiles over the submarine thing.  It was already a problem. Now it seems like really, I guess what he should stop doing, maybe stop tweeting.  That's all. But also stop working 120 hours weeks. That doesn't seem to be going well for him.

Start time: 392.00
End time: 428.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Stop giving interviews. Stop taking Ambien. Stop tweeting. There's my prescription.  Kara Swisher wrote an opinion piece for The New York Times. Let me answer the question many are thinking. Is Elon crazy?  She says no, he's a human being. You know what?  Elon has said things like, look, there are only two companies in America that go bankrupt to auto companies, Ford and Tesla.  He's making a car that many agree the Tesla Model 3 is the best electric car ever made.  It would go a long way, Elon, if you just, you know, kind of keep under the radar and be crazy like the rest of us in private.

Start time: 428.36
End time: 431.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wonder why he wouldn't do that. Maybe he's just so tired that he can't tell.  Too tired.

Start time: 433.49
End time: 435.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's pretty good. It's also a pretty good promotion too, right?

Start time: 436.22
End time: 438.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think it's good promotion or is it bad promotion? Doesn't it make people nervous?

Start time: 439.54
End time: 442.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For a while it was entertaining. Lately it's been a little more scary.

Start time: 442.04
End time: 481.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think for a long while it was definitely entertaining. Yeah, as Harry said, I think only recently he seems to have really veered off the rails.  And it just underscores this idea that there's very little upside to tweeting.  Unless you're trying to, you know, to just stir some trouble up and get people mad at you, then I don't really see the purpose of going on to Twitter.  You know, at this point, Twitter is just this cesspool of hate and trolls.  And I think Elon Musk probably gets a little bit of entertainment out of that.  But it's also, you know, it's cost him a lot in the past couple of months.  And I think that he's probably finally coming to this realization.  But certainly it's keeping his name in the news, right?

Start time: 481.22
End time: 509.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that's not necessary. I mean, maybe if you're Donald Trump, that's a good thing, but not if you're Elon Musk.  You're trying to sell cars and reassure investors.  And I think. And then what's this about? Is Zalia getting lost in his house?  And there's just too much weird stuff going on. This isn't good.  You know, I mean, we all have weird stuff going on, but we don't publicize it, right?  Patrick, I know you've got weird things going on in your house, but you don't tell the world.

Start time: 510.18
End time: 555.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't. I don't publicize those. They're just pictures of cute babies.  That's all I do. But no, I mean, honestly, for the for the past few years, he has been using social media in a very efficient way.  I'm talking about Elon Musk now. It's only in the past month that he's really gone from, you know, this this Tony Stark Iron Man character to is he taking medicine?  He shouldn't be taking. And I think that's possible to correct.  He's just been having trouble, I guess, for a month.  But it doesn't mean that he can't use Twitter and social media in a positive way.  Until then, it was keeping him in the news and in the positive light.  So I think it's possible he's just been doing a bad job at it.

Start time: 557.14
End time: 633.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think where I draw the line is like this pedophilia stuff.  There's been a lot of really erratic behavior in the past couple of months.  And so we shouldn't just gloss over some of his public behavior.  I think that it really deserves holding this person accountable.  You know, I think we you know, the investors certainly deserve that much.  And I think that even just like the general public, you know, if you're going to be a billionaire and and finance all of these really, you know, these really, really big goals, I think that's great.  You know, I think that it's awesome that he's trying to privatize space.  It's awesome that he's trying to develop all these new technologies, including making the electric car, you know, more mainstream.  But to call a rescuer a pedophile and to, you know, to do some of you know, some of and also the attacks against the media, I think there's there's certain behavior that is just it just crosses the line for me.  And and I start to lose faith in this person as a good leader, as someone that I look up to.  And I start to just think of him as kind of a madman.  You know, this is someone that's egotistical, narcissistic and and just ultimately thinks that he's always in the right.  Even when you know, even when he doesn't deliver on some of his promises, because that's also been the case with a few of his companies at this point.  I have to say, first of all, Twitter is addictive.

Start time: 635.00
End time: 647.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like crack.  I can understand.  You know, you just got a tweet, just got a tweet in the middle of the night whenever you got a tweet.  It's also as a media entity, this kind of behavior is addictive.

Start time: 648.59
End time: 648.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You think so?

Start time: 649.00
End time: 746.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard not to cover it.  I didn't want to cover it.  I was going to say leave Ilana Malone and move on.  But it's it's fascinating in weird ways.  Kara Swisher writes in The New York Times.  She says, People ask me all the time now, is Ilan crazy?  No, he's not.  Not at least in my various encounters with him over nearly two decades, including recently, in which he has been alternately funny, rude, compelling, obnoxious, accessible, easy to deal with, hard to deal with, always on, outspoken to a fault, even when he might be at fault, angry, charming, intense, also strikingly confident, deeply human with all the positive and negative characteristics.  I don't think that really answers the question.  He gave a great interview, I thought, with Marques Brownlee on YouTube, but that was all about the Tesla and the factory.  And it was that stick to that, Ilan, you're doing great.  And then there's this weird story.  And I think this is just people hopping on the music and musician Azalea Banks on Instagram, posting a bunch of weird, increasingly odd posts about him trapped in his house.  I waited around all weekend, she tweeted, well, by these, these have all been deleted.  Well, Grimes coddled her boyfriend for being too stupid to know not to go on Twitter while on acid, which is completely possible that that's what's going on.  I don't know.  Staying at Ilan Musk's house has been like a real life episode of Get Out.  His humanoid group emerged, crawled out of the Caucasus cave system 15,000 years ago after the first Caucasian homo sapiens did.  Now I don't know what's going on.  And then porkskin was the last tweet.

Start time: 746.10
End time: 754.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I don't it's just I mean, I think this is veering into, you know, People's magazine.  It is worse than that. Yeah.

Start time: 754.00
End time: 755.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, sensationalism.  Yeah.

Start time: 756.60
End time: 797.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but he he has been behaving erratically and it shows on Twitter.  But I think he's been it's been dealt with in a not maybe not dealt with.  But the reaction he didn't get a pass.  Everyone has been very concerned by what he has been tweeting and and very likely for this latest stock price episode, he's going to be in serious.  At least there are going to be legal questions.  So I think it's it's happening the way it should be.  And hopefully he will manage to get back to a normal behavior.  And if he doesn't, we might write him off.  But for now, things are going the way they should, I think.

Start time: 797.20
End time: 807.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. If Twitter did not exist, would people be fascinated by Ilan Musk or would like that's what I mean.  Eighty five percent of the things that people find interesting about him just not be apparent to us.  Right. And that's I completely agree.

Start time: 808.02
End time: 814.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like a double edged sword.  He got benefit from it, as you pointed out, Michael, but but now it's not benefiting him.  And I don't know.

Start time: 814.58
End time: 858.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, and also I also want to just say that I don't think Elon Musk deserves that much praise at this point.  You know, we still don't have our thirty thousand dollar electric car.  We still don't have you know, I think he goes he goes on to Twitter and he makes these really big promises for all of the companies that he's running.  But he often falls short of those promises.  And I just don't see, you know, I think he deserves some credit for trying.  That's certainly really great.  And that's a commendable, you know, commendable behavior from from an entrepreneur.  OK, so he's trying to reach the moon. He's trying to reach Mars.  He's trying to to to to build an electric car that everyone can afford.  The reality is he hasn't done any of those things.  And so I think that, you know, in addition to the to the erratic behavior, it's hard.

Start time: 859.00
End time: 872.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't expect him to be on Mars tomorrow.  Yeah, I don't say he hasn't landed two rocket launchers in tandem and did some pretty good stuff.  That's one of the things that's pretty impressive.

Start time: 874.04
End time: 876.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he has gone short of his own self-defined goals.

Start time: 877.42
End time: 922.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead, Patrick. Arguably, he's moved the entire auto industry into developing electric cars.  And at the very least, his cars are reality.  And what they do would have seemed unimaginable 10 years ago.  So I think it's a little bit unfair to say he has done nothing.  As he's done all of his promises. No.  But he has still I think the most disappointing thing is that, as I was saying, he was this figure of hope of like science triumphant.  And the the voluntarism of man triumphing over the the difficult odds of nature.  Now we're finding out he might be insane, which is a little bit disappointing.  But, you know, the book is not written on him yet.  And it's not too late. It's not too late.

Start time: 923.00
End time: 927.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. I think Elon could could recover if he just gets off Twitter.

Start time: 928.38
End time: 930.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He doesn't seem insane. It's just that it's all out there.

Start time: 931.14
End time: 933.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It's all out there. And that's one of the things you maybe don't want.

Start time: 934.00
End time: 937.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I can't understand why he's letting it all out there if he's under control of himself.

Start time: 938.42
End time: 998.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he's under a lot of stress. He's working really hard.  Also, don't forget, Elon thinks this is all a simulation.  And if you're in a simulation, does it really matter what you do? Right. Have some fun.  I think part of the part of Elon's real courage.  Jason Calacanis, who's a friend of his, did not want to speak for him, but was here a couple of weeks ago, said,  you don't understand, Elon was at one point not only flat broke, but owed hundreds of millions of dollars  after he got up, made all that money at PayPal, started SpaceX, started Tesla.  He was deeply underwater and fought back and created something.  And I think that if you have the kind of courage to, you know, put it all on black,  put it all on red and just let it ride that Elon Musk has, it helps if you think it's all a simulation.  It gives you some false courage. I admire the guy. I own it. I should say I own a Tesla I bought.  I will buy another Tesla when this one at least runs out on this one. I think they're great cars.  And OK, so my initial intent to say leave Elon alone, completely shot.

Start time: 1001.28
End time: 1007.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not me. No, I refuse to leave Elon alone. I think like I'll give him credit for the batteries, but not much beyond that.

Start time: 1008.10
End time: 1066.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's really interesting. We had Sam Abel submit on last week.  He's a car guy, works for Navigant Research and is kind of it almost feels like he's he's like.  Anti Tesla, anti Elon, even in the he hates the Tesla.  And I think it's weird how Tesla, especially, but but Elon in general, but Tesla specifically,  have created this weird polarizing thing where you love it or hate it. Right.  I don't know. It's puzzling to me. It's very it's unusual.  And what grounds does he hate it? I don't know. I keep trying to put him on the spot.  He said, well, the fenders fall off. I don't know.  I you know, well, but it's funny, even in my own family, my wife hates our Tesla.  She hates it. Every time she drives it, she said the thing tried to eat me, tried to run into another car.  It stopped in the middle of the freeway. And I haven't I love it.  I have it's the same experience, probably for both of us with just different takes on it.  I don't know. I don't know.

Start time: 1067.00
End time: 1083.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I would say it's hard to deny that the Tesla Model S is a really cool car.  It's obviously pretty awesome.  But but but I just think that a lot of the technology in that's going to be commodified over the next couple of years.  You know, Tesla claims thanks to Tesla. Thanks to Tesla.

Start time: 1084.60
End time: 1117.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and I don't think even even minds he's he's basically given away a lot of his technology.  He's giving away the self-driving stuff. He's open sourcing it.  And I think his goal is to save the world in a number of ways.  Solar, but also electric cars.  And he wants everybody to succeed. And I think that's pretty awesome.  But anyway, it's interesting.  There's really we do have people have these kind of visceral takes.  And maybe that's what it really is. People feel strongly about it.

Start time: 1118.82
End time: 1123.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm like cautiously positive about the Tesla. I don't have one.  So it's not a personal thing.

Start time: 1124.00
End time: 1135.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know as a Model 3, I wasn't going to get a Model 3.  I was going to get somebody else's electric car.  Everybody I know as a model 3 says, oh, you'd be crazy not to get one.  So crazy car ever made. And it feels like sorry.

Start time: 1136.16
End time: 1161.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Go ahead. It feels like Tesla is a brand that had consumers have kind of a similar relationship to as people who like Apple.  Apple. Yeah, exactly. Yep.  So I don't know how much of it is actual preference for the objective qualities of the product and how much of it is some kind of irrational attachment to the brand because it makes you feel cool.

Start time: 1162.18
End time: 1164.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is like an Apple very much in all of those respects.

Start time: 1165.18
End time: 1169.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you love something, you're willing to cut out some slack when things are not perfect.

Start time: 1169.52
End time: 1290.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I always try to tell people it's OK to love Apple, but don't assume Apple loves you.  They're just a company.  And I suppose I should say the same thing about Tesla.  Google is struggling over this search in China project.  Project Maven was the military drone project that its employees rebelled against.  Google says we're not going to do artificial intelligence for the army.  Now they've got another project to bring search back to China after famously leaving China behind.  They had an event, an all hands meeting this week.  Katie Conger was live tweeting it and shut the event down.  But we not before we heard that Sergey Brin said, I hadn't really heard about this.  Sergey Brin said I had.  Now, he's not the CEO.  Dragonfly, that's the code name for this. Here's Katie's tweet.  It came to my attention honestly because of all this kerfuffle.  Kerfuffle.  And as soon as somebody in the audience noticed this, Casey Newton writing for The Verge,  somebody in the audience noticed this.  He stood up at the microphone and said, F you.  And told everybody there's somebody in the audience who is live tweeting these private remarks and they shut the event down.  But what is Google up to? That's the question.  And remember Sergey Brin grew up in the Soviet Union, is no fan of repressive authoritarian regimes.  I thought in a quite principled way decided to take Google's business out of China after they asked him,  I can't remember what it was, were they asking to help find dissidents or just censor search results?  Censor search, yeah.  And now they're talking about going back in with censored results?

Start time: 1292.20
End time: 1348.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It seems like someone was looking at China.  I mean, obviously we don't have specific knowledge about any of this,  but from what we're gleaning, I would say someone in the company went to their management and said,  listen, let's just see how it could work if we could try to make a search engine for China just to see, to study it.  And they told him, all right, do it, but don't tell Sergey.  We'll see what happens once it's ready.  We can discuss it then.  That's what it feels like to me.  They were prototyping it maybe with the intention of discussing it later and see how it would work so that they could discuss it.  And maybe someone had in the back of their mind, you know what, we really need to be in China.  So that's a good way of trying to approach it cautiously.

Start time: 1349.84
End time: 1361.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then there is, we don't know because this is all leaks, although leaks that aren't really denied by Google.  But Google has apparently said, well, this is just in the early stages, but others have said it was it's ready to ship.

Transcript:  I'd be really curious what you all think.  What responsibility do American companies have to stand up for American values overseas?  Apple very famously is happy to do business in China.  They say, well, we're just following the local laws.  But let's admit the local laws are somewhat authoritarian.  Apple, for instance, has moved all its iCloud data storage for Chinese nationals into China with companies that are run by the Chinese military, in effect, handing over data about Chinese citizenry stored on iCloud to the Chinese government.  That seems to me a line too far.  Should Google have a search engine that censors uncomfortable information the Chinese government doesn't want its people to see?  Or should they just step out of China?  Is there so much money there that American companies can't turn their back on it?  When do they have a moral responsibility to say, you know what, no amount of money can get us to do business with China?

End time: 1473.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a really complicated question.  I think you can make legitimate arguments in either direction.  I did admire Google for pulling out just because it is unusual for any company to do something that is ultimately a hit to them, their bottom line.  If they come back, I think you can also make a case that an imperfect Google is better than no Google at all.  It sounds like they are talking about having disclaimers on the search engine that would make it apparent to people that information is being withheld, which is certainly better than silently erasing stuff.

Transcript:  I remember being in China during the initial Uighur revolt, the Uighurs now being apparently incarcerated by the millions in China.  They're a Muslim minority in China.  During the original revolt, I was in China in 2009 watching CNN and CNN started reporting about the Uighurs.  It just went black. It went black for three minutes and then it resumed.  So it's not like the Chinese authorities want to hide the fact that they're censoring.  So I don't know if saying this is censored is doing anything.  It's better than nothing.  I guess it's all you can hope to do.  But that big chunk of black was a pretty clear signal there's something going on that our government doesn't want us to see on CNN.

Transcript:  And the Great Firewall, although it's been a while, I think I was last in China in 2009 as well.  And at that point, the Great Firewall was pretty imperfect.  And it let some stuff through and it's hid some stuff.  But my understanding is it's gotten a lot more effective more recently.

Transcript:  That's another example of China going along with the Apple going along with the Chinese regime.  They blocked VPN apps.  They pulled them out of the app store in China so that you can't try to get around the Great Firewall.  All right.

Transcript:  I think one of the considerations for tech companies, I mean, it might have been different.  When did Google pull out was in 2009, 2012?  It was earlier than that.  Was it?  OK.  I think it's been about 10 years.  Yeah, it could have, you know, they looked at it and they might have thought, well, you know, this they didn't really think how long they were going to have to not be in China.  Ten years later, this this might go on forever.  Are they forever going to abandon the Chinese market and abandon?  I'm thinking about money, obviously.  They might be missing out on on 100 years worth of Chinese business because it doesn't seem like China is losing its grip on its population and intending to loosen the censorship.  And there is the other, you know, you can make arguments on those sides, as Harry said, and there's also the argument that you should not decide for another population what is good for them, which is a very complicated argument in itself.  But is it for Google to decide, well, we don't like China, so we're not going to serve them?  It's the kind of thing I think where you commend them for taking a stand, but also understand them if they don't.  I don't know if that makes sense.

Start time: 1646.00
End time: 1667.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess it also depends on what Google's actions or Apple's actions or any company's actions mean.  One thing may be to censor another thing to help arrest dissidents.  Yahoo got in a lot of trouble because Yahoo Mail was used by the Chinese government to arrest dissidents.  And I thought that was really reprehensible of Yahoo to hand that information over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't see how Google can be in China in any way and not somehow get into that system as well.  It seems impossible for them to not, you know, they have so much data at some point the Chinese government is going to go to them and ask for whatever data, you know, search or anything else.  So if they do, they're going to get into that discussion as well.

Transcript:  Yeah, I just don't see this self-imposed ban lasting.  I think it was the man on the player side because it was against their own business interests.  But I just think that ultimately if your goal is to vacuum up as much information as possible, you're going to want to get to the most populated country in the world.  And so clearly, you know, there's a gigantic business incentive there to have a new CEO.  A lot of time has passed since the Umbrella Revolution and since, you know, since the last kerfuffle between Google and the Chinese government.  And I just I just expect the company to find its way into China, even if it even if it never has a majority market share of searches or even if it's a very small percentage of searches.  I think that they'll find a way to do it.  And I don't think that they really owe anything to to, you know, to the to the human rights advocates as much as I, you know, tend to align with with those beliefs.  I don't think that Google itself owes anything to anyone.  You know, there are a lot of American companies that that do business in China that do business in a lot of sketchy places around the world.  And that's just kind of I just think that's the collateral damage of globalization, right?  This is just how the world works.  You know, we don't we don't talk about Exxon Mobil doing business abroad or, you know, some of the other Fortune 500 companies that have have strong footholds in other places around the world.  You know, we just happen to be harping on Google and Apple because, you know, because there's sort of a Silicon Valley backlash at this moment in time.

Transcript:  I would if this weren't a tech show, I'd be going after the other pharmaceutical companies, the Exxons of the world as well.  But we're talking about tech companies on this show.  I I think I think it's time for American companies to stand up and say these are the values we believe in and we are not going to put profit ahead of those values.  I mean, it's capitalism.  You know, well, if that's all you believe in, if all you believe in is profit, OK, that's, by the way, the statement that they are making.  All we care about is profit.

Start time: 1831.30
End time: 1896.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I I agree to an extent, but also I would think it makes me a little bit uncomfortable to to say, even though I, you know, in an ideal world, I would love for Apple and Google and all of the tech giants to say, no, sorry, we're not going to hand over information on dissidents.  So we're just not going to do business in China.  That being said, telling that it's the job of companies to take these kinds of moral stance seems a little bit a little bit weird because in my mind, and maybe that's because I'm a dirty European socialist, it's the government's job to say which country, you know, if you put a ban on trade with a with a certain country because the government representing the people,  estimates this is too far.  We don't want to encourage that behavior.  You're not supposed to do business with them.  That's one thing.  And that process exists.  Yeah, it doesn't seem like.  Yeah, it's complicated.

Transcript:  So here's what China wants.  Good article.  Probably worth reading for anybody listening after the show from Foreign Affairs Adam Siegel writing when China rules the Web.  He's talking about the fact that their current president, President Xi, is very much aware of the importance of the Internet to Chinese economic future and very much wants to influence it.  In Xi's words, cyber sovereignty represents the right of individual countries to independently choose their own path of cyber development, model of cyber regulation and Internet public policies and participate.  But that's fine.  Yeah, I guess every country could do that.  But this is the one that worries me.  Participate in international cyberspace governance.  International cyberspace governance on an equal footing.  China envisions a world of national Internet's with government control, justified by the sovereign rights of states, but it also wants to weaken the bottom up private sector led model of Internet governments that here in the United States we've championed for many years.  Beijing sees that as dominated by Western technology companies and civil society organizations.  They want more say in what goes on, not just in the Internet in China, but globally.  That bothers me.  That worries me.  I think they would say that, but it's our priority.

Always great to have Patrick on Frenchspin.com.  He does English language and French language shows.  Absolutely.  Out of his world headquarters in Helsinki, you figure it out.  You know who else has been with us an awfully long time?  Audible.  I think Audible probably started advertising right at the very beginning.  I know I started using Audible in 2000.  So I've been an Audible subscriber longer than I've been doing Twit.  That's because back in the old days, I had a commute from hell all the way down to San Francisco.  And I probably, if it weren't for Audible, I would have probably gotten in a crash or road rage or something.  Audible has saved me so many times.  Audiobooks from Audible are pure enjoyment.  I want you to take a look.  Audible audiobooks are a great sidekick for whatever you're doing.  Anytime you can't hold a book, whether you're hiking, sunbathing on the beach, cooking, walking the dog, and of course commuting.  They have an unmatched selection.  I've lost count.  Unbelievable selection of audiobooks, but also original audio shows, news, comedy, Audible broadcasters, entertainers, magazines.  You can now, the Audible app, if you haven't seen the Audible app in a while, you really ought to check it out.  The Audible app has gotten so interesting because you can do clips.  You can send clips or books to friends.  They let you listen faster or slower.  I know a lot of people listen to podcasts faster.  You can speed it up if you want to or if you slow it down if you want.  Because Audible is owned by Amazon, when you buy a book on Audible, you can also buy the Kindle version.  Then with WhisperSync, you can read it on the Kindle and then pick up where you left off on Audible and vice versa.  I love WhisperSync.  Audible members get credit for every month, good for any audiobook, regardless of price.  Don't worry, unused credits roll over to the next month.  If you don't like a book, no problem.  Exchange it, no questions asked.  Your books are yours to keep.  In fact, that's one of the things I love the best when I go to my Audible library.  Whoops, it wants me to log in.  I love it because I have a long-time Audible member.  I have hundreds of books in my library.  I can listen to it anytime.  It's like a real library.  That was one of the problems I had with the...  I used to listen to books on tape, remember those days?  You'd have to mail it back after a month.  I never would even finish a book in a month.  So, what are you listening to these days on Audible?  Let me give you some Audible recommendations.  Anybody else?  This is what I'm taking.  We're going on a vacation to Europe.  I decided to do a little Heinlein binge.  I read Heinlein in high school.  I haven't read it since then.  Moon is a Harsh Mistress and Stranger in a Strange Land are coming with me.  Oh, this new Stephen King, The Outsider.  Lisa and I...  So one of the things Lisa and I do is we will pick a book that we both want to listen to  and we'll listen together.  And she loves the Stephen King.  I do too.  So we're listening to this.  Can I give a recommendation?  Yeah, Patrick Béja, what are you listening to?

It's an American woman who went to Paris with her two or three-year-old and reflects on  American and French ways of...  Oh, how fun.  ...educating and raising babies.  It is...  It's really interesting for the education part, but also it's super funny, very well  written.  I had a blast listening to it.  If you're expecting or have a small child, I highly recommend it.

End time: 2806.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even then, it has so many implications in the OS.  I think we would have seen that somewhere show up, some leak or something, because you  can't have a pen and not have a way to write full sentences on your phone.  That's a good point.  One word at a time.  And there's no trace of it in iOS 12.

And then the next step up is $1,250 for 512 gigs storage.  That's an awful lot of money.  It's an awful lot of storage.

Start time: 2888.86
End time: 2922.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess.  I think the difference for Apple is they're going to keep the iPhone 8 in the store and  push it, probably offer it for...  Maybe give it a little bit more visibility than in the past because that's a more reasonable  price device to answer the concerns of, ah, you're going even further than $1,000.  But the taboo has been broken already.  And there's also the LCD version, right?  That'll be the low cost.  That's also going to be a little bit cheaper.

Transcript:  I think they're going to do it.  They're just forging ahead.  If you're used as strange as the notch is, people will get used to it.  It's very surprising how much of a fashion sense influence Apple has.  The notch is a bit weird.  But yeah, you see it everywhere.  Even though it is not great aesthetically and for the screen, having a phone without  a notch, and that's probably going to grow very fast.  But having a phone without a notch feels like it's the old thing.  Like, oh, yours is the one without the thing that's new and that Apple has popularized.  So I think they're just going to do it whether we like it or not, which is not uncommon for  Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw that too.  There's nothing in the middle.  There's completely room for the notch.  They moved the time over.  Google, apparently, with its Pixel 3s will also have notches.  You can't have more than three notches though.  According to this story, Google bans Android phones from having three or more notches.  Good.  I think that's good.  The notch wars.  I think we should hold on for no more than two notches.  I want a seven notch phone.  I thought for a while the notch was kind of an interim technology.  Maybe that was just because they couldn't figure out how to do the cameras through the  screen.  Maybe someday we would have a phone with a fingerprint reader back again through the  screen, cameras through the screens, but maybe not.  Maybe we're just going to live with the notch.  I would say don't get to like the notch too much.  Hold out for a notchless phone.

Transcript:  Apple is reassuring customers after an Australian report that a teenager, 16-year-old from Melbourne,  broke into Apple's system from his home many times over a year, downloaded 90 gigabytes  of secure files.  He apparently even said he got the secure stores where keys were stored.  These sensitive documents, the police raided.  Apple contacted the FBI, which then referred the matter to the Australian Federal Police.  The AFP raided the boy's home.  They took two laptops, a mobile phone and a hard drive that matched the intrusion reported  by Apple.  It wasn't too hard to find the data.  It was stored in a folder called Hacky Hack Hack.  Hacky Hack Hack.  And as often happens when you get caught doing this stuff, he couldn't resist boasting to  friends on WhatsApp about what he had done.  An Apple spokesman said the company's information security personnel, quote, discovered the  unauthorized access contained it and reported, contained it after he downloaded 90 gigabytes.  That's not exactly instant and reported the incident to law enforcement.  We want to assure our customers at no point during this incident was their personal data  compromised.

He obviously knows what he's doing.  I mean, his folder was named Hacky Hack Hack, so he's obviously pro.  But I mean, no, seriously, he probably frequents, you know, hacking forums and had to get informed  on how to do this somewhere.

One more Apple story.  Apple's in trouble in Japan right now.  Their Japanese Fair Trade Commission is investigating allegations that Apple forced Yahoo Japan  to kill a game platform that it had that didn't require the App Store, bypassed the App Store.  The Game Plus platform was launched July of last year.  You could play games without needing to download apps.  Hmm.  I didn't play any of these games, I don't think.

Transcript:  The Fair Trade Commission and the industry ministry began receiving reports from Yahoo  last fall about issues surrounding its Game Plus platform.  It let users play games without needing to download apps.  That's all it says here.  Yahoo abruptly slashed its budget for Game Plus last fall and now has all but stopped  promoting the service.  Yahoo told multiple business partners it was forced to cut back because of pressure behind  the scenes from Apple.  The company relies on the US tech giant for part of its profits in the form of sales through  the app store.  Interesting.  We'll keep an eye on that story.  All right, let's take a break and then we're going to talk about Google following you around  whether you like it or not.  And they actually as a result, we talked about that last week or was that on Twig?  It was Twig.  And as a result, Google has changed its location tracking policy and language and a lot more  coming up in just a bit.  Our show today brought to you by Uber.  Actually, often in more ways than one.  Often our hosts are brought to you by Uber as well.  I certainly ride Uber around.  You know, when Abby got in her last car accident, nobody was hurt.  She wasn't hurt.  The car was totaled.  I said, Abby, you know, it's cheaper for you to ride Uber.  And so I set up Uber on her phone.  I said, I'll pay for this.  It's a lot cheaper than me.  She's still in college paying for a car, paying for insurance, paying for gas.  And I feel I love it.  She loves it.  Uber is moving forward and they're doing it with a bunch of features for riders.  She really likes the fact that she can see who her driver is.  You can actually put notes in the app saying I'm wearing a red shirt or a baseball hat.  You can even choose a color in the app to light up your phone screen and hold it up  as more and more people use Ubers, especially like in a big city on a crowded corner.  I've had this problem, you know, it's me, it's me.  That's my Uber.  You can now hold up a red phone so that the driver could spot you at night or in a crowd.  Just a few of the new features Uber has added to the app.  They want to improve the ride sharing experience for riders and drivers and they want you to  come back.  I've been using Uber for a long time.  I haven't stopped and I still use it all the time.  Uber.com slash moving forward.  If you want to see what Uber is doing to make rides easier, to make it easier to get a ride,  to learn more about your driver ahead of time.  I think a lot of credit to Dara, their new CEO, who has really transformed the company.  I am a fan and I think you should be too.  To find out all the ways Uber is moving forward to see the improvements they've made to the  app, go to Uber, UBER.com slash moving forward.  Uber.com slash moving forward.  Uber is headed in a new direction and we thank them for their support of this week in tech.  Before we get to the Google thing, does anybody use MoviePass?

Transcript:  What is going on?  So MoviePass stock went to basically nothing, right?  Because the company admitted, well, it really isn't a sustainable model.  The idea was you pay a flat monthly or weekly rate and you get to as many movies as you  want.  But that's considerably changed.  They've changed their model.  They've changed their usage.  It has not been a good week for MoviePass.  On Wednesday, they were supposed to put a new plan into effect to introduce long-term  stability.  Actually, that was last week into the movie subscription service.  Instead of $9.99 a month getting subscribers up to one ticket a day, you would now get  three movies a month.  That's a big difference.

End time: 3773.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  $126 million the first half of the year lost, spending $73 million a month.  Stock went down to what was it, like a quarter.  I don't know what it is right now.  A number of people jumped in saying, here's a chance to make some money.  They were unfortunately not.  Thousands of investors got creamed.

Start time: 3774.88
End time: 3797.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did they let it reach that point?  Like, you know, they weren't able to pay.  They weren't able to pay for their, you know, to pay their bills, basically.  $78 million.  What is it?  Did you say a month?  It seems like you would see it coming when you don't have money in the bank anymore.  A few months in advance.

Start time: 3798.24
End time: 3822.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The inflection point was when they knocked it down to $10 a month.  I mean, originally it was like $35 to $50 a month, an appeal to a rather small number  of people.  And at $10 a month, that's less than one movie ticket in San Francisco.  And so they all of a sudden they had huge numbers of customers and every one of them  lost the money.  Was that it?  They were too successful?  I think so.  That's how their failure scaled up at least.

Start time: 3823.16
End time: 3840.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's how you lose a lot of money.  You only lose a little money if you have a few customers.  So their latest plan, yeah, it's three movies a month, but you have to pick from the movies  on a special list.  Just not comprehensive?  A daily short list of movies that will be available to subscribers in any given day.

Start time: 3841.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we have a similar system in France.  We have a similar system in France, but it's per company or per chain.  And you pay $20 a month and you can go see any movie you want anytime you want.  They're copying MoviePass.  And the chains have been moving that to their account.  Per company, right?  Right.  So you have a similar thing in the US as well.  The problem MoviePass has is that it's any movie, anywhere, any theater you want, right?  That's what makes it impractical, I guess.

None of them, except for Crazy Rich Asians, have I heard of.  I never understood MoviePass.

Transcript:  What's fascinating to me is that in Silicon Valley and tech, there are so many examples  of these loss leaders, right?  Businesses that cost more to operate and to run on a daily basis, they cost more than  they're able to actually make.  So Amazon was famously an example of this, and there are probably dozens of other that  we could rattle off.  In this case, people just aren't cool with it.  The investors don't want to really participate.  It sounds like this company is floundering.  And it seems like the idea of subscription-based movies is just not something that's going  to last.  Ultimately, it seems like the trend that I see happening is that people are going to  be...  Eventually, this is going to go direct to consumer, directly to your set-top box at  home.  That movie theaters, it's getting harder to convince people to spend money on going to  the movies because they can watch a lot of these things from the comfort of their own  home and do so at any time they want.  And so I just feel like, yeah, it's just been interesting to watch MoviePass try to find  its way through this dark room because in theory, it sounds great.  You pay a one-time fee, you can go see many movies a month, and it's probably a lot like  a gym membership.  Most people won't go to see a lot of movies.  That was the model, obviously.  Yeah.  That's what it seemed like.  But what I'm learning is that my math was somehow wrong about this.  That, in fact, they're actually losing a ton of money, and it's starting to sound like  this is unsustainable and maybe this model just isn't right for movie fans, for the entertainment  industry.  They underestimated how many movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Originally, movie theater would love them and cut them a deal.  Movie theaters did not love them.  A few small chains do cut movie pass a deal, but the big ones don't want them inserting  themselves in the middle of that.  AMC hated them.  Yes.  And then released its own plan.  AMC has one of that.  Yeah, the big ones can do that.  In the cinemas, which is not bad.

Transcript:  Yeah, they can do it themselves.  You said in France it's the equivalent of $15 a month, Patrick?  20 euros.  20 euros.  So a little bit more.  It's probably 25.  You go to the movies quote unquote for free.  So you're more likely to go to the movies.  One thing should be added though.  In France and in Paris especially, it's much easier to go to the movies.  You walk out the door and you probably have a theater five, 10 minutes away by foot.  Paris is basically the city with the highest number of movie theaters per capita in the  world.  We really love our movies.  So that might play into it as well.  But the fact that you have a subscription to it makes you go more because it's easier.  So it's a way of sustaining maybe the industry.  And there are a whole lot of other things that happen in the movie industry in France.  But for people who are, for an industry where people are getting disinterested in going  to the theater, that's a way of keeping them going to the theaters, I think.

Transcript:  Yeah, this one actually came out of Europe four years ago.  $4.99 a month you can get one ticket a month.  $6.99, two tickets, $10, two tickets per month.  But that includes something MoviePass never included, which is 3D, 4D and IMAX movies.  $15 a month, three tickets a month.  So it's a little more expensive than MoviePass.

Start time: 4271.92
End time: 4355.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't see how this can work in the long run because what I've kind of noticed  is that movie theaters are getting much more, they're focusing on being a luxury experience.  They're getting big recliners and now you can eat dinner at a lot of theaters and at  a few of them you can drink alcoholic beverages.  There's one in my hometown that has a Starbucks in the theater.  And so it's becoming, the tickets are way more expensive.  They're like 20 to 30 bucks a ticket.  And it's almost like a restaurant experience.  I'm watching this awesome movie.  I'm watching Mission Impossible while I eat chicken wings and drink beer.  And that's awesome.  Bless for me.  Welcome to America.  I'm paying the price to do that.  I'm paying like 30 bucks.  And so it doesn't make sense to me how a company could charge only $10 and expect you  to go to unlimited movies or let's say even three movies a month.  The math just like doesn't make sense to me unless they're able to, I guess, recoup that  through some of the data stuff.  That was actually something I didn't know, but I guess it makes complete sense that they  would try to gather more information about their customers and then sell that to different  data analysts.  But without that, without that extra component of the business, I just don't see how they  can sustain themselves over the long haul.

AMC's solution, which is called Stubbs A-List is $20 a month.  And you can, but you have to go to an AMC theater, which is fine if you live near an  AMC theater.  I don't know.  Is that unlimited?

Transcript:  Well, I was just going to ask, do you think that this is just kind of prolonging the death  of the movie theater?  I like to think that at some point at least, one of the big movie production companies  has to try releasing something directly to the internet.  So I remember-

Start time: 4451.16
End time: 4462.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've been doing some of that.  Remember Sony had a box you could buy, very expensive, that you'd get first run movies  and they would satellite them to or somehow get them into that box.  But it was only Sony first run movies.

Start time: 4463.35
End time: 4511.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Well, they did try it with the interview, which I know there was kind of a special circumstance  around that particular film because there was the big hack.  But again, Sony did try at least to make this movie available to everyone at home.  I just feel like that's the way that people want to watch movies now.  Look at the Academy Awards, for example, or any of these entertainment award shows.  More streamers like Netflix are winning awards for their feature films.  And I think that if that's the case, there's going to slowly be less of a difference between  going to the theater and seeing Mission Impossible 3 versus staying at home and watching, I don't  know, another action movie on Netflix.  And I just feel like that's the way things are heading.

Start time: 4512.34
End time: 4570.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there will always be movie theaters.  And the reason is very simple.  It's because the movie companies can sell you the movie multiple times.  Right.  If you go to the movies and then buy it on Blu-ray and then watch it on Netflix, they've  sold it to you three times instead of one once or twice.  Of course, it's different if they sell it to you for 30 or 40 bucks at home when it  comes out in the theater.  But I think the different experiences, people do want different experiences and maybe there  are going to be less movie theaters, but I don't think they're ever going to go away.  And it's still going to remain a big part of the business for a long time.  It's just as long as it makes money.  And what we've seen for all the talk of we just want to stay at home and we want to binge  Netflix, you know, in the past few years, we've seen the biggest blockbusters we've  ever seen, box offices.

Start time: 4571.34
End time: 4580.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So it's like, is that because they're charging more for tickets or is that because more people  are going to see these movies?  I think a lot of people are still going.

Transcript:  It's those movies that are doing the best, though, right?  I mean, the big movies, the the event movies, the movies you want to see in a theater with  a lot of friends or the movies that have great special effects or sound.  So Sean Parker, there's a name you might remember, had a company called Screening Room.  A couple of years ago, they announced it.  The movie companies were fighting it.  Last year, I saw a story that is still coming and he had partners, including Steven Spielberg,  Ron Howard, big filmmakers, Paramount, 20th Century Fox,  JJ Abrams, Peter Jackson.  Nothing happened.  Now, this is an article from Odyssey, the best way to watch newly released movies in your  house. I don't know how you would get this.  It's still coming soon.  You pay fifty dollars for a 48 hour rental, but it's the same day and date that the movie  comes to the theaters.  And of course, you have to buy the setup, which is 150 bucks itself.  Would you do that?  Fifty dollars a movie to be able to not go to the theater?  Yes, some people would.  If you had like this 100 inch screen we've got here in the studio, maybe, and a giant  surround sound system.  I like going to the movies, but I don't go every week for sure.

Transcript:  Yeah, there is a big change in priorities, as there should be, when that starts to happen  for people.  So I think when you're young and either single or with someone and you don't have the  constraint of being a parent, then absolutely, movie night is a great date.  But when you add the element of kids, I think it becomes way, way harder to justify going  to a lot of movies.  And then often what I've noticed is that the types of movies that they actually go out  to are no longer summer blockbusters.  They're often like these big franchises, I guess, like Infinity Wars, Avengers, or I  don't know what.

Maybe it's not exactly all the same movies that are making a lot of money.  And also the in-house day and date of release, you know, 50 bucks movie ticket or movie  streaming, whatever it ends up being.  As you were saying, it's not selling the movie to people who would go see it in the theaters.  It's selling it to the parents with young kids who can't go to the theater.  Right.  It's selling it to people who wouldn't be going otherwise.  Mostly.  I mean, there's going to be some intersection there.

Transcript:  I mean, here's an interesting graph.  It really depends who you talk to about how movies are doing.  The blue line is the number of tickets sold.  That is dropping.  The red line is the revenue that is going up because tickets are much more expensive.  In fact, it's gone up and more than made up for the loss in ticket sales.  But if I'm in the movie industry, I might be starting to worry.  Well, I guess ticket sales are about the same as they were in 95.  But then, but, but if you compare 2002 where ticket sales are 1.5 billion tickets sold  compared to the bottom last year, 1.2 billion, that is a drop.  So I don't know.  I don't know.

Well, I'm like, yeah, this is what I think this is what most Americans want.  You know, they imagine a gigantic flat screen.  They imagine having surround sound to to augment that experience.  And then you start to add little little boxes to it.  You know, it could be a fire TV, could be an Apple TV, could be an Xbox one,  PlayStation four. But, you know, all of these things inevitably  create what used to be called a man cave, which is which is not  I feel like that's not really a term that's that's thrown around much  because it's a sexist term.

Transcript:  Let's see.  This was the success story of the week on, let's see, August 13th.  What is that four days ago, five days ago?  The AP unveiled a study that they had commissioned from researchers at Princeton  that showed even after you turn location history off  on an Android device, Google was still tracking you.  An app like Google Maps would, every time you open it,  not only save your location, but send it off to the Google servers.  After the study came out, Google responded by  clarifying its policy.  And I think that's really what was wrong here was not so much  that Google was doing that.  I mean, when you open a Maps app, of course, Google's going to have to say,  well, where are you?  And then send that back to the servers so you can download that data.  It just needed to be more clear to users that that was what's going on.  If you want to use a map, even with location tracking turned off,  we need to know where you are.  Now, Google has modified its help page for location history setting, saying, quote,  this setting location history does not affect other location services on your device.  Some location data may be saved as part of your activity  on other services like search and maps.  Tempest in a teapot or did the AP  catch Google with its hand in the cookie jar? Your thoughts?

Start time: 5032.46
End time: 5056.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The wording was definitely confusing.  I think location history, if I understand correctly, is basically  if you personally want to keep a log of where you've been,  because it can be interesting.  That's what that's for in the same way that the web search history  is something you can go back to. Yeah.  But they certainly did not make that clear.  And I could totally understand why people would think it was more sweeping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So well, it's semantics, it's location history, right?  The name of the setting.  It's not location or, you know, GPS.  It's location history.  So the expectation from this would be  you don't store my location history in the way that Harry was defining it.  And there was some semantics that were not great there.  But location, I guess my point is location.  Location history is not just location.  It's location history.  Doesn't mean you're disabling. Right. Location period. Right.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's in Google's interest to be as clear as possible about all this.  In fact, the AP pointed out, I've forgotten about this.  Remember Google Buzz?  Google got in a lot of trouble.  An early social network attempt by Google leaked people's email  and other information.  Google was fined and the FTC and actually made a 20 year agreement  with the FTC.  This is back in 2011, in which they said the consent decree said  Google will not misrepresent to consumers how they can protect their privacy.  They actually have a legal burden to show consumers  what they can do to protect their privacy.  So that seems.  You know, I think that's pretty I think Google,  Google not only has an obligation to do it just morally,  but now they also have a legal obligation.  Be clear, that's all.  Just tell us what you're doing.  FTC is not saying whether they're investigating Google over this.

Transcript:  Well, these tech companies have gotten really good at this type of language.  You know, it's always like one or two words.  Yeah, exactly.  I think it's it's been referred to as something called dark patterns  in in user interfaces or just in language.  So, you know, I think you're you notice that I'm noticing this a little bit more,  especially following the GDPR,  because although a lot of these companies are compliant with this new data privacy  law that's been established by the EU,  a lot of them are still, you know, using what I would consider misleading language.  I think that just through through the way that they design these user interfaces,  they sort of lead customers to believe that sharing information at all  at all times is is is the best.  You know, ultimately, that's going to lead to the best experience,  which I think is partially true.  But but there are a lot of things that are either omitted or just not.  Described plainly by it, by Facebook, by Google, by Twitter,  by a lot of these data mining companies that I think, you know, I think  that more attention deserves to be deserves to be.  Sorry, I mean, we should be having more discussions like this  about the way that the language is is is built on a lot of these sites, because,  you know, sure, maybe this was a mistake,  but also you have some of the smartest minds in the world.  You have a engineer, you know, a team of thousands and thousands of engineers  working on this. How could you not possibly get this right?  I think that, you know, we're giving companies like Google,  in this case, a lot of leeway and a lot of a lot of room to fail.  I mean, I think, you know, and, you know, maybe this isn't the most egregious,  the most egregious thing that they've done all year.  And there are there are other big issues that the company is dealing with.  But it but it does bug me that that something is playing as location history.  In my opinion, that's pretty it's pretty obvious.  You should not be logging customers locations if they elect,  if they opt out of that, you know, through the location history setting.  What Google said was that there, you know, that multiple settings  exist throughout their various products.  And so the language was a little bit off and it sort of misdescribed  what was happening in a different program rather than Google.  So I think that, you know, these companies have become really good  at obfuscating the truth, which is that they're trying to follow you  every second of the day, your location, your interests, your general disposition.  They're trying to profile you in as many ways as possible  so that they can help advertisers target you.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think if people understood how powerful these engines were,  these artificial intelligence engines were, that then they'd be they'd be frightened.  I think that people would be disturbed by how much information is available  through various data brokers.  You know, it's not just tech companies.  Obviously, there are, you know, there are databases of credit card information  and hedge fund managers can go buy that information or maybe it's a magazine.  You know, you subscribe to Wired and to GQ.  And so they know that you're a male that's into fashion and tech.  And there's ways of getting those bits of information.  The issue is that companies like Facebook and Google  specialize in gathering all of that information from all of those various data  brokers and then packaging it and reselling it to new advertisers.  And I think if people understood how powerful these machines are  and how how you know how dramatic the effects can be on your your disposition,  on your feelings day to day, you know, just based on what you see.  I think people would be disturbed, to say the least.  So I think they already are.  But it's a grim view. But yeah.

Transcript:  I think they are.  We've been talking about this for a couple of years now.  You know, the tech companies are not the darlings that they were a few years ago.  And you mentioned GDPR.  And I have to say, even myself, I am I don't know if you get as many of those notices  for GDPR in the US that that we do in Europe, I'm guessing less.  But I use private browsing on Safari on my iPhone and iPad.  And I have, well, Chrome on my PC.  So obviously, I'm completely tracked on everything on the PC.  But on the private browsing,  I have gotten to the point after what, two months now of GDPR being in effect,  where I don't even look at the banners anymore.  It's constant.  The banners have to be like a third of the size of the the the web page,  at least on the phone, it usually takes half of it.  I don't look at them anymore.  I just click. OK, accept, accept, accept, accept.  So I don't really know what the solution is, because I think arguably this is the most  compelling and complete solution you can offer.  And yes, there are dark patterns, but I don't even want to look at them  because it's on every site every time I visit.  So I just click accept.  I and I'm just realizing what's happening now after just a couple of months.  I don't think that's working either.  So I don't know what the solution is.  No, it's the opposite, isn't it?

Of course, you use cookies. Is that OK? Yes.  Yeah. And at this point, you just accept, accept, accept.  It has not accomplished anything.  You know, right?

Start time: 5538.46
End time: 5595.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In my opinion, I think at the very least, they have to be forthcoming  and offer you possibilities.  I think the one part that is a little bit  that becomes annoying is the fact that you have to accept everything all the time.  But the fact that they have been put on not on notice  and that they have to let you  change some of the settings or, you know, it doesn't need to be a giant  banner all the time. Right.  Maybe they would.  A better approach would have been you have to have some kind of API  to let your browser extension decide what type of tracking you're OK with.  And that propagates without you having to click and select and do all of that.  And I don't think it would have been much more complicated than what they  the webmasters had, you know, the web developers had to do already for GDPR.  So maybe there's an iteration on this.

Start time: 5596.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Here's my conspiracy theory. Paranoid.  Does does GDPR say you have to put up the cookie announcement?  You have to get the consent this way or it does.  Because I'm thinking the companies are doing this on purpose.  They're making it as kind of repetitive as possible.  So that you just get used to it and say, OK, fine.

We had a tour of power plant and everywhere in the power plant  that it's science conserve, you know, be green.  This was in the 60s. Be green conserves.  And my teachers said they just put those up everywhere.  They don't really have any intent.  They just want to lure you to the whole idea so that you just go.  Yeah, you're conserving and forget about it.  It's one way people is an interesting technique.  You just say it over and over again until it becomes nothing.  Meaningless. Maybe that's what you're doing.

Transcript:  I feel like these companies are using just these huge walls of text to,  you know, it's like to to intimidate people.  It's like terms of service.  You know, when's the last time you read a terms of service agreement  before you actually agreed to it?  Nobody really. Yeah.  Yeah, no one reads those.  And that's what this GDPR, what these GDPR notifications are turning into.  It's another wall of text that were, you know, that were asked to scroll through  for legal purposes.  But, you know, but no one no one is taking the time to read this.  And the companies have very little incentive to actually explain  this information to people.  In my opinion, you know, what I think that there should be more of is  more insight into the back end.  We should have at least some exposure to what's going on on the back end.  And if they're going to collect with it, that's what Harry said.  Yeah. If you're collecting all that information about about all these individuals,  visuals, including myself, I'd like to see what that profile looks like  and how it's being. And that gets us back to where we were, because

Transcript:  that's what we're saying to Google is just be clear, just tell us what you're doing.  It's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think I think most people understand the general idea of it.  They collect your information and then and then use it to target you for ads.  And we've had enough examples now that we know exactly how that can work.  And just like you don't ask every person in the world  to have an intimate understanding of the medical procedures  that are happening in a hospital every day, you can't ask every person  on the planet to have an intimate understanding of how the profile  is built on an ad tech company to sell you ads.  It's with the GDPR.  I've looked into the options of a few of them.  Some of them are very complicated.  And you can feel that they make you go through three levels of accepting  and of details to confuse you.  Some of them are quite simple.  Some of them you really understand.  These are the cookies that we need in order for the site to function.  These are the ones we use for ad tracking.  This is you have a few categories.  Some of them are pretty clear.  But even those, I would bet you no one bothers to go look into them.  So there is, I think, a fantasy on the tech  knowing population that is if only people knew, if only people had the option,  then they would take matters into their own hands and refuse.  And like we're seeing more and every time I've seen one of those things,  you know, the cookies initially a few years ago and now the GDPR.  It's well intentioned.  I think the implementation could be improved.  But after the initial burst of either outrage of status or satisfaction,  people just stop caring.  And I'm not saying it shouldn't be there.  I think GDPR especially is good because it allows people like us to make sure we  keep them keep an eye on what's happening.  So there's more transparency happening and that's good.  But the idea that the general public is going to take matters  into their own hands is a fantasy, just like you're not going to go  and repair your car yourself and know exactly how it works.  You bring it to the shop and they do it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So by the way, somebody in the chair is pointing out and I know this,  that the cookie thing is actually predates GDPR.  I don't know what happened with GDPR that every site now does it.  It may be that GDPR has, I don't know, has stepped up the enforcement or something.  But now it's much more prevalent than it used to be.  Used to be you'd only see it.

Transcript:  But the GDPR notices are lit.  I think I'm not 100 percent sure, but I think it's states.  It has to be at least a third of the size of your website.  Like you can't miss it.  And that's specifically because with the cookies, they would put a tiny little bar  at the bottom that you wouldn't really see or care about.  So it's more obvious.

Transcript:  You've had it for 15 years from Mashable.  Michael Nunez is also here as deputy tech editor at Mashable.  Great to have you, Michael.  He's in New York. So it's not that late.  Not that now. Not too bad.  Game of Thrones is an honor, I think.  So you could stay late. Yeah. Yeah.  And Harry McCracken, the technologizer.  Great afternoon here.  It's mid afternoon. It's early.  There's plenty of time left.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.  If you're home hunting, you may not feel like there's plenty of time left.  You watch those interest rates kind of ticking up and thinking,  if it goes up another quarter point, that's going to be thousands of dollars  more this home's going to cost us. That might put some pressure on you.  That's why the folks at Quicken Loans have decided they're very customer focused.  They decided there's a better way  to get you a home loan, a way that takes the anxiety out of it.  They call it their power buying process.  We've talked about Rocket Mortgage before, how it makes it easy to get a loan.  You could do it all online, even on your phone.  You could do it from an open house.  There's several stages that are involved in this new power buying process.  The first stage we talked about before, you go to rocketmortgage.com  slash twit number two, rocketmortgage.com slash twit two.  And you answer a few questions.  They have relationships with all the financial institutions.  So they just say, is it all right if we go get that information?  You say, yes, you don't have to go to the attic and pull out  pay stubs or anything like that. They get everything they need.  They say, yeah, good. Pick a loan. You're ready. We're ready.  Within 24 hours, they then give you the next step, which is verified approval.  Now, at this point, you've got a letter you could show the realtor.  You could say, look, I'm I'm I'm good for it.  I'm good for it.  You basically have the strength of a cash buyer.  That is awesome.  So that takes a lot of the pressure out, too.  When you're making an offer on a house, you know, you've got the loan.  But here's the best part.  Once you qualify, you've got the all new rate shield approval.  They lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.  You have three months and the interest rates can't go up.  You have up to three months to shop. No pressure.  Don't worry about the interest rates going up.  They go down, they'll go down, but they're not going to go up.  It's exactly what you'd expect from America's best mortgage lender.  Number one in customer satisfaction, eight years in a row, according to J.D.  Power, number one in volume two, they're America's largest and best.  To get started, go to RocketMortgage.com  slash twit to rate shield approvals only valid in certain 30 year purchase  transactions, additional conditions or exclusions may apply  based on quick and loans data in comparison to public data records.  Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.  Dot org number 3030.  It's RocketMortgage.com slash twit to  RocketMortgage.com slash twit to we thank them so much for making twit possible.  Here's a little revelation.  This actually happened months ago, but is now  become public thanks to Reuters.  Face the federal government, the Department of Justice  asking Facebook for help wiretapping Facebook Messenger.  They want to hear a suspect's voice conversations in a criminal probe.  This is according to Reuters, who say three people briefed on the case, said this.  It was an unreported case in federal court.  It's under seal.  No filings are publicly available.  Facebook, according to the source, is contesting the DOJ's demand.  This is coming up in Fresno, California, as part of an investigation of the MS 13 gang.  Facebook's fighting.  I don't know how long they can fight, though, ultimately don't.  Isn't this just out of their hands?  The court will rule and Facebook will have to do it.  This is similar to the FBI asking Apple to decrypt the iPhone.

Yeah, they just don't want to do it.  Yeah. Anything to say about this?  How do we feel about it? I have such mixed feelings, because on the one hand, you want to  help police catch bad guys.

Transcript:  Right. All right.  Oh, that was easy. Thank you, Pat.  You're welcome. Got that all.  Be reasonable today.  Here's an article from New York magazine.  SEO is back.  Thank God.  Now, a few people might say, wait a minute, what's to think about that?  SEO, search engine optimization.  And the reason is this report from the Australian that Campbell Brown was in Sydney last week  talking to publishers, actually specifically the Murdoch-owned Australian, saying,  we're not interested in talking to you about your traffic and referrals anymore.  That is the old world.  There's no going back.  She said, Zuckerberg's giving me a lot of leeway and concessions,  but it looks like your business is dying and you can't.  Headed for a hospice.  It's headed for the hospice and you can't count on us to send you traffic anymore.

Transcript:  Although I believe Facebook said she did not say that, at least in those words.

Start time: 6329.38
End time: 6431.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  On the other hand, I've heard it from other sources that Campbell Brown,  who was, of course, a journalist for many years and now works with Facebook to liaise  with the journalists, is being fairly blunt that, look, we're not here to help you,  to drive traffic to you.  You know, you've got to solve your own business problems yourself.  Don't expect us to come in and save you.  I don't think that that's so bad.  In fact, this article in New York magazine says, great, that old world, the world where,  you know, magazines would put headlines in designed to drive social media traffic or  you won't believe what happened next kind of headlines.  New York magazine writes, that old world absolutely sucked and it made the internet  ecosystem a discernibly worse place.  Sometime around 2012, the ecology of digital publishing underwent an epical shift.  Yeah, I'd like you to talk about this, Harry, because you've seen this happen directly.  Facebook overtook Google as the top traffic source on the web.  So in the past, you'd be doing SEO to get higher Google ranking.  But SEO isn't all that bad.  It's, according to this article, sort of a guessing game, a digital jeopardy in which  the person creating web content tries to think of the query that will get users to their  web content.  So that's why an article might be headlined, what time is the Super Bowl, as opposed to  the Super Bowl is coming up soon.  But you could argue, well, yeah, you're trying to be more helpful.  Uh, instead, when Facebook got involved, the key to a good piece of Facebook optimized  content was that it was emotionally intelligent, often in an exaggerated manner.  It wasn't just 21 pictures that will make you feel good.  It was 21 pictures that will restore your faith in humanity.

Start time: 6432.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The author of this article, in fact, I want to give the author credit, Brian Feldman,  says, for instance, when an article, when a writer pads their article for the trailer  of the newest Marvel movie for SEO, they'll pad it with searchable keywords like the cast  and crew and the opening date they're optimizing for SEO.  But that provides genuinely useful information.

Start time: 6469.23
End time: 6490.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a good piece.  I think it is complicated.  I think the worst Facebooky headlines stopped working very well a while ago.  You don't see anywhere near as many of them as you used to.  I always associate them with the site Upworthy, which collapsed in the last week or two.  Oh, did it really?  Yeah.  Back in 2012, it was going gangbusters in those headlines.

And if you do that and you're being accurate, that's an entirely moral thing to do.  And it has the side benefit of also helping you on Facebook and Twitter and Google.

Now by Facebook's own account, the valve to the fire hose has been closed.  Great.  Use it to build brand awareness or whatever, but otherwise it's time to recalibrate  and leave the reliance on Facebook as a traffic source behind.  I think that's well written.  Readers learned.

Transcript:  Jan Kuhm, who was one of the founders of WhatsApp and kind of gotten a little tiff with  Facebook over advertising and WhatsApp.  Facebook wants to do it.  Jan Kuhm does not.  There's also some issue about- we were talking about encryption in WhatsApp and whether  Facebook maybe would do end to end or not.  He quit in April or said he was quitting in April, but according to this article in  The Wall Street Journal, he continues to show up once a month.  Now remember, Facebook bought WhatsApp for money and stock, stock which skyrocketed to  over $22 billion for an app.  I think that's still the record price paid for an app.  Kuhm has been there for three and a half years.  As usual in this kind of acquisition, the stock doesn't vest all at once.  You don't get to use it all at once.  It's kind of spread out over a period of time.  So apparently Facebook spokeswoman declined to comment on Mr. Kuhm's schedule, but said  he remains employed at the company working on various products and helping transition  WhatsApp leadership.  Here's why if you're Kuhm, you want to show up.  He still has about $450 million worth of Facebook stock that he hasn't cashed in.  Actually, he's set to collect it right about now, two and a half million shares.  It's contingent on him being employed at Facebook.  So he's still showing up.  They call it rest and vest.

It's not about- and you can't really share links or anything like that.  It's the kind of the best parts of Facebook.  You just see, you keep in touch with family and friends through pictures, which is the  quote unquote good part of Facebook.  So it makes sense.  Yeah, I like pictures.

Transcript:  Let's see.  Ajit Pai tells the Senate why he lied to them.  Oh, God.  He said, I didn't want to, but I had to.  I had to.  I was told I couldn't tell you.  Thank you.  So this goes back to the net neutrality regulations and FCC opening up their comment area for  comments and John Oliver saying, again, for the second time, everybody should go there  and tell them preserve net neutrality.  So many people did.  The site went down.  Could have just been traffic, too much traffic.  It went down the first time too, right?  Instead, the FCC said we were hit by a cyber attack.  It was a DDoS and we can't accept any more comments.  That's it.  We're done.  Pai went before a congressional committee for the first time this week since an internal  investigation found that the agency misled the public by claiming it was a cyber attack.  Agit Pai said, I couldn't tell you.  I was told I was bound by a request for confidentiality by the department of the inspector general.  The FCC, Pai said, quote, wanted to get this information to you sooner, but I made the  judgment we had to adhere to the request, even though I knew we would be falsely attacked  for having done something inappropriate.  What?  I know it's a little bit head spinning.

And then there was an investigation that said, you know, we're going to have to get this  right.  And then there was an investigation that said, okay, it's not a DDoS, but you can't say it's  not a DDoS.  And then in the end, they said they didn't worry about any of the comments or this makes  no sense at all.  None of it makes sense.  And we were talking about, you know, the dark patterns and the way the companies confuse  you in the that's what it's doing.  Right.  Am I crazy?  That's what he's doing.

I'm from Europe, so I'm not exactly sure my information is accurate, but my understanding  is the FCC is supposed to like legally take into account the comments that they have on  the decision.  That's for sure true.  But they didn't.

There is no apologizing.  And blame your cutouts.  Heaven forbid someone admitted...  Yeah.  Exactly.  Yeah.  They just find a strategy to wriggle out of that lie later, long after the lie has been made.  So it's super disappointing when it comes to leaders doing this on important tech issues.  Because this is the thing that's going to carry the country forward in a lot of cases.  And we should be sort of the guiding light or we should be laying the foundation for  the rest of the world to follow when it comes to a lot of these things.  But instead we're just...  I don't know, man.  It's really disappointing when I read stuff like this because I just think that it's hurting  people in ways that they probably don't understand.

Transcript:  The federal appeals court has stayed an FCC decision pending appeal.  The FCC said that they were going to kill tribal subsidies for Lifeline internet access,  a $25 a month Lifeline subsidy.  The court said, nope, can't do it.  We're going to have to go back to court and fight it.  The tribes and the small carriers who provide the internet to the tribes had sued the FCC  saying there's a substantial risk tribal populations will suffer widespread loss  of vital telecommunication services if the state isn't approved it was.  So a little victory there.  Let's take a break and I've got the bits and pieces including some amazing  inventions and the annals of technology.  But first a word from an amazing invention in the annals of postal service.  You wouldn't think there'd be a new and better way to do stamps, but there is stamps.com.  We're not talking a postage meter.  We're talking about buying and printing real U.S. postage the minute you need it using your  computer and your printer from stamps.com.  In fact, you get all these amazing services of the post office right from your desk  anytime of the day or night whenever you need it.  You can buy and print official U.S. postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail.  The mail carrier still comes and picks it up.  Actually, it's even better than that because regulations require that if you have a package  greater than a pound you can't put it in the mailbox.  You have to bring it to the post office unless you use stamps.com mail carrier pick it up  no matter what size.  Stamps.com suggests ways to save money.  You can actually get discounts you won't even get at the post office.  It fills in all the forms for you for international mailing and certified mail.  No equipment to lease, no long-term commitments.  You'll even get a digital scale that automatically calculates exact postage.  And it looks great.  You can print right on the envelope.  The return address automatically printed a corporate logo if you want.  It'll take the address of this recipient from your address book, fill it in automatically  for you a lot less typing, a lot faster, a lot more professional looking.  Prints out labels for packages.  And we have an amazing special offer that includes $55 in free postage.  That digital scale I mentioned and a four-week trial.  All you have to do is go to stamps.com.  Up in the upper right-hand corner on the website you'll see a radio microphone.  Click that, enter tweet, and you're going to get an amazing offer.  They're giving you $55 in free postage just to try.  Stamps.com.  We use it here and you will love it too.  There's no better way to do everything you would do at the post office right from your desk.  Stamps.com.  Enter tweet and you're going to get an amazing offer.  The world's smallest transistor switches.  This is an amazing story.  So Intel has had some trouble.  It's the one atom one.  One atom.  Intel's had trouble getting 10 nanometer parts made.  They say maybe next year.  Much to the chagrin of Apple and others who depend on Intel parts.  Scientists in, I assume this is Holland, at the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology  have come up with the world's smallest transistor switches.  It's one atom which is about a tenth of a nanometer.  That is one hundredth the size of even the chip that Intel can't make.  One atom repositioning that single atom in a gel works as a transistor.  But even more importantly, they've done this before at absolute zero,  273 degrees Celsius below zero.  This is at room temperature which means it consumes very little energy.  In fact, a significant factor less.  This quantum electronics element enables switching energy  smaller than those of conventional silicon technologies  by a factor of get ready 10,000.  So imagine getting a hundred times more storage in the same size  at a tenth of the electricity.  This sounds really good.  Now, I don't know what the manufacturing situation is,  but I think that's an important breakthrough.  I just wanted to pass that along.

Now, you know, it's funny because remember we were all excited  about that cross point technology until announced the 3D chip technology  that would increase the density and so on.  And it took a few years, but it's obtained.  Until it has announced it, it's going to ship it or it's shipping it.  Some of it already.

So I do think these things get out here.  We should probably pay more attention to how long.  Who knows?  Maybe there's all sorts of issues with single atom transistors,  but I just think that's a fascinating story.  I had to mention it.  There was another invention I wanted to talk about.  Maybe it was this, the digital birth control app that is only 93% effective  but has now been approved by the Food and Drug Administration.  Maybe it's that one.  What?  Natural Cycles.  I'm sorry.  It's from Sweden.  It's up your way.  It's from Sweden.  It's the Rhythm method.  You've probably heard of this.  It includes a thermometer and an app,  and you take your temperature, and it tells you if you're fertile or not.  If it's used perfectly, Natural Cycles says it's 99% effective,  but under typical use, 93% effective.  And in fact, one hospital in Sweden reported 37 cases of unwanted pregnancies among women  using the app.  But it is approved.  According to Natural Cycles, 900,000 people use the mobile app.  Let's see.  900,000 with a 7% rate of pregnancy.

Transcript:  That's a lot of babies.  Well, I guess it's approved doesn't mean that  you know the FDA is saying this is a method of birth control.  It's an app that tells you if you use it normally,  you're going to have a 93% chance of not having a baby.  And it states this pretty clear.  They're clear.  I guess it wouldn't be the place for the FDA to say, no, you can't sell this or you can't.

And it looks like Steam is going to do another streaming gaming service like Twitch,  like Amazon owns Twitch.  What was it?  It was caffeine TV and now a steam valves.  Steam TV was briefly live.  There's a mixer as well.  Mixer from Microsoft.  Right. Steam was briefly live showing the Dota 2 competition, but it was an accident.  Valve said that was just a test feed that accidentally went public.  However, those who saw it said it worked pretty well.  So get ready.  Steam TV is coming.  I like it because we are on Twitch.  We're on Mixer.  We're on YouTube.  These services, it doesn't just have to be gaming.  They allow us to stream free.  I like it.  I think it's a good thing.  Ironically, we were on Ustream for many years and now IBM is charging for their streaming.  It's not free anymore.  It's a good thing there's others.

Transcript:  Just a quick disclaimer.  I used to work for Blizzard a long time ago now, but I did.  So that's an ethical statement.  But yeah, it's a new expansion.  So usually what they do is that they add a new landmass,  a new number of levels that you level through,  and a new adventure, a new narrative thread that you go through.  And this one is pretty good.  They divide between the two factions of the game, the Horde and Alliance,  and they give you two entirely different continents to explore.  So the rivalry is very strong.  And it's working.  Narratively, it's pretty well done.  You like it.  You're playing.  So how many hours a week do you play World of Warcraft?  Well, when a new expansion comes out, it's usually all in for a few weeks.  And in the past four days, it's been, I would say, can I say?  A little more.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Wow.  But they've done, they've been pretty clever.  What they do now is that basically with every new expansion,  they give you a character boost that brings you to the level  you need to be at the beginning of the expansion.  Oh, that's smart.  You don't need to worry about anything else.  You just buy the expansion and of course pay for your subscription,  which I'm guessing they hope you will forget about,  just like every other subscription you have in your life.

Start time: 8074.88
End time: 8129.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a complicated issue because Tim Sweeney, the CEO of Epic,  has always had a strong stance against these stores that he feels  kind of control the OS a little bit too much.  So he has a ground to stand on when he's saying this.  At the same time, the 30% obviously is something that is difficult to swallow  when your game is already the biggest thing in the world,  and you're probably going to get people to install it no matter what.  The problem isn't so much that as what happens afterwards.  Actually, Google did something really smart and really good for security.  On the App Store, now they say if you search for Fortnite,  they say we don't have the game on the App Store,  so don't bother installing those other apps.  That's good.  It's not available.

Start time: 8129.50

So the real question is how many people need to see  a product before they actually click through and buy it.  That's something that I don't have a firm understanding on,  but I at least am getting a good gauge for how many people  this stuff will reach for just a couple of bucks.
