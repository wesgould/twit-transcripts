Transcript:  Welcome back, one and all, to Twit This Week in Tech. I am not Leo Laporte. I am Jason Snell.  It is Labor Day weekend. There are things going on. It's a little bit quiet. It's the end of summer.  But there's stuff to talk about. And I'm here live in California. Unfortunately, no one else is.  Fortunately, I have a wonderful collection of people in New England who are here via computer screen.  Let me introduce our wonderful guest on today's episode of Twit. Andy Anadko is here.  Beloved technology industry pundit. Regular appearances on MacBreak Weekly.  And always when I think of Boston, I think Andy Anadko. Hi, pal.

I wanted to ask you to please not insult our patron saint, Mark Wahlberg, today on the show.  I would appreciate that. Or Tom Brady. It would just make us feel more comfortable.

Transcript:  Live action. Thank you for the footnote in the middle of your week. Praise for Ben Affleck.  Let's talk about some technology topics. How about that? That is why the people tune in on Labor Day weekend.  If they are out there, which I'm sure they are.  I want to start with Apple because first off, I have spent my career writing and talking about Apple,  but also because we're in the silly season that is right before the Big Apple event,  which was announced it's going to be on September 12th, a Wednesday.  They sent out an invitation to members of the media showing a golden ring that is basically the Apple Loop logo,  although that didn't stop people from joking that they're going to release a circular laptop.  That's probably not going to happen. They will almost certainly release new iPhones, maybe iPads,  probably new Apple watches as well.  And one of the reasons we know about the phone and the watch is because 9to5Mac discovered basically,  let's just say somebody put some graphics up on I think an Apple server somewhere using a guessable file name structure.  And guess what? Somebody was guessing.  And so 9to5Mac has images of a new Apple watch with edge to edge.  It looks like basically the same shape of the Apple watch, but the screen goes edge to edge.  No bezels. If you are an investor in bezels, by the way, I'm sorry. It's a bad time for you.  And new versions of the iPhone X, including a much larger version as well as a large non-OLED, an LCD version.  But there's an image of the two small and large iPhone Xs as well.  So if you're at Apple and your job is keeping product security for just two more weeks and we'll get across the finish line,  well, the sad trombone is playing for you.  But we've got the information. We're on the outside. We don't care. We're not working at Apple.  So what does everybody think? New Apple stuff is on the horizon. Andy, why don't we start with you?  What's your read on what we know so far about what Apple is doing in a couple of weeks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the news about the the new Apple line. Excuse me.  The new iPhone line, especially the idea of having a humongously crazy, stupid, big iPhone 10,  because I really missed having the Mac, the iPad mini to play with.  And so now you can sort of if it's really as big as they're saying, six point five inches diagonal,  that will maybe give me some of that iPad mini love that I've been missing out on for the past couple of years.  And I also like the idea of doing a an iPhone excess.  That's really the name of it.  Basically, finding a way to make something that is nearly as good as an iPhone 10.  But why don't we just take away the things that don't necessarily affect performance?  Like what if we switch to an aluminum frame instead of a steel one?  What if we switch to LCD instead of OLED and be able to get the price way, way, way, way down?  Let everybody have face ID, even the people who normally would buy like the the the people last year  who would have bought the iPhone seven or the iPhone eight.  Isn't it great that they can have like the really cool notch screen?  That is the other thing that if you see my great grandfather, his first job as an Italian immigrant  was in the factory floor, creating creating, taking notches out of screens like the classical hand tooled methods  that he brought with him from Italy.  And he would be out of a job now because if you don't have a not screen, you are nothing.  So those are my two favorite things from from the thing what we think we know right now.

Transcript:  Man, I just Jason, I know you love Apple.  I support you. But like I like I'm so bored.  This is a safe space. Be bored. It's safe to be bored.  OK, I'm so bored. I'm glad this is a safe space to say this.  Admittedly, I'm also an Android. So, you know, I have my Pixel first generation.  I'm just holding on to that, waiting for that October 9th.  You know, the other events that's coming up. We'll get there. Yes. Yes.  We'll get there. But the I think what is fascinating to watch as I guess kind of an Apple outsider is just how much like they just do one thing.  They send out an invite with a circle on it.  And that becomes a huge conversation on Twitter for like five days straight, which I think is amazing.  You have to give them that right. You have to give them like what they do still matters.  Even tiny little design choices, which frankly, as near as we can tell, that's what we're going to see in this event.  Right. We're not going to see any huge leaps forward in small device computing technology here.  We're talking again, as per usual, about changes in bezel, disappearing bezel, using a different metal that supposedly maybe will make the phone function better.  Like, I guess I've just become that, you know, I don't know, old guy yelling in a room by himself saying, like, show me something amazing.  And this is this is all incremental stuff. And that's fine.  But I guess, yeah, I've become that guy who's like, like, I don't know, make it and turn it into a like a convincing virtual reality, augmented reality device.  Like, show me something amazing and I'll be excited about Apple again until then.  I'm going to yawn a little bit.

Transcript:  Must be nice to send out an invitation to an event that has nothing in it of interest at all.  It's literally the logo for their new campus where they're holding the event and have people spend several days talking about your invitation.  If only, you know, a wedding save the date invitation got so much. But no, it's just Apple.  Brie, what do you think? Are you are you more interested in this than Ben is?

Transcript:  I also want to say I love like the saddest thing about the server leak is like when I found out about it.  I'm imagining like what goes on in Guangzhou with the people actually assembling Apple devices where, you know,  they're patted down and x-rayed as they're going into the factory to build these things.  And then, you know, back here in America, somebody just didn't think like encrypt the server before everything is going live.  And it all gets out. I find that deeply ironic.  As far as this generation of iPhone, you know, we've had some real turkey S years, in my opinion, the five S and moving to 32 bit and touch idea.  First, I don't think that was the best phone.  But for this year, with the different sizes of phone, I'm actually I'm really excited about this.  I do think there's some room for a faster processor in the iPhone 10.  I think it does stutter just a little bit.  And for me, even though I know like the screen in it is bigger than the old seven plus, I just liked that bigger form factor for me on my campaign.  I use my phone so much more than I use the Mac we have dedicated to it.  So, you know, the idea of having more battery life and more screen, that's a product I'm very, very excited to buy,  which is why I was sad that it looks like there's going to be no pencil support.

Start time: 714.44
End time: 736.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I'm sad about that, too.  That's that's a report. Who knows?  It seemed to me like if they're going to do a giant iPhone 10, which is which is what we've seen, it seems like that's going to happen, that that would be a great time to do a revision of the Apple pencil and bring that support.  They've got all the software there from the iPad and bring that in because you've got it at that.  You've literally got a phone the size of a notepad.  Why not let people write on it?

Start time: 737.74
End time: 740.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'd have to make a smaller pencil, which would also be a great product.

Start time: 740.95
End time: 794.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like a golf pencil. The Apple golf pencil that could do it.  I think in terms of the talkier versus it's like a tick tock.  It's the S year. As you said, Brie, the idea that at least doing a this big phone is more interesting, a big iPhone 10 than if it was literally the same phones we saw last year.  And then having this other large but cheaper phone is also something to give even though Ben is bored.  It's a little bit more interesting than if it was literally the same phones you saw last year, but slightly faster.  But I do want to ask about this because I know a lot of people who really don't like large phones.  And if you do like a large phone, bless you. It's great.  But the rumors do not encompass an update to what we think of as the iPhone 8, which is has been the shape and size of the iPhone for the last five years.  And I wonder, you know, is that a problem? Is Apple's?  I know there's a market for bigger phones, but is Apple basically saying if you don't like a huge phone, the iPhone 10 is your only option?

Start time: 796.77
End time: 839.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a good question. I do. I also I'm a huge fan of big phones as well.  Like all of my phones have been huge since I had that option.  And and I really do think it's it's it has been interesting to see them sort of like take the place of tablets as Andy was talking about.  So like I don't I don't know. Again, it's like the question of like if Apple makes a move, does everyone just say, OK, I guess we're all getting big phones now if we want the new version.  But yeah, I don't know. I think that's a I don't know. I think that's a good question, Jason.  My guess is that like if Apple just makes a bigger version and is like you have to get a bigger phone now, people will fall into line.  I feel like I have a really interesting perspective on this.

Transcript:  They actually came out with guidelines for people running for high level office, basically steering us away from certain brands of Android phones because of security leaks and hacking.  So my campaign has literally every single size of iPhone that they make.  I bought that for somebody on our campaign for my call time phone.  I don't use my personal phone. I have a different iPhone that I use for that.  It's a little iPhone SE. I would love to see them update this phone as part of their line this year.  I mean, it's it's we've gotten so used to the bigger phones that when you hold the smaller one in your hand and you're just fitting in your purse, I think we've really forgotten just how awesome that is.  I mean, like it's a little small emergency phone that weighs nothing that you can use, you know, like as a backup phone.  I would love to see them just update that, make it a little thinner and put it right back out.  So I also say like I agree with you, Jason, that there are people that don't like big phones.  There are people that don't want to spend a thousand dollars on a phone like we do.  Simone to rush for a friend of mine.  She just absolutely thinks it's absurd to spend that much on the phone and she's the person that goes out and buys that, you know, the model from last year at a lower price point.  So I do worry that they're not going to that they're going to be pushing us towards the higher end and are going to kind of ignore other kinds of consumers.

Start time: 933.70
End time: 964.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's intriguing about the combination of having a phone that is the rumored cheaper phone, which is this six point one inch phone.  So like, well, wait a second. So it's cheaper, but it's also larger.  And that that's a little bit of a of a conundrum if you're somebody who doesn't want to spend a lot of money on a phone but also doesn't want a large phone.  But I guess it's also a great value if you do want a large phone that there will be one that's cheaper.  Also, there's some rumors I should just mention in passing some rumors that maybe the iPhone 10 won't be a thousand dollars this year, that it might actually go down a hundred, which is still not a cheap phone.  But it is cheaper than it was last year. And that might be good.

Start time: 964.00
End time: 1087.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's that's one of the ongoing worries about Apple that because they have the horrible responsibility of making literally every single phone that runs iOS and runs iOS apps.  But they can't deliver the sort of broad accessibility that the Android platform can.  And it's not just we have to remember that as convenient as the larger screens are for reading and for media and stuff like that.  Large phones are unavoidably sexist because I'm a dude.  I also am a dude with poor fashion sense.  So I've got lots of pockets and they're all big.  But if I were a woman, I would not have as many pockets and they would be not not big enough for these kinds of phones.  And if you have if you're on the Android platform, you can actually you can actually seek out phones that are pretty much if you just come up the list of everything that you would like to have in a phone.  Chances are excellent that you can find it somewhere in Android.  I've got a in my in my library of phones I bought last year, a Kickstarter phone that runs the second to latest version of Android.  But it is like it is literally about the size of like this battery charger pack.  And it's a full touch screen phone. It has dual SIMs.  It has SIM expansion. It's unlocked.  And I actually use it.  I actually bought it because for one hundred dollars I could I wanted to have like an a music player that will work with Google Music and all the other servers services and also be able to contain like my entire music library.  But I'm also using it occasionally when like I'm at the beach and I don't I'm probably not going to be using my phone much.  And it's OK. And I kind of it's OK for me to have lost or gotten wet one hundred dollar phone.  And I took it to a place where I needed to remind myself not to be on my phone because that would have been incredibly rude.  So I have this thing where I can just take place text messages.  So that's the problem. The lack of diversity, both economic diversity and size diversity.  So I think that Apple's missing a trick if they don't figure out a way to preserve at least the classic iPhone size and scale and keep that in the product line.

Start time: 1088.00
End time: 1132.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's funny. I was actually just thinking that this is I see the signs that Apple's actually knows now that it has a problem with not you know for the longest time the iPhone was literally an iPhone.  Like we can only make one kind guys. So here it is. You've got the entire spectrum of Android phones and an iPhone.  And if you look where they're going it's if these rumors are true we may see an Apple that is selling an iPhone SE an iPhone essentially eight this new large lower cost iPhone.  Plus the iPhone 10 size plus this larger iPhone 10 size at that point it's like OK.  That and with presumably a spread of prices in there it's not going to ever match what Android can have.  But I do wonder if Apple realized that what's holding the iPhone back at this point is a lack of diversity in the product line.

Start time: 1135.14
End time: 1140.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're running out of people to sell iPhones to which means they're going to have to figure out who's that why people aren't buying them and price and size are probably two big reasons.

Start time: 1143.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm also waiting for like this is the extreme trend obviously but I am also waiting for I feel like more and more I run into people who are much younger than me who are who are basically like want to flip phone basically want like this.  Right.  Like are not like do not make phone calls or pick up phone calls don't are actually sort of suspicious of being always on their phone and using the Internet on their phone and are like I'm sort of waiting for this like I feel like I'm seeing the edges of it just anecdotally of people younger people who are like you know what a flip phone would be fine.  Like if I can send text messages which is basically all I do anyway on my phone and maybe take good pictures like that would be enough for me.  So I feel like I don't know maybe that's too crazy but I feel like there's a there's a further extreme coming in the phone market and obviously Android has some crazy options like this or not crazy but older options like this that run some of the more recent operating systems but are much simpler phones.  So I don't know I'm curious to see in the coming five years if we see more of that.  One last Apple thing before we move on.

Transcript:  I use the Apple watch.  I don't know if anybody else here I know many of you have used it.  Bree do you use an Apple watch.  Right there.  Yeah there it is.  So the rumor about the Apple watch where they again.  Hey there was a file on an open web server about an event that's happening in two weeks.  What could go wrong.  Show the Apple watch with this edge to edge display.  The idea is it's not necessarily going to be bigger but there'll be more pixels on it which I think is going to be a big win especially for people who use the smaller of the models.  I talked to a couple of designer friends I know who looked at this image that that you're putting we're putting up on the video version of the show anyway that is this.  It's got like 10 different complications on it.  And basically what they all said is oh the horrors that it's so junky there's so much there.  And as an Apple watch user I looked at this and I was like finally a watch face that I can put stuff on because for me I was always frustrated that I couldn't get enough information on my watch face.  I don't know if you feel that way Bree but that was definitely the first thing I thought of when I saw that image.  No I couldn't agree more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's worth saying like the Apple watch has it has gotten so much better since that series zero.  I mean the first one I had it and I remember getting it and I work out every single day I run.  So I used it but like when it finally died and the battery and it wasn't working anymore I didn't replace it just like through a series of things.  I ended up getting one with the cellular capabilities in it and I really really like the series three.  So I almost feel like it's a shame that from the outside it really looks like the same watch.  And I think that's kind of unfortunate because I think a lot of people that were kind of underwhelmed by this along the way.  I don't know that they're going to be looking at a watch with a little bit of extra you know pixels around the edges and feeling like that's a product they should take a second look at.  As far as UI I'm right there with you.  I think it looks it looks much better.  But what I can't tell from that picture is if they've made it any thinner finally.  And that's really my main complaint with it.  You know the battery life in the series three it's OK.  It's it's better than it was but it's nothing to write home about.  And you know it's a watch that you know like when I go on TV I'm embarrassed to wear it generally.  So I just I really would have thought they'd make more progress on it by now if that makes sense.  It does make sense.

Start time: 1366.00
End time: 1409.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does make sense.  Keep in mind it was literally four years ago that that product was announced.  It's only been out for three and a half years and this will be the latest iteration of it.  They've come a long way.  I think you're right though that you can see that they've kind of emphasized features and the software has really progressed in the last couple of years.  It's way more capable as a device than it was.  But it does feel like they prioritized all of that over making a big hardware like a look change to it.  And and so it does look the same.  It's it's this one will no doubt be better but it does look the same.  You got to wonder when they're going to finally just break compatibility.  It feels like maybe now is that maybe next year is the time where they say I'm glad you bought all those watch bands.  We're Apple.  You're going to buy new watch bands.  Now that's just how it's going to have to be.  Pay us money.

We're back here in the studio.  I mean by we I mean me and then everybody else is in Massachusetts.  I want to talk about the Google Pixel 3.  It's it sounds like it's going to be announced October 9th in New York City.  So about a month after Apple's event there are definitely things afoot.  They are being approved by the FCC.  A lot of stuff has leaked about them.  And today I read that somebody left one in the back of a car and and the Uber driver was very nice enough to take pictures and post them on the Internet before giving it back to the person who came to claim it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm interested.  I'm interested.  I think the thing that annoyed me about the Pixel 2 was that you basically and Apple fans will of course relate to this is that you you couldn't actually you know they got rid of the headphone jack and the you had to get these new wireless earbuds.

But no but I do think I you know I'd like to see what they do with that because I am still an old fashioned regular wired earbuds guy.  I think the thing that most intrigued me about the Pixel 2 was the live Google translate function.  I just as a huge fan of you know like all of the books that we think of when we think of live translation as a technology.  I think that was the thing that most interested me about the Pixel 2.  And I think again Google software power I was driving in the car yesterday with my brother in kind of like showing off to him Google's assistant.  And he and he said to me he was like wow Google's pretty good.  And I was like yeah obviously.  And he was like Siri sucks.  I'm not going to come out too hard against Siri against Apple.  But I do think that like at least with the Pixel 2 at least this live translate function and basically Google being able to show off its software power in its device was the most interesting thing to me.  So I'm sort of intrigued to see what they release with the Pixel 3.  And as long as it's got a headphone jack maybe they'll go back to the headphone jack I'm hoping then I will definitely buy into the Pixel 3.

The so many Android phones have picked up on the notch design language slash compromise from Apple.  And the pictures that I see of the Pixel 3 it's just got a little bezel at top and bottom and they're not going with the indentation.  Is that is that right.  Is that your understanding Andy.

It does let you put a larger display in the same size device but it's not as though I'm suddenly going to be able to like read two page comic book spreads and comics ology because I've got a notched screen is it.  So it's fine.  I just I just think it's silly when people say oh my God look how big that notches.  Oh the notch.  That's like I need to be I need to hold a martini glass and put on a monocle so it's a little that monocle could fall theatrically into the martini glass.  Yeah I think and for me I am anticipating buying a pixel three because I do like the size.  I love my pixel one which I actually bought a year later as a piece of overstock.

If you if you if you take like at least me again like that's 80 percent of what I do with my phone is take pictures.  And I think you know just having an amazing camera is huge in the pixel one and I you know again like if they if they come out with hardware that is as good as the pixel one and has a headphone jack.

Transcript:  Well I mean I have a pile of Android phones in you know my our game studio office.  I mean we worked on developing games for Android and you know obviously running for Congress there's not as much time to develop games as I would like.  But I don't have any like philosophical objection to Android.  It's just it's literally like this is not a situation where you want to be hacked right.  You're talking about some really important stuff.  And you know it's I really have always been confused that the pixel is not the most popular Android phone.  I mean I like the Samsung phones that they put out.  I think the touch the Note 9 this year is particularly great.  But I think if you're comparing like the flagship Samsung to the flagship Google it's generally better.  That said I'm looking at this phone this year and I don't think it's really progressing as much as I think the iPhone 10 has.  I'm a big believer in the fingerprint on the back of the phone.  I think it's more convenient if you get used to it even though I love Face ID.  But like I'd love to see I just don't see Android.  I don't see Google rather putting out pixel that makes me go oh wow I want to get that that really looks sexy.  That really looks like a cool design that looks substantially thinner or different or better battery.  I just I don't see that this year.  And that's that's disappointing because I don't want it to be just a you know a Samsung and Apple world for only two people are putting up good phones.

Start time: 2000.42

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so I absolutely see that.  My my excitement about the pixel three is because because I love what Android is doing.  Excuse me Google is doing with Android and I really want my I really want to have a phone they'll be able to that's designed with next year's Android the Android after that in mind.  I think that Android P this year is has got to be one of my favorite updates from last year's to this year's OS on any platform whatsoever.  And that's the thing that gets me really excited about staying as an Android user.  But you're right that this is this is a it's I think that the the the current generation hardware and what we think is going to be next generation's hardware.  It's very very nice and it's great for people like me who will who are only going to be looking at the phone until I get that shipment from spec and I put it in that grippy case that I like all the time.

Transcript:  Can I ask a question like why why does Google.  Why does Google suck at selling hardware.  It seems like maybe they don't suck but it just seems like people.  I also wonder why the pixel is not way more popular than it is.  And I have always felt like the hardware that Google is putting out is basically like an experiment for them to learn new things to make their software better or something like I it just doesn't.  I've never been convinced that Google is serious about hardware and maybe I'm completely wrong on that and happy to be told I'm wrong but it just seems like the stuff that they put out that I have bought is great but they don't.  I don't know it just it does.  I do wonder because some of the hardware is like amazing but it just doesn't seem to gain the same traction as Apple hardware and maybe it never will.  But even it seems even behind Samsung and and you know these other companies that that that make like great phones and great devices as well.  But I'm just sort of surprised I guess that Google's hardware is not more popular than it is.

Start time: 2136.70
End time: 2166.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah I think that I think that and plus is plus simple marketing.  When Samsung comes up with a new phone I mean my metric for marketing is when my commuter train pulls into South Station because Samsung will buy out the entire every every space on every platform and every advertising screen inside South Station and you see them everywhere.  And that's it's not the coincidence that's that's the reason why Samsung is kind of the default phone the default hardware platform for Android and because they are in every single carrier store.

Transcript:  I don't know. I think it's I think it's like Apple.  I think they'd have to go get a foothold at the mall just like Microsoft did.  It's kind of a it's a analogy here but Microsoft has really started to excel at hardware.  I bought the Microsoft Surface Go which I think is it's an exceptional product like from a hardware perspective.  I think the software itself has a lot of issues but the hardware itself is excellent.  You know Apple went to the mall for the first few years of the Microsoft store being there.  It was a ghost town and I don't know what yours are like but when I've been to the one in Burlington or the one in NADAC you know it's a generally popular store these days.  I think Apple's really I mean Microsoft rather has put the time in and they've really built up a following.  I think if you look at the Google Pixelbook I've looked at like I've wanted to buy one of the first gen ones for years and just like hack it to run Linux which is a completely awesome computer if you can do it.  But they sold so few of them. It's still unbelievably expensive to find a really good one.  So I think they can clearly do it as far as the number of phones.  I think they have the partners out there which they've used to produce it.  I think it's just simply a matter of marketing and having like the in front like consumer facing places to go sell it.

They really are town squares where people just go there to hang out or people go there to get a class and fear what's going on.  My Microsoft store is at the Prudential Center actually kind of like one street away almost across the street from the Apple store.  And it's just it's it's usually pretty busy but there's really no it really doesn't invite you to sit down at a big big huge table and just plop your laptop down and work on the free Wi-Fi for as long as you want.  It really is a place to go buy something have a nice conversation with somebody in a very clean polo shirt and then conclude your business and leave.

Transcript:  Oh that's me.  I don't know that because I am not from Boston.  One other Google related thing that I wanted to talk about before the next break which is YouTube owned by Google obviously rolled out a the next step.  Obviously at I.O. they talked about digital well-being and the idea that you're trying to manage how you use technology.  They rolled out a new time watched stat this week in their apps that will actually tell you whether you.  Well I mean you have to look if you don't want to know don't look how much time you spent in today yesterday and in the last week on average watching YouTube.  Now I thought about this and thought my son I wonder if my son could break 24 hours like if you could literally have two screens up and on average you watch YouTube for 27 hours a day.  He could do it.  But you know again I think this is a really interesting trend where the you know seeing how much time you spend on YouTube is probably not going to encourage you to watch more YouTube right.  It's probably going to encourage you to be like oh my God what am I doing here.  And yet they are adding this feature which I you know I think they're to be applauded to do it because I think a lot of us are going to look at that time number and be like oh my God I had no idea I was watching.  I did I did.

Transcript:  Did you do it.  All that.  So I OK I do want to say though my my primary use of you of YouTube is I pay for YouTube premium and it's been my experience when you're out about like streaming YouTube audio really doesn't hurt your data plan that much.  It doesn't seem to be any worse than like streaming music.  So like when you're running for office you're in the car constantly driving from place to place and I love that I can go into the app and can see whatever horrible thing is going on to the news I need to be able to understand and can listen to it while I'm driving.  So my staff was amazingly like four hours like on average a day which I was stunned by.  But it's like I don't think I'm the only person quote unquote watches YouTube by mostly being in the background when I'm doing something else.  I mean that's not just me right.

Transcript:  Well it's weird too.  Like I wonder how many like I guess I'm curious about and I and I don't know maybe people were writing about this but I'm curious about what science they base that on.  Right.  Like I think it is I do think it's admirable that they put out that information and there's sort of this tech wellness thing that's happening and people are talking about.  I do think that that's good to be sort of conscious of the amount of time you are spending using these services.  But at the same time like what we're we're pointing me to the science like anecdotally I totally can relate.  I mean I was going to say shadows of Mordor for me like when I looked at the number of hours that I was playing that game I like almost threw the controller at the television.  I was like oh my God.  But I just wonder I am curious Jason you know you talked about the possibility of like of that actually getting people to stop or to be more conscious of their viewing habits and I and I am curious as to where like is Google actually like looking at science or studies and saying oh yeah this will like get people to be more healthy with their viewing habits or are they saying hey if we put this data people will think that we are in a situation where we're not seeing the data.  I just I just think it's an easy enough thing for them to do.  I think that all these services are coming under a certain level of heat about having an impact on lives but no one knows exactly how good or bad that impact is.

Transcript:  I keep coming back to it's an easy enough thing for them to do and given that they have that it's an excuse to do that.  Essentially an extension of the same sort of stat tracking that they've got going on Android phones now with how much time are you spending in certain apps.  I think that's I think it's a natural progression and a good thing.  What I would love to see is if they were to open up that API so that if someone who does have access to good science wants to build their own data and they're going to be able to do that.  On how you're using these devices and use that harness that data for your personal well being as opposed to Google's advertising well-being.  There are a lot of things that you could say diagnose but it's interesting data.  There have been times where I've looked back on Google's data and I've looked at a lot of good things that Google's data has been finding to be useful.  There have been times where I've looked back on it felt like I wasn't getting out enough.  It felt like and that might be because I'm my mood is bad or something like that.  And I went into that tab in Google where it will say, well, here's where you here's a calendar of like where you went on certain places.  And I could see, oh, wow, that's right. In December, like I didn't really even leave the house for two days.  And then I went out like once just around the block to do some shopping.  And then I didn't leave the house for another two days.  It would be great to have the ability to take a look at that stats to not necessarily not even do something as simple as, gosh, I seem to be spending too much time watching YouTube.  But when you're trying to figure out the status of your well-being and that could be just as simple as, hey, I want to live a happier, more productive life.  Or it might be that I deal with major depression and I need to figure out when I seem to be cocooning as opposed to engaging with the world.  And did these periods of just spending instead of two or three hours watching YouTube to now like eight or nine hours in Netflix and eight or nine hours in this app.  Did that coincide with something else that I could look at and track?  It's good to have that data available. And I don't see any particular downside to it.

It depends on what you want to do. It gives people the option.  I like the idea that people can choose to be aware of what they're doing if they want to make a change in their life.  I also am dreading the fact that in maybe three weeks, iOS 12 is going to come out.  And at some point in the weeks following that, we will be barraged with thousands of think pieces by everybody who is using the new screen time feature, which will be able to say, yes, you are using social media 10 hours a day.  I think it will make people make changes in their in their life habits that will make their lives better.  I do believe that. But boy, there are going to be so many people who are going to be like writing that very serious.

Transcript:  Hi, Jason and gang. Thank you for letting me interrupt.  I'm on vacation right now, but I bet you I'm not sure. But I bet you I'm missing my Casper.  Oh, it's such a good feeling, isn't it?  When you go home after a hard day and you and you and you pull back the sheets, you get under the covers and you just go.  And I get I do I get that every night.  In fact, it is a little hard to travel because I don't know what I'm going to get.  But I know when I get home, I'm going to say, oh, it's so good to be home with my Casper.  Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.  They they noticed there was this real discontinuity in the economics of the mattress business.  It seems that turns out that there's this horrendous markup at the mattress showrooms.  And by selling direct to you, by manufacturing and selling direct to you, Casper saves so much money.  And then they pass that on directly to you.  Brilliant. And man, talk about brilliant.  Casper's mattress obsessively engineered at a fair price made in the USA.  Their expert team of engineers and designers researched, prototyped tests.  They made hundreds of test models.  They wanted to meet the needs of all kinds of sleepers and give you just the perfect balance of both support and the quality of life.  Both support and comfort.  So when you get in bed, you go, oh, I love my Casper.  I love my Casper.  And all Casper mattresses use premium phones that relieve pressure.  No more that hip poking thing, you know, which is, oh, how it helps align your body.  So you fall asleep easily. You wake up feeling refreshed.  And for me, really important, it breathes.  It is you sleep cool on a Casper summer or winter.  That's important. Regulating your body temperature turns out to be one of the most important things during sleep.  Casper makes it easy.

One of the signs of a true media professional, by the way, is that when I'm on the show, I'm getting very excited and I'm going to talk and I'm going to say we're going to talk about this topic and we're going to talk really fast.  And then we cut to Leo and he's just happy to be as slow as he needs to be talking about a mattress.  I aspire to that level of chill on podcasts.  I don't have it yet.  I aspire.  I dream.

But I feel like we need to talk about it because this week, the president of the United States said that Google is out to get him.  It's rigging its search results against him.  The search results are very biased that they didn't promote his State of the Union address, which wasn't really true.  That it was all unfair and Google is a meanie and it's out to get the president of the United States.  And we're taking a look.  Maybe something can be done about Google.

Transcript:  So I'm afraid I may have a different opinion than some of the people here today.  So with Trump, no, it's not.  It's clearly not.  I mean, if you Google Trump's name, and I did before the show, it's linking to reputable search results.  It is showing accurately what credible media sources seem to be thinking about him.  That said, I do think there is an adult discussion to be had about the way that Google ranks things.  One of the things I've really faced in my career is this week I did a piece with Kotaku.  I did Wall Street Journal.  I did New York Times.  You know, there's a lot of credible media sources about me that don't always say things that I like, but it's fair.  It's accurate.  It's well researched.  It's journalism.  Then at the same time, it feels like stuff from very wholly unreputable sites ends up in the search results of a lot of marginalized people's search results.  Like, I dare you to Google any professional woman in the entire world and see what comes up in her search results.  It's going to be Reddit.  You know, it's going to be 4chan.  It's going to be all these these sites that don't really add anything to the conversation.  What I've been trying to talk to Google about for years now in back channel is talking to them about the way that they rank things because people click on dirt and dirt does make things go higher and higher in the rankings.  And I don't have any issue with that being out there and being publicly searchable.  This is the magic of the Internet.  But I do think there's a discussion to be had about how people like to click on dirt.  We like to click on clickbait.  That's why that media model works.  And maybe when it comes to like search results about topics, we should be thinking about ranking New York Times, Washington Post, these really excellent sources of journalism higher than they are.  I totally for the record, I totally agree with you, Brianna.

Transcript:  I think that I like I really I I think that this is a bigger conversation.  And as and as much as I will say that I I'm totally fine with like not seeing any more news period some days.  I like I do.  I do think that this is a bigger conversation.  Obviously, Facebook has struggled with this.  Twitter has struggled with this.  All of the major platforms that we use every day are trying to solve this curated and I think that's a big conversation.  I think that I think that a lot of the major platforms that we use every day are trying to solve this curation question and mostly trying to solve it for their own profitability and for their users.  Right.  But I and I also think it's really tricky when you start to get into this conversation of well, what what news sources should we promote?  I think it's really important to me that these executives that these companies resist this idea because I do think that that is a tricky conversation of saying like, OK, well, let's make sure people get their vegetables right.  And I think that's a really complicated thing of figuring out how to give people news, how to give people their vegetables, for lack of a better term.  So I agree that I think it is a conversation worth having.  I also think and I think we've talked about this on this show before.  In this curation process, it's not going to work to just build, you know, some algorithmic solution to this.  You need a human element when you're talking about fake news or you're talking about like wrong news or bad news or whatever.  So I do think it's a bigger conversation.  I do think that the president is not wrong that there that there may be issues with the larger question of curation on tech platforms, and we need to know more about how they do that.  And I think that's a really important thing to think about.  And I think it's a bigger conversation.  I do think that the president is not wrong that there that there may be issues with the larger question of curation on tech platforms, and we need to know more about how they do it.  And they probably need to do more to make sure they don't do it in an irresponsible way, since they have now become the arbiters of how we take in information all the time.  I think that's a big point to his positive stories getting punished.

Let's let's be clear that there has been throughout my life a very concerted effort by one particular political party to work the refs.  Facebook and the like, not the stories that came out this week about people not feeling they could express conservative opinions at Facebook.  That's part of a whole tactic that has been very, very effective.  So, you know, I think there's a conversation that needs to happen here.  But let's be really clear, like a certain political party is trying to work the referees here and get an outcome in their favor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A couple of things here.  They're they're definitely obviously you.  Google's not responsible when if people are writing about really weird and contrary things that you're saying and Google search finds all those articles.  Yeah, that's that's not Google's problem.  And that's that's your problem.  That's the problem with the people who are who are paid very, very well.  Government salaries to make sure to try to get you not to say stupid and contrary and incorrect things.  But it's good to have that broader question.  You're right about about prejudice and search.  I don't believe there's a liberal prejudice or conservative prejudice.  There is, as Brie mentioned, when you do these searches, you get it seems to be favoring major news, major news outlets that have real journalism that's happening as opposed to Kyle and Randy's political blog.  But that that in itself does point out one prejudice that we're not aware of, that independent voices of journalism are not going to be favored in.  It's always going to be large corporate owned newspapers and media outlets that are going to get the most attention.  That's it's not wrong for the New York Times becomes a juggernaut in these searches results.  But not everybody is as well funded as the New York Times, even though they're doing they're working just as hard and providing just as good journalism.  The other thing is that Google is not necessarily in control of its own algorithm, and they don't know how it works and what effects it has on the people who are doing the searches until somebody.  There's a really great book that I that I got a hold of earlier this year.  I had to go look it up.  Algorithms of Oppression by Jackie Snow.  And it's basically about how search Google search can like enforce racism.  And she did the inciting idea from this book was she did a search for black the term black girls wanting to like find some some pieces that her nieces would enjoy.  But that might find interesting.  And most of the first pages were like links to like model sites and porn sites.  And that was a prejudice that was built into the search engine because the people who are gaming this are looking for trying to hardwire those pages for those two words.  But nonetheless, the more majority of people who are just looking for I'm doing I'm doing a history paper.  I know I want to find out what resources there are for black girls who want to code or black girls who want to get access to whatever.  And that's not something that you get when you do other similar search terms.  So I don't know that it's a problem that Google can very easily solve.  The Boston Globe had a very, very long piece earlier this year that that they decide that they posited that it's time for Google to be broken up in that they made the case that for one thing Google should open up the search algorithm so everyone could see how that works, which is a natural solution to the problem.  We have to find out what's inside this black box.  But the problem is once everyone knows how it works, everybody will figure out how to fool it.  And that can't be that can't happen.  What I what I really favor is it is a black box, but it's an open it's a black box.  We all have access to researchers can send whatever signals that come into it.  Take a look at the signals that come out of it and point out where it's failing.  And so I don't know if this had any direct if the book that I was mentioning had any direct impact like this.  But now if you do search for black girls, there is almost no there's almost nothing that isn't like a LinkedIn profile for black girls code coding programs and other positive and good things.  So so long as we have the if Google is not going to monitor this, we have the ability to monitor it and make sure that it's not having an effect on how in our perception of the world.

Transcript:  Yeah, can I say one more thing before we move on on this?  Sure.  So at the height of Gamergate back in 2014, I got a I got a rather interesting email from a woman and she was describing to me a company that a man in tech had started to basically wage SEO warfare against women that he didn't like.  And the idea was if you broke up with a girl or had some problem with the woman at work, you could destroy her life.  And he had a set of bot farms that would essentially go and rank up anything that the person paying for it wanted in a person's search results to basically destroy this person's professional reputation.  It was shocking to me how little that cost.  You know, Andy, one of the things in the example you just mentioned, they do open up that box.  That's going to be a roadmap for people to know exactly how to conduct SEO warfare.  So I'm not sure that I agree with that.  But I would say SEO warfare as a as a as a tactic.  This has implications for cybersecurity.  It has implications for national national security.  This is information warfare.  And we do need to start to have a discussion about this.  Now, I'm not the kind of person where I believe every single problem needs to be solved by the government.  But I do think that there needs to be a conversation between national security interests and Google to make sure that, you know, other people aren't gaming search results to for nefarious purposes.  And I do think that's a conversation we should start to have.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think you're right.  And despite I have a fear, but that fear shouldn't interfere with this conversation that we need to have.  My fear is that we've seen what happens when people who decide that it's wrong that science doesn't our science textbooks and schools don't cover intelligent design.  We need a balanced look, a balanced discussion of it.  And if we're looking at the looking at the scientific portion of it, it's not balanced unless we look at the other one.  So my fear is my fear.  And again, I don't think this should this fear should supersede ongoing conversation into what how best to integrate search into responsibility for for positive search into society.  My fear is that someone will say, well, look, if you're so if someone is saying did and did Andy Anato who is running for Congress actually steer all of his campaign money into into cookies and beer?  If if they're if they're 41 articles to say, well, I don't know what that rumor is about.  But I want to vote for him.  But exactly. Yeah, I don't I don't know what that investing.  I don't know. I should stress that I'm on the record of saying, no, I'm not even running for office.  But it's like, well, it's not a balanced search unless they're also 40.  It also pulls up 41 articles that says that he did do it.  It's like, well, no, because these are these are idiots who are saying that he did that thing.  He's not even running for office.

Transcript:  I think your statement cuts to the core of a lot of the president's complaints, too, which is we live in an era where people talk about alternative facts and truth not being truth.  And one of the challenges is if you're trying to create this concept of a neutral search engine, but nobody can agree what neutral is.  And you see the arguments around this story.  It's things like how dare that you say that CNN is neutral and Breitbart isn't.  And it's like, OK, well, you know, that is a perspective.  And somebody else might say, how could you say that Fox News is neutral and CNN isn't?  And when you can't agree on like what reality is, it's a problem now, not necessarily to people who know all the brand names and know that when they pull up a Google News search and they see a Breitbart article, they know what they're going to get versus a share blue article, let's say.  But it does matter if it's a topic where somebody is innocently typing something into the Internet wanting to know what the truth is and what they get is not the truth.  But they get this weird collection of potentially like like is the earth flat?  Right. The answer is no, it's not.  And it's not fair and balance.  Wait, wait, wait, wait.  Oh, boy.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Just to one one point of clarification that we shouldn't care whether a news source is biased or not.  We can only hold them to the standard that they have to say things that are factually based.  They can if it's not if it's not labeled as a personal editorial, if they're saying you're free to say that the world is flat, but you have to show your work.  If you've done an incredible amount of research and if you've done all of you've done all the homework and shown all the math, that's OK.  If you're if you're showing if you're just saying, I guess, citing citing other B.S.  blogs that are don't have any any firmament, that's why bias is such a bad word for journalism.  We don't know. I don't know any single any journalist who isn't biased in some way.  But if they are journalists, they know that they can't simply say that employment is way, way, way, way down under Trump.  Well, no, it isn't. You have to you have to come up with numbers to if you want to be a journalist.  You don't start off with the idea. I'm going to write about how the employment is down under Trump.  You write under. Well, how is employment doing under Trump?  And then when you find out that, no, the numbers are actually very, very good.  You bite your tongue, you swallow your bile and you say, well, employment is actually very, very good under Trump, because that's what you can actually prove.  So bias is not as important as being an actual journalist.  Yeah, it's hard stuff.

Imagine if all the issues we have now on this small Internet were taken where everybody on the in the entire world was on the Internet.  That might be bad. That might be bad. That might be bad for society.  Turns out. Well, what you're going to do? Here we are.  Now everybody's on the Internet. And it's we've come a long way in 30 years is what I'm saying.

Transcript:  Leo, let me barge in one more time and talk a little bit about something we did at Twitter that made a huge difference, certainly in peace of mind for me.  It all started when we had an engineer who couldn't remember the passwords. Right.  Now most people, if they can't remember passwords, they'll put a post it note on the screen. They'll write it down in a book. They'll do something he did.  I think he thought he was clever. He put it up on the Internet on a public website.  All the logs, it's all the passwords for our Web servers, our Amazon instance, everything.  On a public website. That's when I said, no, there's got to be a better way.  And we got LastPass Enterprise. It turns out I'd been using LastPass for years.  LastPass celebrated its 10th anniversary last month. Oh, actually in July. That's almost two months now.  And I started using them, I think, right about when they first started.  And then we got to know Joe Segrist, the creator of LastPass. Steve Gibson interviewed him.  Steve looked at the source code. He gave a thumbs up. He started using it.  So I know LastPass is great. It's a password vault, keeps track of your passwords.  It's the last password you have to remember, the LastPass vault password.  But it has so many features for enterprise that are so important.  Remember, when you have employees and you're giving them the keys to the kingdom, you know, they're going to leave.  They can share those passwords. I just saw a study that said 32% of employees share their passwords with other employees or people, maybe not even employees.  No. Ow. And then there's always the guy who's going to put it on the public website.  LastPass Enterprise makes password sharing convenient for employees, but keeps access to corporate data secure.  You can completely customize the access. I can share a password with an employee and they don't even get the password.  They can't share it. They don't have it. They can use it, but they don't have it.  I can I said it whether they can modify it. We can do there are a hundred different policies, things like I will.  We have master password requirements, so they can't use monkey 123 to open their vault.  They have to use a good password. We do have password reset.  So if they forget an administrator, I or Russell or somebody can can reset it.  We do require and I would recommend this to factor.  In fact, LastPass is authenticator app. It makes it really easy.  It's not a number of button pops up on your employees phone and said, did you just try to log in?  And they say, yes, that guarantees they're the only ones who can access their account.  That I think is really good. You can organize more than just passwords to database logins, SSH keys, software licenses.  You know, as I travel, I'm in Europe right now. I always have in my last pass my past an image of my passport.  So I always have it with me. You don't want to put that in a public website, but I always have it with me.  Secure plus credit cards, drivers, everything, Social Security numbers. I stored all in LastPass.  And LastPass makes it easy if an employee leaves to restrict access or maybe they just no longer need access to the QuickBooks or whatever.  You can easily change that. LastPass now supports Active Directory 2, by the way.  So they so you can use your Active Directory credentials to log in.  So if you're an Active Directory house, that's a great feature.  You don't have to even have a LastPass password. Just use your AD credentials.  And of course, and this is important. This is one of the things that Steve Gibson wanted to see.  Data is encrypted and decrypted at the device level. Data stored in the vault is secret even from LastPass.  No one has access to it but you. LastPass password generator is great. I use it all the time.  And you know what I do? I'll give a little tip. I make passwords of varying lengths.  So sometimes I'm just going to say this. You can't make it more than 12. I say, come on. Come on.  But if I can use long passwords and I use the longest ones I can.  But let's say it's, oh, we allow 48. I'll use 47 or 42. So it's not easily guessed how even how long my password is.  Makes it really easy to do that. You can, of course, have letters, numbers, special characters, whatever you need.  So there's LastPass for business. That's the LastPass enterprise. If you have a small business, LastPass Teams 50 or fewer. That's good.  There's LastPass premium for your own personal use. If you're not already using it, why not?  LastPass families is great too. That's what I use at home. That way I can share passwords with Lisa.  Things like, you know, she wants to know how, well, I need to know what the login for Comcast is. I could send that to her.  Securely.  LastPass. More than 13 million people trust LastPass. It's the number one most preferred password manager.  So what I've been using for almost a decade, Steve Gibson uses and we use here at Twit.  Enough said, right? LastPass. Learn more at lastpass.com slash twit. Lastpass.com slash twit.  Snell?

Transcript:  That's that's that's I just love how dedicated they are.  So we live in a world where people say everything is a service.  I was reading a story about how one could argue that Apple's focus on services revenue should start to include iPhone revenue since you can actually sign up for a plan where you just get a new iPhone every year by paying them a monthly fee.  And all of this is my way of saying Microsoft announced a new thing called Xbox All Access.  And what is this? You get and this is right after I bought an Xbox One X by the way.  So I was really thrilled to see this news. You get Xbox Game Pass where you've got like more than 100 games that you have access to.  You get Xbox Live Gold which gives you access to a whole bunch of extra stuff too.  And either an Xbox One S console or an Xbox One X console. If you want the one S which is the cheaper one it's twenty two dollars a month on a two year contract.  If you want the one X it's thirty five dollars a month.  So they've rolled all of their premium services and the box itself into a two year contract with a monthly fee and Xbox as a service is here I guess you don't need to buy the console.  You just pay them twenty two or thirty five dollars a month and you got an Xbox with all the games that are on their services like right then including I think it's all of the exclusives go into Game Pass.  All the Xbox exclusives of which there are not as many as on PlayStation but still.  Brie I know you're a huge gamer. What do you think about?  I used to be before I was running for office.

Transcript:  So I think this is a fantastic deal for consumers. I think this amazing deal with consumers for consumers.  That said people don't understand just how expensive games are to develop.  You know something like Netflix works because the cost of developing content has really really gone down.  Like the cost of delivering special effects the cost of doing color correction.  It's gone down to a point where they can they can do that for Netflix shows.  For game development what you're seeing is we haven't really found a way to bring those costs down.  And this has led to a real innovation crisis in our industry where if people are you know spending 150 million dollars to make a game.  Well that's why we're getting Call of Duty Black Ops 3 this year.  So I think this is a great deal. I'm definitely going to subscribe to it.  That said I think this is going to send our industry into it like once this becomes mainstream.  I don't think this is going to be good for developers at all.  I'm not going to talk out of school but I think if you talk to most developers that have participated in PlayStation Plus and the free games that come along with that.  It has been a very mixed bag whether or not that's been a financially good deal for them.  Often they'll just give you like 30,000 40,000 dollars to like basically have the game on the service forever which isn't great for a lot of people.  It doesn't recoup costs. So yeah it gave for consumers really bad for our industry.  It's just going to make our innovation crisis that much worse.

And it's the most important thing in movies and TV today and yet they have very little power and a lot of those companies go out of business just like game studios do.  It's actually kind of I mean there are some parallels there too.  Ben and Andy what do you guys think about Microsoft as Xbox as a surface. It's a thing now.

Transcript:  Yeah and I don't know. There's something there is something compelling about the idea of not necessarily having to buy a new console every five years or whatever the heck it is for 400 dollars.  And for some reason even though I might eventually pay more than that paying a monthly fee instead feels better somehow.  I do think it's an interesting idea. The question is I don't know how many people will jump on to it and how many people will be like me where they like they really just want to like buy the thing and own the thing.  And you know I this is another old man grumbling thing I guess but I spend a lot of my time complaining about like how you used to you used to own the game.  You bought the game and it came on a DVD and you owned that thing or you owned the software came on a you know a actual physical thing that you owned a copy of it.  And now this this I don't know this move to everything as a internet based service.  There are things about about that where you're just kind of borrowing it.  Everything from when we're talking about digital music to software to games becomes I think frustrating in a lot of ways to say nothing of the impact it has on the actual people whose jobs it is to make this stuff.  I think it does actually you know create some annoyances for the user that you wouldn't have imagined before when you were so excited about how convenient it was.

Transcript:  Well it's it's it is nice that you do after spending like what six to eight hundred dollars you do get to keep the console at the end of the agreement.  That's nice. But my my big my big reaction is that this really shows you how valuable customer acquisition is for any service that if you can get now.  I think it's especially a big problem for a lot of players now that every TV comes with a Netflix Netflix excuse me a Netflix client and a Hulu client and a YouTube client built in.  If you can somehow get more people to lock to basically choose your box as the as the as the pipe through which all of their content comes.  Boy you can't you can't. That's the hose that get that sucks money out of their bank account.  At some point they're going to buy stuff and at some point they are going to forget to turn off certain controls that let you observe exactly how they're playing and what they're watching.  And that's it's the exact that's why it's such a good example to compare this to early days of phones where they would give you the phone if you just sign up because the most important thing is if they can get you to sign up for two years to use to use AT&T or to use use Verizon.  Chances are you're going to still be a customer four or five six seven eight years later no matter how you abuse them.  So that's that's a sign of exactly how the streaming the streaming world is going and it shows you how things might change in the next year or two.  If Apple does decide to deliver a streaming package through Apple TV or if Google does does decide to expand their YouTube TV service to become your point of access to pretty much every piece of streamed entertainment that you might want to access.  So this is going to be cheap money.  This is going to be long money for Microsoft I think.

Transcript:  And from a purely consumer buying psychology standpoint the fact is a smaller monthly bill seems better than having to go over that hurdle of spending $400 or $300 on the console even though if you netted out over two years you're spending a lot of money on all this stuff.  But you don't have to put down a large sum of money.  It's just like buying a thousand dollar phone.  It's a lot easier to agree to a two year contract for a small two digit sum instead of shelling out a lot of money.  But you're still spending the money is the thing.

Transcript:  Yeah this this sort of deal does tend to bring in a lot more people of middle and lower income because they can get ahead.  They can get a hold of 35 bucks over the course of a month.  They might not necessarily be able to get a hold of $500 all at once particularly when they know that they're handing over $500 and getting a game console.  So it's this is this is why biases in pricing tends to really have a long impact.  There's the there's the old saying that there's nothing more expensive than a cheap pair of boots because these hundred dollar boots you're going to have to replace in a year.  Whereas if you buy a pair of $500 boots that last you 100 that last you 10 15 20 years.  But the thing is that a lot of people they will not have that they don't have that $500 to spend at once on a pair of boots but they can get 100 bucks.  I mean they need boots right now.

Transcript:  No I was just going to say I also think it's worth like thinking about the fact that our industry profits so much by re-releasing games to run on modern systems.  Ask any gamer how many copies of Final Fantasy 6 or Final Fantasy 4 they've bought.  I probably bought 20 different versions of it for different platforms like.  So you know I do think this is going to really cut into that revenue.  I mean again it's great for the consumer but like look at Valkyria Chronicles.  This is a fantastic example.  Sega puts out this game.  It's kind of a cult classic.  You know they sell it again to you by selling the PS4 you know upscale remaster that's essentially just a re-release and they do very well with that.  I think if the service catches on that's just another way that again great for the consumer.  Why should I have to buy Valkyria Chronicles again to run on my PS4 when I buy it from my PS3 but not super great for you know the people actually making these games.

Transcript:  And there are a lot of games that are not in these subscription services that people can still buy separately but I've seen it firsthand with my son in our one month trial of Xbox Game Pass that we got when we bought the One X and with Live Gold.  That the fact is the existence of those libraries suppresses his desire to buy other games.  So it does have a carry on effect and I'm sure it then pressures those developers to get in because now their revenues are down.  It pressures their developers to get into these deals which are bad deals for them and I can see that.  I can see it happening in my house that he's definitely less interested in buying games because he's got this huge catalog now.

Transcript:  Even Apple is looking at the problem of if we can't necessarily attain more customers how can we make more money off of each transaction.  And that was one of the highlights of the sales call that they excuse me at the analyst call a few months ago that although five phone sales are a little bit flat.  They're making money on more money with every off of every customer.  So now Microsoft is kind of doing that same thing where we can grow we can have customers but make more money by selling them services access to old games as opposed and as Brie says it kind of puts it kind of throws a knife in developers backs.  If Microsoft is more concerned with selling subscriptions to Microsoft services then they are helping developers sell games.

Transcript:  I want to shift gears for a minute.  One of the other topics I wanted to talk about briefly touch on briefly is something I noticed this week it was a report in the Financial Times by about Uber and in specific it was a conversation that one of the reporters had with Dara Kastra Shahi who is the CEO of Uber now.  And what he said was they are planning a long term shift from cars to electric bicycles and scooters and they already bought an e-bike company jump and they have a deal with lime the bike and scooter rental system.  And what the CEO of Uber said is there are lots of cases and this is not this kind of a no brainer but to hear the CEO of Uber say it is interesting.  There are a lot of cases where you're in urban core and you need to take one person a few blocks and there is no reason for that to happen in a car that weighs a ton when you can hop on a little electric scooter and just zip there in a few minutes and not have to deal with gridlock downtown.  And so I was intrigued by this because it seems to me that if you're an Uber driver you're like well wait a second that's one of my fairs you just took away from me.  But I get kind of a larger point which is that this is a recognition by Uber that maybe as advanced a disruptive technology transportation platform as they are if all their chips are on cars they're missing out on the potential of e-bikes and scooters.  I mean Uber. I'm sorry go ahead.

Transcript:  I'll just then be quick. My first reaction is that they are they're clearly trying you want to own all the railroads on the monopoly board.  And so that's exactly what they're doing. This is going to be the popularity of as much as as much damage as they do these early these early iterations of these dockless scooter and bicycle rentals.  The fact that they're so popular I was in I was in last time I was in D.C. You see just people riding these things everywhere.  That means that it's fulfilling just like Uber was fulfilling a need that was invisible until this service became available.  They can't stand by and let someone else take again one of those one of the other railroads on the board when they have the ability to take it themselves.

How far do you want to go. We've got something for you.  Yeah exactly. And I actually do as a user like I do I do see the the the potential beauty of that future.  Right. Like if I'm it's it's the same thing it's it basically is the same thing as Amazon but for travel.  Right. Like if I'm a prime Uber member I just like get out of my car and I get onto my Uber you know scooter and then I get onto my Uber train and then you know what I mean.  I think reducing that friction of having to sort of like get the car rental and then do this like when you're on vacation for instance to just be able to like swipe your fob or whatever the heck just to do everything in your travel schedule or on your itinerary with one company I think makes a lot of sense.  So I can totally see it makes total sense why Uber would be trying to do this sort of thing.

Transcript:  I'm thinking the exact same thing. Yeah I think sometimes when we talk about technology there tends to be a very American centric point of view.  If you look at China like they've innovated with ride share bicycle sharing services and scooter services.  So this just seems like entirely new way to do this.  You know Jason I was at WWC this year where I saw your great show on relay and we were riding electric scooters weren't we all of us.  Well no well I felt bad for my hotel like getting an Uber to drive down there like it's gorgeous.  I'm outside I'm not having to smile because I'm not like running for anything at that moment.  And I remember looking at the very bare bicycle sharing surface that was down there and thinking how much how great that would be if it were more expanded.  So I would just I love this idea and I would love to see it.  It happened though I will say there are plenty of times you know like when you're riding with elderly people like not everyone can get on a scooter.  That last mile I would like I would like for the option to be there for you to just get driven all the way.

Transcript:  Yes that was my several of my friends at Apple's developer conference in San Jose where they were they were Bird and Lime scooters everywhere.  We rode the scooters and they were a lot of fun.  And I'll tell you the general response was write them while they're legal because they should not be legal.  They're super dangerous.  Because what you need I went to Amsterdam this summer and like what you need is you need the city to adjust to the existence of these vehicles because right now one of those scooters you're supposed to not ride on the sidewalk which is good because you will plow down pedestrians.  That's not good. But if you go in the bike lane you will die because there will be big cars there that will hit you and there will be bikes they'll be angry at you.  So like you just we all need to adjust our cities to this stuff.  But as Andy pointed out the demand shows you there's something there there's clearly something there.

Transcript:  Disrupting but but but but the reason why I think that we should definitely let these things happen and grow is that because again not only because people have demonstrated that we have a use for these these are fulfilling a need.  It will also help solve so many problems that are unsub hitherto been unsolvable.  I as I've been saying another I've said before and on the podcast that I gave up my car a few years ago because my bike was and public transportation were working so well.  And the system works so well that I took only like a portion of the money that I was going to be spending on to replace the car that I gave up a few years ago.  It basically the salt salt corrosion got got to it before I did.  That's why I gave up the car.  But I have done that I've replaced that with now an electric pedal assist bike.  And the problem the reason why more people aren't using these electric bicycles and electric scooters is because as you say even if even if a city is is advanced enough to put down a bike lane nobody the drivers don't care UPS drivers will still park over that lane as they go.  We're just going to drop off a couple packages and UPS will have a big fit if they start getting ticketed for block blocking the bike lane.  But once this becomes part of the assumed infrastructure of how people get around once it's ordinary people who haven't necessarily spent three thousand dollars on electric bike haven't necessarily bought like an electric skateboard.  But the people who do count on if they if they were meeting somebody a mile and a half away instead of getting a cab or taking public transportation if they know that can just grab a scooter and get there without having to walk the whole way.  Once they start saying hey I can't I I've been forced to like go into the street that's unsafe.  I won't have this or I've been forced to go on the sidewalk where I'm in danger of the people.  I won't have this. That's when cities start to see here's how many people are getting from here to there on personal electric vehicles or personal personal vehicles.  And so we're going to have to make sure that there's infrastructure to accommodate them safely which and part of that infrastructure is that guess what UPS driver.  Now you are getting ticketed every time you block that green that green thing.  So it's not just going to help out people who like to use these dockless vehicles but it's also going to help people who maybe decide that gee I use these bicycles so much maybe I will buy myself a folding bicycle so that I can get from the office to where I need to go from time to time or people who want to have those electric bikes.  So that just like again you have to develop a city that incorporates this stuff and you have to make sure that you support these people.  Once people have support for using these vehicles more people will use them and that's how you get more cars out of the city and all the unnecessary cars out of your city.

Transcript:  Walking around Amsterdam it's just a it's great in seeing that that is a city that has been redesigned for bicycles being a major part and it is and it is and it's huge.  I do I wonder about what might happen in a city like that where they have they actually a bicycle as a service there where literally like there's so much bike theft that it's better to just pay for a service and if somebody steals your bike they just bring you another one.  It's like a disposable bike.  Interesting.  And you mentioned pedal assist I wanted to say one of the things since three especially made mentioned accessibility the idea that can you ride on a scooter.  Are you well enough to ride on a scooter for example.  One of the things about e-bikes that's great is that they aren't traditional bikes.  They've got the electric assist which means if you're somebody who isn't comfortable riding up a hill or you don't want to get super sweaty when you get to the office at the end for your commute because you've had to pedal up a hill.  That's what's great about e-bikes is they're accessible to way more people than who would use a traditional bike where they have to supply all the power themselves which is it's a good thing for transportation maybe not as great a workout but good for transportation in urban areas.

Like could you if your phone knows what your altitude is and what the temperature is and where you are exactly can you almost apply some similar technology like solutions to making sure that none of these scooters for instance ride on the sidewalk.  Like again this is a little bit futuristic I suppose but can you as you're designing cities to be more open to these multimodal transportation or however you want to describe it.  You should be able to get these companies to make some tech changes to the modes of transportation themselves to make sure that they stay in their lane for lack of a better term.

Transcript:  Oh goodness I have to say I don't I mean I obviously think that could be a component of it but I think the core issue here is we need to start planning our cities for the future.  That means funding infrastructure that means thinking about a future where maybe not everyone has a car.  I think here in Massachusetts that might even know this is an extreme political view.  Maybe we should fund the T maybe I don't know but I think like we've got to start funding infrastructures for city and not have like a four year plan that we like we have been having.  I think we need like a 20 year plan for what our major cities are going to look like.

I went to a couple of conferences during the last administration that are just mind blowing.  But here's what happens once you start to get all the unnecessary cars off the road.  Once you start to build essentially if it really isn't if you build it they will come sort of thing.  Once you create a thoroughfare that that is appealing to or even or even just basically safe for pedestrians and self powered vehicles.  People more the more people see people on bicycles and on electric scooters in these lanes going past stuck traffic that more people are going to actually start to use this stuff.

It supported us.  It put space on the outside of our displays so that we could put our fingers all over  the edges.  And it didn't matter because we weren't touching the screen.  Bezels.  Bezels are dead apparently.  The Verge reporting that at the IFA convention in Berlin, there were a lot of new laptops  there.  Bezels are going away.  It's a style thing.  It's nice.  I mean, who needs a bezel?  The iPads, which we didn't even talk about earlier, are rumored to be losing their bezels  as well in the same style as kind of the iPhone X.  I recently bought a television, a 4K TV.  I always thought the TV in my parents' house was enormous.  And I realized that my TV is actually quite larger screen-wise than my mom's TV.  But she's got me beat in bezels because her TV is 10 years old and it's got these gigantic  bezels that my TV doesn't have.  So I just, you know, pour one out for the bezels is what I'm saying.  Does anybody have strong pro-bezel feelings that they want to get out?  You might want to do it now because we may never talk about bezels ever again.  Let them die.  Let them die.

But I do think that that does seem like a potential design issue with breaking screens  easily.  I drop my laptop probably once a quarter and I feel like when that happens with a bezel-less  screen, it's going to be a bigger problem than it is right now.  And I also think about, you know, you think about frames for photographs.  I remember in the very early days of posting photos online.  I want to say it was Instagram, but I actually don't know if that's true.  But posting photos online, I would always add, you know how you could add the frame  to the picture, like add a black frame around the picture?  I used to always do that because I just thought it looked better.  So I'm curious to see what laptops will actually look and feel like without bezels.  I haven't seen one IRL yet.  So I don't know.  I feel like we might miss the bezel.

Transcript:  It's possible.  I wanted to mention I have actually right in front of me for this entire show, I have  an iPad with what is called the Bridge keyboard.  It's an add-on Bluetooth keyboard.  And the way it works, it's very good.  It turns this into a full-on kind of laptop style and I can just lift the iPad out when  I don't want it to be a laptop anymore.  I like it.

Transcript:  So the way this thing works, it's in these clips and the clips are against the bezel.  And if the whole thing is a screen, the whole thing falls apart and now I don't even know  how they're going to do it.  I hope that there will be some way for them to make a keyboard like this for the next  one because it's just there you go.  The clips are touching the bezel.  That's how it works.  So I need a little bit of bezel there.  Plus, for yes, when I'm resting my thumb, you need a designated thumb resting area,  I think.

Transcript:  Well, yeah, my point is that bezels, you never know when you're going to need a bezel for  your thumb or some weird add-on or whatever.  But at the same time, I fully support pushing bezels further to the edges.  I do wonder if this is an extreme style change that might get backed off at some point because  there are going to be like Apple, when they narrowed the bezels on the iPad, had to write  new software for their touch detection to ignore certain kinds of touches.  And quite frankly, I can tell sometimes that I am mistouching the corner of the iPad because  my thumb is just kind of a little bit over off onto the touchscreen.  So it's like maybe this could be solved technically so that Andy can rest his thumb wherever the  heck he wants.  But it is an added complication.

Transcript:  Yeah, I don't want people to start thinking that bezels are...  If something has a bezel, then somebody screwed up or somebody's not trying or the worst phrase  to find in any particular happens most...  It happens to happen most often on an Apple blog.  But yeah, see, it just shows you these designers, this company, they just don't get it.  Like, oh, God.  I thought you were going to say if you see a bezel, they blew it.

Transcript:  That's also true.  But I was having a conversation with somebody who was saying, well, see, in fairness, if  it...  Someone was saying that, well, once again, because I will never stop complaining about  phones and other certain devices that don't have actual headphones jacks on them, because  I still think that's a bad...  I still feel as though designing a headphone jack inside your device is something that  the engineers don't want to do.  And so they'll much rather inconvenience the users rather than themselves.  But one of the problems that bezel-less devices causes that, as this person was saying to  me, well, if they had...  Because they had to move display drivers places, if they put a headphone jack in, now you couldn't  have a bezel-less screen.  And I'm like, oh, God, I don't want to live in a world that I can actually plug in headphones  that I don't have to be stuck without music or video because I don't have the right kind  of headphones with me.  But I do have that little sliver of a bezel someplace, that little strip of black that's  like a big, violent globule of pus with teeth and eyes that's telling me about every failure  I've ever had.  It's just a bezel.  It's okay.  You'll live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that my position on neutrality and many other things might be more relevant to  my one on bezels.  I would say this.  Have you picked up an iPhone 6 Plus or 7 Plus or 8 Plus lately?  Because if you do, it's really...  For me, it's like you get your iPhone 10, right?  You're holding it.  Something I love is I don't have the pain in my pinky finger that I used to have with  the other because it's like resting this giant rectangle on it.  For something like an iPhone, we are carrying it around all the time.  Every millimeter matters.  We're all happy when Apple gets it a few millimeters thinner.  I think on the iPhone, we know how they did this.  It's not a mystery.  They developed the iPad and they made the bezels thinner.  Along the way, Apple developed some anti-edge touching technology that they brought to their  entire line of phones.  By that, they were able to use that space more efficiently.  For me as a software engineer, I can't tell you how many times I've been looking at code  and it's like 30 lines and you challenge yourself and go, well, can I get down to 28 lines?  Can I think of another way to write this?  Can I do it so if I run data through this, it will do it more efficiently?  I love more efficient designs and I don't think bezels are always a waste.  But I think in your living room, that's certainly like a waste of...  It's like a waste of your living room.  I think on a mobile device, it's really a waste of that.  Is this like a blanket statement that you should never have bezels?  Of course not.  But I do think generally speaking, that trend is a positive thing for our industry.  I would agree with that.

Transcript:  I think there's extremism in bezels.  I cannot believe that's a phrase I just said.  I think some of it is a good striving to be...  I'm sorry, I'm touching my bezels on my iPad as I talk.  Yeah, there it is.  Oh yeah, those thumbs.  Look, they just rest right there.

Transcript:  Your bezels, they know we're talking about it and it's worried.  That's why you should be caressing it and reassuring it.  It's okay.

Start time: 6653.65

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So my point is, I think some of this may come out as being fashion.  And people are like, you know what, a little bit of a frame around something, it's okay.  But there are also places where bezels could get smaller because they're probably too big.  And I agree with that too.  Look at me, everybody's a little bit right.  Isn't that the best way to end this edition of Twitter?  I think maybe it is.  I want to thank my wonderful guests for being here.  Ben Barak Johnson, thank you so much for being here.

Transcript:  So, you know, the reason I decided to come on Twitter this week when we're in the middle of a Gia get out the vote effort here in District 8 is because every time I come on, you're all so amazingly generous with your campaign donations.  Like even as I'm sitting here, I watch people from the chat room donating to my campaign.  So if you want to support real technological competence in Congress, which is a low bar, but it's what we only need people in the house to know what we're doing.  That is what I'm running for.  I would be honored to have your support and you can do that by going to supportbrianna.com.  You know, win or lose this time.  I'm going to run again in 2020.  I'm in this field for good.  We need people to understand technology in Washington, D.C.  I also do a podcast with the illustrious and awesome Christina Warren, who often appears here on Twitter.  You can find that at Relay FM as well.  All right.  And yes, amen to all of that.
