Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's colder here.  It's like in the 40s.  Yeah, you should come down here.  You should be a snowbird.  Come down to come down here.  Or no, I should go there.  I would like to.  Yeah.  Anytime.  I want to see the cottage.  You should.  Cottage is grown a little bit.  It's bigger than a cottage, smaller than a bread box.  Also here, Robert Scoble from his home in beautiful northern central California.  Half Moon Bay, baby.  Where is HMB?  Cloudy today.  It is cloudy.  Nice to have you both.  Thank you.  We were talking before the show began actually about Google and about Apple.  I guess, Robert, you're doing is this a new book you're doing with Shell?

Start time: 208.22
End time: 222.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, with Shell Israel.  It's called The Age of Context.  And I noticed five trends this year that the number of sensors we're seeing or wearing  is going up exponentially.  Just put the cell phone alone.

Start time: 222.26
End time: 223.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My God, the cell phone knows all.

Start time: 224.34
End time: 228.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seven sensors in the cell phone, nine in the newer ones like barometer got added, right?

Start time: 228.84
End time: 231.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we got a barometer in our Galaxy S3.  What the hell is that for?

Start time: 233.04
End time: 235.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you can tell elevation and you can tell weather patterns.

Start time: 235.98
End time: 236.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Elevation.

Start time: 237.34
End time: 252.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're going to, you know, I went to Oakley a week ago  and met with a team that builds these new airwave goggles that has a heads up display in them.  And they could tell how many vertical feet you're skiing.  They're for skiers.  Oh, that makes sense.

Start time: 253.68
End time: 257.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A skier needs to know elevation.  I don't know if I need to know elevation.

Start time: 257.46
End time: 259.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you jump out of a plane, you need to know elevation.

Start time: 260.62
End time: 267.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That, well, of course.  It's for when you go wingsuit flying, Leo.  Yeah, I want a squirrel suit.  You need to know that.

Start time: 267.50
End time: 281.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need that.  So you got a barometer, you got accelerometer, you got barometer, you got GPS.  This is actually, this is good.  They used to ask name all seven doors.  Now it's name all seven sensors.  Accelerometer, barometer is one.

Start time: 281.74
End time: 285.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Microphone, microphone, camera, camera, GPS, compass, compass.

Start time: 287.06
End time: 289.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're missing gyroscope.  Gyroscope.  Is that an accelerometer?

Start time: 290.82
End time: 298.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's different than accelerometer.  Gyroscope can tell twisting motion.  Accelerometer can tell that you've stopped or started or moving.  And what else?

Start time: 299.32
End time: 300.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is there any?  I think that's enough.

Start time: 301.32
End time: 304.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some have a temperature sensor.  Some have a barometer.

Start time: 305.24
End time: 311.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So we got as many as eight.  Yeah.  And yet there's no application that uses all eight.

Start time: 312.82
End time: 322.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not yet, but I just interviewed the CEO of Basis and they're making a watch that has several more.  They're looking at your perspiration.

Start time: 322.40
End time: 326.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd like to know that heart rate perspiration, blood pressure, salinity.

Start time: 327.36
End time: 341.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they're doing a health monitor so they can tell, you know, are you being active enough  and stuff like that.  Who else?  Nike FuelBand has two or three sensors or one or two sensors in it.  The Fitbit has one or two sensors in it.

Start time: 342.00
End time: 343.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Those are the Motion X sensors from...

Start time: 343.96
End time: 347.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My Nest Thermostat has a sensor in it, right?  And on and on.

Start time: 347.90
End time: 367.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the Nest not only senses temperature, the Nest senses movement because when you walk by it,  it wakes up.  It says, hello.  Yeah.  I love that Nest.  But you know what?  It's funny.  We're buying into this and yet we're so concerned about privacy.  I'm not.  Well, obviously.  Nor am I really.

Start time: 368.10
End time: 373.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've decided to live my life in public.  I mean, I'm on Twitter if I care about privacy.  I wouldn't be on the show.

Start time: 374.40
End time: 378.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sort of in that camp too.  If someone wants to know my elevation, you know, that's fine.

Start time: 379.18
End time: 415.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we're going to trade our privacy for utility.  So, you know, Google Now is a good example of this, right?  The more you tell Google Now, the more you let it study you, the more it can serve you  and tell you, hey, you better leave for the next appointment you have.  And, you know, here's a concert you might want to go to or here's your plane tickets,  you know, stuff like that.  And that's going to be a huge trend.  So, you know, wearable computer sensors, these new databases that are huge new databases  are coming along that feed off of social networks and feed off of location or mapping information.

Start time: 415.62
End time: 439.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had Jonathan Schwartz, a former CEO of Sun On talking about privacy.  He's actually a very interesting guy, very interested in privacy.  And we've actually talked to a number of people.  And I think the consensus is, of course, you're right, the three of us, because, you know,  we're kind of in the public eye, we don't really, we kind of accept this lack of privacy.  But the trade off needs to be explicit, right, Matthew?  Yeah.

Start time: 440.00
End time: 452.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  I mean, I think, regardless of whether it's an app or a service or a social network,  they have to tell you what you're getting in exchange, what you're giving up and what  you're getting in exchange, I think.

Start time: 453.78
End time: 468.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it should be consistent and should be, you should know where your information is going to go.  I mean, it's one thing to give it to a service like Gmail.  It's another thing for it to leave Gmail and do something with a third party, for instance,  I should be aware of where it goes.

Start time: 469.54
End time: 523.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a blog post actually on his current Jonathan Schwartz blog,  JonathanISchwartz.wordpress.com.  He says, it's time to take responsibility for our data and reject the increasingly confusing  array of privacy waivers designed to strip our control or rights.  He says, I don't blame the social media companies.  They're behaving rationally.  After all, companies don't have ethics.  People do.  They're just maximizing for profit.  That's what they do.  We, the users, are the ones behaving irrationally by trusting media companies and advertisers  to act in our best interest.  That's not their mission statement.  It's ours.  Privacy is a right, not a privilege.  And he bolds this, unless I give you explicit permission to gather, distribute, or use my  family's information, that's the context this blog post is in, but you could just say information,  you're forbidden to do so.  That's the privacy policy I want.

Start time: 524.30
End time: 555.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the problem is, so let's take a scenario like, let's say we went skiing to  Heavenly Valley, and let's say you're on the California side and I'm on the Nevada side.  And let's say we both had heads-up displays, whether they're Google or Oakley or whatnot.  I only want to see messages about what I'm doing, which is skiing.  I don't want to see any tweets.  You know, right now on my screen, I have a new tweet coming in every half a second.  I don't want to see that while I'm skiing.  So I needed systems to filter out or only show me important stuff.

Start time: 556.00
End time: 563.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I would submit that the reason you go skiing is so that you don't see any crap,  except the slope, the trees, and enjoying nature.

Start time: 563.57
End time: 586.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not true.  If you're over on the other side of the hill and you find a trackless bowl and you want  to invite me over, I want to see that message, right?  If you want to invite me to lunch, I want to see that message.  If the place we're going to lunch has open table computer, I might even want to reserve  a table for us.  But it should be pull, not push, shouldn't it?  Well, I think in these new glasses, it's going to be push.

Start time: 587.94
End time: 597.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And that's probably a little annoying.  I'm going over there.  I want to know what the reservation system is.  Not just kind of...  Go ahead, Matthew.

Start time: 597.26
End time: 616.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there should be criteria.  I mean, I think you should be able to choose.  It should be a lot easier to say, I want this information and not that information.  And I want you to use this, but not that.  Just think it should be a lot more overt, instead of you having to comb through  settings and whatnot to figure out what they're doing with your data.

Start time: 617.26
End time: 656.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google Now, somebody said Google Now is push.  It's actually an interesting mix because I don't see Google Now unless I activate it.  But then once I'm in there, it's pushing whatever it thinks is apropos based on algorithms it uses.  So I don't see it on the front page.  But if I tap the Google bar, then I get the Google Now cards.  So it's a mixture of push and pull.  It's opt-in, I guess.  You also see some in the notifications.  Yeah, but you can control that.  I turn off notifications, I think.  Is it on all the time?  It's always doing something, but I don't...  Yes.  So in other words, it's always downloading new cards because then they're there when I look.  But I don't see them unless I explicitly say I want to see.

Start time: 657.02
End time: 663.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And keep in mind, we're only in the Apple One days of this stuff.  Well, and this is not why it's good to wait.

Start time: 663.34
End time: 665.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's why we need to weigh in now.  We're in early days.

Start time: 667.46
End time: 744.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you're going to change your behavior because of these things that are going to come along.  I watched Gary Beinerchuk give a talk this morning.  And he asked the crowd, how many people said they would never join Facebook?  And every hand went up.  Okay, how many people are on Facebook?  Every hand went up.  We all hate it.  We change our behavior because there's new utility.  And our friends force us to, and the world forces us to.  You know, we're in competition with each other for limited resources.  Here's a good example.  I was on a plane.  We were on the tarmac.  I kept my phone on because I do.  I'm sorry.  I don't turn it off.  And Tripit said, the plane is being canceled.  You're going back to the gate.  I was one of the first people to get another ticket out of town.  There was three seats in the other plane.  So we headed back to the gate.  Then the pilot comes on and says, hey, we're canceling this flight.  Sorry about that.  Tripit helped me win the game of life that night.  And that's what's going to happen with these glasses.  If I'm wearing them, they're going to tell me things about what's going on.  If we're heading toward a restaurant together  and there's only one table at that restaurant tonight,  I'm going to win if I have these glasses on,  if I can get to that OpenTable API before you do.

Start time: 746.90
End time: 760.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to let Matthew talk.  I feel like Robert and I could easily dominate here, Matthew.  And you're Canadian, which means you're nice.  So just jump in.  I'm constitutionally required to be nice.

Start time: 762.32
End time: 783.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess the idea of winning, like I see what Robert is saying,  that you get benefits from these services and that helps you in your life.  I just wonder whether seeing it as a race in which people win  makes you more likely to give up things.  That night we were in a race.  There was 168 people on that plane.  There was three seats out of town and I won the race.

Start time: 784.34
End time: 786.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, no, I love Tripit.

Start time: 786.80
End time: 790.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's people who say I don't consider the downside of technology in the chat room, by the way.

Start time: 791.78
End time: 816.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true.  I, you know, there are always downsides to technology.  When we were arguing about cars, when cars first came out,  I'm sure there's people who said there's going to be tens of thousands of cars.  I'm sure there's people who said there's going to be tens of thousands of people  who are going to die in these things a year.  And that's true.  And they do.  Yeah.  There's a downside to technology.  There's an upside.  It serves us.  There's a downside, you know, and we're going to have to deal with the downside.

Start time: 817.22
End time: 825.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of ironic that Jonathan Schwartz was writing about privacy  and his co-founder Scott McNeely is the one who said, you have no privacy.

Start time: 825.56
End time: 873.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Privacy is dead.  Get over it, said Scott.  Yeah, I asked him about that.  In fact, it's a good triangulation if you haven't seen it.  We're talking about, well, we haven't even really started the show  and already we're talking about a lot of things, privacy and Google.  Let's talk about, all right, first we're going to talk about the fact  that Twitter is now allowing you to download your tweets.  That happened today.  Already a Joy of Tech comic.  ARG, I downloaded an archive of all my tweets from Twitter.  Everyone since I signed up reading them,  I realized what a colossal waste of my time Twitter is.  Add to that all the wasted time reading all of my wasted time tweets  for the second time.  Wow, that's really interesting.  You should post that on Facebook.  Nitro Zack and Snaggy, skewering it again.  This is surprising.  I thought Twitter would never let us have our tweets back.

Start time: 875.60
End time: 930.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was kind of skeptical too.  It's funny.  I mentioned something on Twitter that Dick Costolo actually did it,  did what he promised and he responded and said, what do you mean?  He actually did what he promised.  I remember when he promised it, I was skeptical because  I had talked to people at Twitter and they were frankly kind of freaked out  that he had made this promise because I'm not sure they thought they'd be able to do it.  I'm surprised that they were actually able to pull it off.  The other question is, does anybody actually want that?  They think the comic brings up a good point, which is  a lot of that stuff is just ephemera.  It's meaningless.  It was meaningful maybe in a small way at the time,  but it's like saving all your conversations, your audio,  like chatting with people in a bar.  Do you really want to download audio of all that?  Like, why?

Start time: 931.34
End time: 935.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where can I get this?  Is it on my Twitter account or does everybody have it yet?

Start time: 935.44
End time: 942.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's on your settings page at the bottom.  It will say tweet archive, I think, or download your tweets.  I don't have it.

Start time: 943.62
End time: 950.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have it yet either.  So at some point we'll have a download all your tweets on here.  But some people do.

Start time: 950.66
End time: 967.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Part of me wants to look at it.  Part of me wants to take it into something like ThinkUp,  which I use and look at trends and patterns and that type of stuff.  But a lot of that's sort of academic.  I don't think there's anything really of huge value in there,  unless you're Andy Carvin and you're covering the Arab Spring.

Start time: 970.64
End time: 981.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's how it's changed.  In the past, you've only been able to go back, I think, 3500 tweets.  And the point people made, which is a very legitimate point,  is those are mine.  I made them.  Why should Twitter be hiding them?

Start time: 984.01
End time: 984.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is a good point.

Start time: 987.18
End time: 999.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The value isn't in the tweets anyways.  It's in the metadata around the tweets.  Same thing with Instagram.  The reason Instagram was a billion dollars isn't because of your photos.  It's because of all the information that happens around the photo.

Start time: 1002.08
End time: 1007.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to talk about Instagram actually a little later on.  Nick Bilton had an interesting article in today's Bitsblog.

Start time: 1008.36
End time: 1010.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm interviewing Kevin tomorrow afternoon.

Start time: 1010.24
End time: 1055.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin Sistram, the CEO and founder of Instagram,  was testifying to the California Corporations Department  because they're trying to figure out if the acquisition of,  the selling of Instagram to Facebook for a billion dollars  was in the best interest of Instagram investors.  It's a billion dollars.  How could it not be?  Facebook requested the hearing.  When asked if his company received any offers besides Facebook at the time,  Sistram said, no, we never received any offers.  He said, we talked to other parties but never received any formal offers.  He was asked again.  He repeated it.  We never received any formal offers or term sheets.  No.  Nevertheless, according to Nick Bilton in the New York Times,  that's not true.

Start time: 1056.58
End time: 1072.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and I've heard the same reports as Nick, I'm sure,  about Twitter.  I guess the big question is what constitutes a formal offer?  Did Twitter ever present a term sheet?  Well, but Twitter was offering, according to this,

Start time: 1072.74
End time: 1082.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  $525 million in cash and Twitter shares.  That's less than a billion.  So even if they had a formal offer, who cares?  They took the big one.

Start time: 1086.32
End time: 1119.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The argument that Nick was making was that if you open it up to an auction,  you would have had a higher price.  The problem is, a lot of times, like when Steve Jobs bought Siri,  his first call was, if you call anybody else about my offer, the deal is off.  And so you have to decide, do I risk that in public?  A lot of times we hear about deals that don't happen,  then everything blows up and then the deals go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We're going to take a break.  Robert Scoble is here, the Scoble-izer.  He specializes in interviewing startups for Rackspace  and has racked up a really amazing list of people he's talked to over the years.  I want to ask you what your hot start...  Don't say, but we will later ask what your hot startups are that you're interested in.  Because one of the reasons to follow Robert on Twitter and Facebook is just to see  who he's excited about.  You never know.  Matthew Ingram is also here.  He covers the scene for GigaOM, one of the most insightful writers.  What are you holding up there?  Was it an app?  I'll tell you right away.  No, I know.  That's why I said don't.  I know you will.  You can't.  You have no...  I knew as soon as I said that, you'd say, well, I'll tell you what it is.  No, because I'm going to do...  It's called a tease, Robert.  I'm teasing the people.  Trying to keep them from knowing what I'm up to.  Don't give it all away yet, Robert.  Robert's...  This is what I like about Robert.  Robert wants to give it all away.  Right?  Yeah.  He holds nothing.  You know who gave it all away and is getting a lot?  Opal Gangnam Style.  We'll talk about that in a second, too.  Psy.  When you hear how much money the AP thinks Psy has made on that video.  Unbelievable.  But first, by the way, you like our Festivist poll?  We're celebrating the holiday.  The feats of strength and the airing of grievances later.  First, a word from stamps.com.  Stamps is a great place to go instead of the post office this holiday season.  I think of this as amateur hour at the post office because everybody with their  Christmas card lists and they're all heading to the post office to get the stamps and everything,  mail the packages, and it's just slow.  And if you're doing mailing for a living, if you're doing fulfillment for Amazon or eBay  or Etsy or whatever, if you're sending out invoices, marketing, whatever, if you're doing  mailing for a living, you don't want to get in that line.  You want to use stamps.com.  Stamps.com lets you print all you need.  Do everything you need from your desk.  Print postage from your computer and your printer.  You don't need a special ink or a postage meter or anything.  Just what you got.  And you could print right on the envelope.  So if you're, for instance, here's a good example.  You're sending out a year end invoices.  You got it in the address book or your QuickBooks or whatever.  You press one button and the envelopes all come out with this postage,  with the address, right from the address book, your company logo.  It's beautiful.  It's very professional.  Boom, like that.  In fact, if stamps.com could come up with an envelope stuffing machine, we'd be done.  If you're mailing packages, you get that USB scale.  See right there, you plop the package on there.  You get exactly the right postage.  Print the mailing label and the mailman comes and gets it.  It takes it away.  Now you may notice, we want you to try this.  You may notice that $80 special value right on the front there.  That's a good deal.  But if you click the microphone in the upper right hand corner  and you enter the offer code TWIT, we're going to take that $80 value,  turn it to a $110 bonus offer.  You get the USB scale.  You get $55 in free postage coupons.  You can use over a few months time.  You get a supplies kit, a four week trial.  All that just because you use the word, how about that?  You got to try stamps.com.  It's for professional mailing.  Professionals, you get discounts you can't get at the post office.  They do fill out the forms for international, all that stuff.  Stamps.com.  Google Maps for iOS.  Just in time for the holidays.  And the general reviews are very nice.  You guys are both iPhone users, right?  You like it?  What do you think, Matthew?

Transcript:  You can't pre-cache the maps, which you can do on Android.  You can download the maps ahead of time if you're going to be off.  Which is nice.  There's no biking directions apparently.  Ah, that's a missing feature.  Which is odd.  You can use OpenStreetMaps for that.  Anyway, it fixes a big problem, frankly, and thank you.  We appreciate it.  Google, keep up the good work.  I've still been using Waze, by the way.

Start time: 1452.62
End time: 1473.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and I think that's true, that in some ways,  Apple Maps was the best thing that could happen to navigation on the iPhone  because it got people to try something else.  Waze is free and amazing.  I love it.  It's a social mapping app.  I use it anytime I'm going somewhere where there's going to be traffic or whatever.  I just love Waze.  In fact, I just like Waze because I like telling people there's cops around a corner.  Me too.

Start time: 1473.96

Transcript:  It's so fun.  You said...  I have it set up so you just wave your hand in front of the phone  because I have the phone on a little knob on the dashboard.  I wave like that and it goes, what?  And I say, I want to report a cop.  It goes, okay.  And you get points.  You can see the cops there.  Yeah.  I'm sure police officers don't like this too much.  And by the way, all those little cute little icons, those are Wazers.  Those are people using Waze.  So then as you're driving along, Waze says,  Attention, debris in the roadway, or Attention, police officer ahead or accident ahead.  And it's actually like some additional information that's really useful, I think.  And you know, it's a great example of crowdsourcing.

Start time: 1516.42
End time: 1543.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A lot of people, I think, assume that whenever something's crowdsourced like that,  that there's going to be bad information or it's going to be useless  because people will just say things that aren't true.  And the amazing thing to me is that that happens so rarely.  People don't say there's a cop where there isn't one,  or they don't say there's a huge gap in the road where there isn't one.  They mostly want to tell other drivers what's going on.

Start time: 1544.46
End time: 1557.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also does a really good reroute.  On my trip down to LA, it routed us around an accident.  And you could see a bunch of Wazers were stuck in traffic  and it routed us around and saved us, I don't know, 15, 20 minutes.  It was awesome.

Transcript:  Even if you're stuck in traffic, by the way,  seeing a picture of the 18-wheeler that's overturned really helps you know,  okay, I'm going to be stuck here for an hour at least.

Start time: 1591.96
End time: 1607.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And actually, I've looked at apps specifically for that reason.  You're stuck, you really want to know.  And once you find out, oh, there's a huge accident and there's lanes closed,  it actually makes it better in a way.  You're still stuck, but at least you know it's something serious.

Transcript:  Well, it's so funny because if you ran a radio,  up till now it was the radio, right?  And anybody who ever commuted realizes it's useless.  You listen to traffic reports, they don't mention where you are.  You have to listen every eight minutes, they do in another one.  And it's just useless.  And by the time you hear that there was a problem, you know there's a problem.  But so if I were in the radio traffic business, I'd be terrified about what it is.

End time: 1698.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Think about all that data from Waze or whatever going to your car.  So your car knows where to go.  You don't even have to worry about it.  It's already taking you a different route because Waze told you that route is closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is one of the things I really love about this industry.  I know this is why you guys are covering the beat that you're covering as a journalist.  It's so fast.  I mean, Waze is two years old and it's completely disintermediating  an industry that's been around for 30 years.  Like that.  What I'm really finding interesting is when these things start to merge and gel  and you've got Google now and you've got Waze, you're starting to see all these  disparate pieces of information start to fit together.  The only thing stopping them is that they're all these fiefdoms.  Facebook doesn't want to give Google anything.  Instagram cuts off Twitter and Twitter cuts off Instagram.  And if it weren't for that, what a world.

Transcript:  You know, I don't know if you guys read that.  Anil Dash's blog post about what we've lost by the rise of walled gardens  and proprietary networks and systems.  That is a real barrier to the functioning of the kind of things we're talking about.  Once they get big enough, those companies don't want to play with anyone else.  They want to use the open web to get big and get lots of users.  But then once they're big, then it's all proprietary systems and don't use our API.

And, you know, I made reference to AOL and I might as well have been talking about the moon.  Because he wasn't even alive when AOL was around, so you didn't have that as a comparison.  And then even blog comments were kind of this ancient,  you know, stone knives and bearskins technology or whatever.  Remember Technorati?

End time: 1839.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He talks about that.  He says, five years ago, most social photos were uploaded to Flickr.  Images were easily discovered on the public web.  Photos people uploaded to be licensed.  Now Flickr's coming back, baby.  Flickr's coming back.  Great iOS app.  It is a great app.  Yeah.  It is a great app.  It's a great app.  But is it too late?

Transcript:  Matthew, you know, big companies never innovate.  Here's a new app called Light, which lets you scrub through in real time,  hundreds if not thousands of photos.  Instagram doesn't do this.  And so Instagram...

Start time: 1885.64

Start time: 1904.64

Start time: 1910.02
End time: 1936.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  Instagram was made for one photo at a time.  These guys built their databases to scrub through thousands of photos at one time.  And people are asking why would you want to do that?  Well, think about the Google Glasses world.  You're going to be able to capture a frame every 30 seconds as you live your life.  You're going to need a new way to go through a large number of photos very, very quickly.  The Light database is the way to do that.

Start time: 1937.36
End time: 1978.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Again, the world changes.  This is interesting.  I interviewed Paul Pierre Olivier Latour.  He did Quartz Composer, which Apple bought.  He worked at, besides Apple, a number of other places like Cool Iris doing very interesting  Apple software.  And he's got this program.  Have you seen every pic?  You upload all your photos to it from everywhere, from every source.  And then taxonomizes them, categorizes them.  And this is the cool thing.  Let's you scroll through them very quickly on your iPhone or your iPad.  I think it's a similar idea, which is it should be easier to see our pictures.

Start time: 1979.86
End time: 2004.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the categorization is the hard part.  I've got 25,000 photos, and most of them are on Flickr.  I tried to go through and tag them.  And you just don't have enough hours in the day.  And even facial recognition only gets you part of the way.  And so it's this huge, you know, it's like having shoe boxes full of photos,  except now you've got hard drives full of photos, but you don't know who's in them  or what they're of or when they were taken.

Transcript:  Nedwin just asked, where are all these billions of photos going to be stored?  They're going to be stored in the cloud.  Those photos I just showed you are on the cloud.  They're not on my local device.  They pull down that quickly.  This is a new world.  It's not a world where you have to store them.

Transcript:  And I think there's two big...  You mentioned the platform problem and the sort of cross...  Different services working across different platforms.  The other big bottleneck is just bandwidth.  And if all the cable companies and providers are charging you based on the data you use,  all of these services are getting you to use more and more and more data.

Transcript:  Mark Andreessen had actually some interesting, very contrarian things to say.  In an interview, he gave...  Was it Bloomberg or the Journal?  No, it was with Venturewire.  And he said...  One of the things he said is net neutrality is a bad idea.  He said, it's not such much a problem in landline, but when we're talking mobile data,  it doesn't make sense for Google to get a free ride on top of these mobile data networks.  It's just not going to work.  I thought that was kind of surprising.  Saying I'm against net neutrality in Silicon Valley  is like saying I'm in favor of...

Start time: 2138.32

I can't remember who.  A well-known economist says all of these...  We need the bubble.  Yeah, we need the bubble.  The example given is in the railroads.  All the railroads went bankrupt after the push to the transcontinental railroads.  But we got railroads.  We got telegraphs.  Sure, they lost money.  But we got a transcontinental railroad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's a really good point.  I mean, if you want to make something like that go viral,  the best way to do it is to get everybody to pirate the hell out of it  and create their own mashups.  I mean, that's how it happens.  If you try and lock that down,  you effectively kill any chance of it actually becoming a viral phenomenon.

And it is one of the big surprises of the year for me  because I don't, you know, fantasy books,  you know, I'm not a big fantasy fan,  but I read it's like Game of Thrones, good books.  And so Trey Ratcliffe told me,  if you don't like this book, I don't like you.  He said, I use this as a test to see if you can be my friend.  And I think he was kind of serious.  So I read it and I love it.  Are you still friends?  Yes.  I was really surprised.  You saw his t-shirt, Patrick's t-shirt said,  what was it, L, PB to AU.  Led to gold.  He was an alchemist.  Anyway, I will go back and I should, I don't, there it is.  Yeah. The Name of the Wind.  I don't watch NSFW because I don't want, I'm afraid of what I'll see.

That's what it's called, by the way.  You transfer funds to Ireland where they have lower corporate taxes.  And then you move royalty payments from subsidiaries in Ireland and the Netherlands  to a Bermuda unit, which is what Google does.  And that way you get a tax rate.  You want to know what Google's tax rate?  Take a guess what Google pays, paid in taxes last year on profit.  The tax percentage rate, you mean?  Yeah.  What do you and I pay?

Transcript:  Sure.  You saw that Ray Kurzweil announced he is going to Google as a Director of Engineering.  Ray Kurzweil, very interesting fellow.  He invented the Kurzweil synthesizer for Stevie Wonder, also created a text to speech for Stevie  Wonder.  The Kurzweil voice synthesis was one of the early voice synthesis programs.  And he, of course, is big on the singularity.  He's the guy, and I've interviewed him many times about this, who says in the next couple  of decades, computer intelligence will be indistinguishable, machine intelligence  will be indistinguishable from human intelligence.  And that's a singularity because at that point, machines can start designing themselves and  the things will just happen very rapidly after that and then Terminator or Matrix.  SkyNet.  SkyNet.

Transcript:  He says, I've been interested in technology machine learning in particular for a long time.  When I was 14, I designed software that wrote original music and went on later to  invent the first print to speech reading machine for the blind.  Among other inventions, I've always worked to create practical systems that will make  a difference in people's lives, which is what excites me as an inventor.  You know, Ray really sees himself as an inventor, not an artificial intelligence  expert or anything, as an inventor.  He said, in 1999, I said that in about a decade, we would see technologies such as  self-driving cars and mobile phones that can answer your questions.  And people criticize these predictions as unrealistic.  Fast forward a decade, Google has demonstrated self-driving cards and people are indeed asking  questions of their Android phones and iPhones, Ray.  It's easy to shrug our collective shoulders as if these technologies have always been around,  but we're really on a remarkable trajectory of quickening innovation.  And Google is at the forefront of this development.  Smart move to hire him.  Good PR move.  I don't know if Ray has any great inventions left in him.

Now, Ray's the guy also who, of course, says that he wants to live long enough to live forever.  And it's taking a bunch of vitamins and extra crazy exercise.  He just wants to live a few more decades because he hopes to pour his brain into a machine  so that his body will die, but he won't.  Or something.  It could just be medical advances.  He's not sure.  A head in a jar.  I would put my head in a jar.  In fact, I have to say, I harbor a kind of, in fact, one of the reasons I really  continue to do what I'm doing is I'm hoping that some kid today is going to be influenced  by what we do and get into technology.  And in 30 years, we'll say, yeah, that Leo Laporte, he really got me interested in technology.  Maybe I should put his brain in a jar.  In a jar.

There's the originator.  Goldman Sachs said it would cost Google $140 billion or more to put Google Fiber everywhere.  And I was a little disappointed to hear that.  But we talked about it on Twig and they said, well, you don't have to do it all at once.  It can be a smaller capital expenditure.  And Google, in fact, has said, no, you know, we might, we might want to get into more cities.  Eric Schmidt said fiber isn't just an experiment.  I hate it when he does this.

Transcript:  It was good.  Here's the trailer.  Now, a couple of things that are interesting.  Peter Jackson filmed it on red epic cameras.  He had something like 50 red epics.  These are the 4 and 5K cameras filled it in not only high resolution, but high frame rate.  Instead of 24 frames per second, which is the typical frame rate for movies,  shot it in 48 frames per second.  Of course, 3D as well.  They had it two epics slaved together.  In fact, I talked to somebody on the radio show who does the rigs for the helicopters  and the planes that they use because they did a lot of aerial shooting of New Zealand in this.  He said, yeah, we had to make special non-standard rigs because they're doing two epics  side by side.  So they're shooting.  Wow.  I mean, just amazing.  Amazing.  But I would like to see the 48 frames.  Now, some have said they've seen it and it looks plasticky.

Start time: 3512.02
End time: 3540.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I read a whole article about it before I went.  And the one phrase that I keep seeing is the soap opera effect.  Right.  So the fact that the frames are kind of being interlaced in between the frames that you're  the rate that you're used to seeing, it smooths things out kind of,  and it gives them kind of an unreal look.  Of course, all of the stuff you're watching is unreal anyway.  So I'm not sure how you would notice.

Start time: 3541.92
End time: 3560.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was a review I read of the 48 frames that said it's so  real that we see we're used to films looking kind of magical.  It's so real that they said Gandalf Staff looks like a resin cast that you might have  gotten from a Wiccan supply house.

If you it's a little like when HD first came and I remember particularly news shows,  they were having to redo all their sets and, you know,  redo all their makeup because you were suddenly seeing such a huge level of detail.

It looks like an 80s era home video shot by someone who happened to be standing around  on the set while the Hobbit was being filmed.  Other visual analog scribbled down in my screening notes include Teletubbies and daytime soap operas.  The effect is curiously washed out and flat yet unforgiving in its hyper realism.  Any imperfection or note of artifice in the costumes or sets stands out as if illuminated  with a bank of fluorescent lights.  This wildly expensive visual technology paradoxically  inspires to make everything else in the film look cheap.  I found myself fixating, for example, on Gandalf Staff,  an elegant art nouveau-esque creation that an earlier Lord of the Rings films would have  blended in as another part of the richly detailed ambient whimsy.  At 48 frames per second, the staff looked like a cast resin prop you might order online from a  Wiccan supply house.  Wow, she did not like the movie.

Oh, yeah, you got to see it.  Any geek has to see it.  The question is about this technology.  Both James Cameron and Peter Jackson and actually other directors as well  are promoting this new format, which is...  And actually they want to go to 4K or higher, I think even 8K, 48 frames per second 3D.  They say it'll be more vivid.

A large percentage of people get sick or headaches from 3D.  So I don't think 3D is going away.  As long as they continue to offer 2D movies, versions of the movie, as well as 3D, then I'm fine.  If they made us watch it in 3D, I might be a little upset.

Start time: 3800.30
End time: 3817.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  Well, what we really need, and I hope this will happen, is higher res.  I want to see 4K and ultimately 8K.  In fact, Sony is now selling an 8K...  Is it 8K or 4K TV for $30,000?  There's $25,000, $30,000.  But you can buy it.  It comes with a media server.  It comes with a big hard drive because there's no 4K content.  So you have to have a media server to serve the content.  But I have to say, I think this is going to happen.  I think it's going to be so realistic that 3D won't even matter  because it'll feel like you're looking through a window at stuff.

And like people said, there's no content.  In fact, I was at Davos this year, the World Economic Forum.  There wasn't a single professional who had a 3D camera other than me.  And the TV industry is just ignoring 3D.  And they're going to ignore 4K and 8K for a long time  because they just invested a lot of money in upgrading their systems to 1080p.  And that's a huge shift to go from 1080p to 4K.

Transcript:  Australian police said, don't use Apple Maps.  You could die.  Thank goodness Google Maps came out right after this story broke.  Police in Victoria, Australia had to start warning on their web page  motorists who are trying to visit the city of Mildura.  Apparently, Apple Maps placed Mildura in the middle of the Murray Sunset National Park  where 70 kilometers away from the actual location,  where there is no water supply.  Temperature can easily go over 100 degrees at summertime in Australia.  And there's no cell reception.  So they've actually had to rescue distressed motorists  who followed their iPhone into the wilderness and got stuck.  Some of the motorists, according to this story,  located by police have been stranded for up to 24 hours without food or water  and have walked long distances through dangerous terrain to get phone reception.  Just so they could get home.  Six people in two months using Apple Maps.  Apple, of course, fixed it immediately and apologized.  They said, you know, we used information from an Australian gazetteer that said that  placed it there.  It's not our fault.  But I think what it really underscores is, yeah, there's a lot of data.  Apple uses 24 different sources for the data in its maps.  But Google and Nokia and others have been at this for a long time, fixing the data.  And that's key.

And, you know, you start with hafties and data,  but you have to tweak and fix and jimmy around streets and names of things.  And, you know, this is just one sort of extreme example of what it takes.

Transcript:  If you have a tattoo, I don't begin a lot of stories here on Twitter with that, but  if you have a tattoo or you are a stock trader,  you are much more likely to break your iPhone.  Square Trade, you know, they're the company that people pay extra money for the breakage  insurance for iPhones.  Has crunched their numbers and they've come up with this.  Stock traders, frequent stock traders are 40% more likely than the typical iPhone owner to  report damage.  If you have a tattoo, you're 25% more likely, as are those who own motorcycles.  People who have sex more than once a week are 50% more likely to report a damaged iPhone.  What are they keeping it under the mattress?  Big households and pet owners are slightly more likely than average to report a damaged iPhone.  So if you're a stock trader who has regular sex and a tattoo,  you're for sure going to break your iPhone.  Is this ridiculous or what?  I don't know.  It is kind of ridiculous.  I can't help.

So that doesn't it's not what you would normally get.  I love the story.  We'll talk about it when we get them ask you back.  But Brian Roberts, the CEO of Comcast, says we're just like Apple.  No, you're not.  No, no, you're not, actually, at all, in any way like Apple.  Our show today brought to you by Carbonite.com.  If you do have good upstream bandwidth, Carbonite is a great way to back up.  It's no point to do it if you don't have Internet.  Most of us now, though, have good connections, good upstream connections.  And I have to say, if you do, the best way to back up is offsite, right?  To the Internet.  Carbonite is automatic.  You don't have to think about it continuous.  A change is made on a file.  It's instantly backed up.  Offsite backup for a very affordable $59 a year.  That's less than five bucks a month for everything on a computer.  If you have multiple computers, external drives, a small business,  they have plans for that, too.  You can find out more at Carbonite.com.  Always a low flat rate.  They don't meter the amount of data or anything like that.  And I tell you, the nice thing about it is you can always verify that the backup happened  by visiting your Carbonite account on any computer with your smartphone apps.  There's your stuff.  It's a really great system.  And I want you to try it free.  No credit card needed.  Just use our offer code TWIT.  You can try it free for two weeks, 15 days.  If you decide to buy after the trial, because you use the offer code TWIT,  they're going to give you a little reward.  You get two free months, two extra free months, 14 months with a price of 12.  Carbonite.com Mac or PC.  Automatic, secure, and I think very affordable.  There's all the plans.  Now, I have to point out this.  Some of the business plans require, like the Home Premier and the Home Plus require Windows.  They do now have Mac for business and business Premier.  And the Home version, of course, is Mac and Windows as well.  Carbonite.com.  Use the offer code TWIT and try it today.  So we got Matt now on Comcast.  I do believe.  Look at that.  It's just like Apple.  How do I look?  Hey.  Hey.  Brian Roberts says, I just had to laugh when I read this.  This is the CEO of Comcast, the most reviled company in the world.  Brian Roberts.

Transcript:  But Comcast is a close second.  Second most.  He's learned from Apple how to take really complicated things and make them simple,  make them fun, make them beautiful, make them easy.  What is he talking about?  Does he know that he's a cable company?  He says, this is in an interview with Forbes.  As I think about where I'd like to see Comcast go,  it's absolutely to take this overwhelming amount of content choices  now with the internet, so many more choices,  and make them personalized, make them easy to interact with  and have any time on any device.  Maybe, maybe this is a hint that he's working with Apple  on this long rumored Apple television thing.  Maybe.  I was recently in Silicon Valley and somebody said to us, he said,  every idea you've heard about someday is going to happen.  That doesn't sound like a good thing.  Okay.  Here's why I would say that, Matthew.  Ideally, Apple would go to the content creators directly  and say, let's disintermediate.  Let's sell HBO shows directly.  Let's sell Sony movies directly.  Who needs cable companies?  But boy, none of these come.  Everybody's scared to death of that because  if you get Comcast mad at you and they pull the plug on you,  you lose your business.  You can't replace the one with the other yet.  Instead of going to the content creators, what if you went to Comcast?  What if Apple said, look, we're going to make a better set-top box.  Comcast could be the Apple of cable television  if you offered an Apple set-top box.  What about that?

Transcript:  Yeah.  But as I said, they said we're going to do it in some other places.  Here's a good hack.  I like this.  Apparently...  I congratulate the Next Web for this.  Apparently, in 2011, the Next Web says they found that there was a ratio  between the number of active...  monthly active users of the Windows Phone Facebook application  and the number of Windows Phone handsets sold.  So they've done a little bit more of calculation.  And actually, this one's from WM Power User, but the same ratio.  Using the number of monthly active Facebook users as a guide,  we can see that around 627,000 MAU,  monthly active Facebook users of the built-in Facebook app,  have been added since October 1st.  This is of Windows Phone.  Multiplying by the MAU multiplier, you get...  Which is 6.75 Hex handsets per active user.  You get the magic number of...  4.2 million Windows Phone handsets sold in the last two months.  Not Apple numbers.  Certainly not Android numbers, but not bad.  Credible.  How many months is that?  Since October.  4.2 million October, November, and a little bit of December.

You get that big to continue to innovate, but I think that the potential is there.  I think Apple is probably wisely playing it safe a little bit.  They don't need 80%, 90% market share.

They turned off Microsoft Exchange ActiveSync,  which Windows phone users needed to sync with their Google Calendar,  address book, and mail.  By the way, iOS, don't panic.  The iOS IMAP technique and the CalDAV and CardDAV technique still work.  But by turning off ActiveSync, they're actively saying to Windows phone users,  guess you're going to have to use Microsoft.

It's not served by letting Microsoft back in the market.  Google is very happy to have Apple as a competitor to play off of.  But if it has two competitors that are strong, it gets weaker.  Microsoft is very willing to tie search and other services into the OS  and take away share.  Microsoft is very willing to be aggressive.  I think the scroogled thing is sort of a fun play on that.  But I worked at Microsoft.  They don't play around.

He said, we're grownups here.  We're all working with each other at the same time as we're not working with each other.  And we're competitors.

They call it Radeon City.  To crack every single standard Windows password in less than six hours.  350 billion guesses per second.  Now, this would be no good on a website.  This would be no good where you had timeouts.  You'd have to have physical access to the Windows system to do this.  Nevertheless, it just shows you as we've gotten faster and faster in computing,  that some of these algorithms for password protection are not effective.

And then he said, yeah, and Cosmo the God was the guy who taught me how to do this  and made the phone calls to Amazon that got this to happen.  He's 15 years old.  He was sentenced in juvenile court in Long Beach, California.  He's pleaded guilty to multiple felonies, got probation.  Because he's 15.  He's a minor.  Yeah.

And they can do that.  There's tools to hack past that pretty quickly.  And then I also turn on restrictions.  So, you know, see, there's a password.  So even if you steal my phone, now you have to know my restrictions password,  which is different than my home screen password.  That'll slow you down a little bit.

She says she is prepared to pursue legislative solutions if the FAA doesn't act quickly.  We may get our Kindles back.  I hope so.

Next week, we're going to have a well, at least the last news focused Twitter 2012.  Next week, we're going to have a traditional holiday episode, which I always look forward  to because it involves lots of drinking and Jonathan Colton, Paul and Storm and John Hodgman  and I think we get a little special appearance from John Roderick as well on this episode.  So that'll be next week's tweet, the holiday special because it's like the eve of the  eve of Christmas Eve.  And then the following week is our traditional best of which chat has compiled some of the  best segments from the past year, big events like Facebook buying Instagram.  So that'll be on December 30.  And then we'll be back here in studio.  What is that?  January 5, something like that.  Just a little word of warning.  Our show today brought to you by audible.com.  We were talking about the name of the wind.  That could be your book free.  Actually, you get two credits.  So you could get a number of books.  Perhaps you'd be interested in Team of Rivals, the book that inspired the movie Lincoln.  Storm of Swords is coming back.  Game of Thrones in March.  You got to read those books before you watch the TV show.  It wouldn't be right to just watch the show.  It's spoil the whole book for you.  There's so much great stuff.  Audible is an audio bookstore with 100,000 plus titles in every category.  There's history.  There's science.  There's romance.  There's kids books for young adults and children.  There's classics.  There's sci-fi.  There's wonderful stuff here.  It's all read by the best performers.  I think that's really important.  If you're going to go see The Hobbit and you haven't read The Hobbit,  can I just recommend you read The Hobbit before you see The Hobbit?  The best way to do that would be to listen.  The Hobbit is available on audible.com.  There's actually a number of versions including very well done, I thought, BBC 4 dramatization.  But I would read the full unabridged text by J.R.R. Tolkien,  the audible versions read by Rob Inglis and it's quite good.  And you can get it for free.  In fact, if you go to audible.com slash twit two, you can get two credits.  You'll be signing up for the platinum account.  That's two credits a month.  Almost all the books are your single credits.  So that means you get two books.  You don't pay a penny.  Cancel it any time.  The books are yours to keep at no cost to you.  In fact, I have another book.  If you go to audible.com slash Sanderson, and this is good even for existing members,  you don't have to be a new member.  You don't even need a credit card.  audible.com slash Sanderson.  You can download that.  Brandon Sanderson's great novella Legion for free.  It's kind of a little holiday gift to you from audible.com.  Do you do audio books, Robert, at all?

Guy Kawasaki was on triangulation this week, and he's a Google Plus fanatic,  even wrote a book about it.  He said his suggestion was that you create your community, not public, but private first,  because the negative of a public community is everything you post on the community gets  shared out to your circles as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I have 22, almost 2,200 startups in one list on Facebook.  And the behavior on Facebook is very different than this community thing.  Facebook also has groups that are very similar to these communities.  So I don't think most people use them.  Here and there.  You would be shocked with a billion users, even if nobody uses it.  Yeah, true.  There's some of the lists I'm on have 100,000 users.  Wow.  Supposedly nobody uses lists.

Transcript:  Well, on TechMeme right now, it says Dell is making a deal with Microsoft.

Start time: 6491.96
End time: 6516.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To do a Microsoft Windows phone?  They dropped Android.  Maybe they didn't get out of the business.  They just decided to move.  That's interesting.  That would be interesting.  I don't see it now.  Where did it disappear to?  It was imaginary.  Yeah, I can see that.  Yeah, actually that would make sense probably.  Dell is a big Windows company, right?  Makes more sense than Android, probably.

Start time: 6518.46
End time: 6527.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  The FCC is trying to get iMessage and other texting services to allow text to 911.  Is this a good idea?  Help me!  From a text message?

Start time: 6542.80

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Why not?

Start time: 6544.32
End time: 6564.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it's how kids communicate.  It's how people communicate going forward.  Over the top, internet messaging services like iMessage should let users send emergency  text to 911.  You can actually put a GPS pin in it, can't you?  So it might actually be a really good way to let people know where you are.

Transcript:  Here's a use case that the CEO of Alohar told me.  They make the app called PlaceMe.  They can tell whether you were in a car wreck or not because your phone stops.  Your accelerometer knows that.  If you don't move, it can call you and if you don't answer, it can report to the authorities  that there's a car wreck.  Is that a product?

Start time: 6590.16
End time: 6591.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's great.  Is that a startup?

Start time: 6593.24
End time: 6626.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alohar is building a system that could enable this.  This could be a use case that happens in the future.  They can tell.  OnStar does it, but OnStar sensors are built into the car.  We're talking about the sensors in the cell phone.  Oakley said the same thing.  Our ski goggles know you're going 20 miles an hour and you hit a tree and you're not moving.  We can call the ski patrol.  They haven't implemented that yet, but they said that's a potential future thing of these new systems.

Transcript:  By the way, somebody just posted that there was a snow alert up in Seattle  that all iPhone users got sent and they didn't realize that the 911 system is hooked into the iPhone.  It is, in fact.

Start time: 6647.20
End time: 6673.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you look at your settings, you'll see that it's part of the settings.  It's national.  There's a national alert system that the federal government mandated.  I think people don't commonly know that, but if there were a national emergency,  or obviously if there's a local snow emergency,  the government officials can use your phone and send you a message.  It's on Android, too.  Yeah, I remember seeing that.  I just don't remember where.  Where is it?  It's a great idea.  I forget.

Start time: 6695.20
End time: 6716.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's cool.  Yeah.  Lou M.M., who is a Microsofter, says he just got an alert in his Windows Phone 8  and Android in Redmond about the snow.  Very interesting.  I think we're going to wrap this sucker up.  Any great startups, Robert?  You're excited about anything you want to...  Oh, yeah.  We got to talk about that.

Transcript:  It's six people, and they built an algorithm, and they learn what kind of news you like as you use it.  You can also program it a little bit.  I put GigaOM and social media and Twitter in there, and it just finds really great news.  Very little noise, if any at all.  This is a huge category.

Start time: 6766.96
End time: 6779.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, speaking of that, there is a story I forgot to mention.  Both The Guardian and The Wall Street Journal have pulled their social reader from Facebook.  They don't like it that Facebook is controlling.  I think it has to do with the new algorithm, the news algorithm.

Start time: 6780.00
End time: 6812.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does.  I actually wrote about that because the guy who wrote The Guardian blog post about why they decided to do it,  they kind of hinted some of it was between the lines, but he specifically mentioned  that now if you interact with things on their website, the way you share things or don't share things  doesn't determine what you see.  And that's a clear reference to the tweaking of the Facebook algorithm,  so that if people don't share things, they stop showing up.  And I think they were probably noticing that.

Start time: 6812.56
End time: 6816.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they really want the news to be a little bit more rigorous.

Start time: 6817.84
End time: 6832.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I've been seeing a lot fewer news items over on this ticker over on the right side of Facebook.  I mean, here's one from the BBC, but very few reading behavior.  There's one from The Guardian.

Transcript:  You mean the ticker?  You like the ticker?

Start time: 6850.00
End time: 6878.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I love the ticker.  I wish the ticker was on all the mobile apps.  I'll be at Facebook tomorrow and I'll ask them why they haven't  brought the ticker over into the mobile apps yet.  For news, it's sort of weird because a lot of stuff that we read is  guilty pleasure kind of stuff.  I really don't need to know that you're reading some article about some sexual thing or something.

Transcript:  I've been kind of embarrassed by a few of the things.  If you still like the social reader, by the way, go to socialreader.com and that's what  the post is doing now.  They're running their own website.

Start time: 6889.44
End time: 6897.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

At first, I was a little skeptical of the new YouTube interface, YouTube.com.  But we had Lamar Wilson on This Week in Google and he explained what the thinking was.  They had briefed him on it.  And I like it.  It improves browsing.  It brings your subscriptions forward, which is nice.  I think actually they've made some good moves here on this.  Yeah.
