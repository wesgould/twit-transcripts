Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Network 8LLI wireless network  AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting  This is twit this week in tech episode 113 for September 17 2007  This week in tech is brought to you by audible.com for your free audiobook visit  audible.com slash twit  This is twit episode 113 and joining us to talk about the week's news in the  world of technology we've got where is will will harris I know where he is he's  in Oxford up late once again hey will hello it's only what 930 no it's 1030  1030 that's positive early why is London time different from universal  coordinated time because of daylight savings ah see that threw me for the  longest time I thought GMT and UTC would be the same but they're not no it all

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  changes depending on the time of the year all right so we're not in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  summertime right now Robert Heron could probably have explained that to me he  would know that kind of thing he is of course the star now of DLTV now that  that Patrick guy is gone gone gone I say no how's it go you and Roger are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  hosting yeah and it's a you know what I think the first couple episodes might  have been a little rough but the last couple I've actually been quite pleased  with Rodgers great everybody he is a trooper and I've taught him not to read  the emails as frequently it's just glaze over don't don't don't don't don't  stress over every little read now we get no never read anybody can write anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they want exactly exactly we're looking for Patrick Norton to join us a little  bit later on he apparently has a plumbing emergency  you want anybody want to elaborate I think is it like a metaphorical plumbing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  plumbing actual plumbing now I actually saw the problem it's his kitchen sink it  just won't turn off and it's it's wasting an incredible amount of water

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well I think that that's appropriate we are all for water conservation here so  Patrick go ahead and fix that and if he gets it fixed I hope he gets it fixed  well we'll make sure we get him on on the Skype as soon as he shows up lots of  stories to talk about actually Robert I'm very glad you're here because a lot  of these stories have to do with your particular area of expertise which is  a home theater and high-def TV but before we even get to those news stories  you were at Cedia in Denver last week it's the big it's the installer show

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right yeah the Consumer Electronic Design and Installation Association has  their annual show last couple years it's been in Denver Colorado and this year

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was as awesome as it always is I want to think of that it's kind of a niche show  I mean they got you know popcorn machines and couches but it's but a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of technology gets shown there too yeah oh indeed and plus it's where I go to  get the preview of all of the latest high-definition TVs new projectors new  screen technologies and just updates in general set-top boxes as well but in  addition it's also the furniture the every other aspect speakers are a huge  portion of it in addition to home automation is arguably one of the bigger  sides of it as well just a way of bringing it all together and making it  either look right perform the way you want or just simplifying the whole  experience and it's just a training session too for hundreds and thousands  of people who come by who take courses in various either installation techniques  or calibration or even marketing and other aspects of home theater as well so  these are installation pros basically exactly and you come there to actually  be trained or to just get advice and updates and in terms of what's what in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the industry and yet the stuff they're installing is the same stuff I'm gonna  buy and put my living room right I mean it's not I'm not gonna put in a screen  that opens when I push a button but you know a curtain that opens when I push a  button but I might be looking at the same plasma sets or projection sets that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they look at exactly but if you want to see like what's the latest in mounting  technologies what is the latest in control systems for those devices  especially for the high-end market I mean relatively high-end where you're  either doing you know I say a thirty or forty thousand dollar room all the way  up to you know million dollar rooms and what kind of equipment would you be  considering for those environments and how and how do you differentiate it from  what what other people do. Matt what do you get in a million dollar room?  You're building a room from the ground up. You get a hundred and eight inch LCD. No it's all front projection at that point here you're not dealing with any kind of flat panel whatsoever.  Really the big expense goes into the room design itself designing the room  for acoustics and isolating the room from the rest of the environment in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  terms of sound in particular. That's interesting if you if prices money is no  object you would buy a projector not a direct view display. Of course. Why? Of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is what cinema is and and the technologies that are available in front  projection aren't available in most flat panel or rear projection technologies  especially when it comes to film based content the 24p material that you see  with HD DVD and blu-ray. There are no displays out there that can process that  properly short of certain pan or certain pioneer plasmas can but there are quite  a few front projectors on the other hand which can take that 24p content and  display it at say 48 Hertz which it makes it for a very smooth presentation  and and for just simple screen size as well if you're going to do a hundred and  thirty hundred and forty or larger inch screen you're talking front projector  you're not talking a flat panel technology. Right. Well certainly when I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  go to the movies these days and I go to my local cinema it's a DLP it's a  Christie DLP usually you know DLP front projection of it I guess the same kind  you could buy in a million dollar home. Exactly. They also let's see they use

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  three chip systems for those where they use a usually a prism split light source  into red blue and green and then each DLP chip processes that color  independently and they get remixed together before it hits the screen and  that's arguably one of the best ways to do it that gives you the best motion  performance when you can do a three chip system. I don't want to get sidetracked

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because it's going to turn into the home theater thing but I want to ask you  because we were talking on Friday and you mentioned something that kind of  scared me you you've been running some tests on motion between LCDs and plasma

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  screens. Exactly one of the big trends I noticed at this year's show was that all  of the LCD manufacturers are touting ways that they can improve image fidelity  with moving content or when when things are moving on the screen it turns out  that LCDs are generally very poor at keeping a clear picture or not smearing  the picture. Is that because of the latency in the screen? Exactly.  Switching from one state to a different state for each LCD pixel is generally a slow process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They call it response time right? Measured in milliseconds usually you know it's for an LCD it's 10 or more

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  milliseconds. Yeah and I'll be honest the response time figures that are usually  stated are pretty useless generally speaking. You have to put your eyes on it.  Yeah. However the latest trend has been 120 Hertz imagery.  These panels aren't capable of accepting 120 Hertz  signal. What they're doing is taking that 60 Hertz signal and adding interpolated  frames in between and that helps to smooth the picture out and produce a more  clear less smeared picture and it does help. It is a step above the traditional  60 Hertz panels you'll see out there but it still is no comparison to what you'll  see on even a modest plasma display right now in terms of being able to  handle scenes that move and I just happened to acquire a new Blu-ray based  test disc that really highlighted the fact for me in the lab where I could put  up the display side by side run similar real-world content in a mix of a test  pattern content and see just clearly that that plasmas produce a clearer  picture when things are moving. Now with static imagery yes you get usually you  get as detailed of an image with either display technology but with things  containing motion which is you know your action movies a panning sequence and a  lot of films it is surprising what you lose on an LCD panel in terms of image  quality and just the softness and it's harder on the eyes and it's a it's more  fatiguing to watch really and that was one of the good things I've seen here  that arguably JVC is ahead of the game in terms of LCD right now because they're  on their second generation of motion performance improvements whereas most  companies have just started with their first generation with the current line  and I'm itching at digital life actually in a couple weeks in New York City I'll  be able to I'll have at least one of their panels set up there to show off  and hopefully soon after I'll have that in the lab for testing. Pioneer showed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  its new Kuro line of plasmas. Absolutely beautiful. Kuro means what black in

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Japanese. Yeah and that's it really they gave their engineers a blank not a blank  check necessarily but allowed them to go back and redesign the panel from the  ground up and the biggest improvements were in black level in particular they  found a new way to drive the panel when it is displaying black where it uses  very little electricity hence it produces very little light and makes it  very very dark which in turn helps apparent image contrast and it makes  color pop a little bit better too and the panels they had on display were  everything from their elite series and their standard series which are also a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kuro as well. So that's gonna place all the all the all the panels then. Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  gorgeous gorgeous panels in general and Sharp was showing off or they mentioned  that they're about to build a 10th generation plant in Sakai City Japan and  they were showing off their their new mother glass whenever they build a new  facility for building LCD panels it enables them to build a larger mother  glass sheet and these new sheets whereas last year the the plant they had just  opened could carve out eight 52 inch panels the new plant can carve out eight  57 inch panels so it's just that's a larger sheet of glass they can work with  at once and they're also highlighting the fact that a Sharps combining LCD  manufacturing with their solar cell manufacturing because I guess it both  involves thin film transistor technology so they're combining both technologies  at one plant and hopefully they're looking to dominate to in low-cost solar

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cell panels as well but somebody told me they showed four kids some people were

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  showing 4k screens too. Oh it was beautiful that was a JVC demo again they had their  prototype DILA which is a L cost technology liquid crystal and silicon  they were showing off their 4k projector which is 4,000 pixels by about 2,000  pixels a 8 megapixel imagery with actual 4k material I had never seen a 4k film  before but it was a it was a film called Trident starring David Carradine and they  showed about five minutes of it and it was as deep it was probably what was it  about probably a 40 foot screen corner to corner and it was gorgeous it was the  black levels were extremely dark the whites were very bright there was no  bleed the colors were just perfect and the detail was phenomenal and then they  immediately followed that up with some oh they were claiming to that each frame  of this 4k material they were showing each frame that was displayed every 60th  of a second or I think it was every 48th of a second was 50 megabytes of  information so it was a huge a huge array of drives spinning away pounding  this up but then they switched over to an an 8 megapixel commercial flight  simulator program that I had never seen anything like this before but clearly  when the pros are out there driving their pro flight simulators it is an  amazing looking experience I have to say especially looking at a screen like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  how long before we all we all have 4k screens is that imminent or is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  something that's decades off that's a good question it is it is coming and  they're looking at even beyond that to 8k in the lab right now oh my god but but

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so just what you thought HD was like the pinnacle it's gonna look as bad as as  standard display that looks now it's gonna be you know we're gonna go HD oh I  wouldn't yeah to a point for the biggest screens is where you're gonna have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the best improvement when you can do really large home theater right  otherwise where all of the material we look at right now it at its best quality  is 1080p material so there's not there's not a huge compelling reason to go  beyond that at the moment in terms of making displays that bigger I mean it  was a big fight just to get most of your high-def TVs you see in the store

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  nowadays to 1080p resolution right all right well it sounds like CD it was a  candy store oh unbelievable we'll see more I'm sure on DL TV oh one one just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  quickie thing THX had a couple of really cool technologies too that they were  showing off one they had the first they said they're certifying display  technologies now and they showed off their first THX certified LCD which was  very impressive is a sharp panel it's available in Japan but another  technology they feature was something they code named Blackbird and quickly it  was just a way of them it's a technology platform that allows content creators to  incorporate metadata into their into their content be it video or audio that  simply describes to compatible hardware it's like hey look I'm 16 by 9 format  video the display should be in 16 by 9 format it uses Dolby digital audio or  whatever audio format make sure the receivers switch to that as well and we  should be seeing demos of that at CES coming up in a couple months it's just a  way to help simplify the experience so that you know what you're not looking at  your 4 by 3 contents stretched incorrectly and likewise your 16 by 9

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  content you think they've done that right up front because that's I mean one  of the biggest pains in the butt is to figure out what you know match everything

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  up oh it really is and it's nothing more frustrating even walking around on the  show floor I saw I saw vendors with their content being displayed incorrectly  and it was like not a lot of that going on but there were a couple and it really  stood out when you notice that especially that it's CDA oh my god not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the place to do it we've talked about home theater but I know that wheel is  championing at the bit to talk about something a little closer to home and  that is his iPhone he brought it back from New York along with a fiancee  talks more about the iPhone these days oh now you're happy you can use it I can

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  open source free GUI unlock did you use the GUI unlock though you use the  command no I didn't so the GUI unlock came out a couple of days later I sat  on the command line doing like you know SSH into the into the back end of the  iPhone all this kind of crazy stuff actually not as hard as you might think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  no it's almost a book should be our intern is written up on his site the  step-by-step and that's what I felt I unlocked mine too I've got mine running  on T-mobile and it's it works flawlessly it's very so it's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  brilliant because it's the first time I've ever used an iPhone as an actual  phone and says all this you know crazy stuff like the text messaging and you  know conferencing in calls and stuff unbelievable I just I'm very happy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  now this is funny because I think because of all this hacking Apple has  really sped up the announcement of iPhone in Europe the big event is coming  up in just three days it's the 18th in London yes at an Apple store and we  don't know what it is but the presumption is it's gonna be the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  announcement yeah and I mean they had the guy who's the head of O2 who's which  is the cellular network is widely sort of tipped to have it went on record last  week as saying you know oh we're not we know we're not saying anything but in  principle you know we don't find revenue sharing objectionable so you know who  else is putting a revenue sharing deal long on the table you know right so so  it looks like it's gonna be in the bag but even if they announce it next week  the talk is that it's gonna be at least November before it actually arrives on  the street and maybe even close and of course this maybe even close to  Christmas and of course with despite the exchange rate it's still gonna be a heck  of a lot more expensive over here and of course if you've got an unlocked phone  then you can choose the carrier that you want and data plan that you want is  everybody in England everybody is GSM in England so you have your choice yeah I  mean the downside is that you know almost everywhere in England there is  3g as well so unlike the US where there's nothing you need you guys kind of  have patchy 3g coverage England is just blanket 3g so the lack of 3g is even  more kind of kind of jarring but you know you pay your money right you take

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your choice so it's O2 in Britain it'll be orange in France T-Mobile in Germany  that's the that's the latest although again not been confirmed but that's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  expectations are yeah absolutely but I mean noticeably a lot of the other  networks over here have started updating their hardware to edge as well because  we've previously only had some GPRS really but O2 was rolled out edge now  we're starting to see Vodafone and T-Mobile all come online with edge  stuff for various you know reasons. Data becomes very important when you start

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  using devices any kind of smartphone it's all about the data really the phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  becomes second. I'm holding out for an HSDPA phone right now well there's been

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a route I have actually kind of ignored the rumors that there'd be a second  generation iPhone as early as Christmas but there this rumor is very persistent  that there will be an HSDPA iPhone by Christmas in the States I don't know if

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's the case. Because the networks are being built up right now I had a quick  question about the iPhone mods though can if you wanted to could you totally

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  restore it back to its original condition? Hold on a sec here we want to  get Patrick into the mix Patrick your your sink has stopped overflowing? Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  had to shut down the water to the house to replace some washers. That happened to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in the middle of the night one night a pipe burst under my sink and my it was  like me and my seven-year-old daughter we're going and it's hot water and I'm  like Abby quick turn off the water she's what daddy what what turn off the water  what daddy where's the water? What water? Oh goodness gracious we had a flood we had a three or four  inches well I'm glad you you've got it fixed so welcome we've already talked  about CDA with Robert and we're now talking about the fact that not only by  the way I didn't point this out not only has Will hacked his iPhone but I have  hacked my iPhone I wasn't willing to T-Mobile I wasn't willing to do this to  my own phone but but I'm very you know and I've mentioned this a few times that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've come real close and just can't I don't want to break my phone that's so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wrong I don't want to break my phone so a pawnbroker believe it or not a very kindly a guy named David  MacArthur who is a pawnbroker in Balmer he has two palms he says you know what  we're getting a lot of phones back pawned phones why don't I just send you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  one you can hack that one hey if he gets any good Mac tools ratchet wrenches or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he can check me an email I'm sure he will Patrick I'm sure Patrick likes his  tools so he said I got it yesterday and just like you will I mean I sat down I  followed Shuby's instructions it's the same ones the key is getting the right  jailbreak program I tried on iFuntastic which is a Mac program couldn't get it to  work there's a Windows program called iBricker which apparently works better  but I ended up using a null river program called something like app tap that really was great and by the way in the process you also get all these third party applications you can install

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just I'm just trying to get over the idea of running an application called iBricker on my cell phone. I couldn't do it! That's exactly right!

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I figured well here's a here's you know here's a pawn you know a phone I got for nothing and thank you David and it's working and I put my T-Mobile chip in it and it's amazing it really works so to answer your question Robert which Robert was just asking before we  picked you up Patrick it's my understanding that because these are just  software hacks at any point you can restore the phone with it with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  restore iTunes restore so if you if you just use iTunes restore you won't  actually you won't undo the hack because the hack is written into the modem  firmware baseband and most restores don't overwrite the baseband so what you need  is to actually go back and re-manually reflash the modem firmware how do you do  that? Well you can you can get the the firmware in a file or actually the  rumor is that the next iPhone update it's gonna overwrite the the modem  baseband which will do it for you yeah that's gonna be the interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  question I'm gonna hold off on 1.03 because I'm not I have a feeling that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  will heck yeah although is this the sorry go ahead is this the only way to  get third-party applications on the iPhone right now well this is a two-step

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  process yes the you have to do what's called jailbreak it to get third-party  apps on but that's just the first part of unlocking it so there's really two  hacks going on and then yes oh believe me when you see this you know you do the  SSH commands you're using to unlock it and that's what I guess that explains it  now will while you're doing these AT commands is you're doing what looks like

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  hey's modem commands here yep absolutely yeah and you know you're reconfiguring  the the the modem that's actually in it that's which is kind of which is kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  crazy that's really I've had to do that since the Macintosh duo 280 in my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  parents house I mean this is a it's all it's like going back in time Apple  interestingly this week Greg Jaws we act jaws they call him who is Apple I think  Apple vice president said that Apple doesn't oppose now it's very lawyerly  language so I should probably read the quotes exactly but this is PC magazine  talk to him doesn't oppose native software development they take a neutral  stance on you hacking your phone to put native apps on it they say now we're not  gonna we're not gonna get involved if you have a problem and we're not gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  enable third-party and we if you put a risk breaking your hardware so we have to  tell you you have to buy a new piece of hardware to replace the one you trashed  by putting on the third piece of the third party software which we don't mind

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  we're good with that now so actually so that so the only thing was that he there  was a sort of mini retraction from from the jaws we act statement a couple of  days later which was that he said you know we're kind of neutral we don't  endorse it and we don't know what's gonna happen with future updates well

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they say specifically software updates will most likely break these third yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and they then went back from that and said we're almost certainly gonna you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know screw you over but but we but it doesn't violate the warranty I guess or  whatever I don't know but see we've gone one step farther and I can guarantee  you while they haven't said anything about unlocking the iPhone they don't  like this because everybody seems to agree Apple's getting a piece of the  action from AT&T on my monthly bill so if I'm going over to T-Mobile they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  not getting anything but then you have to think like you know how much how much  love does Apple have for AT&T when it's introducing you know the ringtones and  the wireless iTunes store where AT&T is just cut out of the loop entirely that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a good point it's a an interesting article I don't know if I believe it  Daniel Silgar writing and roughly drafted he's been on the show before or  Macbreak weekly I guess said seemed to seem to make a pretty good case that  Apple didn't even want to charge for those ringtones but was required to by  the RIAA because these are derivative works RIAA interestingly enough does  not pass the revenue along to the artists it's not a performer's royalty  it goes right in the body of the label pure profit it's your profit and what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  even more what's even more crazy is that even if you buy a tune from the iTunes  ring from the from the iTunes store like there's no guarantee that you can  convert that into a ringtone because only certain tunes on the store you can  then have the rights to half a million of them are yeah this is probably from

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the same brilliant RIAA team actually I take it back at Sony who came up with  the Ringo the CD Ringo have you guys heard about this oh gosh go ahead tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  us about it this blows me it's because okay CD singles you know basically 45

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  singles started to die out but cassette singles because singles started to  become very popular than the cassette died and there was never really seemed  to be a huge market for the CD single so now what they're doing is they're taking  a hit a couple of beat tracks or remixes and throwing on a couple of ringtones on  it and as Sony and UMG are leading the pack Sony's only came up with the idea  and October November this year you will be able to buy CD Ringo packs you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  won't want them but you'll be able to buy them now and of course it's no  guarantee it'll work on your phone because many many carriers in the states  like Verizon just you know no sorry you got to buy it from us but that's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  amazing how many hacks there are to get around true the those systems that people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  companies have set up in fact one of the first things you do when you install  the you know the application jailbreak on here is is put up there's a great  application allows you to take any song and make it a ringtone so that's you  know that's almost instantaneous so that's easy to die easily done in the  fact I think there's at least Ambrosia software and a few other companies who  are making ringtone software you know that will take a song and make a ring  tone for the iPhone it's pretty hard to stop people from doing that not easy to  do on a Motorola phone you have to use bit. Pim and and weird stuff like that oh

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bit. Pim's one I love bit. Pim oh but it's such a hack yeah but you know what  it's it's bit. Pim allowed me to do a lot of stuff that well yeah you know I had a  I had a great I think it was an LG I came up with an LG or a Samsung phone and  there was no software from anybody supporting that on one list I wanted to  buy a particularly obscure $50 third-party application and and I  downloaded bit. Pim which is free and it allowed me access to all you know it  allowed me to pull all of my phone numbers off of there to transfer files  onto it it was and it was a thousand times easier than using the weird  little program that came to pull photos off the phone well it makes me crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that the phone companies keep still to this day are keeping people from doing  things like that the hardware their own content on their own hardware and the  phone company gets in between you I just Leo we've created a fantastic wireless

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  infrastructure and make these phones available to people at a vast discount I  think it's only fair that we're allowed to recoup revenue and investment by  forcing people to use obscure online applications tied into a per use fee  that allows us to continue revenue stream that will internally allow us to  keep bringing you those wonderful phones you keep buying over and over again and  we want to thank you for your continued support of this telecom industry running

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  character on to it we call Billy Bob Verizon and thank you Billy Bob PR this  is one for for Robert blu-ray versus HD DVD battle might face a third contender  from a London based company new medium enterprises versatile media disc 1080p

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  HD screens under 200 this is like a bad Dilbert cartoon what we need here is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  third competitor but it's really a yeah did you see it yeah actually I had the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  demo presented at CDA met with the company it's and bucks yeah the players  will be anywhere from 150 to 200 dollars they have a decent list of launch titles  coming how did they do that essentially what they're working with is a red laser  technology so that their big push is that the current disc replicators have  will have a very easy time switching over to producing content on this format  and they're looking at using multiple layers of red laser because you're only  getting about less than five gigs per layer so they're stacking upwards of  three or more layers on these discs in order to provide enough space to provide

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  1080p content no format no major studios but they do have Mel Gibson they had

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a they should actually both demos I saw was a saw apocalypto and I saw we were  soldiers yeah it was pretty much but there's also that a list of upcoming  movies as well and included some some relatively current films and I was I'll  just be curious to see if if this can take off or not in the face of just all  right we have these two competing high-def disc formats already in addition

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to our other DVD content and they've got everybody in their pocket you know if  you're not if you're not a Sony partner anyway then the HD DVD forums giving you  a bunch of money to produce your discs on HD DVD I mean they've got an uphill

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  battle I think for content exactly it's different from like China DVD yeah see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's like yes it is really the fourth high def format oh what happened to  Patrick he's wandered off so should we worry about this Robert should we should  we hold off I've just seen to me it gives me just another reason not to buy

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  an HD DVD or a Blu-ray player you know what the other thing well in this case  I'm I'm not that concerned about this format really the one thing people might  instantly assume as well if you can do these inexpensive red laser discs that  store upwards of 30 gigs you know the hey that sounds great for the PC  environment but no this is strictly for the disc replicators not for you're not  gonna have any kind of drive technology that will allow you to burn this kind of  content yourself right that's just one thing to point out the demos look solid  the technology looks solid the the protection for the content owners is  there it literally will just come down to acceptance and do people really want  to mess around have yet another disc player stacked in their array of  hardware at home granted inexpensive as it is and it should be relatively cheap  I mean the most expensive player they currently announced is 199 and the discs  themselves should be dirt cheap as well so there's possibility there however at  CDA as well they also showed off LG and Samsung both showed off brand new dual  format players for the HD content or the HD disc format so it's getting to the  point where you know what don't worry about the war anymore hold out for the  price of these combo players to come down and then you don't have to worry  about whether it's blu-ray or HD DVD your disc player is gonna play it just  fine and the key with these this latest generation of combo players is that they  they support all of the features now of both formats blu-ray and HD DVD HD DVD

Transcript:  Sony's coming forward now with these blu-ray recorders 50 gigabytes of disc

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and they're fast right I mean they're 4x yeah I mean go go into a store and try  to find a 50 gig recordable good luck we have the recorders but no media yeah no  media and and if you priced out the cost of even a slice of 25 gig media that's  really prohibitive I haven't seen it under 20 bucks a slice yet so I'm it's  it's ridiculous you're still better off if you can authoring two regular red  laser technologies I mean that's that's where the cost benefit is and a lot of  the new disc authoring tools even even the consumer versions will allow you to  author to red laser in a camp in a format that's compatible with the high  def disc formats it leave you're not gonna have a lot of space to work with  but you could still put like say 20 minutes of content on there we didn't

Transcript:  not only that they announced a three core processor which is very strange

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well I don't think it's announced I think it's rumored oh rumored okay because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's the quad Barcelona is the most recent one and that one yes Barcelona

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  came out on Monday apparently which is the which is sort of the big release to  AMD's been targeting for a long long time it's their first you know quad core  server chip and they're calling it a native quad core because it's it's it's  truly quad core rather than Intel's which is like two dual cores packaged  together right for all the difference that that makes well apparently not in  the benchmarks it's not very impressive well exactly the problem is that you  know for the slight technical inefficiency that having two by two might  be compared to the native for Intel can crank it stuff a heck of a lot faster  the name T can crank it I say we're sitting in two point five gigahertz or

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  something after did you just get a dog or something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  feelings downstairs with me she was outside and started whining every once  in a while I hear you go here boy apparently the mute button doesn't work

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  talking to the laptop Mike yeah that's what I'm doing well the MacBook Pro I'm  still trying to resolve the MacBook Pro problem with the internal or the the  line input right yeah that's what we use USB I just like you as I know but I'll  send every time you use USB you complain about a sound quality I can't go back  to the little little handset I'll try the USB again maybe it'll work better on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the I thought this was a very interesting story in CNET they asked a  bunch of lawyers about ad blocking software and the general consensus was  you're gonna see a lawsuit in the next year or so as more and more people use  programs like ad block which is a Firefox extension and block ads from  websites there they're cutting into revenue to the point where the people  like the interactive advertising bureau are gonna go up against them and say you  can't do this anymore IAB says it's not preparing a legal offensive and he'd  like to work he'd like to work with software developers and consumers to come  up on what on a middle ground but he says the issue is now ripening ooh that

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  means they found no way to be able to prosecute the end user that's exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right well I don't think they'd go after the end user they'd go after the  companies but even then that's pretty difficult who makes ad block it's  probably just some guy right I don't think there's a company ad block works  so well I have a mix I don't have a mix to feelings about this because on the  one hand I you know ads are what support most of what we do on this podcast and  everything I do for a living but at the same time we know very well for instance  that people who visit a website a lot never click on the ads the ads are  almost always clicked on by the first my first time viewers so I think is we see

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know okay I'm sorry gonna rub it I was just saying my biggest complaint  about most ads being served is that it's a from a third party and as long as  the webmaster is ensuring that the site is still performing as quickly as it  would be without having those ads not being served locally it's I have no  problem with it it does just like a change because of one somebody's ad  server is choking and it's my experience. I have that problem on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  twit and the reason you don't serve them locally generally is because the they  want to count them yeah mm-hmm and I you know we've had problems in the past with  dot TV loading slowly because you know some banner ad on there is is not coming  in as fast as the rest of the site is and it is annoying I don't know what you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do about it or if it if there's a way that they could load the the bulk of the  text or the content on the site first and have that display immediately and  then you know what if the ad doesn't appear so be it but that's up to me and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I that is something you can code into okay yeah and that I really should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  doing that because I often watch and the status bar at the bottom of my browser to  see what's going on it's like oh waiting for some bizarre ad server  located who knows where and tada no web page yet granted you know using a bad ad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  server because this this this whole this whole series of articles came out of a  New York Times column back on September 10th that no Cohen wrote out or actually  the week before that he wrote about ad block plus and that there's a group  basically a group of webmasters have gotten together and put a they want to  start they want to start boycotting Firefox users because so many Firefox  using users are employing the ad block or plug-in extension and so this is yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  so it's been interesting in your code I don't want anybody with ad blocker you  can only say I don't want anybody with Firefox so that's the you know that's  the best you can do I mean I think he has that site my Firefox is blocked calm

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that talks about yeah yeah but but yeah but it's been interesting to watch this  this this article on this this column in the New York Times and the paid content  dot org picked up on it that CNET picked up on it and it's there's a lot of  there's apparently a lot of upset webmasters and it's in our I mean you  know Robert you pointed out there's nothing worse than when a web page hangs  because some ad server company doesn't have their you know to lead that sort of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stuff let's say it's just Google AdSense which loads fast it's almost  always just text they're fairly unobtrusive and by the way ad block  blocks it too you guys don't like that either I don't know I leave ads I make

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  my living of for the most part through advertising revenue for the companies  that I work for so I never block ads you know maybe you know it's just out of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  personal courtesy I don't block ads either mostly because it doesn't bother  me that much but I'm sympathetic to people who do I don't have I don't do

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it yeah but if I'm in a hurry and I'm on a deadline and I need pages to be  flying through my browser you know I'll enable the damn thing and say you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what it's pretty telling if a page loads considerably faster without ads that's  you know you're paying more a higher price for that ad than just you know  using up space or looking ugly it's slowing you down yeah that's a good  argument against it I gotta say I don't know you know what we discover what we  Twitter's that just people aren't willing to pay for content you know some  people some small percentage will always donate we thank them very much but we  have to run ads or you know it's just not just not gonna pay and you know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for the sites that I do visit if there's a relevant ad of a product I'm even  remotely interested in I do try to click on the ads to support that site and give  some give them some you know click through or whatever well the web you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  know it's funny I see this all the time I mean and I'm this way too I want stuff  free and we were a little spoiled by the web we want kind of a lot of free  content easily downloaded and read and free software and damn you Napster yeah  we're spoiled and and we forget that you know somebody has to pay for this stuff  it's not free by the way be careful when you hack your iPhone I Apple is now  asking for if you want that hundred dollar store credit to identify the  phone and your phone number and they give you an SMS text message to that  AT&T phone number to correct credit so if you've got a hacked phone you won't  be getting your hundred buck credit that's clever  it's very very clever like cuts into their bottom line doesn't it it does  that's the point yeah cost some money I think well we don't know that's the  speculation we think yeah yeah people think I don't know the whole thing I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mean you know Leo have a bleeding-edge phone to be bought for the absolute  positive absolute top price and then turned around itself you know a few  months later the price drop that's what amazed me like all these people up we  support it's like this is a shock of these people never bought you know cell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  phones before right so well it was it was I I'm with you on that and that's  kind of exactly what it was an amazing drop it was a 30% that's the thing huge  drop exactly it's a huge drop and it was in it and it happened at two months after  the phone came out so I kind of understand it's for the money suckers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hey speaking about a hundred dollars and you can spend it or store back basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  get a coming and going oh yeah and who could go in an Apple store and only  spend a hundred bucks you know they're gonna make a little extra on that on the  side I'll probably buy a nano right a hundred fifty dollar nano they made  money see see it's a it's a perfect thing you're continuing efforts to keep

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple alive and highly profitable you think I had stock or something what you  buy the next on stock and get an SUV that would make more that would be more

It's called linked the new science of networks Albert Laszlo Barabasi who is  from Transylvania even though even though he lives in Indiana he's from  Transylvania so there you go he must know that's beyond cool I would say that I  might buy out too if I were from oh yes I'm from Transylvania if you want to  listen to this book or any of the 35,000 books they've got on audible.com and by  the way 135 plus different devices so don't feel like you have to listen to  on your computer or your iPod it works on all sorts of mp3 players portable  devices even specialty devices for people for instance who are a blind or  want to listen on a cassette and that kind of thing and you can burn them to  CDs a udible.com slash twit for your free book we thank them so much for  their support of this week in tech and the entire twit network let's see a  couple of other stories before we wrap this thing up Verizon is now going to  court saying we don't like this auction the FCC is doing this 700 megahertz  auction you remember Google asked had four open access suggestions the FCC  decided to implement two of them Verizon doesn't like the idea that whoever wins  this spectrum auction must allow consumers to use any device and any  lawful application on their networks. Because Verizon sucks. Verizon hates

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  community networking. Verizon got so upset that Philadelphia who they  didn't apparently weren't consulted about not wiring started their own  community wireless networks they started getting legislation in place at the  state level to prevent you know basically to make it more difficult for  communities to wire themselves. Verizon sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They say and Billy Bob should be reading this Billy Bob says  imposing any such requirements in the competitive wireless market would reduce  the revenue the government will receive from the spectrum auction in other words  we ain't gonna pay for that you know and limit the introduction of new and  innovative wireless services yeah that's BS good for Google yeah because go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  oh no it's just like because you know the the wireless companies haven't made  fantastic amounts already off of off of the wireless auctions and their ability  to access them in unusual ways. We want a monopoly. They're saying they want a monopoly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  basically. Google I love this Google's response to the legal action is that  Verizon doesn't think consumers deserve more choice than they currently have and  that's regrettable and I think it is regrettable for them to go to court is  absolutely absurd I'm sure the US District Court of Appeals will overturn  them obviously the federal government has the right to make any stipulations it  wants it's our spectrum ladies and gentlemen it's our spectrum not yours  Verizon well let's hope the courts do the right thing on that one we shall

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not entirely sure you know Google's gonna be the most amazing owner of the  spectrum should they win the bid but at least they're doing some things even if  they don't get this right from at least offers the opportunity for the American

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sissing to get better use of it. They're making the right noises anyway you know  someday we should do a show just on you know is Google a threat or not but they  do the right for instance you know that the new X prize that they just announced  the Google Lunar X prize. Isn't that great I mean it just little things like  that they're gonna yeah they're offering a twenty million yeah twenty dollar  prize twenty million dollar prize for the first commercial attempt to get a soft  landing on the moon you have to go for 500 what is it 500 meters you have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  explore for and then you get and you have to send back a gigabyte of video  and high risk or high def imagery as well isn't that great actually 30

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  million dollars and then and then it 500 meters transmitting mooncast you have to  do a moon cast back to the earth I just love so awesome I hope you think that's  gonna yeah I mean look what happened to the with the Ansari X prize that really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  did stimulate commercial launches isn't the are the Ansari folks administering  this one also are they because I was just gonna express that the other day

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah that would be great I mean they did a great job I think with the first one

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll just be curious to see if somebody can do this for a cost of less than 30  million dollars if that's possible that that will show some very very good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  efficiency on their part wouldn't that be amazing but even if not at least this  defraes the cost a little bit right or it'll make NASA seem less relevant and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they have the automotive X prize too oh they do what's that  hold on one second went for the I was reading about it but apparently nothing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stayed in my forebrain on this one while you're on one side while you're while  you're doing your research once again also mentioned that Google once again on  the side of the angels well maybe not on this one I don't know they proposed a  global privacy standard now that's the thing people most fear about Google is  that they know so much about us Google's saying the US privacy standard is to  patchwork sometimes it's true to count to draconian they say it's very difficult  for any web company to operate internationally because of the wide  variety of laws we think that the European framework is probably  inappropriate as well because it really is too restrictive we like the Asian  approach they say it's moderate it balances the the privacy of individuals  with the needs of business I'll have to read the the Asian framework but you  know that's you know this is a good question is is is Google here fighting  for us or fighting for Google probably Google right or the Google shale hoarders

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  shale share holders as the case may be Mark Rotenberg who with epic and we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  should get him on and says that the the Asian Pacific privacy framework is  backward-looking and the weakest international framework for privacy  protection far below what Europeans require so he's not he doesn't think  it's great but but I think that the what they say a global standard is certainly  a good idea maybe it shouldn't be as unrestrictive as Google wants but I  certainly I think a global standard is a very important step forward yeah make it  easier the yeah oops sorry go ahead make it easier yes I just said what I had to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  say you may go ahead you've done your research so the XPRIZE foundation they  basically Google sponsored the Lunar XPRIZE that's still being administered  by the XPRIZE foundation and they've also started the automotive XPRIZE which  is to inspire a new generation of viable super-efficient vehicles the  multi-million dollar AXP purse will be awarded to teams that win a stage race  for clean production capable vehicles that exceed a hundred miles per gallon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of fuel economy good so and if you're a teenager don't do your use your cell  phone while you're driving that new car yeah because that's illegal in  California now I feel bad for teenagers they don't vote so that they can pass a  bill like this they notice they don't pass the same bill should be passed for  all people you shouldn't be using your cell phone while you're driving or your  PDA or your laptop or your pager but because 16 and 17 year olds don't vote  they could get that one through totally they just don't count they don't count a
