End time: 359.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there's been breakthroughs in the clay potage of late.  Lots to talk about with Father Robert.  I guess the big story of the week really is a twofold story, all about the story of streaming  and what the hell is happening with it.  First thing happens, Netflix in their Q1 financials revealed that for the first time ever, they  lost subscribers.  A couple of hundred thousand subscribers versus two and a half million expected.  And of course, it's the first time ever.  They've gained every year since they were founded, I think.  Immediately, the market reacted by killing Netflix value by almost a third.  Might be more than a third by now.  A huge plummet.  And I guess the feeling is this is the beginning of the end for Netflix, which kind of surprises me.  Netflix response is, well, we're looking at ad-supported programming, which would definitely kill Netflix.  It seems the wrong way to go.  You know, Netflix blamed the couple of things that clearly make a difference.  You have the broad variety of streamers now.  You have many, many choices.  Disney+, Peacock, Hulu.  Netflix is just one of them.  You also have, so you have competition for them, but they've also been hurting Netflix by pulling back  on the programs they own.  Peacock pulled out The Office, Disney pulled out Marvel's content.  So Netflix is losing a lot of its catalog to the competition.  And then their answer, which was a good answer, was to make original programming.  But they spent $13 billion last year on original programming.  And it's kind of hard to imagine that that's a sustainable strategy.  So Netflix in trouble.  And this affects you too, Nate.  Netflix is big in the UK.

Start time: 360.64
End time: 462.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's big.  But actually, one of the things we were looking at this week is how subscriber numbers to all streaming  services are really going down in Britain.  And a lot of people are wondering why is this happening in particular in the UK?  And a lot of people are looking at the cost of energy in Britain, which went up by about 50% in April,  which doesn't sound like it would necessarily impact streaming directly.  But most households in the UK had their energy bills sort of go up by 50% literally overnight.  And they're going to go up again in October by a similar amount.  So one of the first things I think people have been looking at is, well, do we need this many subscriptions?  Do we need Netflix and Disney Plus and Apple TV and all of these other things that we have?  And I think a lot of the answers now is, well, no, we don't.  And I don't necessarily think it dooms Netflix because the numbers are still enormous.  You know, we're still talking hundreds of millions of subscribers, but it's definitely a concern.  And as you noted with the share price, which is something that we look at a lot, obviously at Bloomberg,  it started the year at something like 600 and it closed on Friday at about 200.  So it's just absolutely annihilated.  And a lot of very prominent investors have lost money and notably lost money by selling at this loss and actually saying,  you know what, we don't think this is going to get any better.  So we're going to counter losses, get out now.  And some people are saying that that was a smart move.  But it's it's it must be deeply challenging, particularly when you look at the wider market and the fact that streaming is growing.  It's a sign that Netflix just cannot keep all these people to itself anymore, at least not consistently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bill Ackman is one of the investors.  He's the lead at Pershing Square.  He got into Netflix just a few months ago.  Whoops. January about 3.1 million shares.  Shares have fallen 60 percent since then.  He sold all those shares netting a 400 million dollar loss.  Yikes.  Yeah, that's the that's the chart.  But somebody like that will only do that if he says, look, there's only downside here.  I see no upside.

Start time: 492.60
End time: 524.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the this is the this is the thing.  And a lot of people, you know, particularly retail investors will talk about, you know, buy the dip, buy the dip.  And there's a lot of logic in that a lot of the time.  But when something so disastrous comes along as what happened this week with Netflix's figures and the forecast to lose even more subscribers,  then the smart money sometimes is on, well, if you're going to lose something, lose lose the least amount possible.  And that at least seems to be Ackman's strategy here, whether or not that will continue.  Who knows? Maybe this is an even bigger dip to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Netflix has three C's that are a problem.  You've got cost.  You've got competition and you've got content.  Now, cost and competition.  Those are did you just make that up?  I just made that up.  That's really good.  But that's exactly the three problems.  Yeah, exactly.  Because the first two you can fix, you can price your service better to be more competitive.  But the problem is content.  And this is where it becomes a long term issue for Netflix.  Amazon and Disney, which are number two and three are fine.  They've got plenty of content that is actually pretty dang good.  Amazon just bought an entire catalog from Paramount and Disney is never going to be running out of content in the next 15 or so years.  But when you start looking at how Netflix has been stocking up its content, it's with pardon my French crap.  It's horrible, horrible stuff.  It's a lot of foreign programs that nobody wants.  They have some successful movies.

Start time: 580.40
End time: 592.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were able to lure Scorsese over and make a three hour film called The Irishman.  They almost won an Oscar for Roma two years ago.  They have some very successful streaming original content.

Start time: 592.36
End time: 608.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's great.  But it only means I have to subscribe one month out of the year.  I can binge everything I want to watch on Netflix in one month and then I'm done.  So where I am right now is I almost don't want to steal the password for Netflix from one of my friends.

Start time: 609.66
End time: 613.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you have Netflix?  I have Netflix.

Start time: 613.40
End time: 614.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not paying for Netflix.

Start time: 615.92
End time: 682.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you left out there's three C's but there's also an R.  It's like Creedence Clearwater, CCR.  CCR, which is revenue.  And that's one of the things Netflix is trying to do.  Go after password sharing.  They claim a hundred million people are using Netflix with a shared password.  I meant my kids who had my password when they lived with me.  They were part of my household when they moved out.  I didn't change the password on them.  So they're still watching Netflix.  But I have to say I don't think those hundred million people are necessarily all going to become subscribers.  I do like Netflix's apparent plan.  They're trying this already in Central and South America is to instead of saying we're going to cut these people off,  they're just going to charge you a couple extra bucks a month for the other people.  So it's very likely the dad who's paying for the Henry and Abby will pay a couple extra bucks a month for each of them.  Then have to make the phone call and saying I'm cutting off your Netflix kids.  Get your own account.  What do you think Lisa?  Is Netflix worth it?  Is it 12 bucks a month now?

Start time: 683.66
End time: 716.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I think it's hard because I think it goes back to what we were just talking about.  It's all about the content.  And I think, you know, if Netflix does start charging more to have, you know, more people on their account,  just like you were talking about what they're piloting right now in some locations,  I think this is going to be a big test for Netflix.  I think we're going to figure out, you know, how crucial is it really to people?  Are they willing to pay more?  You know, I think you'll have a lot of those conversations of like you're saying, you know, dad might call you up and say,  hey, are you using Netflix?  Do I need to upgrade or can I just, you know, cut you out?

Start time: 716.52
End time: 719.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you for giving me the wording.  Hey, are you using it still?

Start time: 720.24
End time: 742.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  I could see that happening a lot.  But I do think the competition is a big part of it.  And, you know, Netflix was comfortable for a long time because they were really the first to popularize streaming.  And they did.  They were also one of the first to have really good original shows like House of Cards.  But it's, you know, they obviously can't just keep doing the same things anymore because the competition has changed so much.

Start time: 744.20
End time: 769.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's what the market is saying.  Not so much that it's over for Netflix, but that the heyday of streaming is over.  I mean, we certainly we had two very good years during COVID.  Maybe they're feeling like, well, OK, but people aren't going to be staying home as much anymore.  And they're not going to be paying because times are tight with the recession and inflation.  They're maybe not going to want to pay that extra subscription.  What's the first one to go?  That's the real question.

Start time: 769.50
End time: 815.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.  Well, I also think people sign up for one show and then they cancel just like, you know, we were talking about before.  So I think that's part of it, too.  I think to really keep people in, they just need to have a really good catalog of good shows.  Like kind of like Netflix is kind of like a cable replacement, right?  Like people don't usually sign up to watch just one show and then, you know, quit.  I feel like that's something that you see more with like maybe Showtime or some of these other, you know, streamers that were a little bit later to the game.  But I think if Netflix really wants to keep subscribers from, you know, just having that be the first one off the chopping block,  they need to just make sure they have like a really big back catalog of stuff that can essentially, you know, fill that cable hole for a lot of people.

Start time: 816.44
End time: 859.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, at the start, we might have looked at the top 10 shows on Netflix in the U.S.  It's always a bad sign when a network goes to reality programming, right?  That's cheap. Yeah.  And it's usually a kind of drive to the bottom.  Number one, selling sunset.  Number two, conversations with a killer that John Wayne Gacy tapes.  I don't know. I think the Mark Tardis fiction, Anatomy of a Scandal, probably fiction.  Bridgerton. Well, Bridgerton is just hot.  And the ultimatum. I don't want to.  The ultimatum, marry or move on.  Number six, this is kind of looks like a bad sign.  I am the best boss.  Huh?  Somebody say something.

Start time: 860.98
End time: 872.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that was my Netflix that for some reason, through here, I was trying to find what the popular equivalents in the U.K. were.  I didn't know why.

Start time: 873.18
End time: 880.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a what do they call this carousel?  I haven't seen before the top 10 shows in the U.S. today.

Start time: 880.80
End time: 892.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The top ones here are actually fairly similar in the U.K.  Selling sunset, Anatomy of a Scandal, John Wayne, Heartstopper, Bridgerton, The Missing.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 893.06
End time: 903.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Netflix can fix this.  How?  All they have to do is move to a metered plan.  Five dollars a month, 40 hours of programming.  No one's going to share it if you're going to be using up your hours.

Start time: 903.44
End time: 915.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's an interesting idea.  And then it's less.  So maybe you won't get rid of it.  And you could probably think of five hours to watch.  Exactly.  And most people like me are going to end up watching more than five hours probably.  So yeah.

Start time: 915.80
End time: 951.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so you go up to the next level.  Go to the next tier.  Also, Leo, you know, we predicted this 10 years ago.  Back in the early days of twit in cord cutters when we were talking about cutting the cord  and we talked about the rise of streaming services.  There was a prediction about how all of the studios are going to want to get on on this.  They see what Netflix has.  They're going to want to start their own streaming services.  It's going to take a while for them to build their catalogs, to build their technology.  But eventually we're going to get to the point where people are going to start saying  I don't want to have five or six different subscriptions a month to watch all the programming I want.  That's where we are right now.  This is the calling.  We've reached the bottleneck.

Start time: 951.58
End time: 971.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it over for cord cutting?  I had a caller today in the radio show said I just signed up for cable again because I couldn't find the shows I wanted.  It was more.  It was getting more and more expensive.  Cord cutting no longer saves you money if you include the cost of Internet.  I think maybe it's the end of cord cutting.

Start time: 971.96
End time: 982.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I saw some report that I think said on average Americans spend $47 per month on streaming services.  I mean, that's like getting into cable territory again.

Start time: 982.46
End time: 988.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Especially when you add the $40 or $50 or $60, in my case, for your Internet access.  Now you're at $100.

Start time: 990.06
End time: 1008.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And also if the cable companies are catching up to streaming and are offering more on-demand options and things like that,  that allow people to watch what they want instead of just defaulting to whatever happens to be on right now.  I feel like yeah, there is a compelling case for just going back to cable instead of signing up for like,  you know, five different streaming services to get everything you want.

Start time: 1009.20
End time: 1047.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Have you seen Samsung TV?  I have not.  So it's something that I just bought my parents a brand new 70 inch TV for their house in Las Vegas.  And they're actually when I first installed it and it took all of information.  Where we were and what locality we're in.  We got access completely free, no subscription to about 3000 channels over Samsung TV.  That's free forever, which includes local TV.  And they've now cut the cable.  They don't need anything.  They've got everything they want and they're not paying any subscription fees.  Now, you know, I don't know, but it's awesome.

Start time: 1047.84
End time: 1058.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if they know, but you know that the reason Samsung does this is because now they are getting marketing information from them.  Correct.  Right. I mean, that's where the revenue stream is, I would guess.  Absolutely.

Start time: 1058.50
End time: 1063.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And it tells you at the beginning, it tells you this is exactly what's going to be happening.  This is what we're using the information for.

Start time: 1063.30
End time: 1085.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think most people, if you got free locals, sure, I'll do that.  You're going to sell my information back to advertisers.  But I don't care if I get free TV.  That's interesting.  Today still, Nate, forgive me my ignorance.  Do you still have to buy a license to watch TV in the UK?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, you do?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, you do.  Oh, yeah.  That's bad.  It is.

Start time: 1087.50
End time: 1160.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, there's a lot.  There is a lot of controversy around this at the moment because the BBC is, you know, I don't want to say it's having its lunch eaten by the streaming giants, but it's certainly having a lot of its food taken by the streaming giants.  The BBC license fee in a nutshell, it used to be you paid it.  Anyone who had a TV paid the license fee and then your TV was free.  And bear in mind that has now moved to the point that it's streaming, it's back catalog, it's the BBC News, it's radio, it's podcast, it's all that other stuff.  And it is entirely ad free.  And that's the thing that makes a big, big difference.  Like it is illegal even to show ads.  Like you cannot show ads on it.  So it's a completely different model and it does work.  And it is actually very, very good value if you're someone who values BBC content.  But at the same time, there are a lot of people who say it is a tax that shouldn't be paid.  It should be a subscription model.  It should be paid monthly.  It should be privatized and it should be made to compete better with the likes of Netflix.  But it's withstood that.  And a lot of the reason is because it's not just TV.  It is a huge wealth of other things as well.  And that sort of kept people kind of happy with it for the most part, at least.

Start time: 1160.90
End time: 1173.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like at a remove anyway, because you know, we don't see everything.  The BBC is the gold standard for broadcasting both radio and television.  And I would be glad to pay.  What's the license fee?  How much does it cost?

Start time: 1173.90
End time: 1229.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I'd have to check.  So I just renewed it.  They renews automatically.  It's something like about a hundred and forty pounds a year.  Oh, that is a lot.  That's Netflix territory.  It's a little steep.  Yeah.  I mean in dollars, that's probably about 180 bucks a year.  That's more than Netflix.  Yeah, it probably is more than Netflix.  But it is almost incomparable to Netflix in terms of the subscription and what you get  for it because it is, you know, you're paying for the newsroom.  It funds everything the BBC does.  And I'm not a BBC apologist.  Throw that out there.  There's an awful lot I don't like about the BBC does and the way the model is.  But you know, there is a lot of educational stuff that comes with that.  There is a lot of, you know, international bureaus full of journalists, which obviously  as a journalist myself is something that I know is not cheap and is very, very valuable,  particularly, you know, more so now than ever possibly.

Start time: 1230.62
End time: 1248.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you want a democracy, you better damn well have a free.  Now, I don't know how free and independent the BBC is, but you better have a free and  independent journalism in your country to report on the misuse of power or otherwise  you have nobody, you know, you have no idea what's going on.

Start time: 1249.12
End time: 1280.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the idea is that it's meant to be it's meant to be unbiased.  It doesn't have a political agenda.  A lot of people is there political influence at all on the BBC?  I mean, there's political influence in everything, right?  You can't get away from it.  But the goal is that it is that it doesn't have that influence.  Personally, you can never get that right.  I just don't think it's possible.  And I don't think the BBC gets it right at all.  And there is a lot of establishment related problems with the BBC from the top, which  is kind of out of step with what a lot of people experience in their day to day lives,  as is also the case in politics.  So there are parallels.

Start time: 1280.64
End time: 1285.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If it were tax supported, though, I think that'd be more of a peril than a license  fee, I guess.

Start time: 1286.00
End time: 1314.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know.  The license fee for all intents and purposes is a tax.  It's a tax.  It's a legal requirement.  But if you ask most people who would watch a show like This Week in Tech and who are  in the tech world and who are generally pretty familiar with the way that the modern world  works for us, tech and streaming goes, you would not find that many people who think  that what the BBC does is bad.  But there is a lot to be said for ways it could be brought up to date.

Transcript:  Our problem in the United States is all media is corporate.  And it tends to be owned and increasingly so by oligarchs.  And so that's really a problem.  And part of the problem that Netflix and streaming and court cutting is having is that the people  who distribute the content are increasingly buying the content creators.  They are the one and the same, which now means they have a monopoly on the content and its  distribution.  It is not a good system.  I have to say here in the United States, CNN, which we're going to talk about in a second,  has become the Ukraine War porn channel.  It's basically wall to wall Ukraine War.  It's as if nothing else is happening.  I saw not one story about Macron's run against Maria Le Pen, for instance, or even salacious  stuff like Johnny Depp and Amber Heard.  It was all Ukraine all the time.  I started to watch BBC World News and you're getting news.  So I'm grateful.  Thank you for paying your license fees, Nate.

Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, you pay for it in a different way as well, because if you look at something  like BBC America or DVD sales and the license deals that go out.  I had to pay for it.  Those sorts of things also, they fold in.  They're under a different arm of the BBC.  There's BBC Worldwide and so on.  So there's a lot to be said for what the BBC does.  And I personally would hate for it to go away in any significant way.  But there are also ways I'd love to bring it up today.  And frankly, you could pay more.  I mean, it's been around for decades and decades and there are so many old programs that are  just sitting in vaults and archives somewhere that aren't online.  All the old Doctor Who's are always the ones that people bring out as an example.  Like that is an insane and huge back catalog of extremely valuable IP that if you put all  those online and said to international audiences, hey, pay this and you get all of this as well.  That's going to please license fee payers.  I'm sure please a lot of people who are watching this right now being able to get a, you know,  ad free very low cost access to a lot of old stuff.  But you know, you cannot please everyone.  One size doesn't fit all blah, blah, blah.  Insert your metaphor here, but it's interesting compared to Netflix.

Transcript:  I should, by the way, clarify.  I think the war in Ukraine is extremely important.  I'm not saying that's unimportant.  I'm saying we don't need wall to wall coverage or I mean, we need coverage and we should  have coverage.  But there are other stories that are also important going on.  And we need dispassionate, dispassionate.  Well, it's really clear now.  I don't know what you get in Italy, but it's really clear now when I watch CNN that they've  decided that war is good for ratings.  Yeah, of course.  And just can, you know, there's no news.  It's just let's keep talking to people in basements and looking at blown up buildings.  And I don't think it's, you know, at the very least, if you want to cover Ukraine war, let's  talk about what's going on and the geopolitics of it.  And you know, I mean, there's lots more to talk about.  CNN is partly this is happening because CNN is currently rudderless.  And that's the other streaming story today.  CNN Plus, which was launched last month with great fanfare and 300 million dollars in marketing  has just been shuttered.  They gave up, canceled.  It's over.

Transcript:  So it's a complicated story because it's part of that story of the rolling up of content  by distributors.  AT&T owned Time Warner, which owned HBO and CNN, divested of it because they realized  we're a phone company and Discovery bought it.  So the problem was that Discovery, I think, is not yet running it or they are.  They just started running it and they could not tell Warner, don't launch this.  We aren't going to do it.  Get it.  Stop it.  Don't stop.  Warner was going to pay, spend a billion dollars to get subscribers.  But it's not allowed if you're in the process of acquiring a company to tell the company  how to be run.  So they could say nothing.  The day that the merger happened, they said, OK, and by the way, that's CNN Plus.  That's got to go.  It was kind of sad.  There are a lot of people who quit their job to go to work for CNN Plus, including Chris  Wallace.  It's quite a stunning, I think, black mark on the reputation of CNN.  But also at the same time, CNN Plus didn't have any live news.  So I think it was destined to die anyway.  Apparently, what was happening at Warner, we had stories that, from Axios and others,  that there were only 10,000 daily active viewers.  The New York Times implies that that was leaked by Warner to tank CNN Plus.  I'm not Warner, by discovery to tank CNN Plus.  It's really quite a soap opera.  So it just feels like the streaming world is in quite an uproar this week.

Transcript:  Yeah, there's the argument that whenever something gets shut down, that, oh, it's embarrassing  and it's a black mark because it's been shut down very quickly.  And obviously, there are other circumstances around this that make it more than just a  business decision.  It's the victim of a merger.  It's probably conflicts of interest, not conflicts of interest, but conflicts of preference in  management.  But often, I think we see when companies shut down a product very quickly, it's often for  the best in the long run.  And you look back because you look back and you think, well, actually, this was never  going to work.  So we did well to kill it when it was young.  And we take the learning that we did that's still very relevant and we plug that insight,  we plug that expertise, we plug that whatever you've got behind the scenes into the next  new property and then get ahead of where you would have been otherwise.  We've seen that happen time and time again.  I think, to be honest, we kind of saw it in the previous section talking about Netflix  and the investor who sold it at a loss.  Like, get out now and maybe you'll be glad you did.  Cut your losses.  Yeah.  Cut your losses.  There's times where that doesn't make sense.  And I did something on my podcast only this afternoon comparing this to Microsoft Kin.  If you remember, in 2010, Microsoft launched a whole new phone platform, physical hardware.  I actually owned a Microsoft Kin, by the way.

Transcript:  Yeah.  It really was.  And I went to the launch for that in San Francisco and they killed it within a few weeks.  And actually, if you look back, that was probably a very good decision.  It didn't help Windows Phone.  It didn't help the Nokia stuff that came afterwards.  But at the time, it was probably never going to succeed long term.  And so they just killed it.  So right, you know what?  Forget it.  Let's not bother.  Probably a good decision.  Maybe this is too.

And it's there's a lot of uproar and shift and change going on.  And we're just seeing that I think very clearly and very dramatically.  What do consumers want?  What do we want?

But we obviously know that's not going to happen because of, you know, ownership and rights  and all of these other things.  It's just not going to happen.  But yeah, I do like the idea of having, you know, maybe three or fewer services that just  have everything that you need.  Because it just gets so complicated.  That's how it used to be.  Yeah, let's go back like maybe seven years ago or five years ago or however long.  But you know, all of this does, I do feel terrible for all the people that, you know,  went over to CNN Plus and lost their jobs.  I do feel like this is kind of a turning point for the streaming wars.  And I do think if there are new services in the future, it is going to be harder for companies  to recruit talent for something like this after seeing what happened to CNN Plus.

Start time: 1864.90
End time: 1882.53

Transcript:  The thinking at this point is that Discovery wants to make HBO Max.  That Discovery kind of agrees with you, Lisa, and thinks we're just going to make one master  subscription that you get CNN, you get everything with HBO Max.  And I kind of agree with you.  But how much would you pay?  I mean, are they going to charge $50 a month for that?

Start time: 1883.54
End time: 1896.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, I think it depends on what else you're subscribing to also.  Like if I'm only subscribing to one or two things, I will pay more for those services.  But if I need to have like four or five services, I don't want to pay more than $5 a month for  something else.  Yeah.

End time: 1932.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if you're already paying for it?  What if we already have a subscription fee, a licensing fee like they do in the UK, except  we call it Amazon Prime?  We bought Amazon Prime because we wanted to be able to get our stuff faster and Amazon  Prime Video just came along with it for free.  I know it's expensive in the States.  Here in Italy, it cost me 30 euro a year.  That's it.  And that's by free shipping.  And that's all of the Amazon services, including Prime Video.  So that's my streaming service.  Not because I wanted that streaming service, but because it came with something else I  already bought.

Start time: 1932.92
End time: 1949.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's a great point because I don't know if I would have signed up for Amazon Prime  Video unless I already had Amazon Prime.  But now that I have it, I do find myself watching it like fairly often.  Again, not enough to get it on my own.  But since it comes with Amazon Prime already.  Yeah, that's a good point.

Start time: 1950.26
End time: 2011.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm right with you there as well, Lisa.  And we have similar in terms of the pricing strategy here.  I mean, I get Prime for the same day shipping.  And you know, when there's something that comes up on Prime, like the new, what's the  thing that was Top Gear, the new Grand Tour comes out.  It's just on there.  And that's great.  It's nice to have.  But I'd never sign up for that on its own.  Absolutely not.  I like the idea of a service where you get, it's like a service that sits on top of the  streaming companies and you get like one hop a month.  And you can hop from Netflix one month to Disney Plus the next month to Hulu Plus the  next month and to Apple TV the next month.  I mean, it would never work because why would they agree to do something like that?  And then there's all the technical problems.  There isn't parity in the pricing models or anything.  But in principle, I like that idea because I would probably give overall more money to  each of those companies than if I was maintaining one subscription with them all for the  whole year.  I don't think we'll see it.  But in terms of answering the question, what would we want?  I would love something like that for sure.

Start time: 2013.82

Transcript:  Also, I have to say that Amazon Prime Video in Italy has way better catalog than Amazon  Prime in the United States.  I get all of Star Trek.  So Picard and Discovery and all of the sci-fi series that I enjoy everything from Upload  to the Expanse.  So it kind of depends where you're located in the world, which only means it depends  on what kind of VPN you have.

End time: 2070.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That general approach also kind of reminds me of Apple TV Plus as well.  I mean, it's not exactly the same.  But since Apple gives you I think it's a full year that you get for free when you buy a  new Apple device.  That's a really long time.  I mean, I guess the idea is you're already buying an iPhone or an iPad or whatever.  And by the time the free trial is up, you probably forget that you not forget that you  have it, but you're so used to watching it if you did fall into it that it's like,  oh yeah, I'll pay five bucks a month to keep that.  So it's a little different than Amazon, but the same in that you're paying for something  else and then you happen to get that service.

Start time: 2070.92
End time: 2110.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And also that Apple and Amazon don't have to make money on their streaming services.  So Netflix, that's it, right?  That's all they've got.  But Amazon, Apple, and I guess to some degree Disney, it's just incremental income for  them or they even can sell it at a loss because they're going to make it up with sales in  other areas.  Apple TV is spending not as much money as Netflix, but they've gotten up to several  billion dollars a year.  And actually, I have to say Apple TV is starting to look better and better.  There's some shows on Apple TV now, which I would say are as good as anywhere else.  And I couldn't say that for the first year or two.

And Slow Horses, which they've just put out, which I was sure they bought from the BBC.  But in fact, no, they produced themselves is every bit as good as any BBC spy drama.  They got Gary Oldman to do TV.  So but that's an advantage because Apple can spend this money.  That's not their business.  Amazon can spend this money.  Amazon, by the way, is spending more than anybody that for this new Lord of the Rings.  They spent a billion dollars just for the rights.  And I can't but and then now they're making I can't remember what the per episode  price is, but it's something like 250 million and it's mind-boggling.

The one the what's interesting is none of these competitors are doing live sports yet.  Amazon Prime has started to do it and now Apple they've got baseball and the  rumor is strong that they're going to get Sunday night Sunday ticket, which is a  lot of football away from direct TV.  That could really put them over the top sports is something people do pay for  and are willing to pay for live sports.

And they don't even have to make it back with subscriptions and that's the key.  All right.  Let's take a little break.  The I've it's fun to talk about TV, but we're going to have to talk about Elon  Musk.  I'm sorry.

Transcript:  Also with this father Robert Ballas here the digital Jesuit from his home  somewhere high above the Vatican not that high not all the way up just you  know halfway to heaven.  It's great to see you and Nate Langson who is tech editor at Bloomberg.  You're talking about VPNs Robert our sponsor for this segment Express VPN.  There are three reasons you'd use a VPN.  There's security.  There's privacy and there's the ability to watch Doctor Who.  I would say all three are very very important.  But one of the benefits of Express VPN is they are in more than 90 countries.  So when you use Express VPN, it's really easy to put it on your phone on your smart  TV.  You can even put it on your router on your laptop on your desktop when you use  Express VPN.  You can say I want to be in London right now.  And then if you've got a Netflix subscription you can binge all the Doctor  Who you want a Netflix UK.  That's just one of the many reasons to get a good VPN.  But I have to tell you I want to underscore good because there are lots of  awful VPNs the free VPNs that spy on you and sell your marketing information.  The VPNs that don't invest in infrastructure not Express VPN.  They they're not free but that money goes to making them the best VPN out there  the only one I use you can even put on your router and protect your whole home  and it's so fast.  Nobody's going to complain.  That's really really important with a VPN.  Not only do they invest in and all those servers and all that bandwidth they  rotate their IP addresses.  That's very important too because the privacy angle on a VPN when you're using  Express VPN you're not using your IP address when you make those Google  searches or you visit those websites.  You're using their IP address and because they rotate IP addresses they spend  the money to get a whole bunch of them.  You are never the same person twice.  That's real privacy.  If you're not using a VPN your internet service provider knows everything you  do Google knows Google says hello welcome back.  You don't you know the incognito mode is not incognito.  You need Express VPN using the internet without Express VPN is like checking  your baggage at the airport without a lock.  Yeah sure nobody's going to go through your bags unless they do and just think  of all the things they'll find.  That's not mine.  When you go to online without a VPN ISP see what you're doing.  Google knows who you are with Express VPN incognito mode truly is private your  identity is anonymized by a secure VPN server and when you find out about the  technical details of what Express VPN does to protect your privacy I think  you'll be very very impressed.  They just had an article in bleeping computer about this fascinating.  They have a custom Debbie and distro running on their servers.  It runs a server VPN server.  They call their trusted server.  It runs it in RAM and it can't it's sandbox so it can't write to the disk and  then every day the whole hard drive gets wiped anyway.  They reinstall the entire distribution.  So you're you're you there is no trace of your visit to Express VPN.  That's real privacy security to you.  You can use Express VPN anywhere and no matter who else is on that network.  They can't see what you're doing secure your online activity use the only VPN  I recommend for privacy for security and yeah for watching you know TV shows  and other jurisdictions visit Express VPN com slash twit right now.  That's expre double SVP N.  Com slash twit three extra months free when you buy a one-year package.  It is the number one trusted VPN.  It's the only one I trust the only one I use Express VPN com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support.  I got up this morning and there are there was already I'm thinking is today  the day we don't have to mention Elon Musk on Twitter is it going to be a nope.  There's already you on chatter because early this morning apparently he tweeted.  This two words and an ellipsis moving on.  And all the pundits immediately jumped on that.  This is by the way Elon loves this attention.  This is I'm convinced the main reason he does this saying oh he's moving on.  He announced this week that he had enough money that he had the resources to buy Twitter  that he had banking assurances from Morgan Stanley and others.  We thought oh moving on from buying Twitter.  No, no three hours later.  He says moving on from making fun of Bill Gates for shorting Tesla while claiming to support climate change action.  Now look, this is a mean to mean tweet, but it's kind of apt.  Yesterday, Elon tweeted this picture of Mr. Gates in a blue polo shirt.  Look, I'm no guy to say anything about a stomach.  He got a little bit of a belly and Elon said looks just like the pregnant guy emoji.  And he kind of does.  I can't.  Elon is like five.  He's got the mentality of a 12 year old.  I don't personally think he should own Twitter.  I think that's a terrible idea.  I think oligarchs should not own media.  What do you think Lisa?  Is he going to buy Twitter or is all this just fun and games?

Transcript:  Honestly, I it's hard to say.  I do think you know, I agree.  I do think you know, it's probably best if Elon Musk does not own Twitter.  But I think what's interesting is why he's interested in buying Twitter as well.  And I know you've talked about Elon a bunch.  So you've probably touched on this already, but he keeps kind of talking about how he  sees a lot of potential in Twitter.  And I think that kind of made a lot of people think about what Elon would do with Twitter  if he actually bought it.  And I think that's something that's on everyone's minds right now.  He's talked about it.  He's been very vocal about his thoughts on free speech and content moderation and making  the Twitter algorithm public.  Right. I think he unless I'm mistaken, I think he has kind of talked about maybe making  an open source or something like that, which would be a really big shift.  But yeah, I don't know.  It's it'll be interesting to see where things go.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think actually Jack Dorsey is more interested in making Twitter open source,  but he's not the CEO and he's not even on the board anymore.  Right.  So we don't even we don't even care.  I'm going to call Elon a bullionaire because he's a billionaire full of bull.  We'll give credit on that too.  Actually, I first read it in Ian Bogost's post on the Atlantic.  Elon Musk baloney King.  But actually he gives credit to Benedict Evans, who's a great tech blogger, a bullionaire.  So one of the things people thought Elon might be talking about because he talks a lot about  free speech is bringing back conservative voices like the former president.  But then I read that House Republicans are just as nervous about Elon Musk as Democrats are.  Jim Jordan sent a letter to Twitter saying you must preserve all records about Musk's  bid to buy the company.  Setting the grounds for a potential congressional probe of the acquisition.  So even the right isn't happy about Elon's free speech.  I think he's trolling us.  What do you think?  Father Robert, do you think he's trolling us?

He's low key.  He likes chaos.  Yeah, the monkey trickster.  Yeah.  And you have to remember this is a person who grew up in a life of privilege.  He grew up wealthy.  He's used to having all of his needs met when he wants to met.  He's used to having people take his meetings anytime he wants to take his meetings.  So for him, this is all part of the same game.  Now the people who cheerlead Elon, I get that.  I understand.  He's successful.  He's wealthy.  He seems brilliant.  We have things to thank him for.

What I am against is when people build up privilege and wealth by doing those things  and then use that privilege and wealth to make it more difficult for everyone else to do the same.  When you have a big player, a billionaire, an American oligarch.  Pull the ladder up.  Pull the ladder up.  Yeah.  And that's what this is.  If you allow Elon to own Twitter, own any social media company, you are essentially  recreating the disaster we have with Rupert Murdoch.  And that never should have happened.  I don't want part two.  And unfortunately, that's what this would be.  Elon in saying that he wants free speech is essentially saying, well, I want anything  that the market will bear.  Everything that the market will bear does not work well for free speech.  That is not free speech.  In the United States and our Constitution, we have definite limits on free speech.  You cannot yell fire in a crowded theater and call it free speech.  That's essentially what Elon is saying.  We should allow on Twitter.

Transcript:  But look at how they're owning it.  There is a block between ownership and editorial ship.  Elon doesn't want to do that.  If you look at the way Elon's companies work, the ownership is editorial.  He controls everything from top to bottom at any point because he is it.  And super in at any point, he can pop in and implement some crazy idea that cannot  be how our media works, how our press works, how our expression of free speech works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  And that was the premise of Ian Bogost's column in the Atlantic.  It is a bad thing for democracy.  We need democracy.  We need we need and I would say, and we need good journalism, as I just said, to  bolster democracy so that the people in power are called to, you know, account.  Thank you.  And I fear that we're losing both in this country.  Without a free press to speak truth to power, the oligarchs win.  And it's pretty clear that's what the oligarchs are trying to do is buy up media.  So I'm hoping Elon is not so I'm hoping he's not serious that he's just messing with us.  And I sincerely hope he doesn't buy Twitter because I don't think any good will come of that.  They you know, Twitter is as outsized in its importance here in the United States.  It doesn't have that many subscribers.  It's one fifteenth the size of Facebook.  But unfortunately, it's the media that pay attention to Twitter and give it an outsized  influence. Is it the same in the UK?

Transcript:  As long as the audience is in any way global, then a newsroom kind of has to pay attention to Twitter, even if you're local.  So, so yes, but I mean, there is a small anarchist in me that thinks it would for a very short period of time be really quite entertaining to see Elon Musk own Twitter.  But that would that would very quickly spiral, I think, into something that is not entertaining in the slightest.  And the other question, the more serious side of me also thinks, what is it about Twitter specifically about that he would want to do with it?  Because he has the means, certainly has the motive, has the, you know, has the resource, has the ability to set something up, to create something from scratch and attract a lot of people to it very, very quickly.  Why if he wants to run a successful business like that, why not build one?  Why not start it?  He could very easily do it.  So there's something specific to Twitter.  And that's why I think he's serious about wanting to buy it.  And that's why I think it's probably a good idea as has already been said on this show just now, why it's probably not a good idea.

Transcript:  I think it comes down to how influential Twitter can be in a weird way.  And I think, you know, Twitter tends to draw a lot.  A lot of people, I feel like, tend to lump it into like the same category as Facebook and other social media platforms.  But like you were saying, Leo, it's not really the same because I feel like the people who really pay attention to Twitter the most are journalists, you know, people in the tech industry.  It's not really, you know, the social network where people go to post things about their personal life all the time, the way you might on Instagram.  So I think Elon sees that and he sees it as kind of a microphone.  And, you know, I honestly think that a big part of the reason why he's so interested in Twitter is because of that influence.  You know, as we just talked about the former president and Elon Musk himself, when they tweet something controversial, it's news.  There's a whole news cycle that's built around it, right?  You don't really get that from Facebook and some of these other social media platforms.  So I think that is the main reason is for the influence that Twitter can have.

You ask 50 different people what I see in the woke narrative.  You get 15 different answers.  The woke narrative is, well, I don't like that.  So it's woke.  Right.  Okay.  Well, no.  How about this?  If you do not communicate in a civil way, people will block you.  I have a block bot that automatically does it for me.  I have people that have created numerous accounts trying to get around it just so they can say it's not fair that you have a block bot.  Well, that's silly.  If you can't communicate with me in a way that is going to encourage a civil conversation, why would I want to waste my time speaking with you?

Transcript:  Elon says Twitter is biased against conservatives.  If you actually look at it, and there was just a study by professors at MIT and Yale called, Is Twitter biased against conservatives?  The challenge of inferring political bias in a hyper partisan ecosystem.  The study basically concluded just what you just said, Father Robert.  Twitter doesn't block people because of what they say.  It blocks them because of how they say it.  Which is fair.  Right?  Yeah.  Block, if you're abusive, I don't care which side you're on.  Block them.  Yeah.

Start time: 3299.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's what my block bot does.  I've looked at what it's blocking.  It's just looking for sentiment.  It's looking for how things are being expressed.  Yeah.  And it's blocking about 50-50 people on the left and on the right.  I don't want people yelling at me.  There's nothing that comes productive out of you yelling at me.  If you want to have a great conversation, we can go back and forth.  If you want to explain why you feel the way that you feel, I actually want to know that.  I become more intelligent.  I become more informed about the world by hearing opposing viewpoints.  I don't learn anything by someone saying, Oh, that's just because you're a pedo priest.  Or that's because you're woke.  Oh, great.  Or that's because, you know, that, okay, I don't need that.  Yeah.  And so when people are saying Twitter is oppressing XYZ voice, what they really mean is,  I feel like people aren't listening to me scream into the ether.  And guess what?  No one should listen to you scream into the ether.  You should learn how to express yourself.

It's got to be able to speak truth to power, but somehow independent, fair, and free.

Transcript:  It's supposed to be.  And I guess to some degree, PBS is more balanced than anything else.  Although if you watch, for instance, they have a nightly news hour, the PBS News Hour,  the sponsors of which are all major US corporations.  So do they have influence?  Well, there have been some studies that say PBS only brings on spokespeople from major US corporations  or think tanks funded by major US corporations.  The influence of big business on the public discourse in the US is absolutely outsized.

Start time: 3415.51
End time: 3495.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is. From what I hear, yes.  I think that that is also the case here, but from a different standpoint.  I think that essentially it boils down a lot of time to money and privilege  and where you were educated.  Because if you look at a lot of the large media companies in Britain, some of them are owned by American giants.  Channel 5, for instance, one of the main terrestrial broadcasters in the UK, is owned by,  I can't remember who owns it now, but it's definitely a US owned.  Channel 4 has been in talks to be taken private because that was set up in part to be a free service  that basically makes the content that no other broadcaster would make.  It's one of the reasons it's quite unusual, never the most popular, but always...  Paramount owns Channel 5.  There you go. So Paramount owns that in the UK as well.  And then on the other side, you've got an establishment like the BBC  that always kind of tends to be run and influenced by people who have large political sway.  They don't have advertising. Product placement is illegal.  Things like that make the British landscape different, but it is equally influenced, I think, by a different type of power,  but it's probably equal in size.

Transcript:  Leo, we had this discussion in the United States not too long ago because we have PBS,  and PBS is still the most unbiased news source in our country.  I think that's fair. Yes.  I think that's fair to say. Yes.  And remember, I remember there was one time where they had Archer Daniel Midland as the main sponsor of PBS News.  Big agriculture. Big ag.  And they were doing stories about what ADM was doing wrong and illegally.  I'm like, okay, I like that. I'd love to hear that.  But what was it? Two years ago, PBS ran a series about, I don't even remember what it was,  but it was a darling of the MAGA community, and there was this huge campaign,  defund PBS, take away tax dollars from this woke narrative.  And the thing is, PBS had to remind them, we're supported by sponsors.  We don't take your tax dollars.  But even that became part of the anger machine of, oh, see, the liberals have invaded PBS,  which used to be a neutral news source.  And it's like, well, I mean, PBS is at a crossroads now.  They see where this is going.  They're going to lose corporate support. They're going to lose public support.  And they're going to cease to be a voice in the news, which they desperately need to be.  So what's the other option?  Take corporate money, take more corporate money,  take the corporate money that will actually have conditions on what they can report on the news.  And there's no good solution for us right now.

Transcript:  Yeah. I just I think it's a warning sign.  Democracies do not flourish if there isn't a free press.  Moving on. Let's move on from media because we've been talking about that a lot.  Let's talk about Apple. Apple is telling developers.  You know, when I first saw this headline, I thought, oh, good news that they're going to pull apps  that are out of date that are old from the app store.  But now I'm starting to think maybe this isn't such a good plan.  There are certainly a lot of apps in the Apple store that haven't been updated in years.  Some of them don't work properly, but they're not all abandoned.  Where developers are starting to say, wait a minute, you mean I have to update my app  even though it doesn't need it just to keep it on the app store.  This is especially true of games.  Here's a proto pop games tweet.  I feel sick. Apple just sent me an email saying they're removing my free game.  Motivoto, because it's more than two years old.  That's not fair. It doesn't need to be updated and people still download it.

Start time: 3654.48
End time: 3697.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think there should be a simple solution to this, which is it's a check in.  Like, hey, you know your app's still live, right?  You still happy with it? Any changes to make?  Maybe force just to check that it still works like an approval process, but on a diluted level.  And that's it. It doesn't need to be updated.  It's kind of like a news story. You have published on, updated on, and that's quite helpful.  Do that with apps. Published on, most recent date.  Validated, checked for compatibility on such and such a date.  Why shouldn't that be a problem? I 100% agree with it. It's ridiculous.  It should not be pulled.  Yeah, I'm 100% with this developer on this one.

Start time: 3698.44
End time: 3724.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I also feel like it's not like a one size fits all kind of an issue.  And I think that's part of it too.  If there's a game that people love and it's still working properly and it's still functioning and people are still playing it,  that's very different than, I don't know, maybe an email app or something that isn't being maintained and isn't working  or might have like a bug in it or something like that.  So I do think that one size fits all approach is going to be difficult to apply here.

Transcript:  This is part of Apple's problem is that the success of the App Store has been so huge and there are so many apps in there.  You want to, I can understand the desire to clean up the App Store to prune out the weeds, but you just can't at scale.  You know, you have to make arbitrary rules like, well, if it hasn't been updated in two years, it must be out of date.  Costa Eliftheriu, who's been very critical of the App Store, he wrote a program called Flick Type Keyboard,  which was a keyboard for the watch designed for visually impaired users.  He says Apple removed it because it hadn't been updated in two years.  Meanwhile, games like Pocket God have not been updated by the developers for seven years, but they're still on the App Store.  So but I think those are the kinds of things that are going to happen at this scale.  It's very difficult.  Go ahead, Nathan.

I'm sorry.

Start time: 3859.40
End time: 3937.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, no, I was just going to say, you know, it's one thing if an app is in danger of possibly not working anymore because it hasn't been updated in seven years.  Maybe, you know, if it hasn't been updated that long, there's a chance it won't, you know, this is just a hypothetical scenario.  But I can see Apple doing that if there's a chance it wouldn't be supported by the next version of iOS or something like that.  You know, I think Apple has part of why it's so strict in its policies is because it doesn't want you to have to sift through all of these apps that don't work or don't function properly.  Like when you go to the app store, there's a certain level of trust in whatever you download is going to run smoothly and it's designed and optimized for these devices.  So I get that Apple really wants to crack down on making sure developers keep up and keep their apps updated.  But going back to what Nate was saying, you know, there's bigger problems.  Obviously, you know, copycat apps and clone apps are a much bigger issue.  But I think it all falls under that same umbrella of, you know, there is a certain level of trust.  But at what cost does that come to the developer community, too?  I mean, you know, developers have not been that happy with Apple over the past couple of years.  And I think, you know, that's also part of, you know, this is just kind of adding fuel to the fire in that regard.  But but yeah, that's all I was going to add.

But I do agree that it would be nice if there were more tools built into these operating systems that helped you realize like what's on your phone and how old some of those apps might be.  Because even as a tech journalist, I have so many apps on my phone that I don't use or maybe I downloaded them once for a specific story that I was working on.  And then I forgot about him. So it's it's a lot.  It's it's a burden on people to do that themselves.  So I would love to see more of that in iOS and Android updates.

In fact, I'm going to put you to work in a second, Lisa, because there are rumors.  There are rumors floating around.  And I mean around. But first, a word from Audible.  We love Audible. Audible has been a sponsor for our shows for I think more than a decade.  Just the best place to get audio entertainment, whether it's audio books, performances, best sellers to celebrity memoirs, mysteries, thrillers, motivation.  The Audible app makes it easy to listen anytime, anywhere.  You'll discover exclusive Audible originals from top celebrities, renowned experts, exciting new voices in the audio.  You can listen to Audible while traveling, working out.  I kind of miss it. I used to have, I've been an Audible member since 2000, 22 years now.  I used to listen when I commuted into San Francisco to Tech TV.  And I kind of miss it because I would get a couple of hours at least, sometimes as much as three or four hours a day in the car,  listening to great audio literature, audio books.  I'm going to make a recommendation because I'm listening to, maybe you know this one, Father Robert, you know the Bobaverse?  I love the Bobaverse.  I love, I love the Bobaverse.  The Bobaverse, the premise of the Bobaverse is fascinating.  It's a Neumann probe.  The idea is this guy, Bob, Bob Johansson, very successful game developer,  signs a contract to have his head frozen, you know, just in case, because he just sold his company, he's got extra money.  He's in Vegas for a trade show, signs the contract, and I don't think it's a spoiler because it happens in the first five pages,  gets killed immediately, run over by a car, his head is frozen.  The next thing he knows, he wakes up a hundred years later and he's got no body.  He's an artificial intelligence made out of his brain.  And he goes, and the story is fantastic.  He replicates himself.  They go out, explore the universe.  They meet alien civilizations.  They meet hostile aliens.  There's space warfare.  There's also a lot of humor in it.  And you've got to listen to it because Ray Porter reads it.  He's the guy who did The Martian.  You'll recognize his voice.  Mr. Johansson, it's Bob.  Please. You're not talking to my father.  I love his delivery.  That's what's so cool about audiobooks from Audible.  They, you're not reading them.  You're listening to them.  They're performances.  And they are so great.  Audible includes thousands of podcasts for popular favorites and exclusive news series.  That, by the way, the Bobbaverse is an Audible exclusive.  It wasn't slated for an audiobook.  So Audible brought them in and got Ray to do it and recorded it.  All four volumes, a fifth volume is on the way.  Audible gives members a chance to listen to and discover new favorites and explore different formats.  Part of what makes your membership so much more valuable.  Things like the exclusive words plus music series or maybe a podcast you never thought of or considered before.  Even theatrical performances.  Now, as an Audible member, you could choose a title a month to keep from there.  To keep, I should say.  I should emphasize. To keep.  I have been a member for 22 years.  I have more than, I think I'm up to 600 in my library.  And I go back. When Dune came out, I thought, I'm going to re-listen to Dune.  I'll go back and listen to them again.  They're yours as long as you're a member.  To keep in your catalog the best sellers, the new releases.  You can download them. You can stream them.  You can listen anywhere on any time on any device.  I even listen on my Amazon Echo.  I just say Echo, read to me and it'll pick up where I left off.  Which is awesome.  I'm listening in the car. I get home. I say, read to me. It'll pick up right where I left off.  2022 is all about celebrating our newfound self-awareness, making positive change.  Audible helps make space for what matters to you.  It's a destination, not just for entertainment, but for wellness.  Whether you're looking to soul search, be inspired, work toward new goals, unwind or simply be entertained.  Audible can make you happy. It'll certainly make you smile or cry or sigh.  It's got it all. You'll find the best of what you love or something new to discover.  If you want to try it, new members can try Audible for 30 days free.  Which, by the way, with the new Audible originals, means lots of listening.  Hundreds and hundreds of volumes you can listen to.  Download the Audible app. Get started with a free trial.  Audible, A-U-D-I-B-L-A dot com slash twit.  That Audible Plus catalog is a huge boon and you can listen all you want.  Or you can text twit to 500-500. A-U-D-I-B-L-A, Audible dot com slash twit.

Transcript:  Tennessee Taylor, Andy Weir, and Daniel Suarez.  Project Hail Mary is incredible. Highly recommend that.  And of course Daniel's a friend of the... both, all three of them.  Well, I don't know, I don't know if Tennessee Taylor yet.  I hope to make a friend of him, but both Andy Weir and Daniel Suarez have been on the show.  And Ray Porter reads Project Hail Mary in that same kind of great style.  Wonderful, wonderful.  Or you can get it in Spanish and then Raul Lorenz will read it for you.  So either way, proyecto Hail Mary.  All right, here it comes. The round pixel watch.  Now Lisa, tell me, Google filing a trademark application for the words pixel watch,  does that confirm this watch or is it...  I mean, maybe they don't want anybody else to call it a pixel watch.

Start time: 4687.92
End time: 4852.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think you're right.  Like it doesn't confirm anything yet.  They could just be doing it because they don't want anyone else using that branding,  although I don't think anyone would because it would probably make things really confusing.  But I don't think it confirms anything, but we've been hearing so many reports that Google,  you know, for years, not even just recently, but for years,  we've been hearing that Google has been working on its own smartwatch.  And by we, I'm talking about the collective news cycle and the rumors and reports  that have been floating around for years, not anything that I'm specifically aware of  or anything like that.  But we have been hearing more reports recently and one of which I think one of the most detailed ones  came from Insider.  I believe it might have been December.  I'd have to double check.  But that report had a lot of details actually written by one of my former colleagues  since I used to work there.  Yu Langley, my former colleague at Insider,  wrote this great report about how Google was working on a pixel watch.  And it'll probably have, I think that report mentioned things like the design possibly being round,  which wouldn't be very surprising because I think all Android Wear watches are round.  I'd have to double check that, but I'm pretty sure they all have that round design.  I think you're right.  Yeah.  I haven't seen a square one, but again, I could be misremembering.  Fossil might make one, but I think they're round.  Yeah.  But yeah, and that report mentioned a bunch of things that we would expect,  like health tracking features and things like that.  But there's also a bunch of things that you can kind of assume would be on a Google smartwatch.  If Google did make a smartwatch, like integration with Fitbit seems pretty logical,  the latest version of Wear OS.  But I think to me, what would stand out the most is Google has done a really great thing with its pixel phones  in that it kind of has a lot of software features that make it stand out.  And that's a hard thing to do in a space like the smartphone market that's already pretty crowded  and pretty dominated by Apple and Samsung.  But I really like the way Google thinks about taking care of some of those inconveniences  that we experience on our phones sometimes, like having the Google Assistant screen calls for you  and things like that, or estimating wait times, how long you'll be on hold, things like that.  So I'm personally hoping that we see some version of that in a Google smartwatch.  I don't know what it would be, but really thinking about how to improve the way we use these devices.  And I think that's one thing that we've seen from Google that is pretty unique.  So I hope that carries over to the Pixel Watch, if it is in fact real, of course.

Transcript:  One of the things you told me in your article, and I have forgotten this, Google's never made a watch.

Start time: 4859.12
End time: 4913.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't have their own consumer watch yet.  And that's the thing. It's kind of similar to what the smartphone market was like for Google  before it came out with its Pixel phones.  I mean, it had its Nexus phones for a while, but those weren't really as popular.  But Google was still so influential, obviously, because it's the operator of Android.  So it has this really huge presence in the mobile space.  But it's also a competitor.  It's weird in that it has to partner with the companies that it competes with.  And that would be the case for smartwatches, too.  And I think that would be a challenge for Google.  If it does release a Pixel Watch, it will have to obviously promote that while also working with Samsung,  which would then be one of its competitors, and then also differentiate its own watch from Fitbit's watches.  So there's a lot going on there. So it could cause some confusion.

Start time: 4913.64
End time: 4931.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It kind of makes sense because Google bought Fitbit.  They still release Fitbits, but they're not under the Google brand.  They might want to brand a Pixel Watch.  Do you think that this is the Pixel Watch, the one that was left behind in a restaurant?

Transcript:  You know, I actually haven't seen that. I don't know.  It looks like the renders.  It does look like the renders, but who knows if that's even legitimate.  Who knows how old it is or if that was even meant to be something that would even be a final version of it.  There's a lot of questions. We won't really know until Google comes out and says it.

Transcript:  The problem is if you're an Apple user, you're going to end up using an Apple Watch.  Correct.  And if you're an Android user, you're probably a Samsung user, so you're going to use a Samsung Watch.

Start time: 5022.44
End time: 5066.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that's the thing here too. The Android space is more fragmented. Just like you kind of mentioned right now, there is no just one answer to the Apple Watch on the Android side of things.  There's choice, right? There's Samsung. There's Fitbit, which works across both. There's Fossil.  So I think Google has an opportunity like we were just talking about to say, hey, this is the ideal Android smartwatch experience.  Just like the pixels kind of become a blueprint for what Android smartphones could be, a Pixel Watch might do that for Android smartwatches.  So I'm very interested to see what Google does with this, especially since it's pretty late to the game at this point compared to the rest of the industry.

Start time: 5068.16
End time: 5099.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Question to you, which is so with the other Pixel products, Google has always tried to fill in something that they feel is missing.  Like the products don't get right. So with the phones, it was like you need to have better screens and faster processors.  With the Chromebooks, it was you need a premium Chromebook, no more of this $50 to $200 stuff. And they proved that that could work.  So what does Google think is missing in the in the Android Watch arena?  What are the features that it wants to include and inspire the other manufacturers to put in?

Start time: 5100.48
End time: 5149.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's what we're hoping to see. I mean, it's hard. I can't answer that question for Google.  But what I'm hoping to see is, I guess I think a lot of it's going to come down to the software, honestly.  But again, that's a tricky question because how much of it is going to be specific to the Pixel Watch if there is a Pixel Watch?  And how much of that is just going to be part of whatever the next version of Wear OS is that would come to Samsung smartwatches and fossil smartwatches and presumably other companies that partner with Google?  So I think that's going to continue to be the challenge is again, like having Google say like, hey, this is what we feel like needs to be done better.  And we're doing that on our product versus how much does it also share with the rest of the industry?  So I'm curious to see how they strike that balance.

Start time: 5150.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a tough job because Apple is so dominant. And then if they're not, like I said, Samsung is.  What could you do that Apple and Samsung don't do? Well, good battery life might be something that would help.  Yeah, absolutely.  More than one day battery life.

Start time: 5167.66
End time: 5183.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Fitbit already does that really well too, at least compared to Apple and Samsung.  So I hope that Google gets some inspiration from Fitbit, which they now own.  But yeah, I mean, battery life is definitely a big part of that for sure.

Start time: 5184.66
End time: 5210.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's so much parity. I have both the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4 and an Apple Watch Series 6.  And there's so much parity between them for activity, heart rate, sleep monitoring.  I mean, it's hard to imagine what you're missing, except the things that Apple has historically not been able to do.  No one's been able to do things like blood sugar monitoring and blood pressure, which is both of which are very hard to do.  Some watches claim blood pressure.

Start time: 5211.86
End time: 5258.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think a lot of it's going to come down to how they decide to show that information.  And I mean, Google, you were asking what can they possibly do differently?  What can they bring to this that Apple and Samsung haven't already done yet?  One thing that I would personally like to see is we have so many health metrics now that can be measured on our wrist.  And you just mentioned some of the ones that we can't measure yet, which is probably a good thing because I think having...  I have a lot of opinions on having access to that kind of data from home.  And on one side, it's great that you can learn more about your health.  On the other side, without the context of a doctor, I kind of worry about having all that information at our fingertips.  But I honestly think that companies can be doing a lot more to make this data useful to us.

Transcript:  Samsung promised the Google Assistant on their watch. They still haven't done it.  Maybe that's something. I mean, I guess.

Start time: 5268.84
End time: 5310.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope so. I mean, I think there's a big opportunity for Google to really prove how useful the Assistant can be on smartwatches  because theoretically, the Google Assistant is in so many different products.  I don't find myself using it that often on phones.  But I use Siri on my Apple Watch all the time because it's such a small screen. I don't really want to type on it.  I don't want to really navigate the watch that much using swipes, like for short things and short interactions.  Absolutely. But if I want to quickly set a timer or check the weather or something like that, I use Siri all the time for things like that.  So I think Google has a big opportunity to really show what the Assistant can do on a Pixel Watch.

Start time: 5313.29
End time: 5322.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Interesting. Yeah, you're right.  We don't have the Assistant on any of these watches yet, do we? Does MoMA do it? Does Fossil do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is on some smartwatches, I believe. But I do think that it was promised to come to the Samsung Galaxy Watch 4.  And I don't think it's come out yet. I'd have to double check, but I don't think it has.

Transcript:  In fact, I think Samsung's, if they're not putting it off forever, they're delaying it significantly.  Yeah, all right. I mean, it shows you that Google still has some mindshare that people are even talking about this.  Somebody in the chat room says, any Google watch should have the feature that Google releases it, then kills it a month later.  They'd be competing with the KIN and QWIBI and CNN Plus for the quickest death.

It's a weird, not exactly hybrid, slightly hybrid event, mostly online, but there'll be a few people at the event, mostly developers and Google employees.  Would that be where they would announce it?  Prosser, who said they would announce it in May, is now backing backtracking and saying he's one of the big Google pixel rumors, rumor guys.  He actually does Apple rumors, too.  He's now saying they'll show it or talk about it at Google IO, but won't release it till October.  That seems like a stupid plan.

Let's see. Speaking of Google, Vice had a great article on Google's AI powered inclusive warnings feature.  This is a part of kind of a grammar checker that's rolling out this month for Google Docs.  And of course, Vice having some fun with it.  For instance, one of their motherboard senior staff writers typed annoyed.  Google suggested angry or upset, which is not a good replacement for annoyed.  Then social editor Emily Lipstein typed in motherboard, as in the name of this website, into a document.  Google said, you're being insensitive.  Using the word motherboard.  Some of these words may not be inclusive to all readers.  Consider using different words.  Then another person, a journalist, Rebecca Baird-Remba, tweeted that she got the warning on the word landlord,  which Google said you should say property owner or proprietor.  Maybe this isn't going to be. Well, you know, they're working on it.  Let's say they're working on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I am not so much interested in the whole inclusive language grammar check.  As I am in the technology that they're using to do this, my understanding is this isn't just a find and trigger.  Is it GPT?  This is actual context analysis.  And if it is that, that would be a great hook because right now I'm paying Amazon for context analysis.  And that's expensive. If Google could give me a product, I would definitely try it.

Transcript:  That is interesting.  I've used that on not this and not for quite some time now, but a script that picked out language in job specs and in adverts or jobs to try and make sure that you weren't using language and keywords and phrasing that could put off a more diverse pool of candidates for a position.  And there was a really interesting study done, which I don't have to hand because it's only just come back to my mind.  I'm sure you can be Googled a study done about inclusive language within the world of job applications.  And actually, you get a much richer or can get a much richer workforce by tuning the language used in your job in your job specs.  And I've used that before. How effective that is long term is hard to measure, at least from my perspective.  I do think that there's a kernel of validity in some of these things that can be can be helpful, perhaps not quite to this level.  But sometimes.

And she appreciates it when they when they reminds her, you know, you got to be nice.  Sometimes you got to be nice.  Craziness going on in the world of travel after a judge in Florida lifted the CDC's requirement for masks on airplanes and on buses and on trains.  Uber went along and lifted the mask mandate for drivers and riders.  I'm curious since we've got people all over the world here, you know, here in California, I just went yesterday.  We had our big for the first time since the pandemic, our big parade and celebration.  It's called Butter and Eggs Day. And it's a heart attack in the making.  But it's a lot of fun. And I went downtown and we watched the parade and the cutest little chicken town contest.  No masks, no social distancing.  People were so happy to get outside and party and have fun.  And it was as if it was like two years ago.  And I'm just curious, Nate, what's it like in the UK right now?  Here in the United States, there seems to be a growing, regardless of what's happening with COVID, a growing desire to say, Chuck it all and go back to the way it used to be.

So they just stuck to it. And now and now infection rates are falling again.  But it's been a long time since I felt pressure to wear a mask.

And so out of Italy got hit so hard early on.  Right. We were the first in the Western world to get hit.  We got hit so hard and people learned from that.

The one place you definitely continue to see them a lot is the subway, of course.  You know, every pretty much everyone on the subway is wearing a mask.  There'll be a couple of people that might not have one, but I feel like that's usually the exception for the most part.  But I mean, indoors restaurants, things like that, like, you know, people used to at least kind of walk in with their mask on and then take it down.  But now I think people are, for the most part, just, you know, not really wearing them as much indoors and restaurants, at least from what I've observed.

Transcript:  One of the things that's that's happened over the last couple of days that's got a lot of people very annoyed here is the emphasis on a certain lawmaker in our conservative government here who so badly wants every civil servant to be back in the office that he printed out a very, very passive, aggressive,  letter and left it on their desk saying, sorry, I missed you.  I hope see you back at your desk.  Oh, geez.  The gentleman who does this, his name is Jacob Rees-Mogg.  I will I will bite my tongue in the interest of not, you know, making a fool out of myself.  But just Google it.  Have a look at it.  It's he he is the sort of person you would expect to do something like this.  The fact that he's done something like this has made a lot of people just facepalm so hard.  But it goes back.  And this then the tech angle here is about working from home and about how effective can people be when your office job is a desk job.  How effective can you still be having two years of experience doing those jobs remotely?  And the answer is for I think many people very effective.  So these kind of passive aggressive ways of trying to get people back into the office when they're very happy and very potentially efficient doing their jobs from home one or two days a week.  It's just it's very offensive.  And a lot of a lot of people in the public over the weekend have been really quite angry about this.

Transcript:  There's a balance that we have to strike.  There are definitely some work spaces that need at least a minimum of interaction between people.  It does help in the creative process.  It helps in sorting things out quickly.  However, office managers have to come to grips with the fact that we've proven that they're useless in any situations that employees work much better.  When they don't have an office manager hovering over their shoulder that they'll get as much or more done on their own.  So now the question becomes, all right, what are we paying people for?  Are we paying them to fill a space at a desk?  Are we paying them for productivity?  Are we paying them to be part of a team in which they collaborate and cooperate with their fellow workers?  I think this is going to shake out well.

And it's going to, in the long run, have a beneficial effect that this industrial era mentality of sitting at a desk nine to five Monday through Friday.  I think that's almost over.

Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to mention, aside from more flexibility in terms of where you're working, I do feel like the pandemic has raised awareness about burnout and the culture around burnout.  Because I think, you know, at first when we all started working from home, the opposite was happening, right?  Like your home, there's not much else to do because you can't really go anywhere.  And I think a lot of people probably ended up working more in the early days of the pandemic, especially us in the news industry for sure, because there was so much going on that we needed to be covering.  You know, I do think that it has brought up a good conversation around burnout and being aware, you know, having managers be aware of burnout and drawing that line between your personal and your work life when it all starts to kind of blend together as it has over the past couple of years.  I love it.

And I'm glad workers are standing up and saying, yeah, that's not okay.  We're not going to stand for this.  And I feel bad for the younger generation now, faced with jobs that are so pitifully paid and work so many hours that all they can basically do is work, eat, sleep.  They'll never own a home.  They'll never be able to put any money aside.  That's not right.  That's not how this is supposed to be.  And I, for one, would like to blame the oligarchs because they're doing just fine.

They are now starting to fence in people.  39 fatalities yesterday, bringing the total number of virus-related deaths to 87 since late February.  That doesn't sound like a lot, but the Chinese Communist Party's policy is zero COVID.  And they are anxious to have no COVID.  And so they are sealing up buildings, locking people in.  There's been food insecurity due to that.  And from our point of view, one of the concerns is many of the factories in Shanghai are shut down.  Some are saying the supply chain shortages we're currently experiencing will get nothing but worse due to this shutdown.  So I don't know whether it's merited.  The Chinese government had up to now done a very good job fighting COVID.  But it is a real problem right now for workers.

Wow, 25 million people in Shanghai all shut inside in their homes to prevent the spread of COVID.  Let's take a little break.  I hope you and your loved ones are well and surviving.  Our show today brought to you by Noom.  If you would like to start a healthier lifestyle, I know for me and Lisa, it's been a boon.  We love Noom.  Of course, one of the things I consider myself a diet expert.  I know I've knew them all, done them all.  But what I hadn't really considered is the psychology of eating.  And that's what Noom was so great for.  It's really not a diet.  Noom will head you on a path toward better health with a psychology based approach.  Changes the way you think about food, improves your understanding of why you eat, when you eat.  I, for example, and everybody's different, but I am a fog eater.  I will eat unconsciously.  And Noom helped me become more conscious about my eating, chewing, putting down my fork, turning off the TV, turning off the phone while I eat to really enjoy my food.  And you know what? I enjoy it more and I eat less.  Noom's psychological approach is based on scientific principles like cognitive behavioral therapy.  CBT really works.  It helps you understand your relationship with food and then build sustainable habits that last a lifetime.  One of the things that surprised me about Noom when I first started, and I've been doing it for about a year, is they said there's no bad foods.  We don't demonize food.  It's not about there's bad foods and good foods.  That's not what this is all about.  Noom doesn't believe in restricting what you can or cannot eat.  It just helps you know better what you're doing so you're doing it consciously and kind of almost magically.  You lose weight, you get healthier, you get more fit.  Noom understands that building these long term positive habits is hard.  It can be filled with ups and downs.  They say it's not about perfection.  It's about progress.  Everybody's journey looks different.  With Noom, you get an app.  You can track everything you're eating and drinking and all the exercise you're doing.  You get coaching from Noom just a few minutes every day to learn these good habits.  You also get a personal coach and you get a group that you're in it together.  All of that really helps.  Noom is grounded in science.  It's the heart of everything they do.  In fact, they take this so seriously.  Obviously, they've published more than 30 peer reviewed scientific articles that inform users  but also practitioners and scientists and the public about how the methods work and how well they work.  And I can tell you, Lisa and I both love Noom.  It's really changed our lifestyle.  I started doing it and she said, oh, I'm going to do it to support you, which was really nice.  We've been eating that way and eating really right for a year now and it's been so great.  Our son has lost weight too.  Joining us on this Noom journey, it's incredible.  And you don't have to worry about things like, I always hate diets because one bad day, one day off  and oh, it's all over and you throw it in.  Not with Noom.  They help you get back on track.  There are no bad days.  You decide how Noom weight fits into your life, not the other way around.  You can spend five, 10, 15 minutes a day reading.  That's up to you.  There's always extra if you want.  It changes how I shop.  It changes how I look at food, how I think about it.  And it really, the best thing for me is, and this is personal, this is about me, but if I saw food, I would eat it.  If there's food on the counter, if there's food in our kitchen here at work, I will eat it.  There's been treats sitting on that counter at work.  There's always treats.  There's candy, there's cakes.  And I feel really good.  I don't have to force myself.  I just have the knowledge.  I go, oh yeah, you're going to fog eat.  Go ahead, put that in your mouth.  Go ahead.  So when I do eat it, it's conscious and it's a decision.  It's incredible.  Start building better habits today.  We are huge fans of Noom.  It's been really good for us.  Many of the people we know have started doing it as a result.  Sign up for your trial.  Noom, N-O-O-M, N-O-O-M.com slash twit.  When you first sign up, there's a questionnaire that is the beginning of the process.  You're going to really learn about what your relationship is to food.  Just even that by itself is great.  N-O-O-M.com slash twit to sign up for your trial.  Noom.com slash twit.  Feel better, have more energy, look better, be more confident.  And for me, the most important part was this struggle that I have always had with eating and dieting and weight.  Just has disappeared.  No more struggle.  I love that.  If it were just that, that alone would be enough.  Noom.com slash twit.  Thank you from the bottom of my heart.  Thank you, Noom.  And Lisa, thanks, you too.  Okay, let's get back to these stories.

You know, because you just don't unconsciously put something in your mouth.  You have to write it down.  I have mixed feelings about this.  I'm a great friend with Kevin Rose.  I love Kevin Rose.  He has gotten together with People, the digital artist, Gary Vaynerchuk.  They created a company called the Proof Collective.  And they designed 10,000 cartoon owls, 1,000 NFT collectors, some of the biggest names in NFTs.  They initially...  Maybe I'm just mad at Kevin because he didn't tell me when they launched.  I could have bought in at $7,900.  The minimum price now for one of these owls...  Remember, if you got in at the bottom, $7,900, $285,000.  And the owners of the 10,000 Moonbirds, $7,000 were given away for a raffle, $2,000 for members, and $125,000 for distribution by the Moonbird team.  They have sold hundreds of millions of dollars, $281 million in sales volume.  And Kevin and company, the founders of Proof Collective, have taken home $50 million.  And all they had to do was create some cartoon owls.  So I'm just curious.  Kevin made a video explaining, no, we're going to do something good with the money, really.  I'm just curious.  And I bring this up a lot.  No one has yet to convince me that this is anything but a speculative bubble.

It's a tulip.  It's worse than a tulip.  It's worse than a tulip.  It's worse than a tulip because people are buying these not because they love these owls.

The tweet doesn't go in your pocket.  It doesn't become part of your physical possessions.  You just have some tenuous link to it.  The guy who bought it, 2.9 million, hasn't been able to find a buyer for more than a few thousand.  So he's out almost three million dollars.

You have a tenuous grasp on the ownership of said thing, but no way to really enforce your ownership of said thing.  I mean, okay, I get it.  It is a speculative instrument, just like most everything in the financial world.  And if you can make money on it because someone else is willing to pay you for it, great.  Awesome.

Transcript:  It's a little telling.  The guy who bought Jack Dorsey's tweet when he bought it said, this is not just a tweet.  I think years later, people will realize the true value of this tweet, like the Mona Lisa painting.  That's the guy who wants to sell it.  And then a year later, he puts it up for auction.  Not a lot.  The highest bid, I don't know, I think $13,000, but I think it's even less.  And when you take out the gas fees, that's the other problem.  The people who are really making money on this are the people who are generating the NFT.  All right.  I don't want to pile on or anything.  I love Kevin Rose, but I am skeptical of all this.  And I will not be buying any bored owls or bored apes or zombies.  Do you have any NFTs, Lisa?  Did you buy buy in at the bottom?  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should.  It's the first episode of Modern Finance podcast.  He has an NFT guy on.  I think it's probably why Kevin ended up doing the Proof Collective.  At least with tulips, you got a bulb, right?  You don't this out of sync in the chat room saying, no, no, crypto is tulip bulbs.  NFTs are pictures of tulip bulbs.  I wouldn't even say NFTs are pictures of tulip bulbs.

Transcript:  And by the way, I should say Kevin bought advertising on Twitter for Modern Finance,  which, by the way, I still agree with.  It's a great podcast.  I think my problem is not if people who are in the crypto arena are buying this stuff,  fine.  You know what you're doing.  You're probably spending your Dogecoin that you only bought for pennies for it anyway,  right?  It's not like you're spending real money.  But where I draw the lines, we start to promote this to people who are not in the crypto  sphere.  And they have to because it's only worth something if they can get somebody to pay more for it.  So all of this enthusiasm, all of this excitement, all of this excitement, all of this excitement,  all of this excitement, all these people saying it's the next big thing.  What they're really saying is please buy this thing I bought that isn't worth anything  unless you buy it for more than I paid for it.  And that's what bothers me.  So I kind of want to keep hitting this because I want people who are on the fence or saying,  oh, that's interesting, or maybe there's something there or being persuaded by all the crypto  bros who say this is the greatest thing since life spreads, going to change the world, to  think twice a little bit because there is no, I don't, there's no inherent value.

And I think the wording was something like, if you're seeing ads for Bitcoin on the tube,  it's time to buy.  They got in trouble for it and had to pull the ads.  And it was really interesting because actually, if you're seeing ads for Bitcoin on the tube,  chances are it's probably a good time to sell.  Exactly.  And I don't think the irony of that was lost on the regulators who said, you can't put  this ad on, for that exact reason.  Because it's disingenuous at best, and it is repugnant at worst, getting people to think  that it's an investment when it's speculation and it's gambling.  Yeah.  Oh, well.

Transcript:  So she designed a tool to twist the Oreo.  You know, it's an Oreo stress rheometer.  R-H-E-O-M-E-T-E-R.  It twists the fluid between parallel disks in order to measure its viscosity.  She had an epiphany looking, staring at her rheometer.  Said, oh, wait a minute.  I could use that to study Oreo breakage.  As you do.  As one does.  So I proposed my idea to my research advisor and the project was born.  Turns out Oreos are a canonical example of parallel plate rheometry.  The cookies are an everyday tri-layer laminate composite.  The cream is the fluid sample and the two wafers are the parallel plates.  Counter-rotating the wafers, that's what you just did, Robert,  causes the cream to shear and flow before fracturing as the two wafers come apart.  But your results are completely contrary to the results of the study because...  Shall we try again?  Yeah, do another one.

Transcript:  Counter-clockwise.  I feel like I should be doing a drum roll.  That one?  No.  You know, you have special Vatican Oreos.  That's...  There's something...  She said, I had in my mind if you twist the Oreos perfectly, as Robert just did,  you should split the cream perfectly in the middle.  But what actually happens, contrary to our own research, I might point out,  is the cream almost always comes off on one side.  The cream distribution is not affected by rotation rate, the amount of cream filling or the flavor.  They got double stuff.  They got all kinds of flavors.  They tried it all different ways with the rheometer.  She does say the rotation rate does play an important role  in whether or not the cookies break apart cleanly.  If you try to twist the Oreos faster...  You can do another one, Robert.  Try it fast.  Okay.  It actually takes more...  It's harder the faster you twist.  So if you're stressed and desperate to open your cookie, do it a little slower.  Oh, no.  Geez Louise.  These are defective Oreos.

With your own empirical results, just as the Vatican and the Jesuits have always been known to do,  you have completely destroyed...  It's what we do.  It's what you do, the scientific paper, with your own investigation.  But by the way, if you want to do the studies at home, they have open sourced their 3D printed Oreo meter.

If you want to buy some silly owls, fine.  Go right ahead.  Stock trading can be fun.  It's like, as you said, it's like gambling.  But the thrill of risky and all is best enjoyed in moderation like casino gambling and eating street food.  If you're playing the market, I hope for your sake you're stashing some safer money in a place like Wealthfront.  Wealthfront is not day trading.  Wealthfront is a way to invest using well researched, proven methodologies to build your wealth.  Wealthfront has a ton of data to show that time in the market almost always beats timing the market.  So they offer globally diversified portfolios, automatically optimized to hit the goals you set and the risk level you choose.  In fact, if you don't even want to answer those questions, you can do it completely automatically.  Or maybe you'd like to personalize your portfolio.  You can see I'm doing this right now on the website with a selection of funds handpicked by Wealthfront's financial experts and social responsibility.  Yeah, you can get into crypto this way, but this is a little bit better way to get into crypto or clean energy or cannabis even emerging markets.  You get to choose.  But the point of it is that you're going to have, again, a globally diversified portfolio optimized to hit the goals you set.  You get automatic tax breaks to boost your returns.  In fact, they call it tax loss harvesting.  And they actually invented Wealthfront, actually invented the software to do this.  The best robo advisor for 2022, according to Vestopedia.

Transcript:  Well, I think the argument is that if the way that it's written is basically if you're stuck in traffic on a motorway on a highway and you're going very, very, very slowly, then it's OK.  Or rather, then it will be OK because they want to make sure that you're able to take the wheel if you need to really quickly.  And having a phone in your hand means you may be impaired at doing that quickly.  I think also the argument is maybe that if you're looking at it on the screen, then you're paying attention to something the car can alert you on as well.  That's right.  Obviously what happened on a phone.  So there are there is some logic to it.  And the other thing that came out as part of the same announcement, though, is that if a if a self driving vehicle causes an accident, then it is on the insurer to pay.  Not the driver, not the manufacturer.  Interesting.  Yeah. So a lot of the questions are now going to be, well, what insurer is going to get to insure a self driving car if they know that if it if it has a problem, it's on them to pay up.  So it's quite interesting.

Here comes the car.  Whoops.  Oh, it's actually turning turning the jet around.  And he doesn't stop until he maybe the owner is coming along to stop it.  He's using something I had on my Tesla for three years and never dared to use the summon feature where you press a button and the Tesla slowly drives to come and get you.  I never trusted it.

Transcript:  Actually, the National Highway Transportation and Safety Administration is investigating now officially as of this week, Tesla's auto autopilot software to see whether it's safe.  They've actually launched two formal investigations into it.  Let's see the count.  I don't have any more details than that, but they are launching the investigation.  We'll keep an eye on that.  I don't know if I think honestly, in this case, it's the driver who's responsible if you're using FSD to keep his eyes out for any issues and to take control if there are issues.  Right.  It's not self driving really.  Well, the name does say full self driving.  If you thought spam was getting better, you are wrong.  Spam.  Americans, according to Axios, are drowning in spam, not just spam email, but spam text messaging, which has now outpaced spam robo calls.  As of last month, there were 7.6 billion spam phone calls in the US, 11.7 billion spam text messages.  And I have to tell you, I'm not surprised because I get calls all the time from very nice people, usually older people, saying, why are they sending me text messages about porn all the time and how do I stop it?

Start time: 8373.06
End time: 8392.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I wonder, I feel like a lot of this is probably because a lot of the tech companies have made tools for filtering robo calls over the past few years.  Like that technology has gotten better.  So I feel like a lot of these scammers are now turning to text messages to do that because it just hasn't caught up as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and the FCC has kind of delayed the implementation of the technology that's supposed to stop spam texts and spam phone calls.  The shirk shirt stirred and shaken framework.  They allowed the big companies are all doing it, but they can allow through calls from small companies until the end of I think it's the end of May.  Companies, small phone companies with no facilities will have to use stir and shake and to authenticate, which means a phone company say, if you don't say who this is from, we're not going to take it.  That will do a lot to stop this.  And then I think at the end of the year, come small phone companies that have facilities like buildings will have to stop.  So I think what's also happening is this is a last I'm hoping anyway, this is the last gasp for spam texts, because as soon as stir and shaken is implemented, AT&T, T-Mobile, Verizon can and should legally say, you know, unless you say who you are, and you can identify that authenticate that we're not going to accept that.  I think that'll solve it. I hope.

Additional salt.  I think you got to make these.  Researchers in Japan have developed a set of electric chopsticks.  They're attached to a wristband computer.  It uses electrical stimulation to transmit sodium ions from the food to the eater's mouth.  This is according to Meiji University Professor Home Miyashita, who developed the chopsticks with Kirin, who, of course, makes food, soy sauce.  I think there's Kirin beer.  By the way, this is not his first time to this rodeo, if that's what you call it.  He's the guy who designed the lickable TV.  Yes, not great.  That would let you taste whatever you see on the screen.  The chopsticks do require you to wear, at least in this first iteration, a little wrist computer.  Researchers say that chopsticks can enhance the perceived saltiness of foods one and a half times.  So, you know, it could be a lifesaver.  It certainly is birth control.  So either way, you're ahead.  And on that note...  I would be willing to test those.  I love salt.  I love salt.  I'm not supposed to have it, but I love salt.  All right, let's do it.
