Transcript:  Is that right? Yeah exactly yeah we don't really cover western Europe either. It's not the only  other exception no offense to my fellow Europeans here. But Latin America, the Middle East, Asia,  that kind of thing. Yeah I would say east of the Balkans too is fair game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  well it's sort of also sometimes Australia has broken out but it's also sort of just based  about where we saw there wasn't a lot of coverage. There's some coverage in China I would say there's  some pretty good coverage in India but there's a lot of places that are just not covered at all  especially when it comes to tech so that was sort of our mission. I love it. Where can we

Transcript:  his wife likes it which is that's great. She does. Ringing endorsement.  Right. So this is an interesting week because you know in Great Britain you guys are trying to figure  out where you're going to get your ham from. Here in America we've got a new ham in the White House  so it's all very confusing but there is some tech news and we're going to stay with that instead of  the political news this week which is nice because honestly it's been pretty political for the last  few months because there's been this intersection of tech and I think it's going to get that way  again because we're in a moment of a pause but I think the prosecution by the FTC and antitrust  prosecutions of Google and Facebook are about to get back underway once you know everything else  settles. They're not off the hook by any means. Do you agree this is not something that  is going to be dropped? Not in the EU either right? I don't think so. Certainly doesn't seem that.

Start time: 444.58
End time: 501.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Go ahead Patrick. Go ahead. It certainly seems that like there is something to be discussed  and fixed and legislated and a few things actually. The difference is now we're probably  going to be able to understand what is being said and why these things are being said most  of the time but yeah I don't think the discussion is going to end because of the change of the  administration. There are new problems that have arisen in the past decade I would say and those  need new societal consensus and discussion and probably some form of legislation and that's I  don't think that's a bad thing. We need to understand the issues and get on the same page  on how to deal with them and there are many of them. Europeans seem more willing perhaps to

Start time: 501.54
End time: 515.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  regulate big tech here in the US because they're American companies for one thing.  There's a bit of division of opinion on this. Louise, where do you come down on this?

Start time: 516.48
End time: 588.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah I think the question is are we going to see meaningful discussion of this? I think there's a  lot of new stories and there's going to continue to be clashes between governments and big tech  but I don't know if any of the big questions that definitely do exist are actually going to get  addressed very soon. I do think that these antitrust cases are going to proceed. You're seeing  very similar theme in China where they're going after their tech giants and wondering if there  are market questions there. And then there are a lot of speech questions and there are privacy  questions and I think that neither of those have really been approached in very thoughtful ways.  The EU tried I think with GDPR but there's still lingering questions there. The US needs a privacy  law. Is any of this going to happen soon? I don't know. This week I felt a lot, the last couple of  weeks I should say, I felt a lot of PTSD from 2017 in Charlottesville.  It seems like we really didn't learn a lot of lessons from that. You saw the same sort of like  a hammer coming down on some of these long time bad actors but suddenly the platforms decided they  were too bad. So the question is are we going to be proactive now or is it going to be another  thing where something really horrific happens and then we sort of decide retroactively okay that was  a line. I don't know. I see these things sort of repeating a lot and it's very cyclical at the

Start time: 588.32
End time: 688.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  moment. I hope there's actually some progress. Yeah it seems like US politics is very cyclical  so maybe that's what it's reflecting. Willow Ramis writing at 1-0 on Medium says how could Biden  reshape the internet or not? There are two schools of thought. One recalls the Obama administration's  cozy relationship with Silicon Valley. Notes Kamala Harris's ties to companies like Uber.  Points out Biden's reliance of tech allies as advisors and so that contingent says it's  going to be easy for big tech over the next four years. By the way big tech's lobbying has been  pretty aggressive and I think will get even more aggressive in 2021 but there has been a lot of  momentum as he points out for regulating big tech. Biden himself expressed skepticism on section 230  and you know there's a lot that Biden could do. In this view, Ramis writes the Biden administration  is poised to enact sweeping reforms on multiple fronts. A federal online privacy act of course  he's replaced Ajit Pai temporarily at least with Jessica Rosenmorsal who is a very I think a very  good FCC commissioner who is very much pro net neutrality but gig economy workers you know prop  22 passed in California. Uber and Lyft against Uber and Lyft's expensive campaigns. A rework  of section 230 could be in the works. Anti-trust legislation so it's kind of unknown where we're

Start time: 689.10
End time: 783.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  going. Really the issue is that we don't really know what to do. We know there are issues in  you know things like free speech in the gig economy in the monopolies of these companies  but free speech you don't know where to put the line and how to enforce it. The gig economy we  know you know it's fairly clear that they're not employees and they're not completely independent  either but we don't know what to put in a third type of you know status and same with the  monopolies. We as you say on this show very often we don't know what to do like breaking them up is  not going to fix the issues that we have. So I think that there's a lot of people that need  to start thinking about before saying we need to regulate almost on a philosophical level.  How do we fix the issues that were introduced by these society altering models that were created  in the past 20 years thanks to the internet. The disintermediation the fact that everyone has a  voice etc etc. And the reality is no one knows what to do and that's not a bad thing. Like it's  obvious that when things change that much the old models and the old ways of seeing things don't  work anymore. So we need to you know think about it and hopefully find solutions but  it's I don't see it as a you know the everything is lost that we don't know what to do right now.

Start time: 785.16
End time: 798.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No it's clear we don't. On the other hand the EU seems to Nate there is pretty aggressive actions  already in the EU against Google and perhaps Facebook. Yeah I mean Google, Facebook, Amazon

Start time: 799.46
End time: 903.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is a big one. Microsoft has been a target in the past certainly. Obviously with the  Brexit situation that we have gone through there is an additional question that is over certainly  everyone's heads in my country which is what does this mean for the UK specifically. You know  because we aren't necessarily going to have exactly the same relationship with you guys and  with US tech companies as the rest of Europe will do and that we would have done had we not have  divorced ourselves from that. And excuse my dog who's probably just going out for his  nightly activity. So that's one of the things that I'm particularly keen to see how it plays out but  we're not going to know that for quite some time. As far as President Biden goes I think what's  interesting from our perspective is we hear a lot through the news over the last week about  the Paris climate accord and carbon goals and things like that and a lot of the conversation  that happens on a tech level or from a kind of big tech level is all very domestically focused as it  should be for any incoming president and administration. I think what's going to be  very interesting is seeing what happens in that next step. Like what is the international message  that the Biden administration wants to communicate with Britain, with Europe, with the rest of the  world of course as I'm sure Louise will have a view on. And that those are two massive unknowns,  hugely influential, massive potential impact for good or for bad but I feel in my waters

Start time: 903.84
End time: 1011.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to be optimistic. There is an argument that the Democratic Party has moved farther to the left  that there is bipartisan agreement that we've got to do something about big tech for completely  different reasons by the way but that doesn't mean that something won't be done. Besides Rosenworcel  who is again temporary chair of the FCC or acting chair, Biden appointed Rebecca Kelly Slaughter as  acting chairwoman of the Federal Trade Commission. She is apparently very aggressive. She's been on  the commission since 2018 as a Democratic commissioner but she is going to inherit the  Facebook prosecution and is apparently very concerned about privacy and big tech. So  there may be at the FTC and she in fact was very critical of the FTC's kind of dropping their Google  investigation last year. There may be actually much more active, much more energy at both the  FCC and the FTC to rein in these big tech companies. So there's debate about which way  it's going to go but it's certainly something we're going to end up watching and I think it's  something we're going to hear a lot about in 2021. Another pick from Biden, the chairman of the  SEC, the Security Exchange Commission. A lot of people are excited about Gary Gensler because he  is a blockchain wonk. He actually teaches, he's an advisor to MIT Media Labs digital currency  initiative and teaches courses at MIT about blockchain. So it'll be interesting to have  somebody at the SEC who knows what Ether and XRP and stablecoin are. I think it's-

Start time: 1011.50
End time: 1023.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the question then that I would have on that front. Is the focus there  blockchain as a ledger tool or specifically the crypto currency?

Start time: 1025.90
End time: 1055.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's probably more so about investing. I think he probably knows a lot. If he's going  to be at the SEC, it's probably going to be a lot about should we be regulating how people  trade these things? And I think there's also a lot of concern about things like Robinhood and  other investment apps. So even if it's not exactly just the blockchain tech, he probably  understands very intimately how these things work as a market. I wonder if that's part of  the consideration there. I think it's cool that he has that. I hope he's not like,

Start time: 1056.24
End time: 1133.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  let's use this for everything in the government. No, I think it's the other way around. In fact,  I think there might be some concern that he sees them as securities and wants to regulate them.  So that will be, well, again, this is early days. We're learning a lot about what's going on.  In a way, it's kind of nice to see people in these positions who at least  know what they're talking about, have some track record. Whether we agree with them or not,  that'll be another matter entirely. Google also facing headwinds in the EU. In fact,  it'll be interesting to see what Google does. I run that in the EU, in Australia. It'll be  interesting to see what Google does. As you know, there is a bill in front of the Australian  legislature to force Google to pay digital platforms, news, or rather to pay news media  for including their articles or even snippets of their articles in its search. In response,  on Friday, Google's Australian managing director Mel Silva testified in front of a Senate committee  that this proposed code was not only untenable, but she said if it goes through,  it would give us no real choice but to stop making Google search available in Australia.

Start time: 1135.64
End time: 1256.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the nuclear option. It's a nice search engine you got there. It'd be a shame  if something happened to it. It's really funny because you mentioned it. At the same time,  I think the same day in France, we've had a law that was forcing Google to give money to  the press essentially, online publications for the news service that they have.  For news. Of course, Google has been saying, listen, we can't pay you for sending traffic to  you. On the same day or the next day after the Australian thing, Google announced that they had  come to an agreement to send money to the French press. That was a little bit of a surprise because  they had always, of course, stated that they couldn't do that and that they wouldn't. We've  had spats in Spain and Germany where Google actually shut off the Google news service.  Of course, they didn't shut off the entire search engine. The thing that's really interesting and  that I'm not sure many people have looked deep enough into to understand is that we don't know  to what extent this is the case, but they have included in that flow of money to the publications,  they have included traffic. We don't know how it's calculated exactly, but traffic is considered,  has a dollar or euro amount. There might be more actual cash in that deal that they're going to  funnel through to the publications, but traffic is also taken into account, which is interesting  because of course the big argument has been, we shouldn't be paying you, we're sending you  traffic and you're making money on that. But they do have a deal apparently with the

Start time: 1257.44
End time: 1267.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  biggest major publications in the country now. They didn't say how much they were going to pay.  It's a precedent and I'm not sure it's a good precedent from Google's point of view.

Start time: 1269.86
End time: 1318.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Australia seems to be asking for an awful lot more, I think, than what we've seen countries  asking for in the past. I read one story that suggested that something like 10% of the local,  like the regional revenue, so the money that Google's making in Australia essentially  should be passed directly to news organizations, which is about $300 million or something.  That's huge and I think that's probably the main reason why Google wants to make such a big stink  about this because as you say, there is potential for other governments, other regulating bodies to  look at this and think, well, Google caved or Google didn't and we've not seen it at this scale

Start time: 1318.64
End time: 1345.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  before. There's also, from Google's point of view, there's a principle which is that the  Australians say not only are we not going to look at the traffic that Google drives  to the publishers, you're not even allowed to include that in the calculus for how much you're  going to pay. I think that probably pissed off Google in a way that maybe it didn't in France,  where they clearly are considering traffic as being part of the equation.

Start time: 1347.72
End time: 1354.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The conversation didn't start at that point.  No, no, but they got them to give in.  At the serial, there was threatening.

Start time: 1356.44
End time: 1369.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think the threat is the biggest problem here, isn't it? This is a very bold ultimatum  and I think personally, I feel it could backfire and I think it will be frowned upon.

Start time: 1372.12
End time: 1395.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What if, it could be even worse than that, what if they did pull search out and nobody cared  and people discovered, some people have suggested this, that's a dumb move for Google because  people will discover, oh, DuckDuckGo is not so bad or StartPage is not so bad or Acosia is not so  bad and maybe this could start undermining Google's monopoly in the rest of the world.

Start time: 1398.48
End time: 1416.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm pretty sure they looked at the amount of traffic they are sending to those publications  that are fueling that lawmaking and I'm guessing that they know the publications can't afford.  That's what happened in Spain, right?

Start time: 1416.98
End time: 1432.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Where are they going to be read? People look at the news on their Facebook feed or they  Google it, right? I mean, you might surface some of this, you might see a weird dynamic where  the rules of Bing are suddenly really important and everyone is optimized for Google.

Start time: 1432.90
End time: 1433.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Optimized for Bing.

Start time: 1434.46
End time: 1449.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you're optimized for Bing suddenly and maybe that's what happens but I think that the  intervening period between Google pulling out and that adjustment would be detrimental for the  Sydney Herald. I'm sort of curious how the publications really feel about this and the  people who work there.

Start time: 1450.16
End time: 1457.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's why it's a nuclear option. That's why, I mean, that really is quite a threat  for Google to say, well, we could always just cut off search.

Start time: 1457.94
End time: 1465.44

Start time: 1476.14
End time: 1496.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think you'd see this threat in the US, is what I can say. You wouldn't see this threat in a  very large country, I don't think. But this is becoming increasingly common. You've seen  a number of different platforms basically say, we're just going to leave and that seems to be an  increasingly common tactic. And sometimes they take it.

Transcript:  Seems very childish. Seems babyish. It's like, just, you know, figure it out, work it out.  But this reminds me of what Epic has been doing.

Start time: 1504.94
End time: 1538.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, talk about babyish.  And that, I don't feel that that's playing out particularly well for them because, well, I mean,  it's embarrassing.  All the lost court hearings. So it's not a great way of doing it. But on a smaller level,  we've seen it done with smaller retailers, even in Europe as a response to Brexit.  Like there are some companies now on continental Europe who won't ship to the UK because it's  dealing with tax and customs forms and complaints. It's not worth their effort.  They're just saying, we'll send to anywhere in the world except Britain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's find out.  I think so. I've never come across one that I couldn't load. But you know, all of these things,  it's kind of part of what I was talking about earlier. We're figuring out a lot of things  that aren't going to work out on the first try, but ultimately might end up coming to a consensus  that I don't want to say benefits everyone, but mostly works. And certainly GDPR when it first  came out was, I think, finger pointed at and laughed at by a lot of people who are saying,  oh, but you can't work it out that you have so many boxes you have to click. And yes, it's the  case, but you're seeing other countries and locations that are starting to think, okay,  maybe we do need something. Maybe we don't go as far, but we do need something.  And the thing with the newspapers, they ended up finding an agreement in France, at least,  and maybe they're not going to get as much money as they would have wanted because traffic is  included into that calculation. But as a newspaper, if you have one additional source of revenue that  is helping you out a little bit and diversifying your income, I think that's good for everyone in  society because you have newspapers that can function a little bit better. So it's messy,  but we're slowly over the next 10 or 20 years going to figure things out, I think. And GDPR is not  mocked as much as it was a couple of years ago, I think.

Transcript:  Interesting. Let's take a little break. We got a- boy, this is a great panel for,  especially for international news. Nate Langston is here. He is consumer tech and European tech  for Bloomberg in the UK, host of the UK Tech Show at UKTechShow.com.  Nice to see you, Nate. Thanks for staying up late with us.  Louise Metzakis is also here. Her new publication is Rest of World at restofworld.org. She's a senior  editor there and it's really cool. I'm so glad to have found it. Thank you for being on.  Even if you're not staying up late. The latest of all from Finland,  our wonderful Patrick Béja, not patrick.com.  Our show today brought to you by Amazon Pharmacy. This is a new product from Amazon that's really  interesting. Why not make it easy on yourself? Stay at home, stay safe.  Amazon Pharmacy saves you time. They'll work with your doctor and they'll  deliver medication right to your door. You can get all the meds you need without leaving the house.  One less errand, more safety for you. I have to say, I've been doing this for some time.  I really think this is the future. It's amazing. It saves you time.  Amazon Pharmacy delivers your medication directly to your door, no more waiting in line at the  pharmacy. Who wants to do that these days? It's very easy. Have your doctor's office send the  prescription straight to Amazon Pharmacy. They coordinate with the doctor to make sure everything  is accurate. You're getting what you need. Of course you can use your insurance. It works  with most insurance plans nationwide. Oh, by the way, if you're an Amazon Prime member, free  two-day delivery, yeah, Prime applies to Amazon Pharmacy too. Plus, you'll save on prescription  medication when you're paying without insurance. The pricing is very clear, easy to understand.  Honestly, most pharmacies, they won't tell you the price of medication until you fill in  your prescription. Then they say, oh, that'll be $500. But Amazon Pharmacy shows you right  up front your insurance copay, the price without insurance. You can make the right decision.  Your medical information, of course, is absolutely protected. They'll never share your personal  health data outside of the pharmacy. You might say, well, what about, I want to talk to a  pharmacist. You can speak with a pharmacist on staff 24-7 whether you have questions or just need  advice. I've been using PillPack, which is kind of the backend for this. Amazon bought them a  few years ago for a long time. It's just the easiest way to do this. It's fantastic. Amazon  Prime members, you can save on prescription medication if you're not using insurance. Plus,  two-day delivery. Learn more at Amazon.com. That's Amazon.com. That's the URL. Amazon.com.  Thank you, Amazon, for supporting this week in tech. If you haven't tried this, you really should.  They just launched it a few weeks ago. I've been using PillPack for years. I immediately went and  tried it. It's really a great solution. On we go with the show. We're not done with Google.  Among the pardons from the former president, Donald Trump, in the last few hours of his presidency,  former Google engineer, Anthony Lewandowski, he was working at Google's self-driving car division.  He left, founded a startup, a trucking startup. I think it was called Auto, which he sold to Uber.  He brought with him, however, according to Google, a bunch of company secrets. In fact,  the judge said during his sentencing, his theft of documents and emails constituted,  quote, the biggest trade secret crime I have ever seen. Lewandowski was ordered to pay $179,000  million, including $756,000 in restitution and $95,000 fine. I'm not sure of the status of that  because remember, he filed for bankruptcy immediately. The president has issued a pardon.  The sponsors in the pardon, kind of not a surprise, Trump supporters and tech billionaires,  Peter Thiel, one of the first investors in Facebook, and Palmer Luckey, who created Oculus  Rift, among those supporting a pardon for Lewandowski. The press release says,  Lewandowski paid a significant price for his actions and plans to devote his talents to  advancing the public good. So he was sentenced to 18 months in prison. He won't be going. He  wasn't going to go until COVID was over. He won't be going now. I think he still owes the money,  however. I don't think a pardon can let you off the hook for that.

Start time: 2062.80
End time: 2097.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is surprising because it was a fairly big story. As the judge said, a fairly  heinous theft of trade secrets. I'm sure Google isn't too happy about it. On the other hand,  he wasn't in jail because of COVID-19. It was an 18-month sentence. I wouldn't want to do it,  but it wasn't the longest sentence in the world. I think the fact that two prominent Trump supporters  were in favor of it probably had something to do with it. No innuendo here. We'd heard news stories  that there was a lot of money changing hands in lobbying for pardons. No idea if this was

Start time: 2098.14
End time: 2157.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  one of those pardons. This makes me think that is Anthony working on something  that perhaps one of these investors is interested in. There has to be a convenient reason,  I think. Is his genius really that so important? That's how the pardon was promoted. It was the  idea that this guy is going to use his knowledge for good and he's so smart that he should be free.  And I really know about that. He's been shown to have terrible decision-making qualities,  but I think that perhaps one of these people wants his talent for something. I think that  self-driving cars is still an incredibly attractive market. That's what I'm thinking  about here. And I think it also shows me that Peter Thiel is still closer to the president  than I might have thought because there's been some reporting that perhaps their relationship  has soured a little bit, or at least they haven't really... Peter Thiel hasn't made a  speech for Trump in a while or anything like that. So I thought it was very, very curious

Hey, I wouldn't associate him with  little Wayne either. Well, little Wayne was a huge Trump supporter. That makes more sense to me. I  also think there's probably been a couple of weird Hollywood parties where they've run into each  other. But when was Trump hanging out with Uber engineers?

End time: 2232.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yes, just so this is clear, he's not going to do the 18 months in prison, but that's it.  That's what he got pardoned for. So it's not like... Because the thing that came to mind,  and it's a completely different thing, but just Chelsea Manning was pardoned by Obama, of course.  Her sentence was commuted. Yes. Yeah. Right. So it's a very different story, but I'm just... If  you want to think about things that are a little bit more controversial possibly, the fact that  he's not going to do 18 months in prison is not... It's not going to change the face of the

Transcript:  earth and democracy. Does France or Britain have anything like this where an outgoing  prime minister or president can pardon, just willy-nilly pardon anybody who wants?  That's a strange thing. The queen can do it. Well, the queen should be able to. That's different.

Start time: 2248.88

Transcript:  But what is it usually someone for? Like someone wrongly convicted? Is there a theme that it usually  goes to? Is it clemency? Yeah, there is clemency. Who does the queen usually give it to? Is it  corrupt? Is it a good thing usually? Or what's the pattern? That's a good question. It so rarely

Transcript:  seems to happen, but there was one of a murderer, I think, someone who... He'd ripped a narwhal  tusk, like something off the side of a museum, when there was a terrorist had gone on a rampage  on London Bridge with a knife. I remember this, yeah. Yeah, and he'd tackled this guy to the  ground. He pulled out this narwhal tusk and he breached, I think, the terms of... Either he was  on day release or something. Apparently, I think he got a royal pardon for something like that.  So it is a rare act. It's not like how... He sounds like a hero. It sounds like,

End time: 2360.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  image to the public that that can happen on a rare occasion that somebody did something for  the public good, saved lives. It's not... What the queen does much more regularly would be issue  knighthoods in the new year to people who have done great things. So it's more that she will reward  people for good rather than offer clemency on a routine basis to people who may or may not have

Transcript:  been wrongly convicted or... So here's a Washington Post article that says, just about every country  has a pardon power, but actual use of it varies all over the place. The pardon power in the US  actually comes from the monarch's pardon power in Britain. Queen Elizabeth has used the power in  the past three decades largely in posthumous cases. The one I remember is Alan Turing,  who she pardoned posthumously. And the prime minister's office apologized.  And very appropriately. And that's thanks to John Graham Cumming, who is a good friend of the  network and CloudFlare. And he launched a campaign to get an apology from the British government,

Start time: 2403.62
End time: 2418.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  which was successful, which I think is great. Do you know what the queen's pardon is called,  though? No. It's not called a pardon. It's called the Royal Prerogative of Mercy.  Mercy. Which is just such a rock and roll way of saying...

Transcript:  The King of Thailand pardons half or a third of the prison population every year on his birthday,  but that's mostly because they have no parole system and a well overcrowded prison system.  So yeah, this is not actually as unusual as I thought it was, but pre-pardons are rare.  Pardoning somebody before they commit a crime, and that's something I think was considered too.

Start time: 2474.20
End time: 2494.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Can I say one last thing on this? Yes.  On the knighthood thing. So we have that too. It's the National Medal of Freedom,  and I thought it was hilarious because it usually goes to heroes, civil rights heroes. People have  done really great things as a congressman or something, but Trump has given way more of them  to sports players and athletes. Yeah, he likes athletes.

Start time: 2494.62
End time: 2567.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he loves doing that. I had dreamt last week that maybe a time would come when that  we wouldn't have to use the word Trump in a sentence for a while, but I guess for a few  more weeks we will mention that because it's still going on. Google is again, it was a no good,  very bad year for Google, and they're in trouble again. You may remember they fired or forced the  exit of Timit Gebru, who was an AI researcher they had brought in to lead the AI ethics team,  and that was kind of controversial. Now they're investigating her colleague, Margaret Mitchell,  because Mitchell had been using an automated script to go through her messages to find examples  showing discriminatory treatment of Gebru. Google locked her account saying, well, they didn't fire  her, but they locked her account saying they're investigating why she downloaded a large number  of files and shared them with people outside the company. I understand that's probably an automatic  process at a company like Google. Nevertheless, maybe they should start thinking a little bit

Start time: 2567.56
End time: 2626.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  about the optics of all this. I think it really shows how hostile the relationship has become  between Google and a small fraction of its workforce. I think that that's really what's  going on here. This employee clearly feels very upset about what's happening at her workplace.  In Google's defense, I think that this behavior without any context is the kind of thing that you  would lock an employee's account for. This is a basic security measure when you see an employee  downloading all sorts of stuff, especially in a large organization like Google. But they've been  caught a couple of times, and so is Amazon, some of these other companies taking what are framed as  apolitical actions when what's going on here is they are sort of fighting back. The problem is that  it's in the company's interest to protect whatever incriminating evidence might be within the company.  I don't know. I think it really just shows that the hostility is really high.

Transcript:  They're just struggling.  Can I just ask, on the issue here, was the issue that the woman in question was using  a script or an AI to mine data for evidence, keywords, or other data sets, or was it that  the data on the whole was being shared outside of the company walls?

Start time: 2664.48
End time: 2666.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Probably a combination of all of those things.

Start time: 2666.08
End time: 2679.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little of both, but certainly sharing it outside the company's got to be a big red flag.  When you see a lot of internal information being exfiltrated from any company, I think that's going  to trigger an immediate investigation and lockdown.

Start time: 2679.52
End time: 2711.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's also a lot of surveillance inside the company. I remember a few years ago,  I don't know if you guys remember the Google memo, but when I was working on that story,  there was a lot of consideration inside the company about when you open a Google doc,  which is what the memo was, you can see everyone who's gone in and out of it.  It's really hard to get that memo because it was very clear to them that the company was just  watching that document and what was happening to it.  I think this is fairly known inside the company that they're watching every move,  which is not uncommon.

Transcript:  Yeah. Speaking of Google, Alphabet is popping its balloons.  This is the Google, the alphabet that I kind of cherish and love, kind of the wacky.  Let's try it. Let's see what happened. The Project Loon, which was named partly because  they were balloons, but I think also partly because it was a little loony,  was one of their moonshots. The idea to put high atmosphere balloons all over the world to  distribute the internet. It launched in 2013. It never really had a chance of making any money.  By 2018, they'd graduated from Google's X, which is their moonshots, and it was made a division,  one of Alphabet's other bets. That's actually the beginning of the end because now we're starting  to see how much this is costing. It got its own CEO, got some outside funding, and there were  some uses of it. You may remember in Peru after an earthquake, they put the balloons up there to  provide internet. Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria. Last year, there was a pilot project in Kenya  delivering bandwidth, but Astro Teller, the appropriately named head of Google X  and also the chair of the Loon board, he killed his own offspring. He recommended Alphabet,  no longer funded, and no one else was interested in picking up the mantle. Astro said,  you know, this was a long shot. Even when we started it, he says he gave it about a one or  two percent chance of succeeding. I think partly the fact that Elon Musk's satellites,  Starlink satellites, are going to do the same thing better. They're already going.

Start time: 2832.60
End time: 2865.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They learned a lot, but it's over for Loon. I think they're seeing the writing on the  satellite wall between Starlink, which is starting to actually be commercially usable,  even if it's in beta. There's OneWeb. It seems that these solutions are filling the need that Loon  was addressing and much more. If it works, you really don't need Loon, because it seems like  Loon works. Technically, it works. It's just you don't need it anymore.

Start time: 2865.80
End time: 2881.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Facebook had a similar idea with drone planes called Aquila, which sounds like a kila,  but these weren't kila drones. It's actually Latin for eagle, I think. They killed that a

Start time: 2881.76
End time: 2929.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  couple of years ago. I think Loon also is just not really as innovative as it seemed to be.  Even though the balloons were really cool, it was expanding existing cell tower coverage.  Which is very different from Starlink, which is satellites that are beaming down the coverage to  areas that don't already have it. That's why Loon was so great in disasters, because it was like,  okay, the fiber is down, so you're going to use these balloons instead. But it's mostly areas  where there was already fiber coverage, because they were just expanding that a little bit. It  wasn't this like, we're going to bring it to the masses who don't have any tower nearby.  I think that was part of it. We ran a really fun story about how the balloons were going down in  Uruguay, which didn't even use them at all, but they were falling into rural Uruguay all the time.

Start time: 2929.56
End time: 2997.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, geez. Steven Levy writing in Wired talked about the fact that in the decade that Loon's  been around, internet access globally went from 75% to 93%. He also says, and I don't know if this is  Levy editorializing or if it's true, the remaining 7% are primarily populated by either those who  can't afford the 4G phones you need for Loon signals, or aren't convinced that the internet  was worth the effort. Like just internet abstainers. Teller came to realize Loon was unlikely ever to  contribute to Alphabet's profits. But Teller said, you know, it's not a failure. He said it was a  successful experiment. Levy asked him, what's an unsuccessful experiment? And Teller said,  the real failure is when the data tells you what you're doing isn't the right thing and you do it  anyway. So the success of this failure was to call it quits.  Is stopping?  Stopping. That's the success.  That's harsh.

Start time: 2998.04
End time: 3079.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually can believe that in a way. I feel like all the best lessons I've learned as part of my  career, I've learned as a result of screwing something up and not doing it twice. And I think  failure is a fantastic teacher, certainly has been for me. So I kind of buy this. And I think the  analysis is accurate that this is just maybe this was something that could have worked earlier,  but it's too expensive to deploy, to maintain, you know, it doesn't impact the bottom line so  much. But I do still think there's something in this idea of balloons and temporary internet  access, as you said, Louise, like in disaster zones and in places with natural disasters or  something else where connectivity is cut off, anything that you can rapidly deploy  can be massively beneficial. I've seen, I think it's Vodafone, this must be going back 10 years,  but they had a backpack, like a cell, the 3G cell tower backpack that someone would literally wear  on their back and carry around to increase cell connectivity in areas hit by natural disaster.  So like there's a genuine need for these sorts of rapid deploy, but rapid, you know,  retrieval things to be in existence, but just maybe not on the scale that Google

That's the other, that's another adage. You buy  on the rumor, you sell on the news. They're buying on the rumor because it is thought that  Apple will have amazing, maybe its best first quarter ever when they announce their results  this coming Wednesday. It's expected, analysts expect that Apple's quarterly revenue for the  quarter ending December, which includes the new iPhones, new Macintoshes, new watches, new iPad,  all new stuff. And of course, new services, the Apple one plan analysts think that their quarterly  revenue will be the highest of all time, exceeding the hundred billion dollar mark.  And so Apple stock price at its highest ever. Mag safe, mag safe.

Like it sort of feels at this point that if it doesn't  tie into that in some way, then it, then Apple doesn't have an interest in it. So I can't see

Transcript:  I mean, I suppose there are enough complaint from their like core, you know, user base because  they really want to be sort of like the niche for creators. And like, is there enough sort of like,  they realize that enough creators are moving away or, you know, very annoyed by that capability.  That's the only reason I could see. Cause like, you're not going to see like a professional  photographer put everything in the cloud, right? Right. No, no, no.

Transcript:  So really, it's a really good point. And definitely one of the arguments back at the time that it was  removed was that not every, you know, pros don't all use SD cards. They were using compact flash  and things like that. And that's not, you know, the, the technology has moved on a lot since then.  And now SD is just widespread. So arguably you could bring that back, but then if you're going  to do that, why not do what Apple does very well and just force the industry to evolve and, and  move everyone to micro SD? I know they're not as fast for the pros, but in terms, but if you want  a physical little thing to shove in the side of a laptop, then there are smaller devices out there  than the nasty card. I've got an SD card with wifi in it somewhere. It's called an i-fire.  I think they went out of business by the way, Nate, bad news.

Transcript:  They're gone. I mean, Apple has driven the market for dongles like this. I mean, you know, I've,  this is, I, I have a numerous dongles just so I, cause I do, I have an SD card in my cameras,  all of them, and I pop it out and I have to have some way to read it. And you know,  maybe they're, I don't know. I'd be, I'd be happy maybe. So we'll,  we'll make Louise happy with MagSafe and I'll be happy with SD cards and nobody's going to miss  the touch bar.

My big problem is I kept hitting  it and things would happen. Siri would pop up or my calendar, Siri, Siri popping up all the time.  So, but better touch tool lets you take all those away. And then you can see time, day, weather,  battery, things like that, which are, that's, I guess that's marginally useful. I don't know.

Then we'll talk about some new stuff  coming along. Apple does. There's some, seems to be some indication Apple will do  some VR headset this year. I don't know. That seems a little bit odd.  Facebook has a big case going to the oversight board. We will talk about that and  I don't know, maybe do a little tick tock too. And the Bernie Mittens meme, we got to,  that's the happiest story of the week. Are we sick of Bernie Mittens yet? Or is that? No,

Transcript:  but in reality, who doesn't love a picture of Bernie Sanders all folded up with his big old Mittens.  And it just happened that the photographer took it with a nice, easy to edit white background.  So highly memeable. Although I've seen a lot of photographers, including the one who took that  picture said, I never ever want to take a meme picture. I hate it. There's my picture everywhere,  everywhere. Our show today brought to you by the folks at WWT worldwide technology. That was my  last, I have a real fondness for WWT because that was my last time on an airplane back in March,  not last forever, but for some time I imagine Lisa and I flew out to St. Louis to see their  advanced technology center. Wow. This is something they began building about 10 years ago. It started  small, one, a couple of racks, one building. It's now I think four or five buildings,  mile after mile, half a billion dollars worth of equipment. See WWT is a trusted partner for any big  business, for the technologies, for the consultants, the software design, they do so much.  But one of the things they always want to know is they want to know how your stuff will integrate  with the new stuff and so forth. So they built this ATC, hundreds of OEMs, half a billion dollars of  equipment, ranging from the big guys, heavyweights like Dell Technologies and VMware and Intel,  to the little emerging disruptors that are changing the world like Equinix. WWT has been doing this for  a long time, a trusted partner for so many enterprises. A lot of their customers have been  with them for over a decade. They know WWT is the place to go to get the answers they need to make  sure their businesses run right. The ATC is not only something the engineers at WWT use to spin  up proofs of concept and pilots in their lab environment, but they also set it up so customers  can do it too. On demand, schedulable labs for WWT's customers. Things like Dell's VxRail Power  Store, Unity PowerMax, Data Protection Central IDPA, these labs represent the newest advances  in primary storage. Hundreds of labs that you can schedule and use from anywhere in the world,  24-7. It's lab as a service, they call it. A dedicated lab space within the Advanced Technology  Center where you can perform your own programmatic testing using that amazing ATC technology ecosystem.  WWT's engineers work in this amazing place every day, beta testing new equipment, building reference  architectures and custom integrations to help their customers make decisions and see results faster,  with much less investment too. But this digital platform they launched this last summer is  incredible, encompasses the whole ecosystem. It really has created a multiplier effect, knowledge,  speed and agility anytime, anywhere around the world for their customers and partners.  So by the way, you can go there not just do the labs, there's full access if you sign up right  now to articles, case studies, all the tools you need to make a difference in today's fast paced  world. So what do you do? You go to www.www.twit.com. To learn more about the WWT, the Advanced  Technology Center to become a member of their growing community, www.twit.com.

From their great home in St. Louis. And I want to go back. It was a really nice,  nice trip. St. Louis is famous for toasted ravioli, which is unique.  That sounds delicious.  It actually is quite good.  You guys seem like you're hip, you're with it, you're podcasters, you own your own microphones.

Transcript:  Have you played with Clubhouse yet? Last week, iJustine sent me an invite.  And I don't get it at all. They just raised, they have 180 investors. They just raised more  money through Andreessen Horowitz. Their valuation, they're a unicorn. A billion dollars,  which is 10 times more than it was from the previous round. Do you know what Clubhouse is,

Start time: 3850.90
End time: 3870.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Louise? Have you used Clubhouse? I have not used it. However, to pull my rest of world angle,  I was very interested to learn the other day that it's also taking off in Mexico and Nigeria  and some other places. So they do seem to sort of have a larger user base than I thought.  Because it's all sort of invite only right now.

Start time: 3870.50
End time: 3874.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And it felt like it's all like VCs and startup guys, right?

Start time: 3875.06
End time: 3916.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. So to be fair, Nigeria has really big tech scene and in Mexico, it's catching on  amongst sort of like BC-ish people. So I do think that like, you know, they're capturing the same  types. I don't think it's, you know, attracting TikTok's user base or anything like that.  But I was sort of surprised to hear that because it definitely has this reputation as sort of,  you know, not the nicest people in Silicon Valley. Some of the like, you know, loudest  voices maybe love to go on there. And it's sort of become like very, the reputation on Twitter,  at least of Clubhouse, is that a lot of the conversations are like sort of very SF-centric.  But I think, you know, it's probably a wider platform than that. It's very buzzy.  So it doesn't surprise me.  It's so buzzy.  I think they have more funding.  Yeah.

Start time: 3928.40
End time: 3987.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you. I would love to, I'd love to give it a try actually, because I think  I think there might be some kind of logic behind the unicorn status. Everyone has seen what TikTok  has done and TikTok was really a different kind of social network. And Clubhouse is the only  new slash different thing that's happened in social networking in the past, well, five years,  if you include, if you exclude TikTok. So I'm thinking there's a lot of people who saw what  happened with TikTok and who are thinking, of course, it's not the same thing, but it's  it's different from everything we have right now. And they're thinking we might not want to  miss the boat on this one. Could be something, could not be. And of course, there are a lot of  issues with moderation and stuff like that. But it's definitely not something that we've seen  in the past, you know, ever. It's a different kind of network.

Start time: 3988.98
End time: 3992.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't get it. I'll be honest with you. It reminds me of the radio though, right? Like,

Start time: 3992.16
End time: 4012.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it reminds me of like people calling into radio shows. It's a little bit more dynamic than that,  but I feel like there is sort of a precedent here for this sort of like, kind of, you know,  social interaction, right? Like it seems like an evolution of that, which is interesting.  And I think potentially does have a lot of potential. Anyone, just like if with Twitter,

Start time: 4012.76
End time: 4037.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  anyone can be their own publisher, kind of, or Facebook. Anyone can be their own radio show,  very easy. And even isn't Twitter kind of copying the functionality with spaces,  which they're trialing now with actually minorities, which is probably a good idea  because they want to catch the potential issues with the service. But it's very-

Start time: 4038.16
End time: 4104.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very- I find the valuation massively unsurprising because you've got a giant body of  VCs and investors and people using this system already saying, it's great. So of course they're  going to throw a load of money into it. It doesn't surprise me in the slightest. You know,  it's being propped up by the fact that the people investing in it are the ones who are using it.  Kind of like, I don't know, the early days of Twitter felt like, you know, a similar sort of  buzz that it was used by a lot of the people who are investing in it. But it does seem to be  something a little different about it this time, just because it does seem to be spreading and  you're seeing news stories come out of things that happened in Clubhouse. And that tends to be the  point that I get interested in thinking, okay, is this more of a fad? Like, hey, look at House Party.  You remember House Party? It was a big deal for a day because it offered a new way for people to  communicate that was exciting, but it was not a sticky product. It's, I mean, what is it? Where  is it now? Really? It's not at the top of the app stores anymore, that's for sure. Certainly not

Start time: 4104.72
End time: 4152.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in the countries I've seen. Yeah. So that was also so based upon like your own network. And I think  that that sort of social network we're starting to realize is really hard in the long term, right?  Like Facebook's running into issues with that. Snapchat is running into issues with that. Now  they're trying to get creators again. I think ultimately to have like a long-term successful  platform, you can't just base it on people you know in real life. It's just like not sticky enough  and it's not going to keep people long enough because they have other ways of talking to their  friends and family. And I think that that's one reason that Clubhouse is a little bit more  promising, but I do agree. Who knows what's going to happen to us. I'm just too chicken to use it.  It is sort of intimate, right? Like, I don't know, but the idea of like turning on these,  these like freewheeling conversations is like not inherently a feeling. For people who don't know,

Start time: 4152.74
End time: 4208.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so you go into Clubhouse and you get a list of, it's hard to describe, but audio rooms.  They're like chat rooms, but it's all audio. There's a moderator who's doing all the talking,  but you can raise your hand and ask to be voiced and then you can communicate. Otherwise,  you can listen. There's a lot of these rooms have hundreds of people in them,  but it's you can't record it. It's not, it's live only. It's completely ephemeral,  which I guess is part of the appeal to some of these to start up folks and VCs and stuff.  In fact, that's one of the things I just seen said last week is you hear people being extremely  candid because they know it's not, it's not recorded. It's, it's like Snapchat. It's like  Snapchat. It just disappears. Of course, as somebody in the chat was pointing out,  everything can be recorded, but you're not supposed to. And since your name is on it,  maybe you don't want to.

Start time: 4209.12
End time: 4243.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it sounds a little bit like a podcast.  Yeah, it sounds like an ephemeral podcast.  We're doing it now. If you can see me, if I put my hand up and say, you know, I want to say  something and interrupt you, then sometimes I do. And that's okay. Cause that's what we're doing  here. And it just, it seems like, is that not the same thing for a different audience, obviously,  but you could theoretically, as far as I'm aware, you could, you could set up a  twit clubhouse and you could talk and listeners could chime in. That's great. We know we want  that. That's a cool idea.

Start time: 4243.68
End time: 4247.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can do it with discourse. You could do it. There's lots of ways to do something like that.

Start time: 4247.49
End time: 4288.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right?  Yeah. I don't think the idea of audio conversations is what is making the product interesting. The  idea, you know, it's the ease of use and execution, just like with Twitter, you could send a message  to someone or to several people in a myriad of different ways before Twitter didn't invent that.  It's just the form that it took that was compelling. And the ease of use was so that  everyone started using it. So I think it would be a mistake to look at clubhouse and say,  Oh, but we can do that somewhere. I mean, I don't know that it would be a mistake. Maybe it is  just going to go away because it's really not.

Start time: 4289.60
End time: 4340.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe I'm just too old. I feel like there's a scale of usability in these things. So if you  go to Facebook, it's pretty clear or Instagram is even clearer. I get it. I understand it. I know  how to participate. No big deal. Then there's Twitter, which, you know, I mean, I've been on it  since forever, but I think people looking at it go, I don't understand. It's a little strange.  And then there's clubhouse, which is far on the end of that scale, which even maybe I'm just old.  I look at it and I go, I, what, huh? I don't want to sit and listen to somebody gas on for hours.  Wait a minute. That's my show. I want to come to think of it. Nevermind. Forget I said anything.  It's a fabulous idea. Well worth it. Can anyone create a room though? Once you remember, yeah,

Start time: 4341.24
End time: 4364.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you have to be. It's right. So that's, that's, that's very different. I think from,  you know, other forms of communication, it's Twitter for voice. And that's been kind of a  fence. We have Twitter for photos, you know, Instagram and many others. We have just short  messages, but for voice that has never taken off anywhere. And if they crack that, I think there's

Start time: 4364.94
End time: 4406.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  value there. So let me, let me tell you what I'm seeing right now. Baratunde, who I actually love  and would listen to is he says he's got 14 people listening, literally streaming Spotify daily mix  while I work. Okay. YouTube business SEO and IG. There's 12 people in there, including people I know  who are smart. Oh, here's one. The power circle secrets of the millionaire mind master the game  of wealth. There's 831 people in there, including some people I know also psychedelic clubhouse  invent investing in psychedelics, the big opportunity. There's a lot of stuff like that.

Transcript:  I mean, what was YouTube when it first launched? It was skateboarding dogs and you know,  what was Twitter when it first launched? I don't even remember it was so memorable.  It's, you know, there's this is, I don't think we should judge it by what it is now. And of course,  if we knew it was going to be successful, we weren't going to be, we wouldn't be discussing  the idiocy of another yet another unicorn, but it is a bet, of course, and it could become something.  You're our resident optimist today, Patrick. I like, I like to think of myself as a realist. I've read  Factfulness. It's an amazing book and you have to look at things in a measured way and not in a

Start time: 4451.80
End time: 4473.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  negative way like everyone always does. Good. Thank you. You're that's a good, a good warning.  In fact, here's a room. If I weren't doing a show, I'd be listening to how to be successful  on clubhouse and there's 243 people. I don't know how to do an invite. I will figure it out and  and I guess send it to your email. I don't really know how this

Start time: 4473.76

Start time: 4479.30
End time: 4495.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ridiculous. But you know, if you were really leading, if you were doing like the affiliates club  live, I would go listen to that. That would be great. Well, I mean, that makes me think of  Discord, which maybe you mentioned before exactly the same as far as I could tell. Yes. And people

Transcript:  watch stuff on this court. I mean, gaming, we've already had all of the  people making fun of, oh, you're watching people game and that's we've had that round already.  But if you go look at this, that's a good point. Watch stuff that you would never believe would get

Start time: 4512.76
End time: 4563.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  an audience. Yeah, no, that's an excellent point. We record my podcast text message. We record that  on discord live and very occasionally we'll pull people in who are listening. Like literally the  show I recorded this morning, we had a pronunciation of a Dutch website because there were people who  were borrowing other people's dogs from a website that let you borrow dogs. So they had an excuse  to be outside because of the strict Dutch lockdown rules. That's so clever. It's clever, but I'll be  honest, that's not what my brother who I did the show with today described it. So it's it's worth  a listen. But we pulled somebody in from who is listening live in the discord to help us with some  of the pronunciation. Because no one can pronounce Dutch except the Dutch. So for situations like  that, it's really handy just very quickly pull people in if they've got something to say it for

Start time: 4563.46
End time: 4605.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  as a podcaster. It's super useful. I'm actually we're kind of exploring ideas for this. So it's  an interesting I love I have to say I see you're influencing me already, Patrick. I do love the  idea of of the internet trying new ways to communicate, not just kind of settling on the  ones that already exist. I think that's that's exactly what should be going on on the internet.  So I apologize. And then there's parlor, which is it's kind of ironic. So is there I don't know,  you did a story that said that the parlor is is reappeared. Well, with the help of Russia.

Start time: 4607.14
End time: 4678.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I was doing some reverse DNS digging to try and figure out where the servers were. And I  I found that it was using a service called DDoS guard, which is operated by two Russian people,  though the office I found was registered. It's in Edinburgh. Yeah. But but what it seems to be,  although it is that that was accurate. DDoS guard isn't hosting. It's like it's like a cloud flare,  right? From what I'm aware of. So they're using that but it but it but it pointed towards the cogs  working in the background to suggest like things are moving. The domain also has has moved is now  being managed by epic epic with a K EPI K, which also is a registrar for oh, Gab. Oh, yeah.  So like, there's things moving that suggests it's on its way. But at the time of speaking now,  parlor.com at least still says technical difficulties. It's a very similar message  to what was on the other day when I was reporting this set for Bloomberg. But yeah, I'm keeping my

That's a little bit of a change  from his earlier story. I don't know how I'm gonna get this back online. He says, despite the threats  and harassment, not one parlor employee has quit. We are becoming closer and stronger as a team  here in our bunker. Oh, no, I added the bunker. I could believe that it's a small it's a small

The question will be  initially whether it comes back in a way that preserves the historic content, you know, is it  your same account? If you have a problem, can you verify part of me? It's like, to get back in if  you got your password or we have to set up a new account. There's a lot of stuff like that, that may  mean that it loses some of the buzz perhaps that it's that it had. But I do believe it'll probably

Start time: 4733.72

I you know,  obviously, the First Amendment doesn't protect incitements to violence or planning violence,  or violent insurrection or sedition. And the problem parlor had was that they didn't seem  to be able to take that stuff down. But I think there needs to be places like gab and parlor,  I'm not going to hang out there. But I think they're everybody should have the right

Start time: 4759.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think the question is sort of like, these platforms are given a lot of credit in  these discussions. Like, let's look at what parlor is right was funded by, you know, a very  politically oriented conservative family. They were collecting people's drivers license, you  know, very sensitive information. You know, is this really the free speech network that we want to be  in a position of? You know, it's like, I'm happy to talk about these things sort of in an idealistic  way. And I think that like, this is just the wrong example. And I know it's like, yeah, you want to  use the hard examples. But I have so much more of a problem with governments wanting speech taken down  that is a threat to their rule. There's just so many more pressing cases of this than parlor.  Like parlor to me, it's just so obvious that, you know, I think they were trying to collect a bunch  of data about conservatives primarily, it was really sensitive data. Like, what was the aim  here? Was the aim here really to give people an alternative because Twitter is so, you know,  authoritarian? Or was it to create sort of a safe space for conservatives where a lot of like,  marketing could be done for conservative causes? That's depressing if that's the case.  I just, you know, it's hard to say. I just don't know. There's a lot of that in the world. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there are probably plenty of people. And God bless the Mastodon enthusiasts. They are like,  it could create issues at some point, but it's a genuine effort. I think the bigger  problem we're going to see with Parler is the same as with Gab and with, oh, what's the name of that  Reddit alternative? Like the free speech slash conservative alternative to Reddit. I'm sorry,  I don't remember the name, but that's the thing. You don't even remember it either. The problem  with these efforts is that they pretend to be defending free speech. But really what they are,  let's be honest, is enabling a pretty unacceptable kind of speech that would be banned everywhere  else. And the real problem is there's no business model for that. They can't monetize. First of all,  it's not interesting because they're talking amongst themselves. So they aren't very many  that stay there because it's only- Well, but Fox News monetizes, Breitbart monetizes.  There are plenty of far right journalistic- Yeah, but they're not that kind of far right.  I think you can express- Not extremist.  Not extremist. Yeah. Fox News, you can express those views on Twitter. You can go there. The  things that you see on Gab and on Parler are, maybe Parler is kind of an edge case because  it rose to prominence during the last few months of the Trump administration. I don't think long  term that is a viable business model. There's a viable business model behind that kind of a  target. Maybe I'm wrong, but the history so far has shown that all of those things tend to go away,  not because they're being censored, but because there isn't really anyone who wants to do business  with them and they don't have any other ways to monetize that. That was Mike Masnick's point on

Transcript:  internet. I think there are problems with how Apple and Google have policed the App Store.  We've seen Apple take down an app that raised awareness about how workers are treated in Foxcon.  There are problems there with these systems, but I don't necessarily think, again, that these are  the best examples necessarily. I think that there's a genuine business reason, to your point,  that they wouldn't want to work with these companies. That raises a lot of questions about

Start time: 5088.62
End time: 5151.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is this a viable business? Were you never going to get massive advertisers flocking to something  like Parler? It was always going to attract more of a niche audience. We've seen that just when  massive advertisers have pulled their campaigns from Facebook when they've seen that their ads  were appearing next to something that promoted something awful or that was against their corporate  values or whatever. But Parler was ad funded. That was their model, was too many money from ads.  So I wonder if at such a point it does come back, whether it can self-sustain essentially as a  donation-based system, because you've got a very loyal group of people who seem to really want this  to exist. Maybe that's how it survives. Maybe it just has to do everything itself and the community  wants it. If they feel so removed from some of these other platforms, maybe they're like,  well, hell, this is the thing that we want, so we'll pay for it. They don't need ads at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no stigma about not being able to self-fund through selling advertising. Absolutely right. Why  not have a subscription? I think that's actually a completely honorable way to go. We're ad funded,  but if something wants to exist and people want it to exist, having them contribute a few bucks  to keep it alive is a pure model, really. That's what Gap does. That is the Gap model.

End time: 5203.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they're doing it. They've found a lot of alternatives. I'm not defending that necessarily,  but I do think that that's fair. That's always going to be a niche approach. You're not going to  scale that very, very far, I don't think. There's a limited number of people who are willing to pay  a monthly or yearly fee for that sort of access. This is what I wonder about with Signal. I've

Start time: 5204.16
End time: 5234.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  become a massive Signal advocate over the last few months, but they're similar. They have designed  themselves around the idea of being funded by a not-for-profit foundation that relies on donations.  I was thinking, well, what's the good example of that being working well in these sorts of spheres?  I think Wikipedia has done quite nicely. The Internet Archive has done very nicely. It can  work. It can totally work if there's value. I think that's what Parler's going to have to do.

Start time: 5234.16
End time: 5299.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it can. The issue you have there is that the target for Parler is people who can't express  themselves on other platforms. It's the exact same service, except for people who can't say what they  want to say on other platforms. My theory, and I think Mike Matznik's article was very close to that,  is that this isn't really this big divide in the middle. It is because we have a complete statistical  anomaly with what happened with President Trump's deplatforming. That made a lot of noise.  The reality of the situation is that that group that can't say what they want on the general  platforms is very small. I don't think you're going to find a lot of people. I would guess,  maybe I'm wrong, but I would guess not a lot of them are going to be funding or donating to these  platforms on the long run. I don't think there's a natural alliance between other groups that do

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  have these problems. I don't think you see sex workers or you see activists who are often  kicked off these platforms or have problems with moderation. They don't want to be on these  platforms either. They're not necessarily just attracting the free speech people or the people  who have grievances with the big platforms. They're attracting even a smaller subset of that.

Start time: 5321.62
End time: 5359.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  An even bigger problem I think we're going to see is not Parler. What we're going to see is  what actually Nate mentioned, things like Signal and Telegram and the other end-to-end encryption  services, which are exactly, for example, which are going to have to start dealing. But WhatsApp,  they can kind of police things a little bit more easily. I think something like Signal is going to  have a hard time moderating these groups if they start adopting Signal massively. I don't know what  the bigger- It's a huge problem for Telegram, right? Yes, exactly.

Start time: 5359.44
End time: 5381.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Telegram though has a little bit more, I think, culpability in that because the Telegram channels  by default are not end-to-end encrypted. So they have some- They can see into them.  Whereas Signal really is sort of just like, we don't know what's going on in the platform,  which I think is sort of an existential question. It's unmoderatable therefore. And so they're off

Start time: 5381.26
End time: 5401.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the hook, right? By design. By design. But that's the thing. I think that's the point we're going  to start seeing in the next, I don't know, year, two years, five years, encryption advocates and  absolutists who might have to start thinking about that idea because- Never.  Never.  Well, we'll-  Never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  WhatsApp has already had this problem, right? They've had this problem in India. They've had  this problem in places like the Philippines. And what WhatsApp has done is they've made a couple  of tweaks around the edges, right? So they have limited the amount that you can forward messages,  for example, since they realized that forward chain messages were a big source of this stuff.  But I think you can only work around the edges if you want to keep the end-to-end encryption in  place. There's a lot of reasons for that. And that's going to be really tricky.

Start time: 5429.80
End time: 5460.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a really good point because you're right. Part of the reason that that was such a problem  for WhatsApp is that it's so pervasive and it has such a giant scale. And there was no  filtering in the way that posts sometimes just because of the algorithm don't appear in your  feed on Facebook. With WhatsApp, you get everything. There's no algorithm deciding which  messages from which people you get. You get everything. So it had that power to spread,  like, I don't want to use like virus because bad connotations right now.  Like wildfire, maybe.

Start time: 5465.90
End time: 5527.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's true. All right. It spread very quickly. Very, very quickly. And yeah, but that,  most platforms aren't at that scale. And so it will be interesting if something like Signal  got to that middle ground where it was big enough to be a problem, but not so big that they had to  enforce something like WhatsApp did to keep it under control. But just one final thing that I  wanted to mention on Parler will be really interesting test case if it is possible for a  very liberal or very left-leaning conversation or person or topic or something to rise to the  forefront in that app or whether it will just naturally and organically get buried simply  because the people who want to use it don't want to read that stuff or they want to push that kind  of content down, disagree with it. It'll be really interesting if we ever see a prominent liberal  voice, I suppose, is what I'm getting at on Parler.

Transcript:  They don't need it. They can speak on Twitter and then you're going to have people who are going to  say, oh, but see, that's that's proof of bias. But it isn't. It's society as a whole deciding  what's acceptable and what isn't. That's exactly again, getting back to that, Mastin's point.  It's us together. It wasn't Twitter and Facebook Illuminati's getting together in a room and saying,  we're going to ban this and this and this word. It looked like this in form because that's the  way it happened. But it was really much wider than that. It was society saying, all right,  that's that's it. Now we say stop. And we was society that took the form of public pressure  on many, many different companies that pushed that kind of speech to the edges. So the left wing  prominent voices can still say what they want on Twitter. I think it's a different, you know,  I'm all for both sides. Really, like the Phineas Club is essentially a both sides podcast. It's  very important to me. And it's very important that we listen to everyone. I think that's key  to the future. But this, I don't think is a, you know, you can equate.

I don't think they will because  they don't need those quote unquote free speech platforms. Those platforms are created to host  speech that is unacceptable. Fringe, fringe, fringe, speech. Yeah. And those left leaning  figures can say what they want on on the, you know, existing platforms, so they don't need to go

We this was a this is a alternative social network designed to replace  Facebook, Tim Bernies Lee, we're very much involved with it, apparently, becoming a haven also for  extremists, far right activity. Is there something about social networks that causes what's going on?  Or, you know, what's happened is you squeeze so hard on the mainstream networks, that the jam is  coming out of the sandwich and it's it's spreading to wherever it can flow.

Start time: 5673.60
End time: 5726.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's definitely what you're sort of seeing here. I also think that there is some  sort of over coverage to some degree, because like, you know, it's like, these are the people  who are getting kicked off that are getting a lot of notice. They get press. So it doesn't mean it's  a big deal. It's just it's getting coverage. I mean, I think it is like a big swath of users,  right? It's like, you know, I think Twitter kicked off 70,000 QAnon people one day like that's,  you know, a sizable chunk of people. You know, it's a little disturbing that there was that many  accounts that they could sort of automatically identify as being associated with QAnon. But  that's sort of a separate topic. So I do think there is sort of a big base. But I do think,  you know, there's always some people who are looking for another place. It's just that this  purge also happened to be occurring to your point, Leo, I think that the you know, the sandwich is  getting squeezed. It's a terrible metaphor. It's a terrible metaphor. And I totally apologize for

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it. But it's like it's apt. It's apt. Thank you for defending my crappy metaphor. What is now  Facebook? This is what by the way, the oversight board was invented for. Facebook of all of these  companies can say, well, you know, we're going to deplatform the president, but indefinitely on  Facebook and Instagram. But we're going to refer it to the Facebook oversight board. And of course,  they have no, they can say whatever they want. It doesn't force Facebook to listen to it. It really  is a mechanism for deferring responsibility. The Facebook oversight board has agreed to take it.  I don't know how long this is going to take. It's decisions they say are binding and cannot be  overruled by Mark Zuckerberg. I don't know. Is that the case?

Start time: 5780.10
End time: 5822.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It reminds me of when they did the voting on the privacy policy updates. And they said that  if if certain things got a high enough engagement from users that it could force a review or a  change or something like that. But I don't think enough people ever actually cared enough for it  to tip the threshold of tip the balance. So I don't know why something like this would be any  more effective than that. It's just as you say, it's batting responsibility. It's going to slow  down decisions, presumably. It seems like a strange, strange decision. But I assume I also  think it's strange because I don't fully understand it. And I'm very aware of that. Maybe one of you

Start time: 5822.60
End time: 5880.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  guys do. But I think the way that this works is it's always it's always an appeal, right? Like,  I think it's always a decision that Facebook first made that then gets referred to the oversight  board. So I think that that's why it happened afterward. And I do think it's going to be  fascinating because Tector did a really good experiment a while ago where they asked a bunch  of content moderation experts about what they thought about various decisions. And I think  that the way that sort of shook out is that they had different answers, like people who specialize  in this stuff, which points to the fact that there is sort of no right and wrong answer.  And I would love to sort of just see their responses and whether there are disagreements,  because I think that the common wisdom here is that this was the right move. Maybe it was a  little too little too late. But I would like to see sort of some fleshed out arguments on both  sides, because I think that this is a complicated question that does set precedent for what Facebook  will do in the future, especially in the rest of the world. So I am really curious what will happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So according to the board, they are binding, although honestly, nothing's binding if Mark  doesn't want to go with it. In the coming days, it would be embarrassing to overrule it. So  in the coming days, according to the board, the case will be assigned to a five member case review  panel. After the panel reaches a decision, its findings are shared with the entire board,  then a majority of the board will have to sign off for the case decision to be issued.  Mr. Trump, through his designated page administrators, will have the ability to  submit a statement to the board explaining why he believes Facebook's content moderation decisions  should be overturned. Facebook will also share contextual information and an explanation.  What they're reviewing though is kind of constrained. They are reviewing whether  there was a violation of Facebook's own policies. In other words, they can't just say,  no, no, no, you should put them back. The members will decide whether the content involved in this  case violated Facebook's community standards and values. They will also consider whether  Facebook's removal of the content respected international human rights standards, including  freedom of expression and other human rights. So there is a kind of a framework for them to  interpret this. They say they're going to move as promptly as possible. There's a 90 day limit.  So I don't know what that prompt means. Following publication, Facebook will have up to seven days  to implement the decision. And they also have to respond to any recommendations within 30 days.  So I think in a way this sounds sensible. I mean, there's lots of issues with the oversight board.  They can't review very many cases. There are millions that would like to be reviewed.  They did pick good people to do it. So, you know, I think I'll be interested to see what they say.

I don't think  anyone has a we have a lot of critics, but very few people are actually saying that's the way we  should do it. And the oversight board isn't, you know, it's probably I really, I genuinely think  it's the best hint of a path forward for these kinds of decisions. Now, of course, they could  really make the decision either way. And a lot of people are going to be happy about it. And a lot  of people are going to say that this is the worst decision ever made, or that they were in the pocket  of Zuckerberg anyway from the get go. Or, you know, I would be very surprised if they overturned it.

The great Jim Cutler, our official pro bono video guy, does a great job.  Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com. One thing we learned last year, the internet  is even more awesome, more useful anyway. If you can't go to the grocery store, buy groceries  online. Can't watch movies in the theater, watch movies online. Can't go to the doctor, visit the  doctor online. And of course, if you need stamps, you don't have to go to the post office. You can  go to Stamps.com. We've been using them for years. Stamps.com has saved small businesses all over  the country, thousands of hours and tons of money. They could save you too. We've got an amazing  bonus offer here. I'll tell you about that in a second. But let me tell you what Stamps.com does.  It allows you to do all your mailing and shipping without leaving your desk, using your computer,  your printer. You don't need a postage meter. You don't need special ink. You don't have to leave  the home or office or home office. You get all the services of the U.S. Postal Service at your desk.  And by the way, now UPS, the United Parcel Service as well. And you get big discounts on both,  both on mailing and shipping rates, whether you're a small office, just sending out brochures or  invoices, an online seller, shipping out orders, even a giant warehouse, sending thousands of  packages a day. Stamps.com can handle it all with ease. They don't just print out stamps.  They print labels right for the, you know, with a proper postage. We're going to show you how to get  a USB scale so you'll always know exactly what the right postage is. You just use your computer  for an official U.S. postage anytime you need it, for any letter, any package, any class of mail,  no matter where you're sending it, anywhere in the world. And I love it because once your mail is  ready, you just schedule a pickup or you could drop it off in a mailbox and boom, you're good to  go. The discounts are really mind bending with stamps.com five cents off every first class stamp,  up to 40% off priority mail. In UPS, man, even more 60 up to 62% off UPS shipping rates.  No wonder over 900,000 small businesses like ours use stamps.com. We've been using them  for almost a decade now. What are you waiting for? Make 2021 the year you stop going to the  post office and use stamps.com instead. We've got a great deal for you. No risk trial.

That's all you have to do.  Stamps.com. Never go to the post office again. Not that the post office isn't great. I love  the post office. I'll probably go in and wave at them and say hello, but when I need postage,  I'm going to use stamps.com. You should too. Stamps.com. Please use that offer code TWIT so  they know you saw it here. Stamps.com. Thank you, stamps.com. Big quarter for Netflix. What a  surprise, right? I mean, that's all we're doing is watching Netflix. Big subscriber growth.  I didn't realize how big Netflix was internationally. I should have known,  but the growth was even greater worldwide. The subscriber growth in the US and Canada  and around the world, 200 million paid subscribers. It had crossed 100 million two years ago.  Now it's at 200 million. And even more importantly, I didn't know this, Netflix  for the first time ever has enough money. They don't have to borrow to continue operations.  Did you know they were borrowing to keep it going? They're going to be free cash flow positive.  That's the term they use. They won't have to do any more borrowing. They do have a lot of debt,  but they'll be able to pay a lot down. They've borrowed $15 billion since 2011.  Isn't that amazing? I had no idea. They have 8.2 billion cash on hand though. So  this is good news. Even in the face of competition from Apple TV and Disney Plus  and Discovery Plus and HBO Max and on and on and on. Go ahead, Nate.

There was a lot of comparisons to HBO initially and how that worked very well for HBO,  but it seems like such a long time ago that whenever you thought of Netflix,  the only show that came to mind was either House of Cards or Orange is the New Black,  because for the longest time, they were among the only original pieces of content that you had on  Netflix. When was the last time anyone described Netflix as being the kind of bargain bucket of  video rentals? It's certainly how we used to describe it here, that if there was nothing else  that you wanted to watch, you'd go to Netflix. It was all junk, but it was fine, because sometimes  you're in the mood for junk. It's so not the case anymore and hasn't been for years. It's amazing.  So unsurprising, but now there's a lot more competition.

Transcript:  Well, and another testament to their success is the fact that every other streaming service  is copying it. HBO Max, when AT&T bought Time Warner or Warner Media, whatever it's called,  the new guy came in and said, we're going to be more like Netflix.  And they are.

Transcript:  We've got a really interesting situation in the UK where we've got both our state broadcasters,  the BBC, as well as a couple of the commercial broadcasters, including ITV, that have teamed up,  even though they're technically commercial rivals, they've teamed up to launch a streaming service.  It's called BritBox.  I subscribe and love it.  Okay, interesting. I'm in Britain and I don't.  You don't need it.  Yeah, this is the thing, but they push it at us. They sign up for wireless phone plans.  Often it's BritBox is an option right up there with Amazon prime or, or, or Disney plus or  something. So it's, and I have used it, but I let a trial lapse cause I just wasn't watching enough  on it. But, but the fact is, is that that's, that's the kind of competition that, that Netflix's  success has forced in regional markets. I mean, I say regional markets, one regional market,  but I imagine similar is playing out in other, in other parts of the world as well.  That maybe Louise's is more familiar with than I am, but that's the kind of thing that's actually  been very good for everyone as far as making content available is concerned, because we've  just got decades of shows that you cannot buy. You can maybe download them or get them on YouTube  somewhere, you know, it's a bit of a gray area, but it's, it's forced them to go through these  archives, bring stuff back. And there's some great TV shows that I've watched that I never would have  even known about, let alone had access to. And that's a by-product of Netflix's success.

Transcript:  Well, and the other thing that has done well is they're buying international stuff and they're  showing up as Netflix originals, but something like Berlin Babylon, which is produced in Germany  is such high quality content. And we wouldn't see it otherwise. I don't think in the U S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so that brings up a really great point, which is like, what don't you see when  things are not on Netflix? Right. So one thing I worry about with Netflix, you know, Amazon studios,  these big international companies with gigantic international presences, kind of being, you know,  some of the only buyers of original content. Like I look at what happened with the dissident, right?  This, you know, extremely acclaimed documentary by a very famous director, but it's about what  happened to Jamal Khashoggi in Saudi Arabia. Right. So, you know, they had a really hard time  getting that bought. Right. This is an Oscar winning documentarian. You know, of course,  documentaries always going to be a little niche. It's not going to be the house of cards. It's not  going to be the orange is the new black, but I do worry when there's only like, you know, I'm really  in favor of things like rip box because, you know, that's the kind of, you know, more niche  carrier that I think would want some of this stuff that, you know, maybe Netflix doesn't want to touch  because Netflix wants to keep gaining new users where it can. Right. Like that's sort of the  problem when you're that big is that you need to please everyone. And we've seen all of these  big streaming companies, not one stuff that's not kind to China. Right. You know,  Apple won't touch that. You're never going to see sort of a critical movie about China.  And that's also true of, you know, in big box offices. So that's what I worry about with these  companies going really global. So I want more stuff like Brit box. I want some of these local  players. Yeah. Yeah. And like, you know, Netflix tries to be, but they're never going to pick up  the really niche stuff. And I want them to, and I want there to be space. That's why I subscribed

Start time: 6733.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Criterion's great. Yeah. But it's amazing hearing Louise describe that because you can use the same  description as, as we did with parlor and Twitter. It's like Brit box is the parlor of video  streaming. It's a place where the niche don't make that the show title. That'd be awesome.

Transcript:  Yeah. There's problems with monopoly, right? And I think that that's what you're picking up on is  that there's definitely problems with monopoly and there's problems about content. But, you know,  I do think there's a little difference between like, I think Netflix and, you know, Apple's new,  what's it called? Apple TV. You know, they don't want to be blocked in some of these countries.  And that sort of seems like a slightly different political calculus, but I do hear what you're  saying. It's like, I think that there's, you know, a downside to these companies getting too big.

Start time: 6785.90

So it's good not  to, it's, I think there is really actually, that's a very interesting point you made because in the  same way that there's monolithic big tech companies dominating social media, I guess there's  monolithic streaming media companies, but it's important to keep these, as you say, Louise,  keep these small niche companies around so that we get to see more variety.

Transcript:  Paul Cudone I absolutely love it. And for quite a while,  quite a few years ago now at this point, back when we had, you know, media, well,  some people do still do have media servers under their cabinets, but I used to have like a bunch of  stuff that was entirely legitimately ripped from DVDs, etc. That I would just have cycling through  so I could switch a TV to a channel on and just watch whatever happened to be playing because it  was just all my own stuff. 10 minutes here, five minutes there, whatever. And that was really  great, but that doesn't exist anymore because all of my consumption is from cloud stuff.  So I really like this idea, but what I specifically want is to be able to make my own playlist  that when I press play, it's only shuffling stuff that I've added into a playlist because  that way I know what I'm getting. Whereas this seems to be the entire catalog.

Cruise, the self-driving vehicle startup from GM had just  did another round of investment, $2 billion round. Microsoft was one of the investors.  We don't know how much, but the thought is about half a billion dollars.  Its valuation now $30 billion. These cruise vehicles are driverless. They don't have a safety  driver even. It's just like a living room on wheels. And GM is putting a lot of money into  this. It'll be very interesting to see where they go.

Transcript:  Louise Yeah, I think I sort of trust the idea. I think that it's probably better than a normal  driver in the long run. I think that there's a lot of problems with the technology that need to be  hammered out. But I'm also not a good driver. I'm a huge advocate of public transportation.  And I think I worry about in the long term how these things will be democratized. Because I  would like to see a world where we're all using cars less, not that we're using AI cars. So I do  sort of worry about what's the path we're getting on. But I do think it's probably better. But I  just worry we're going to have this world where if you're a little bit richer, you get the AI  Uber first and then everyone else is still using the normal bus and then public transportation is  even more screwed. What about the AI bus? You know what I mean? That's what I want first before  the AI car. Yeah. I have some of this to be a little bit more like ensure that we're really  supporting people.

December 31st Adobe killed flash, but I think they didn't  realize that they would also kill the railroad system in Northern China and Dalian. It collapsed  citywide for 20 hours. Apparently the China, China railway Shenyang was running on flash. They were  using flash for train operation, for scheduling, for shunting. And when flash stopped working,  so did the railroad. You would think knowing that flash was going away three years ago, they would  have maybe planned better. Apparently not. However, good news. They were able to fix the issue  by installing a pirated version of flash and they were back up running, running the next day.  Amazing. I love that. Speaking of China, you had a great story on, I didn't, I mean, who knew this?  This is why I love rest of world because we're learning about stuff that the cuts wrote war to  dominate China's grocery delivery industry. Is there a grocery delivery industry in China?

So it's  really big and it's really, really innovative and it's attracting sort of like grandmas almost,  like aunties, you know, people who are really price conscious. So imagine you have a group chat  and all of your neighbors are in that group chat and you have sort of like, you know, maybe a local  stay at home mom or someone, you know, maybe the corner store owner, someone who, you know,  owns a seven 11 and they are the moderator of that group chat. And every single day they give you some  crazy deals for fresh food. And all you have to do is in that group chat, say what you want.  And the next day, the stay at home mom will get it all delivered to her place and then she'll bring  it to you or you go pick it up at the corner store. So they're called group buying groups.

Transcript:  which is the Uber of China is invested in this, you know, every 10 cent JD.com, Alibaba, all the  biggest tech companies are investing in this all over the place. It's a huge frenzy to sort of like  get all these people. Cause to your point, these are people who didn't usually buy groceries online.  They would just go to that corner store and get the stuff previously. But what this is doing is  it's letting all those big tech companies cut a ton of costs. They get marketing from the stay at  home mom. They get logistics. They don't have to go to each person's home, right? The stay at home  mom will take care of that for them. So the problem is-  And she makes money too, right? She gets paid.  She gets about five to 10% commission. So she's incentivized to get, you know,  as many people as possible. Most of these people have, you know, anywhere from a couple hundred to  900 people that they're managing. So it's huge for them. And it can be, you know, it can be a big  source of business for them. And it's a crazy trend in China and it's become, you know, really,  really wild. Actually two employees at one of the companies that has invested in this actually died.  Recently, which sort of set off this huge reckoning about like, you know, are they pushing  employees too hard at these companies? You know, is this frenzy worth it? The government is mad  about it. But I love it because it's like stay at home mom selling vegetables, but everyone in tech

Well, as you point out, it's in the article,  it's highly customized because this one person who is managing this group gets to know everybody,  their interests, their tastes, what they want, what they don't like. So it works. It sounds like  it works really well. I have to say, yeah. And like, come on, if you're like cute little

Like come grab them tomorrow with your eggs and  your milk or whatever. Of course I would do it. Do you think this could, this model could work in  the rest of the world? I think that like, you know, when I think about someone like my mom,  who's like not going to navigate Instacart probably, but you know, knows how to use  iMessage. The thing is that it's integrated into WeChat, right? And we don't really have  integration here in the same way. So I think we're sort of far off, but I do think, you know,  this is supercharged by the pandemic. There are way more people buying groceries online than there  used to be. And I think that Instacart is like ripe for disruption. I think that like, you know,  Whole Foods delivery is not doing anything particularly innovative. And I think that even  Amazon and some of these logistics giants are still really struggling with how to make a profit  off of this. And these Chinese companies have sort of figured out a way to do it. Although to be fair,  they're offering really, really low prices because these are really price conscious  consumers and suppliers are getting mad because they're like, you know, selling a bottle of cooking  oil for like less than the actual cost to make it. So there are a lot of sort of, it reminds me of  when it was like $2 taken Uber anywhere because they were just pouring money on it and get a 50%  off Lyft ride. If you just open the Uber app and the Lyft app, you know, notice that you were doing  that. We all remember this. It feels like that. So I do worry it's sort of gimmicky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we didn't. We weren't cool enough, unfortunately, but I did come over to the  San Francisco office a fair bit. I had some beer out of your beer robot.  I'm glad to hear it. It's a nice office.

Start time: 8275.50
End time: 8279.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I made it over there. Did you hear of Beeper?

Start time: 8281.38
End time: 8330.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't even mention Beeper. And this kind of puzzles me because it doesn't seem like this  solves a problem that hasn't been solved, but it's from the guy who started Pebble, right?  I message on Android using a weird hack. Now I'm already using something called Air Message.  You have to keep a Mac running all the time, running the Air Message server.  It takes the Apple messages, puts them on the server, and then I can use  Air Messages on my Android to check my Apple messages. So in effect, it's a hack,  but it puts Apple messages on Android. They're going to do that. But then they said  for people who don't have or don't want to keep their Mac running all the time,  they're going to send them old iPhone 4S jailbroken.

Start time: 8331.68
End time: 8355.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jailbroken iPhone. I mean, the goal initially is to have a unified private message app.  So the goal isn't just to have a-  It's like Pidgin or Adium or what? Yeah.  Except they also do iMessage through that ridiculous hack. I don't think anyone is going  to want to keep the- But maybe, I don't know.

Start time: 8356.50

Transcript:  I keep my iMac running as a server for Air Messages day and night.

Start time: 8360.10
End time: 8401.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just feel like how many message platforms do most people have? And I also think some people  like to turn some of them off. Some people want to pause their work notifications on the weekend,  and they wouldn't want to pause their iMessages. So I just wonder how much- This is for a really  connected person or someone who has so much inbound stuff coming to them. I almost think it  might be good for a real estate agent or someone who's dealing with a lot of inbound communications  from all over the place, maybe a content creator or something like that. But I just don't know if  this is going to appeal to most people. I agree.  I think if you have five or six different social media accounts, you have an email address,  you're posting stuff on TikTok, on Instagram, it's definitely really helpful to look at that

Start time: 8402.14
End time: 8436.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all in one place. But it's cool though. It's kind of like the consumer version of something like  Twilio or Messagebird.  Or Salesforce even.  Yeah, like this unified inbox that you can WhatsApp to it, you can WeChat to it, or you can email it  and vice versa. It doesn't matter. I don't like them in principle because I think you're adding  another link that security can be compromised because of. But for pure convenience, if you  don't care about security or privacy, then go nuts, I suppose.

Start time: 8437.64
End time: 8471.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like the real problem here is a proliferation of messaging platforms.  I agree.  Because everybody uses a different one. I understand beepers trying to solve that,  but it's not going to solve it. Can we all just decide on one? I don't care what it is.  Signal would be fine. Telegram would be fine. I see Q would be fine. Can we just please stop the  insanity? By the way, Pigeon's still around. Libpurple still works and you still can do it  with a lot of different things. I don't know. I just want.

Then you too can have a  show with Tom Merritt. And of course, not Patrick. Patrick Béja, always welcome on this show. He does  so many shows. They're all at notpatrick.com and he's not Patrick on the Twitter. Great to see you.  Congratulations on that new show. Work Insanity. Yes. Also with Tom Merritt.

Transcript:  Right. Thank you, Patrick. Thank you, Louise. Thank you, Nate. Really great having you. It's  always nice when we have such a smart panel. Lots to talk about. I hope you enjoyed our show today.  We do This Week in Tech Sunday afternoons, 2.30 Pacific, 5.30 Eastern Time, 22.30 UTC. And the  reason I give you the time we record is you can watch us live. We have a live stream at all hours  of the day or night at twit.tv slash live. It's live audio or video. Watch whatever you want. If  you're watching live, the chat room also goes 24 seven at irc.twit.tv. Lovely people in there.  So I encourage you to check that out. irc.twit.tv. If you want to download the shows and listen at  your leisure, of course you can do that. All of our shows are available at twit.tv. We also have a  full bore YouTube channel for every single show, including This Week in Tech. You can subscribe  there. My favorite thing would be if you would get a podcast client, doesn't matter which,  and subscribe in that because that way you get it automatically. You don't have to think about it.  And if you're ever in the mood for another twit, you can just fire up your podcast client and there  it'll be waiting for you. It's that time again. Our annual survey is going strong. We don't want  to miss your feedback. So please help us out. Go to twit.tv slash survey 21 to take the survey.  It closes next month, but it helps us understand our audience, helps us make your podcasts better  suited to you. It also helps us sell advertising. We don't spy on you. We don't track you. Once a  year, we ask you a few questions, completely optional and only take a few minutes, but it  sure would help if you go to twit.tv slash survey 21 and thanks in advance. We have a couple of ways  you can interact with us. We have a wonderful forums at www.twit.community. Those are discourse  forums and they're really good and many of our hosts hang out there. It's a great way to comment  on any show. Every show has an entry there so you can comment there. We also, as I mentioned,  have a Mastodon instance at twit.social and you're welcome to join us there if you're not already on  Mastodon. The way Mastodon works, it's like a federated Twitter. So you join an instance and  there are hundreds and hundreds of them. In fact, if you go to joinmastodon.org, I think you can  pick an instance that you like, but one of them is twit.social. You could follow the folks locally  on that instance or follow anybody on any other instance because it's federated. And so I think  it's a nice antidote to Twitter. Not quite so busy, but a lot of fun. You're welcome to join us  there. No charge, of course, for that. That's it for this edition of This Week in Tech. Thank you,  everybody. Have a great week. We'll see you next week and another twit.
