The show where we cover the latest tech news.  And every week I put together a panel of people I love and want to talk to and we did it again.  Thank you Jason Howell, producer extraordinaire. Georgia Dow is here from Montreal.  She's the internet's psychotherapist. And my personal shrink. Hi Georgia.  Hello, it's nice to be here. It's been a little bit. Great to see you. Georgia at Westmount Therapy if you're feeling low.  If it's an emergency, you know, call whatever your emergency number is in your country.  But if you just want a little somebody to talk to, Georgia's there. And we appreciate that.  Thank you, George. George always makes me smile. Also with us, one of my favorite people and now internet superstar,  Mike Masnick. Hi Mike from Tech Dirt. Hello. You may have seen that little article about him in the New York Times.  Cashmere Hills profile. Headlined an internet veteran's guide to not being scared of technology.  I feel like cash probably didn't write that. I'm guessing not. Yeah, I'm guessing that's a bizarre headline.  Mike Masnick who founded Tech Dirt in 1998. By the way, she dissed you a little bit on the website.  I have to say. Yeah, she did. Didn't she? Writes for an influential audience of lawmakers, CEOs and activists.  Somehow he's still an optimist about the promise of technology. I think that's fair as well.  Sure. Yeah. And I noticed they didn't really let you out of the office for any of the photos.  You're like stuck in the office the whole time, which is hysterical. It was a difficult photo shoot.  Was it? You don't look super comfortable, I must say.  You look like you're in better shape than the ficus behind you though. That is not doing well.

Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know why they... I mean the photographer was there for a few hours.  And these are the ones they used, huh? I'm a little surprised at the choice of photos. I mean,  it is true that there was not much to work with and we tried to look around to see if there was  somewhere near the office. We took photos outside. I thought there were probably some with  the sky in the background that might be nice, but for whatever reason, those are the photos they...

Transcript:  You know what? I did learn something from this, besides the fact that your website looks like  it's from 1998. I personally think your website is supremely functional and don't touch it.  If it started looking fancy, I wouldn't trust you as much. It's exactly what it should look like.  But I didn't know that you coined the term Streisand effect.  That's correct. Oh, wow. Yeah. See, I'm telling you.  That's really cool. Yeah.

Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  Do you want to tell everyone when they say it? Do you want to be like, that was me?  That was me, guys. That was me. And no one would believe you. They'd be like, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, people don't believe me, but I invented it, honest. When we have Christmasina on,  he invented the hashtag, right? People in the know know, but you can't go around saying,  well, yeah, I invented that. But I want to tell everybody.  You have to have a t-shirt. That's what you need.  Yeah. Then they really wouldn't believe you. So when did you coin Streisand effect? I didn't

Start time: 311.82
End time: 334.08
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  realize that. It was 2005. So the event where Streisand sued the photographer happened in 2003.  I wrote about it at the time in the whole scenario in which she sued, and then this photo that had  a grand total of eight views before she sued, then immediately shot up to a whole...

Start time: 334.22
End time: 347.46
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  It was a picture of her house.  Exactly.  And yeah, it's in Wikipedia now.  Yes.  Good job, Barbara. But I don't blame her, but that's why we need a term for it, the Streisand

End time: 366.08
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  effect. Yeah. So yeah, I called it that in 2005, and then it took off. That was not through any  work of my own. I have no idea why it caught on. I just thought it was a fun thing at the end of  an article. It was apt. It was very apt.  And now it's taken on a whole life of its own.

Transcript:  Anyway, excellent. Well, and I have to say well-deserved article about you in the New  York Times. I think it was this week. Thank you.  And in fact, I thought we'll never get Mike on the show now. It's all over.  He's a big star now. No, it happens.

He's... Good to see you, Janko. Thank you.  Good to see you too, Leo.  You don't age at all. I don't understand.  Not quite true.  It's just weird. Anyway, lopass.cc is his Beehive newsletter.  Well worth subscribing. Lots of great stories. In fact, we'll be talking about some of them.  But the big story in Hollywood this week is Barbie in a billion dollars in revenue.  In what? Like less than a week, a week and a half.  Have you seen Barbie yet, Georgia? Why am I asking you?  I should ask one of the guys, right? Have you seen her?  You should ask one of the guys. Yes.  Yes. It's kind of...  There's a little pink in your shot. Have you seen Barbie yet?

Start time: 465.78
End time: 479.18
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  No, no. To be honest, I haven't gone out to a movie in years. So I haven't gone out  to a movie since pre-pandemic. So I have not had a chance to see Barbie yet.

Start time: 480.24
End time: 515.22
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe I'll see it at some point. Today's board op, Jammer B, guy running the board,  rented a movie theater so we could see the newest Dr. Strange movie a year or so ago.  That was the only time I've been to the theater since COVID. But I am going to go see Oppenheimer  and IMAX on Friday, finally. It's Friday because there's only a small sweet spot in IMAX theater.  It was like this hole was eaten out of all the seating charts for weeks ahead. I finally got a  seat. It's only five rows from the screen, but that's the best I could do.

Start time: 515.48
End time: 518.02
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  So where is the best spot in an IMAX?

Start time: 519.26
End time: 620.40
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Kind of a third of the way up and in the center. Sound is really important. So you want to sit in  the middle so you get the stereo effect. But obviously you can't be too close to the screen  because you'll be like having a crick in your neck at the end of the show.  You could sit farther, I think a third or farther back. But I think most people kind  of center of the center is that's how it gets. If you look at the ticket sales,  it blossoms from the middle of the seating chart out. Anyway, I'm looking forward to seeing that.  That will be my first real movie with other people. But apparently Barbie's changed the world.  Also the highest gross for any female director, previously held by Patty Jenkins,  for Wonder Woman if you're collecting trivia. Wow, a billion dollar ticket sales. 400 million  domestic, 500 million internationally faster than any other movie the studio has ever produced,  including Harry Potter. Only 53 movies have made over a billion dollars, not accounting for inflation.  Wonder Woman did 821 million, Frozen did 1.3 billion, Frozen 2 1.45 billion. I bet you've seen  both of those too, Georgia. I have.  So for those of us who have not yet seen the Barbie movie, and by the way, I want to just  in my defense say I tried to get Lisa to go see the Barbie movie with me, and she absolutely  adamantly refused. So I wasn't going to go by myself. That seemed a little too much.

Start time: 622.98
End time: 625.20
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  That would have been really cute though. You could have worn pink.

Start time: 625.46

Speaker: Leo Laporte

Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  You buy the ticket for the sweet spot in the middle of the movie.

Start time: 633.34
End time: 648.48
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  In the middle. I got the best seat. In IMAX.  That's what you really went to see. It's Friday, you're going to see Barbie in IMAX.  Barbie in IMAX is the real deal. Now we know. You just didn't want to admit it.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Is it a good movie? People say it's a good movie.

Start time: 651.56
End time: 687.26
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  So it's an enjoyable movie. I did not find it as deep or in-depth. I think that the issues  of women and empowerment and equality have been something that I already discussed and have  discussed for a really long time. I think that it made it much more mainstream, but I think that  the opposite effect that also has is that other people can be angry. I think that people feel  like it was man-hating and that it was actually causing a rift between men and women instead of  bringing people together, which I don't think was what the movie intended. I don't think that that

Start time: 687.44
End time: 691.50
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  was the message of it. There were people on the right who said it was anti-man.

Start time: 692.66
End time: 747.20
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  Yes. I don't find that it's anti-man, but I can understand where they're coming from with that.  Because it is very pushing equality and what it looks like to see the lens from  an opposite kind of way. Like the Barbie world. It's a girl's world. So they see all these  swimsuit models on the screen and they go, oh, look, the Supreme Court. It's a completely  different world. But I think that it also says, and this they did not say, but I kind of thought  too, is that if women were in power, that doesn't mean that the world would be a much sweeter kind  of world. Anyone in power can often want to protect that and often could push other people aside,  which I think was the underlying message also that people always get.

Transcript:  I bet it makes the haunchos at HBO a little upset and Zaslov deserves it because they took  the idol, which was originally shot by a female director, and they fired her because it was too  much from a woman's point of view. This was a show that was on HBO. The Weeknd was kind of  the producer of it. So he had a major role and it was terrible. It was horrible. They reshot it.  It was very sexist and just an awful show with terrible ratings. I'm thinking they really missed  a bet. This proves there's an audience. What's wrong with having a feminine point of view? Nothing.  Anyway, the reason that's maybe important is because this is probably one of the last movies.  The writer's strike is now kicking in and in fact, Screen Actors Guilds have followed  with a strike. Most Hollywood production is shut down. In fact, Yanko, didn't the  Association of Motion Picture and Television Producers, Alliance of Motion Picture and  Television Producers meet with the Writer's Guild on Friday and nothing?

Start time: 822.55
End time: 834.51
Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  I'm not completely up to date, but it wouldn't surprise me. Those things linger for much longer.  There was this whole theory that somebody brought up that they're just waiting for the writers to  basically give up. It wasn't a theory. The producer said it out loud. We're just going to wait until

Start time: 837.34
End time: 850.98
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  they lose their houses and then they'll settle. That's not going to work. I feel like that's a  little vicious. Oh, okay. You're not covering Hollywood as much as you used to. You used to

Start time: 852.82
End time: 857.28
Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  write for Variety. I used to write for Variety, but I always covered more the tech side of it.

Start time: 858.94
End time: 943.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Well, there is a tech side to it because one of the big issues is AI. There are many other issues.  The biggest issue, of course, residuals in a streaming world is not the same as residuals  used to be. Movie extras, NPR had a story, are worried about getting scanned and replaced,  essentially. NPR quoted an extra who was working on Wandavision who said after her four weeks of  working as a background, it's not an extra exactly, it's a background actor, after four weeks,  she was told by the production crew to report to a tractor trailer where she and other background  actors were scanned one by one in front of, she reports, a series of cameras on metal rigs behind  glass. Have your hands out, have your hands in, look this way, look that way. Let us see your  scared face. Let us see your surprised face. They were scanned for about 15 minutes and digital  replicas were created. Hollywood says, we'll never use those on any production that's, you know,  they're not already on, but I think that's one of the concerns SAG has about this. And of course,  writers are concerned that AI will be used to create scripts. I've read some of the AI  crypts that's created scripts. I'm not too worried, but who knows? AI is getting better and better.

Start time: 945.22
End time: 980.58
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  It's a scary thing to think that you don't have a right over, like, you know, you give up your right  once and then they could use it and then suddenly you're in a hemorrhoid commercial and you're the  butt and you didn't even, you know, get paid for it. And now suddenly, you know, you don't have a  right of where you're going to be used nor asked. Like there has to be, like, this is kind of that  brave new world of what technology can be amazing. But also we have to make sure that we've gone  through and made sure because if not, someone is going to try. And suddenly you're in a movie and  you're like, I can't believe, look at me, they're sitting in that seat that I didn't get paid for  choose to be part of that movie. Yeah.

Start time: 981.50
End time: 1038.26
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  Yeah. The thing that I don't understand is that there are laws. I mean, we do have  publicity rights laws. They're state by state. So they're different depending on which state you're  in. But most states have some variation on that. And to me, this seems like I have a lot of problems  with often how those laws are actually used in practice. But this seems like exactly what those  laws are for. And so I'm sort of surprised that there's a lot less talk of it. There's a lot of  talk about copyright and AI, which I think is the wrong discussion. But publicity rights laws  are like the exact example of this kind of thing. And so I don't understand why people aren't  talking about that because I think that prevents this kind of usage. Of course, the response to  that is scanning people is one thing, but it's not that long until they can just design fake people  to stand in for you in the first place. The scanning part is kind of meaningless.

Start time: 1038.50
End time: 1066.88
Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  You know, actually, the scanning part might be part of that, right? Because you still need some  training data for all of that to happen. So now they're accumulating these scans with the idea of,  well, we're just going to put you in the background more often in this one production.  But I think the danger really there is that once they have enough people scan, they can just use  that to then do meta-humans or whatever and have AI humans that don't really look at any of those  scans anymore. So there's no question of compensation anymore. Actually, you say meta-human.

Start time: 1067.02
End time: 1128.08
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  That's an actual technology Unreal Engine is using to create virtual humans that are  indistinguishable from real humans. And you're right, they need training data. And that's maybe  how the AMPTP is getting away with this. It's, well, we would never use these scans in another  image, another picture, another TV show. But yeah, it's training data. It won't be you. It'll be you  merged with you, merged with you. And we're going to use that instead. Here's my question for you,  Mike. Because when we worked at Tech TV, we'd have people sign releases before they're on.  And invariably, the release would say something like, we have all rights to your image in all  forms of media now known or forever to be invented in perpetuity. There's always that little  clause that allows you to use it in publicity and other things. I bet you that there's some  contractual agreement that allows this. Wouldn't that supersede any laws?

Start time: 1129.48
End time: 1157.04
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  It really depends. Again, all of these things are very context dependent and the specifics and the  facts of each case really, really matter. But the idea that if they were taking somebody who is real  and putting them somewhere that they have never been and presenting them as if they were in that  video, I think that publicity rights laws would protect them. And certainly that's one of the

Start time: 1157.18
End time: 1161.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  reasons that unions are striking and actors are striking is to make sure that that's also in

Start time: 1162.38
End time: 1193.82
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  the contracts. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it also does become a contractual issue. And that is where I  think the strike part is really important is that negotiating this in the first place is really  important, which goes back to that story with the scanning. I understand that people who are  background actors or extras maybe don't have a lot of power in that situation. But it still strikes me  as, why would you agree to be scanning? Yeah, walk away.

Start time: 1193.98
End time: 1239.26
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  But they may not know when you're signing and you need to eat. You may not know everything that you  sign. And I think that they need to go through to make sure, because let's just say it, these  contracts, no one reads them, like whatever percentage of 1% will read them, but no one  reads them. They don't know what's in it. And so I think that this is really important that people,  you know, again, $250 could feed someone for like two weeks. So it becomes really difficult to be  able to know what's there. And I think we need to have contracts be something that is legible,  easy to read, not a whole bunch of fine print. And I think that we need to kind of overhaul contract  law so that people that don't need to hire a lawyer, because let's be honest, most people  can't afford to hire a lawyer to be able to look over a contract before they're going to be signing

Start time: 1239.40
End time: 1244.52
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to. And that's a union's job is to kind of make a boilerplate agreement that everybody's.

Start time: 1245.40
End time: 1279.00
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  And that is where this aspect of the strike is important, where they can make that clear and  understand that and don't rely on people who have no power in the position to have to agree to it,  just to be able to eat. That is where the union is supposed to step in and say, we're going to  create a contract that is fair, that prevents this kind of thing, or at least sets it up in a way that  this person has either payment or a clear decision of what it is that they're agreeing to, and that  it's not in perpetuity for any project ever going into the future. And the flip side is you could

Start time: 1279.16
End time: 1310.76
Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  also imagine that there could be a fair contract for it, right? So I think the article mentions it's  $187 per day for a background actor to basically sit around all day and then sit in a cafe and  pretend to talk for five minutes. If now this person was scanned one time and then they use  that multiple times or multiple shoots, they get compensated every time that gets used in a shoot,  that might actually be more money in the end, or maybe it's a lot less work for a comparative  amount of money. So one could imagine a scenario that works out well, but obviously the studios

Start time: 1311.68
End time: 1333.12
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  would rather probably go a different route. But again, going back to the point that you made  earlier, where if this is just for training data, and then you're just creating models,  then you can't associate the particular model with the original actor, so the actor's not going to  get paid if it's a fully synthetic model. Is this legitimate? I mean, we're really seeing

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  creatives, artists, writers, Sarah Silverman is suing because their stuff is being used for AI  training. And of course, the product of that training will not be the same. So it's under,  I guess, fair use, it's transformational. But creatives are really starting to get more and  more concerned about this. And actually, we all should be that are I mean, I'm sure Yanko,  they've taken every article of yours and added that to a model and LLM, large language model.  That's got to be concerning. If you're the person creating the human creating the original,  that at some point, your content is going to be used for training.

Start time: 1376.96
End time: 1412.32
Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  Yes, and no, I think I'm not too concerned to be quite honest, same as I'm not concerned that  Google is caching my articles or the Internet Archive is archiving my articles. I think there's  good points to be made for all of those use cases. And then flip side is, how do you compensate four  billion people for all their writing that they ever put online? Yeah, may or may not be used in  a training model, which may or may not result in any article that may or may not compete with my  work in the future. So really muddy thing there. If I'm Sam Altman of OpenAI, I'm going to argue

Start time: 1412.48
End time: 1432.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  this stuff's public. It's on the internet. We're just scanning public materials. You put it out  there if you don't want it out there. Although I kind of agree with Google's plan to add a robots  dot tech style metadata to site saying, please don't add this to an AI training model. I think

Start time: 1432.62
End time: 1443.36
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  that would be a good way to handle that. I think that's it is a not necessary under the law, but a  reasonable move for them to make in order to appease a bunch of people who are very angry.

Transcript:  So Sarah Silverman and other comics are suing Sarah Silverman has a book,  Bedwetter. And her point is her attorney's point is you could go to chat GPT and say summarize  Sarah Silverman's Bedwetter book and it gets a full summary. And she's saying, well, how do they

Start time: 1461.34
End time: 1490.72
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  know? But yeah, I think that one is a pretty bad lawsuit. I wrote something about it a few weeks  ago. I think her lawyers are the same ones. They filed a bunch of the lawsuits. There's like,  I think there are seven or eight copyright. So it's kind of ambulance chasers for LLMs.  Yeah, they've filed a few of them and I don't think it's a strong lawsuit because  if you, and people get mad at me for this. So I'm like, do I want to start this and have people?

Start time: 1491.20
End time: 1503.14
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  No, but it's important. It's important. I agree with you. In fact, I've dismissed all of the  artists' copyright claims. Same thing. Tell us why though. I feel like it's transformational.

It's, you know, to me, the argument that I keep making is, you know,  in her lawsuit, she presents this, you know, ask chat GPT for a summary of her book and it gives one  and the summary is not very good. It reads like, you know, a middle school book report.  And then you begin to think like, is someone doing a middle school book report? Is that  infringing? Well, no, that would be ridiculous. And to some extent, and yes, there are differences  and yes, the intent is different, but all the chat GPT is effectively doing is kind of a middle  school book report. And so like ingesting the content, reading the content, learning from it,  and then being able to summarize it should not be copyrighted. If you asked me to summarize

That's a good point.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So I, it's, you know, this focus, again, it goes back to like the focus on copyright,  I think is the wrong focus. It is where everybody goes. And I think it's, it's sort of a symptom of  the last, you know, whatever 50, a hundred years where Hollywood in particular has convinced  everyone that the only tool possible to protect artists for anything is copyright. And so everyone's  jumping on this on AI and saying, Oh, we have to have copyright law protect us. And it's, I think  it's the wrong tool. And it leads to really weird lawsuits and really weird claims and really weird

Speaker: Mike Masnick

But in the case where you are legitimately  copying someone and presenting them as if they, they did write something or they are appearing in  something that they did not, publicity rights takes care, takes care of that.

And some states say no, once the person has  died, you can do whatever you want with them. So that one is a little more complicated.  And so in some cases you don't, I don't, I don't remember the specifics with, with the Fred Astaire  and the vacuum cleaner, if they had to pay the estate or not. There's a very famous Fred Astaire

Start time: 1713.10
End time: 1728.16
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  there are things like, there's like, you know, historical fiction that takes real people and  puts them into fictional arenas. And we think that's okay for the most part. I think it would be a  problematic world in which you had to get the estates okay to put a real life figure into a

Start time: 1728.16

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  historical fiction. But you see how complicated this is. Yeah. And I could see an actor going to  the Unreal Engine's MetaHuman technology. And look, look how Unreal Epic publicizes this. Look how  easy, high fidelity digital humans made easy, you know, that you can create background actors  from software that are good and realistic. Now, obviously it's trained on something,  but do the people whose faces were used in the training, do they have rights to the result? I  don't, I don't know. We just, this is, and I could see why. So what I'm thinking is happening is  you're right, Mike, there's probably not a lot of legal recourse for Sarah Silverman or a Thomas  Kincaid, the painter of light to get money from OpenAI. But there's definitely this feeling in  the world of creatives that, well, they owe us something. Sure. Is that unreasonable?

Start time: 1817.64

Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  Yanko was saying where it's like, you know, I'm, I'm not particularly worried. You know, I have  51,000 articles written and I actually hope that AI reads through all of them and that I could  go into chat GPT and say, write a tech-tored article about X and, and not, not being Twitter,  but maybe, you know, write an article about this. And, you know, and I know it's not going to be  great, but like, would that help me be more productive? I think it might be. And I think  that would actually be useful. So I think, you know, not that in every case that, that like,  there's an obvious way that it makes people more productive or more useful or whatever,  but I think there are a lot of cases where that is going to be true. And I think that  the focus for people should be to, to look for that. And the example I've used, and I think it  was even mentioned in that article about the body scanning was, was Grimes, you know, the singer who  released the AI version of her voice and said, anyone go ahead and make songs with AI Grimes.  And you just have to give me 50% of any revenue. Very important. You have to give me 50%. Sure.  Yeah. But it's a contractual setup that says, I am going to, instead of like trying to shut  this down and block it, I'm going to encourage it, but structured in a way that I benefit from.  And so I think that the more that people start looking at this technology is in, how can I make  it, you know, a useful thing rather than saying like, this has to be stopped entirely. I think  the sort of more forward looking approach rather than like, I need to get paid for what happened  before. It's just going to be a more overall beneficial setup. And there's probably models

Start time: 1929.04
End time: 1968.40
Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  to make that work for smaller creators too. And this comes to sort of collective licensing models,  the type of things that have worked in the music industry for decades, essentially. Right. So  the unions have big influence, obviously in Hollywood, if they were to structure a contract  and say, you can only make films with union actors, if you pay, I don't know, 3% into this  big pool and we're going to dole it out to all our members as a flat fee at the end of the year  for their use in AI work, because it's going to happen regardless. It's a lot harder to track  those types of things, but I think there's probably models to make it also work financially.

Start time: 1968.86
End time: 2019.86
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's interesting, but that also gets tricky, right? Because then you could say like,  okay, I mean, that sounds great. Have this 3% fund that then gets distributed to, you know,  all the background actors or whatever who were used to train the models. But then you get to  this world in which, you know, every background actor and every show or movie is from that. And  you block out the ability for new actors to get into that pool. Right. And then suddenly you have  this like, you know, people who are 85, 90 years old getting paid for being, you know, the model  on which a 27 year old was based on or whatever. And so, you know, I'm not against that kind of  model where there's some sort of like, you know, collective licensing or however you want to  structure it, but that it does raise a bunch of questions about how that actually plays out  in practice and then what that means for the overall market as well. Maybe this really is

Start time: 2043.12
End time: 2089.28
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  become something that we need to discuss. I feel like there is a certain amount of  whistling past the graveyard though with you and Mike and Yanko and me, because I have more than  20,000 hours of content on the internet publicly available and you too, Georgia, you're putting all  those videos up that we say, well, no one can duplicate what we do. What we do is so special.  As humans, we're so good that, oh, go ahead, let them have it. That may be a little short term,  okay, but long term, that may be problematic. We may regret that because you're right. Right now,  it's a middle schooler's report on Sarah Silverman, but in some amount of time, five, 10, 15 years,

Start time: 2090.18
End time: 2182.72
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  it might be better than Sarah Silverman. Well, let's say it's probably going to be much faster  than five, 10, 15 years. Right? Like in one year, we can already see that these articles are quite  good, like not always. And if they're bad, they're really, really terrible. But these are things that  I think that everyone, we were made to think that for me, it'll be different and that I don't have  to worry. I'm too good to be duplicated. Yeah, we feel much more comfortable. That's our safe zone.  So as humans, we like to stay in that feeling of everything's safe. And then we have other  personality types that are the opposite. They're like, the world is crumbling and people like me,  we have to wear the tinfoil hat. And so because of those two extremes, which probably neither of them  are accurate, we end up not really taking care of things because people are like, oh, someone that  says that, oh, we have to make sure that we've actually made sure that contracts cover people for  maybe you, not just that you use the license and you get paid, but do you have a say in which way  is your likeness going to be used and how? Like we still, that's an area of contract law that is  relatively weak because it's like, we can just use it for everything and anything now and forever.  Don't ask us and we can change the contract at any time. We'll kind of let you know,  but it's considered that you've already accepted that. Like there's certain areas where it's like,  that seems much more sketchy. So I think that we need to kind of be in that middle ground where  you know, trust, trust, trust in the world, but make sure that you, you know, take care of your

Start time: 2182.84

Start time: 2189.84
End time: 2229.42
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  but it's important. That's an important insight. The one thing I would add though is like, I'm not,  I don't, I don't think that like right now, yes, the AI is not as good. I'm sure that the AI is  going to catch up. I, but I, I actually would like that. Right. I mean, I feel like I'm right.  Whistling past the graveyard, Mike. I don't know. I feel like I write about 10 to 15% of what I  would actually like to write. And I would love to be able to point a little plastic AI and, and,  and pointed out, I want to, this story is happening. I want to write a Mike Masnick take on it.  I think that would be really handy for me. What about, what do you feel about someone else saying,

But just the fact that like, if somebody thinks that, that my takes have enough value that they

Cause I, you know, like I said, there's 20,000 hours of, or more of my audio and video would be  trivial to synthesize me. And I'm sure in some point AI get good enough to synthesize me. It's  indistinguishable from the original. If I use that, that's fine. If, you know, if I can retire  and all these shows are done by an AI, that's fine. But if somebody created a Twi'k clone  and did all of that and started eating our audience up, I would not be happy about that.

The thing is like we we've been hearing for, for like five or six  years now about how this exact scenario was going to happen where there were going to be deep fakes,  especially in the political realm, and they were going to fool people. They've been bad so far,  right? I can't think of a single example. The only thing that I've, I've seen has been sort of in  reverse where somebody has been caught doing something bad and then trying to claim that it  was a deep fake to try and get out of responsibility for it. And so yes, like there is still the  possibility that we're going to see a deep fake that, you know, is somehow realistic enough that  it fools people. But the one thing that, you know, that gives me at least some calm is that  we haven't seen one yet that's been all that successful. We will see one in this election.

Start time: 2693.92

Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  But our brain believes things that we see. So much so that if you're in VR and you know that you're  in your living room and you're at like, you know, a 15th floor, many people have a panic attack when  they're walking a plank over the 15th floor out of the building. Because our brain, our occipital  area of our lobe is so large that what we see will believe. Like anything you see often enough  and it's repeated starts to reform the way that we see things. And if you're very technologically

Start time: 2733.38
End time: 2791.84
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  that was the case. Yes, we are adapted for that. And that was a good thing then.  And then we deal with people that might not be as technologically savvy or that already have that  cognitive dissonance that they want to believe something. And when we're talking about our  belief system of what we want. So if your alignment is with a political party and  that becomes your identity, you want to believe that so much so that you'll actually work reality  around it. And we've probably all been around people on whichever side that work reality  around their party. And even if you get the truth, you don't even need it. It doesn't even matter.  So that little tiny possibility is all that they need to kind of latch onto because if their party  is the one that's going to fail, they need to have something to be able to hold onto. And so it gives  us that excuse to be able to believe something. And so you'll actually, you actually don't believe  something even if there's facts. And the weirdest part is that true facts will actually make you

And if you don't believe that because when it's  one of those core beliefs, it changes all the rest of the way that you have to think about things.  And that for us was really adaptively. Like remember our brain hasn't evolved much in about  50 to a hundred thousand years. There's not much evolution. So a lot of this is adapted for like  caveman times. So that made sense because the world didn't really change. And having one belief system  kept us alive. We were able to adapt, but not very quickly. Our ego structure is basically a Jenga

I really, your insight is always superb. I often find our, we often find ourselves on all of  our shows saying, I wonder what Mike Mastick would say about this. That's why we read Tech Turnt.  And Yanko Rutgers, he's at the information, but he's also got a really good newsletter at Beehive.  It's called Lowpass because he filters the future. Get it? Lowpass.cc. Lots actually in this Lowpass  we can talk about. Meta Horizons reboot. This Row Kid is making a TV dongle for its AR glasses.  Maybe some insight into what will be coming from Apple. Are you sold on the Vision Pro?

I mean, I don't think anybody at Apple thinks it's the next  big thing. A device that's 3,500 bucks and that they're only going to make a hundred thousand off  or 200,000, whatever the reports, whichever report you believe. But I mean, things are going in that  direction and those are still just transitional devices that are supposed to get us to true AR  glasses. Yeah. That are basically as light as regular glasses, but give you augmentation of  everything around you all the time. And that's really hard to make. And we're not going to have  those for a couple more years at least. And so they're making these transitional devices in between.

Transcript:  The history of technology is though, that just because you were the one that, you know,  made the first one or the second one doesn't mean you're going to be the one that wins.  These devices they're making now, both Meta, HTC, Apple are so early that it may well not be any of  them that end up capitalizing on this. Somebody might come along down the pipe and magically might  make spec, you know, the AR spectacles. And suddenly everybody says, that's the one. So, but I guess is  it, it's fair to say that you need to do, you need to start to get there. Right. Somebody's got to do it.

We've got lots more to talk about our show today brought to you by  Zip Recruiter. Oh man, if you're hiring, you know how hard it is to attract top talent. It's very  competitive out there. You know, I mean, if you're good at anything, you get multiple offers.  That's why you need Zip Recruiter to get ahead of the game. You want a partner who knows how to get  people to apply to that job. Zip Recruiter knows how tough it is right now, but they have figured  out solutions for the problems you're facing doing your hiring. See for yourself right now.

First of all, you're reaching more of the right people, assuming there are great people  out there for your job. And you know how important it is. You hire the right person because the right  person can really take your company to the stars. The wrong person can drag them into the mud. Just  one person, one bad employee can ruin it for everybody. So you know the good ones out there,  but how do you reach that person? Well, the first thing Zip Recruiter does is post your job listing  to more than a hundred other job sites and social networks. So you're going to cast the broadest  net. You're going to let more people know about your job than anywhere. And if you need to hire  right now, they have such cool, smart technology. It goes through all the current resumes they have  on file, matches them up to your requirements and then sends you a list. Hey, you know what? These  people seem to have what you want. You go through that list and you pick a few, you pick the ones  you like and invite them to apply. And I got to tell you, that invitation puts you ahead of the  line. Everybody else who wants that person, you're right up front because you ask them and people are  flattered. They go, oh, they want me. You get first dibs on the best people. I also like Zip  Recruiter because the pricing is so straightforward. There's no surprise costs. You know what you're  going to pay before you post. Team up with a hiring partner who understands what you need. Zip  Recruiter will post, you know, I mean, it's the worst thing. Somebody gives you notice, oh crap,  we're going to lose one of our best people. What are we going to do? We know people are going to  have to work harder. It's going to, we got to go through the whole application process, but then  Lisa will go and it's, you know, it's breakfast. We're having breakfast. She goes, oh no, we got  to replace Ashley was most recently. We got to place Ashley in continuity. So what we do is we,  she posts it at breakfast and I swear within a few hours, she's starting to say, I hear her across  this office. She's going, oh, we got one. Oh my gosh. Here's another one. Great one. That's how  we found Viva. Team up with a hiring partner who understands how tough it is and knows what you  need. And it happens fast.

We thank Zip Recruiter not only  for supporting our show with their advertising, but for giving us a way to find great people.  We love Viva. All right. Back to Hollywood. More Hollywood stories. We got the YouTube results,  quarterly results from Google. YouTube ad spending up big, big time, which is a surprise.  It looks like YouTube is really getting in gear. I can't remember what the increase was. A 4.2%  increase year over year. But what's really interesting, it seems to be coming at the expense  of the TV advertising market. $70 billion a year at stake in TV advertising. YouTube's increase,  overall revenue increase, 4% year over year. By the way, that's the first after three straight  quarters of decline seems to come almost exactly at the cost of TV advertising.  As of early May, YouTube, this is from the information story, Hollywood's pain  is YouTube's advertising gain. Great headline. Thank you to Sahil Patel for this article.  YouTube has already booked $7 billion in upfront ad spending deals.  More advertisers have warmed up to the content on YouTube thanks to creators like MrBeast.  And while YouTube creators may not have the budgets of expensive TV shows, Sahil writes,  they draw younger viewers that traditional TV cannot. And that's really the key.  Are we starting to see a shift, Janko, from traditional television advertising to YouTube?

Start time: 3432.88

Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  I think we're seeing a shift in general from traditional TV advertising to streaming,  to digital, to streaming, to all the streaming platforms. YouTube is one of the biggest  benefactors. I think Nielsen also just put numbers out for, I guess those were June numbers,  but YouTube and Netflix are both the two biggest streaming services. And then others are starting  to catch up. 2B is like 1.4% of all TV viewing now. Roku Channel, all these channels, all these  digital properties are moving up. And it makes a lot of sense because people are cutting the cord.  It's not stopping. Comcast just lost another half a million of subscribers to its TV products  and across the board that continues and the conchic adverse. And there is really not that  much reason anymore to watch network television or cable television anymore because the best stuff  is on streaming. A lot of stuff, if you weren't looking for the HBOs or the premium channels,  if you just want to tune into something, just wedge out in front of the TV, there's great free  alternatives for that right now on streaming. Free V and Pluto TV. Exactly. All those guys.  So obviously the advertisers are going where the eyeballs are. And YouTube is one of the big  benefactors, but I think beneficiaries of that. But I think all the other ones are benefiting from

Start time: 3534.44

Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  And apparently it's going quite well. I think they would say they're still very early and that  they're still starting to build it out and figuring out how much to charge and who to work with.  I think initially they were just saying, oh, Microsoft of all cases is going to sell all our  ads. And now they're like, well, maybe you're going to have some other people there too who  can do that. Maybe even better than Microsoft. That's my interpretation. But I think Netflix is  in the ad business now. The majority of people on Hulu get it with advertising. They're making  more money with the ad-supported tier than with the tier without advertising. Oh really? Oh,  that's interesting. And I think Netflix is sort of gearing for the same thing. So that's why they're  discontinuing their cheapest ad free plan now. Because they're basically like, oh, we can be  even cheaper if we have ads, but we're going to make a lot more money with that. One thing that's

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  helping, when I've in the past watched Hulu with ads, it's the same ad. I was getting so sick of  Captain Obvious from what I was at Travelocity or something. Same ad over and over again. And that  was a real turnoff. But I've noticed lately, I've been watching Pluto TV, they have more advertisers  they have more variety. It's a lot more like watching network television than it used to be.

Start time: 3616.64
End time: 3636.00
Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  Yeah, they're getting all smarter. They're doing the frequency capping so you don't see the same  ad over and over and over again. I think for a while it was also not just the question of  the technology, but also the inventory. There wasn't enough advertisers and there was a huge  demand streaming was growing leaps and bounds. And then you just have to show that same ad over and

Start time: 3636.10
End time: 3663.90
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  over again. We're moving to a cord cutting world. I mean, that's pretty clear. If I were the cable  companies of our Comcast and Cox and Spectrum, I'd be a little nervous. They're all moving to be  internet service providers as opposed to content over the top TV providers. Is it inevitable that  everything's going to be on the internet and that we'll no longer have an antenna or a cable?

Start time: 3665.28
End time: 3702.25
Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  People still use an antenna, surprisingly. It's a whole other story, but basically the future  of broadcast TV, they're still trying to push the new ATC 3.0. All of that. That still exists.  But I think primarily everything is streaming and that most people are comfortable with it now.  Most people either own a smart TV or a streaming device or in many cases both.  So it really doesn't make a whole lot of sense to pay those $100 or more for your cable TV bundle.

End time: 3770.96
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  No, it's mostly streaming. It's hard when you have so many options out there. I think that's  another issue is that now there's so many options that people are cutting down on having every  single service, but then there's YouTube and other ways that you can get content for free.  So when you're competing against free, it does change the entire way and it's easy. It's easy.  It's easy to consume. In the end, when you're tired and you want to veg out, which is what people  often do at usually consuming media is that time when you want to veg out or you're driving your  car, you're doing something else and you want to do that with it, the easiest thing is often going  to work out. And so the more hoops that you have to kind of jump through, the less chance that that  barrier to entry is going to be so difficult that there's less chance that people are going to go  through with it. And so every time they make another little inconvenience for us, there's  a greater chance that people are going to be like, you know what? I don't want to unless it's that  hit show that you really want to no matter what. And then you'll jump through every single hoop

You don't believe me,  but I know the first one's four minutes. The second one, the second one is two and a half  minutes. And the third one is three minutes, 45 seconds. So you just skip that amount and,  and you can end. Well, I should say the second break, I include the interviews with the contestants  because I don't care about them. I just want to skip my time.

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  remember replay and they got put out of business pretty much. Right. Yeah. Yeah. With ad skipping.  Good. Because ads are good. Everybody should listen to all of our ads. No skipping. No,  I'm always conflicted because as an ad supported network, I don't want to bash ads, but nobody,  let's face it, nobody really likes ads. But I would also emphasize that if you're not willing  to pay for something, you better be willing to watch ads because there's only two choices.  Well, I guess the third choice is charity on my part, but you know, we've got lights,  we've got people to pay, we've got things to, you know, it's expensive. I'm sure you feel the same  way. Mike, I know, you know, you say you're not making any money, but you have to pay the bills.  You can't, you know, you have to have advertising, right? Is there, is there a tech, there is a tech

We have Patreon, we have what we call the TechDart Insider  setup, which is, is a premium version. But right now we really don't have ads on the site. And,  and I think we discussed this in the past where we had gone through problems with the ad providers.  Yes. And so we finally ditched it just because it was becoming too much of a pain for what we  were getting out of it. We're not opposed to doing ads, but generally my take on that is, is that  there, there either there needs to be a balance in terms of, you know, most publications that I go  to today that are ad supported are just, it's, they're impossible to read. I mean, you have  like something that comes down off the top, something that pops up across the bottom,  and then every two paragraphs, there's a giant ad and, and that it's, they're, they're just ridiculous.

Transcript:  rearrange themselves. So you can't scroll by them. So, yeah. So, so I mean, we would never do that,  even if we did have ads right now, we don't. But the other thing is I wish that we were  talking about better ways to do ads, because I do think that there are ways to do advertisements  that are less annoying, less problematic, you know, less based on just trying to suck up all  of your data and try and target you the best, but you know, that, that actually some people enjoy  seeing, like, you know, you, there are ads that are actually good and enjoyable as, as content in  their own right. And I've written about this for years as well. Like, I wish the ad market was  moving more towards that world in which, you know, there are, they are advertisements and they're  clearly labeled as advertisements, but they're not annoying. And they're actually good enough  that people don't mind seeing them. But, you know, the, the, the advertising market has not  necessarily moved in, in that, in that realm, whenever people approach us about advertising  deals, we try to talk to them about like, Hey, can we talk about doing some sort of creative  sponsorship that is something that people would actually enjoy? And so far, we haven't really been  able to convince many people to do that, but it is what we would like to do. I think that's where

Start time: 4006.08
End time: 4186.40
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  we're going to end up. I mean, I think advertisers are starting to learn that playing all these games  and snarping up all this data is not actually a long-term tenable point of view. In fact,  I think we have a story along those lines here. I can't remember where I, where I stuck it.  But basically to add targeting is just not  a long-term good solution to this stuff and people are really getting fed up with it.  Yeah. Well, we'll see what, we'll see what happens. You know, I had it here somewhere.  Moving right along. Let's talk about Metta and Canada. A divorce in the process, George Dau.  Canada has a bill that passed. See, we call it C18, the online news act. It forces platforms like  Google and Metta to negotiate deals with news publishers in Canada to pay for the snippets  that those, well, in the case of Google, that Google uses in the search results or the shared  articles in the case of Metta that are showing up on Facebook. As a result, Metta is now blocking  news in Canada. Rather than pay, they say, no, we're not going to pay and no news for you.  To which Canadian heritage minister, Pascal Saint-Ange, who's apparently the one in charge  of this weird heritage. Okay. She's in charge of the government's negotiations with Metta. She said  this week, this is irresponsible. They would rather block their users from accessing good  quality and local news instead of paying their fair shared news organizations.  We are going to keep standing our ground. If the government can't stand up for Canadians against  tech giants, who will? I guess the key here is paying their fair share.  Does Metta owe the Toronto Globe and Mail when somebody on Facebook shares an article from the  Toronto Globe and Mail? And sends them traffic. And sends traffic because it's just a clip,  right? It's not the whole article and you click it and where do you go? The Toronto Globe and Mail.  This happened in Australia. Remember, both Google and Facebook didn't like it, but ended up at the  negotiating table after some concessions from the government. It happened in France. It happened in  Spain. Google news left Spain for some time. I think it was years before the Spanish news organizations  said, complete surrender. Come back Google, we missed you. What's going to happen to C18?  First of all, Georgia, if you're not Michael Geist, are people generally aware of this? I know

Start time: 4186.74
End time: 4237.02
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  Michael's been very outspoken against C18. Yeah, I don't think that many people really know.  I think that there's so many options for where you get your information. I don't think that many  people will really be that bothered by it. I think that it's a really big issue and in this,  I'm not really much of a meta or Facebook fan, but in this case, I'm kind of like, well,  they have a point. Where do you overstep your boundaries of trying to enforce your laws and  what you're going to do and who gets what and what is fair and how much is an article and then can  we be sued by personal people? It becomes one of those slippery slopes that can kind of go all the  way through. So for most people, they don't care. For most people, they're kind of on the side of,  not on the side of the government for this. Oh, interesting. Even though the government's

Transcript:  quote standing up for Canadians. Meta says only 3% of the content on its users feeds are news.  News is not, according to Meta, a big deal for them. In fact, Rachel Curran, who's their head  of public policy in Canada said, news outlets voluntarily share content on Facebook and Instagram  to expand their audiences and help their bottom line. They need us more than we need them. She  says, in contrast, we know the people using our platforms don't come to us for news.

Transcript:  So we're just going to stop showing it. It was, I thought it was interesting when threats  sort of launched and all the journalists flocked to threats because of much, much better than  whatever's going on at Twitter slash X these days. But then Meta came out and said, well,  this is not really a platform where we want news to happen or we're not going to prioritize news

Start time: 4291.90
End time: 4303.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  at all. Yeah, it's interesting. They mentioned Facebook and Instagram. They didn't mention  threads, did they? Yeah. But there isn't a lot of news on threads. There's some, but I was wondering

Start time: 4303.58
End time: 4313.50
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  if that was sort of covered by the claim of Instagram, since threads sort of remind you of  property. But yeah, it's not clear. And maybe there's just not enough users right now for it

Start time: 4313.64
End time: 4345.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to matter. But yeah. I do. You're right though, Yanko, that as soon as threads launched a couple  of weeks ago, every brand, every news organization desperate to get off of Twitter flock to threads.  And most of my feed is still those, it's the brands and the news organizations, less normal  people. Because most of the normal people stopped posting on threads, at least half,  according to most statistics. I like threads. Mike, you said you're using Blue Sky mostly these days.

Start time: 4346.30
End time: 4375.22
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I've just found Blue Sky works for my sort of mental model of what I used to use Twitter  for in terms of, you know, if I'm sort of working through ideas or thoughts, or just want to sort of  chat with people who are thinking through similar things that I'm thinking through.  Blue Sky is obviously a lot smaller, but for whatever reason, it just matches with my mental  model of how, you know, micro blogging kind of site should work. To me, threads looked the most

Start time: 4375.40
End time: 4382.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte

Start time: 4382.88
End time: 4413.02
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  It's actually been, you know, it's still invite only. And so it's still relatively small, but it's  been growing really quickly. I think it's almost up to 500,000 people at this point. And as it grows  more and more, the people that I, you know, enjoy talking to seem to be showing up. And so far,  there haven't been too many. I wouldn't say it's certainly not entirely true that the people who  make me frustrated about social media, there have been fewer of those on Blue Sky so far.

Start time: 4429.06
End time: 4470.80
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  I think the big question is whether or not threads really does embrace Activity Pub,  which is what Mastodon is based on, which they claim and they continue to swear is absolutely  part of the plan. And so if threads becomes the largest by far, you know, contributor to  Activity Pub discussions, then Mastodon might become more interesting because if you can  communicate with people on threads via any of the various Mastodon tools,  that becomes a lot more interesting. And so I'm sort of curious to see how that plays out in terms  of what that will mean for Mastodon. What are you going to do with all our accounts then? Are

Start time: 4471.00
End time: 4504.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  we going to merge them again? So I run a Mastodon instance, twit.social, and I actually think threads  might be a really great opportunity for Mastodon to incorporate some of those brands and new sites  because you can follow them and just stay on Mastodon. If you want a little touch of that,  you can add it, but it doesn't mean you have to participate in threads. And more importantly,  it doesn't mean you have to give any data to Facebook at all. It doesn't communicate it over.  Blue Sky is also supposed to federate, not with Mastodon, but in general.  Right. I don't know if that's going to happen.

Start time: 4505.84
End time: 4548.40
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  That is definitely part of the plan. And that, you know, I want to see what happens there as well.  And if you listen to the developers on Blue Sky in terms of how they look at federation and how  they're thinking about it as compared to Mastodon, you know, I think they're trying to solve for some  of the problems that Mastodon ran into. Whether or not they accomplish that is, you know, a huge  open question, but I think they're actually saying a lot of very thoughtful things in terms of how  they're looking at federation and how they look at sort of their role as owner of the protocol or  controller of the protocol, as well as running one particular node on it. But right now it's all  theoretical. And so, you know, who knows what will actually happen.

You know, I think that we got a lot of attention  for various stories mainly because of discussions on Twitter. And I think that I was a business.  Sure. And I was able to meet people and communicate with people and, you know,  and have connections almost entirely, a whole bunch of really what turned out to be really  important connections almost entirely because of Twitter. And so I actually feel like, you know,  what has happened to Twitter is really, really, you know, upsetting just because it was such a  useful service for so many things. And I totally understand the reasons why for many, many people  who are not in my position, it was a terrible, horrible, awful service and had no benefit  whatsoever. But for myself and for a number of other people that I know, you know, Twitter  has helped people get careers and build up a wide network and friendships. And so, you know,  having something that handles that role, I think is useful for a lot of people.

We are rethinking a little bit how have we used this in the past and how we're going to use it.  Like, I used to be on Twitter, well, not 24 seven, but basically my entire working day,  just having to be tech up and running and looking at it all the time, which can take like once the  election came around and then COVID and so forth, that can also take a mental toll for sure.  And so now with all these new networks coming up, but none being quite that big and Twitter  just being a shit show. I don't think I will ever go back to like a world where I pay 24 seven  attention to these networks. I don't know if I ever want to have anything that replaces tweet  tech because paying a little less attention to that and then diving in when it's useful for me.  And then, but also taking a break during the work day from it for four hours at a time  seems to work actually a lot better.

Transcript:  TK Exactly. There'll be a few situations in which... Well, the other thing too is like,  there are questions of if people are sued, maybe, but then there are questions of like...  Because he sort of suggested like if you get fired or something. And if that's the case,  the person who's fired is probably not gonna have a legal claim unless they work for the government  and there's potential First Amendment issues. But if you just work for a company and you say  something really dumb on Twitter, which is what he seems to be encouraging, and you get fired,  you have no legal recourse. And he's sort of suggesting to people that they will. So I think  what might happen is a bunch of people who do get fired for being complete jerks on Twitter,  then file bogus legal claims and then go ask Elon to pay the legal bills. And if they're dumb enough  and have supported Musk enough, maybe he'll just pay their legal bills. But the most likely  scenario is that he's not gonna do anything.

That Elon just posts stuff because he  knows he'll get in the newspapers and he'll get attention and he doesn't, he's not attached to  what he's saying.

I love her YouTube videos and Yanko records here from the information and  other points, including fast company, just freelancing for you everywhere, but do follow  him on his newsletter, lowpass.cc. Our show today brought to you by Express VPN. The only VPN I use  and recommend watching Netflix without using Express VPN is like, I like how they make this  topical, buying tickets to a Taylor Swift concert, but only being allowed to see the opening act.  The reason is you have, for instance, Netflix, you have a subscription in Netflix and you may  have noticed that Netflix in Canada has a whole different slate of shows or Netflix in England or  Japan. Netflix is all over the world. I asked Netflix about this. They said, well, you have a  Netflix account. Yeah, you can watch those. We don't recommend a VPN because it's not going to  be a good experience. It's so slow. But with Express VPN, it is fast. They invest in their  network so you can watch HD video with no hiccups, no buffering, which means you fire up Express VPN  on your device. You can use it on your router. A lot of people do. In fact, Express VPN sells very  good routers with Express VPN built in, but you can also use it on Mac, Windows, Linux,  iOS, Android. You fire it up and you say, what country would I like to be in today?  Let's say you want to be in Japan. You want to watch a lot of anime on Netflix Japan.  You choose Japan. You are now emerging on the public internet in Japan and Netflix Japan says,  Hey, welcome. Here's all your anime. It's really awesome. How does it work? It lets you change your  online location. So you control where Netflix and it works with other streaming websites as well.  Think you're located. Very simple. Now, let me tell you the other reasons you want to use Express  VPN. They're really the important ones. Of course, we talk about a VPN for security, for privacy, for  eliminating geographic restrictions. The key though is the VPN has to be completely private  and Express VPN is zero logging. It's in their privacy policy. Their privacy policy is vetted  by independent third parties. So it's true. They even go the extra mile. They created their own  trusted server technology. When you fire up Express VPN, it launches the trusted server  in RAM sandbox to cannot write to the hard drive. As soon as you log off, it's gone. And so is every  trace of your visit. And as if that weren't enough Express VPN runs on custom Debian distributions  that wipe the drive every morning at reboot. So you there is no trace of your visit to Express VPN.  That is true privacy. They invest in the network so you can stream in high def. It works with  everything you've got. They've got servers all over the world, 94 countries. It works with every  streaming service, YouTube, iPlayer, Netflix, partly because they invest in rotating their IP  addresses too. So when you use Express VPN, you merge on the public internet with an IP address  that's not yours, that's theirs, and they rotate them. So these companies don't even really know  that you're on a VPN. You just look like somebody who lives in Japan. It's really a good service. I  think it's the right way to go when you need a VPN. There should really be only one company you  think of Express VPN. Get your money's worth right now. ExpressVPN.com slash twit. Be smart. Stop  paying full price for streaming services and only getting an access to a fraction of their content.  The opening act. Get the whole concert. And don't forget to use our link at ExpressVPN.com slash  twit. That way you'll get an extra three months of Express VPN when you sign up for a year. It's  the best deal. Less than $7 a month. ExpressVPN.com slash twit. If you want me to spell Express VPN,  I will. EXPRESSVPN.com slash twit. Have you seen Taylor Swift yet, Georgia?  You going to Taylor Swift? The Iris Tour? Nope. Nope.  No, I'm not much into concerts. I'm not a Swifty, but I know a lot of people who are going crazy.  Taylor Swift's Iris Tour was in Silicon Valley this week. Somebody said, I don't know if this is true,  that the local, was it the Cupertino police, instead of having a siren or playing Taylor  Swift songs through their loudspeakers? I don't think that's, I saw it in the news though,  but I don't think it's, it doesn't sound right. Right? Zuck went, he was seen in a box  at Levi's stadium. A lot of tech celebrities got tickets to see Tay Tay. Not me.  Guess there's nothing more to, I don't know, I'm being sexist. I asked you about Barbie and now  Taylor Swift.

Transcript:  Yeah. No, Elon has no intention. This is all part of his  general plan to get everybody to pay attention. Yeah. Yes. I'm ready today. Oh, there it is.  Yeah. So he's responding though. So see, he's getting... Elon's getting the attention.  Zuck's paying attention. Which is what he wants.  He says, I love this sport and we'll continue competing with people who train.  No matter what happens here. I love this. I love it. It is really the ultimate shade when Elon spends  $44 billion to buy Twitter to then just spit up something that's an exact duplicate and say,  come over here. I mean, that's the cage match right there in a nutshell.  Let's see. Amazon had a good quarter. And according to the verge, every single Amazon  team member is working on generative AI. Actually, it's not according to the verge,  it's according to Andy Jassy in the Thursday earnings call. Amazon and AI sitting in a tree.

AI is actually very useful,  I'm sure, in business intelligence in doing things like saying how many widgets you sold and how many  widgets you need to make for next year, things like that. But honestly, the Amazon Echo could  very much use an assist from something intelligent. So could Siri. So could use the Google Assistant.  I'm surprised that we haven't seen more AI in those guys.

Transcript:  Google is in court, of course, always. The attorneys general of most of the states sued  because they said Google was favoring their own services like Google Shopping or YouTube  over third party services. In a ruling unsealed on Friday, US District Judge said,  nope, you have not demonstrated to my satisfaction that Google's search results  harmed Yelp or Expedia. So we're going to throw that out. He wrote the state's allegation on  vertical search quote relies not on evidence, but almost entirely on the opinion and speculation  of its expert. Simply put, there is no record evidence of anti-competitive harm. This is from  US District Judge Amit Mehta. So the case will go on, but now that whole section has been removed  and it will focus its set for trial September 12th on agreements Google made with companies to make  its search engine the default. Google rumors say, speculation says pays Apple, for instance,  $15 billion a year to be the default search on Safari. Plaintiffs allege that kept rivals like  Bing and Duck Duck Go from succeeding. I'm sure you've written about this, Mike. Is this, you  pointed out Bloomberg said this was a setback for the state's attorney general, but you said, what,

I don't see how you can read this too much  differently. This seems like a whole chunk of what they were suing about is gone. And it's the very

Start time: 5733.40
End time: 5752.62
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  thing, Yelp has spent years, probably a decade pushing this exact theory and really was one of  the main driving forces behind this lawsuit. And to have that part of it, the part that really  is about Yelp just tossed aside by the judge is kind of embarrassing for Yelp.

Start time: 5754.56
End time: 5778.48
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  Maybe you can fill me in on this since you really pay attention to this. It seems surprising to me  that antitrust regulators, not just in the US, but even in the EU seem to be motivated by  complaints from competitors. Sony complaining about Microsoft Activision or Tile complaining  about Apple and their air tags or Yelp complaining about Google. Is that how it's supposed to be?

Start time: 5779.96
End time: 5869.42
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  Well, that depends on who you ask, right? So there are different schools of thought when it comes to  antitrust. And the big question is, what is it that antitrust is supposed to be protecting?  Is it supposed to be protecting the consumer or is it supposed to be protecting competition?  And there are many times where those two things overlap, in which case antitrust then works in a  reasonable way. But there are times where that is different. And that's where the complications  come in. And so the people pushing these theories are the ones who say it's supposed to protect  competition. And therefore, if there is a company that is not doing well, the question is, are they  not doing well because they're not doing what they do? They're not doing well. They're not  attracting the interest from consumers. Or are they not doing well because of an unfair business  practice by the large incumbent? And so that becomes a lot harder to parse out. And because  it's sort of this fuzzy area, it allows any company that is struggling or flailing to claim  that it's for antitrust reasons, as opposed to their own inability to succeed. And there's a lot  of gray area in the middle in terms of which things are really impacting it. But to some extent,  competition means that sometimes companies lose. And that alone shouldn't be an antitrust violation.  The real question just gets down to, is the big company doing something that is unfair,

Start time: 5869.82
End time: 5879.38
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  that blocks their ability to compete fairly? So yeah, I mean, okay, that makes sense. And if  a company complains and can demonstrate that, then they have every right to complain. But they have

Start time: 5879.56
End time: 5897.52
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  to demonstrate that. So and I mean, you can sort of see it in this ruling, right? The part of the  case that moved forward was the one where Google comes in and pays a ridiculous amount of money  to have its search be the default. But that's not a monopoly. I mean,

Start time: 5899.04
End time: 5910.12
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  if I had Leo's search engine and had the money to pay Apple $15 billion, I would be the default  search. That wouldn't be a monopolistic behavior. That's just spending an outrageous amount of money.

Start time: 5910.52
End time: 5925.52
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  Well, it depends, right? I mean, that's where the analysis, I mean, I still think there's a  decent chance that even if this is going to trial, that Google could still win. It's just a question  of where does it get kicked out? I mean, you don't blame, you don't say, well, Kellogg's,

End time: 5991.28
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  commercial behavior. Well, there are some people who disagree with you on that. I mean, there are  people who will say that some of that behavior, if the company is large enough, and if they're able  to block others from doing that, then there might be. But I tend to lean towards what you're saying,  which is that it's a more difficult antitrust case to make than others. I think there are a bunch of  different antitrust lawsuits going on all at once, some of which I think are weaker than others. And  I think this one was always kind of on the weaker end of the spectrum. I think there is another one  involving Google's ad business that I think has much stronger arguments about the things that they  did behind the scenes to really hurt competitors that were not just like, we have more money and  we're able to pay for the end cap kind of situations. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's a strong case.

Transcript:  I don't think it's sufficient to say, oh, this company is just too big, your honor. Yeah.  And that's kind of what you're saying, if Google can afford to pay $15 billion to Apple to be the  default search. Well, they're just too rich. Yeah. I mean, you could argue certainly

And I think it  was in the verge, but the premise was, you can create a great search engine. Neva was doing it.  They first licensed Bing and they were kind of weaning themselves off of Bing. They used AI.  It was started by some Googlers who said, we can do this without ads if we ask people to pay.  And I was paying five bucks a month. I liked it. There were no ads. The search results were  quality. They were getting better all the time. But is it the tyranny of the default or the  tyranny of the $15 billion, whatever it is, Neva had to fold.

It's sort of proving that's not the case. And so, yeah, there are some, you know, but there are,  you're right, there are others who are trying to build search engines. But the question is,  you know, can they attract enough of an audience or a business model to make it work? Brave has

I, you know, a lot of people use Brave because it's chromium. It's  a Chrome compatible browser that's not Chrome. I haven't seen that. I've looked at the results,  but I can't. Does, do you know if Caggy, by the way, Caggy is confusing because it's also  a payment service, but it's not related. That's a little confusing. But do you know if they use

If it's impossible, then there are questions about, you know, does antitrust need  to step in to help enable competition with the idea that if there is competition, then the consumer  would benefit as well. But that's where there are a lot of questions and a lot of, you know, very

Start time: 6235.06

Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  difficult legal questions involved. God, I mean, it wasn't that long ago. There was a huge diversity  of search engines, right? Yeah. Startpage and Lycos and AltaVista and Excite and these are all  names that are dim, dark, distant memories of the internet. Young people are going, who?  What? You mean Google? Yeah, Google. That's the one I was talking about. Remember when Google

Start time: 6260.18
End time: 6269.82
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  launched, I mean, this is you and I being old, but when Google launched, I thought it was way  too late, right? We have too many search engines already. Why do we need another one? They won

Start time: 6269.94
End time: 6317.40
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  because they were good and simple, but they really did give noticeably better results.  The PageRank algorithm worked and they won because of that. I think it's possible  that Lina Khan and the FTC really want Google to break up Google and just have there be a search  engine and then, you know, YouTube is somebody else and shopping is somebody else and airfares  are somebody else. That would be advertising. Yeah, that would be very interesting because right now  they both buy and sell. They are definitely in that weird position where they control too much  of the advertising market and I think that that case has a lot of merit, but I don't know if you

Transcript:  would be interesting. Force them to offload the ad business maybe, except that's their business.  It's 80% of their revenue. Right. 79% as of their last quarterly results.  By the way, Apple had kind of weak to middling quarterly results, much as expected, 1% down  year over year, but the services were up and a good part of that is the $15 billion that comes  from Google every year. That and of course this little thing called the iPhone app market, which  makes quite a bit of money for Apple. Let's see. Should we take a little break? And when we come  back, we have a lot of little stories, the little ones that seeped to the bottom. Great panel here,  Georgia Dow, Mike Masnick, Janko Rutgers. We're going to have more of the show in just a second,  but first a word from our sponsor this week in tech brought to you by Lookout. Business has changed  forever.

Anybody interested in  that at all? Is it real? Is it fake? I thought the most interesting thing was this is a South Korean  researchers who posted a what they call a pre-print. That's an un-peer reviewed scientific  article. It will eventually be peer reviewed and if approved, get into a scientific journal.  But the claiming that they made a superconductor that operates at normal temperatures, which would  be massive, would change the way everything works. Computing, electric generation, everything.  But what's interesting is that they created this out of normal chemicals that are around the house  and published the details about how they made it so that you've got a lot of Twitter people and  YouTube people saying, oh yeah, I made it too. Oh yeah, it wasn't that hard. There is, I think,  a reasonable skepticism about this. This is a pretty extraordinary claim. But there are a lot  of viral videos, samples of material supposedly levitating because of the Meissner effect.  I guess there's nothing much to say except this is more of the same with social networks.  The most scientific experts say extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. That proof  is still forthcoming. Nobody has quite replicated it. Even your favorite Instagram influencer.  Although it would be pretty hysterical if they did.

Transcript:  There's a Russian anime fan who has disappeared now after claiming she had also synthesized it.  I don't know. I find it fascinating, frankly, the way people have jumped on this.  Angry Russian home scientist claims replication of LK-99 with a faster method.  Okay, fine. She's disappeared from view. Maybe she didn't really do it.  Good news. Voyager 2 has not disappeared from view. The antenna got knocked askew.  Two degrees off. Now remember, if you're, what is it, 17 billion miles out, two degrees means you're  missing the earth entirely. But they were able to use a very powerful space telescope in Australia  to ping it. They've got the antenna reoriented and we are now talking to Voyager 2. It's been  hurtling through space since 1977. It is, I guess, 12 billion miles out, which means the signal takes  18 hours to get to it and 18 hours to get back. It's not a very fast conversation, but good news.  Voyager 2 is back in communication as it heads out to the outer planets. Where is it now, John?  Beyond Pluto. It's already beyond Pluto. Wow. That would be cool if Pluto were a planet.  Sorry. Sorry. Too soon?  That's too soon.  Too soon. Fortnite. I didn't know. Go ahead.

And meanwhile,  my phone mic after a year or two gets completely outdated. Why doesn't anybody use special antennas  for that? Good point. Excellent point. Fair point.

Transcript:  I did not know that Fortnite had museums. Apparently it does. It has a Martin Luther  King exhibition. They are adding a Holocaust museum. I imagine that if you're playing  Fortnite you probably jump past those museums pretty quickly. But the fact that it's there,  I think, is pretty cool. The museum, I guess Epic allows you to create museums. The museum has been  created by an expert, right? It's an expert. It better be an expert.  Luke Bernard, who's the director of The Light in the Darkness, which is a game  about a Jewish family in France trying to escape the Holocaust, used Epic's tools to build the  Holocaust museum, got Epic's approval. It will now be, I guess, is it in the lobby? I haven't seen it,  but I guess it's in the lobby and you can go see it. Here's some.

Transcript:  I think that's a wonderful way to be able to reach people is to go into the media where they  already are. Like again, maybe people won't go, but even if you reach some that may not have been  as educated about this or might be interested or, you know, add a storyline that goes to it,  I think that we need to adapt the way that we educate people to where they already are.  Like go to where they are. Don't try to drag them into a regular museum that they may not  be able to afford or it might be more antiquated or they might think of it as boring.  So I think it's an amazing idea.

Transcript:  And the other thing that I agree with George entirely, the other thing that I thought was  kind of interesting is, you know, Mark Zuckerberg spent all this time trying to create the metaverse  that nobody goes to. And here you have, you know, Fortnite sort of creating a metaverse-like  experience almost by accident and people are realizing, you know, where the people are,  then you can build interesting things. So seeing like this museum pop up and all of the stuff about  concerts and other things that are happening in Fortnite, it's kind of interesting to see how  these things, you know, which is certainly not what Epic planned originally for Fortnite, but  what it sort of turned into is really kind of fascinating.

Transcript:  This is actually, Janke, one of the things you cover, you cover  Horizon Worlds. You got an article at lowpass.cc about the new shooter in Horizon's world,  Super Rumble. Is this part of a general reboot of Horizon Worlds?

Start time: 6889.16
End time: 6982.52
Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  It is, and part of that is that they just upped the technical abilities. So before everything,  basically in Horizon World had to be built in-world and it was so, it wasn't great looking.  Everything looked sort of similar. The resolution was low. And now you can import objects and you  can import things. And so that allows people to do much more professional stuff. And one of these  examples for that is this new game, which actually I played it. It's a lot of fun. I think they are  sort of seeing that they have to push more with first party titles, with making, giving people a  good reason to go there. And that goes to Mike's point with Fortnite, right? The game was there  first. That's why everybody came and everybody liked the game. And then they started branching  out and, oh, maybe we can do a concert here. Maybe people can build their own stuff. And then people  start building museums and all those things. Horizon tried to do this backwards in a way,  I think initially, or Meta tried to do it backwards, but they said, oh, it's a blank slate.  You can do everything. They built a couple of games, but those were, they were okay,  but it wasn't the best examples and you couldn't do that much in-world. So all the stuff that people  built was worse than what Meta started with. And so it wasn't very interesting. And now they  basically retooled a lot of these things and they're going to do more first party titles.  They actually built a game studio specifically for Horizon, out of Meta, out of Oculus Studios.  That's going to do first party. They're going to partner with game publishers to bring some titles  to Horizon. So things are going to change quite a bit there over the next couple of months.

Transcript:  You, you refer to a leaked memo from internally memo from Meta saying,  saying Meta's own staffers won't even use Horizon worlds. The, the manager wrote,  if we don't love it, how can we expect our users to love it? So it has been challenging for Meta.  Do you, Georgia, do you, you don't use any of these social networks in your VR?

Start time: 7012.74

Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  Play, do you? Not really. Like we, like I have, I've tested them out and like gone on and usually  they're ones that have the social aspect, but also have a game that's attached to it. So I'm really  there for the game. And then you meet other people that are also playing the game and now we're all,  you know, doing a boss or doing a level. So it kind of feeds itself, but the ones that are just  for social, no, like why my, my just thought is why, right? Like I think that it's wonderful if  you're lonely or if you're, you know, you want company or you want to do it, but I think that  it's much, a much better thing is inside of a game where you're already participating in the game.  And so because of that, then you can meet other people that are like-minded with the game and  talk about the game and then kind of branch out from it. I don't find it is interesting to be  there. I find it much more tedious than having personal conversations with people that are in  person because you're not reading the, like the, there's that, that uncanny valley, like you're  not reading someone really well. You don't get all of the same facial information. And at first,  it was really cute and cool to be able to do it. But after a while, I think that it just becomes  kind of heavy and tedious. So it was not as fun for me just to socialize. I think it's true in

Start time: 7084.04
End time: 7119.60
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  life as well. It's a lot easier, at least it is for me, a lot easier to socialize around a game.  That's why people play golf. Then just go into a spot and just say, let's talk about something.  It's a lot easier to have an activity. And then, and then there is a, there could be a very,  you know, vital social environment when you have a card game or something that you're doing.  I like my, I liked my, I used to like my poker group because it was a chance to get together with  the guys and talk and, but ostensibly it was to play poker, but the poker was just an excuse.  That makes sense to me that that would be much more intriguing.

Start time: 7120.52
End time: 7152.56
Speaker: Janko Roettgers
Transcript:  That's basically the story why Second Life never really went anywhere.  They drew like a core crowd of people who really liked this creator aspect and this social aspect  of it and building stuff in the world and having your own economy and all these things.  But it was way too complicated and they purposefully never wanted to be a game because  they thought games are for kids, which is always wrong. Bad assumption obviously, as we know now.  But yeah, so they missed the boat on a lot of those things and never grew past,  I think about a million concurrent users or monthly users.

Start time: 7154.62
End time: 7200.64
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  You know what the game was that actually people still play Second Life, but it's mostly around  sex. They found a game that they could play. It's weird. I, you know, I used to be in Second Life  and I went back a few years ago and people were buying like suit, like nude suits so they could be  naked in Second Life and flirting. And so they did find an activity to commune around.  It can't have been very satisfying, but it's still around.  I think it's still around. Yeah. These are all lessons learned. I just don't know if we've learned  them well enough to create a VR world that anybody wants to be a part of. We're a long  way from the metaverse. I hate to say it. What do you do these days? What do you play these days?

Start time: 7200.80
End time: 7233.68
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  What are your games, Georgia? So I actually haven't played a lot of  games in VR right now. Getting tired of it, aren't you?  It's not the tired of it. It's that they haven't made really great games. Like after Half-Life,  Alex and I did Horizon also, which I thought was good, but it was more of a climbing game  versus the Horizon video game that I really enjoyed. And so like Red Dead Redemption is just  a lot of fun, much more relaxing. You can kind of do whatever you want.

Start time: 7234.46
End time: 7245.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  So that's a good example. That's a VR game, even though it's on a 2D surface,  because it's immersive. Once you're in that, you're in that world.  Yes. Riding horses and camping around the fire.

Start time: 7245.72
End time: 7264.56
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  Yeah. So Red Dead is not in VR that I know of. No, it's a 2D game.  It's a nice 2D game and it's just fun, relaxing, enjoyable. The pace, you can make it whatever you  want. You can just play poker all day if that's really what you want to do.  And it's kind of enjoyable and chill. And so that's really good.

Start time: 7293.74
End time: 7310.06
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  Yeah. You don't have a choice now. And you usually do. You kind of get the good cop, bad cop. You  can kind of decide which way you want to go for most things. But sometimes he's just inebriated  and he is a little bit awkward sometimes and says things that he probably shouldn't. He owned it

Start time: 7310.28
End time: 7350.88
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  though. I was proud of him for owning it. I think we ascribe too much importance to the  nerd headset that really a good movie is a virtual reality experience. A good game is a  virtual reality experience in the sense that you are immersed in a different world. And even if  you don't have the surround picture, you have a sensory of experience of being somewhere else and  being transported. That's the goal. And I think if you can do it without annoying people by  making them seasick or putting a headset on them, you've done a better job than most VR titles.

Start time: 7352.08
End time: 7412.08
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  Though I'll say a good VR titles where you're immersed in the game and you really feel it and  it's more fun than that. Being able to look all the way around and you really do feel like you're  in that world. You feel a sense of sadness when you're playing something that's in VR that  is exceptionally immersive. If you're into scary games, it is a thousand times more frightening  to be immersed in the world than to play it on a screen. There's many games that are scary that  I can play if it's on the screen, but you put the headset on and very quickly there's no way that I  can continue on with this game. It's too much. So I still think that VR, there's a place for it.  And I think that there's many things that you can do and experience and test out and train and  reprogram your brain through VR that can become exceptionally effective. But unfortunately,  I don't think that meta did us any favors by putting out a very poorly thought out

Start time: 7413.32
End time: 7419.44
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  experience that really failed on many aspects. So you think Apple's Vision Pro might prove your

Start time: 7419.58
End time: 7466.38
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  point? Well, the Vision Pro is not really VR. It's going to be more AR. And I think that  AR is a different animal than what I would want. Like if it was just like little tiny  sunglasses and I feel like the Terminator and I get all the info about everything.  That's a different thing though. That's not kind of cool. That's not what they're  offering. So if you can't make the world, if this doesn't actually make things better,  the cost of having to put on a headset is going to be just too great. Even though you can still  see your face beyond it, it's not really going to work. They're still very, very heavy on your head.  Even wearing a few pounds on your head, it's hard on your neck. I mean, I think if you go to a,

Start time: 7466.76
End time: 7494.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  I'm not talking about video games. If you go to a movie and it's a big screen, it's immersive,  you've got music, you've got emotions, you get drawn into it. You could be just as scared by  a good movie or just as emotionally wrought by a good movie as you could by a VR game.  Or is there something about it being- Have you played The Exorcist on VR?  No, it's really scary. You're saying it's something visceral that happens when it's

Start time: 7495.06
End time: 7538.68
Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  immersive that you're in it. Well, there is. So if you look at a movie on a screen and you  want to leave, like emotionally, what you do is you kind of curl up. We look somewhere else on  the screen. We look at the other people. We are with others. We can support each other.  Again, when every single part of our senses is in a terrifying experience and everywhere you look,  it's just more terror. It is a much more visceral experience and much more terrifying.  And even mild ones such as, I think there was called Two Sisters and it was about dolls.  Dolls can be relatively creepy. It was really frightening. And it's one of these experiences

But I would say you should not be walking in this because it's so scary. You may choose to  run. And you're going to run into something and then it will feel even worse.  Should I get a barf bag though? Cause it makes me a little. Do you get motion sick?

Transcript:  my upbringing. I don't know why I thought you were Dutch. German, of course. Well, there are people  who did play this card game and it's still very popular. Wizards of the Coast adapted Lord of the  Rings into a Magic the Gathering set and decided to make a card just one with Sauron's ring. Just  one. A hyper rare card. It was found back in June. The owner has now sold it to rapper Post Malone,  who is apparently a big Magic the Gathering fan. He bought the card for $2 million  for basically what is a playing card.

By the way, you can get a  unspecial version of this card and still use it and play it. It actually plays. I guess if I had  that many tattoos, I wouldn't wear a shirt either. It seems odd, I guess. But anyway,  so here he is. He's opening up his Magic deck looking for something to play. That is wild.  That is really wild. Can anybody tell if any of those tattoos have anything to do with Magic the  Gathering? No, I can't either. Let's take a little tiny break when we come back. Final words with a  great panel. You're watching This Week in Tech. This show is also supported by our club members,  our club twit members. If you're not a member, I invite you to consider it. First of all, no ads.  There's nothing to skip. You get ad-free versions of all the shows, which also means  no ad trackers because we do have to use, we filter through sites like,  oh, I can't remember who we use anymore. I think Advertisecast does direct ad  insertion and pod sites. We do that in a privacy forward way. We have to. It's the only way  advertisers will buy ads. They want to know if their ads are working. But you don't get any of  that in Club Twit. You don't get ads and you don't get ad tracking. You also get access to  the fabulous Club Twit Discord, which is a social network par excellence, not just about the shows,  but about everything in a geek's life. I love Discord. The more I use it, the more I like it.  We've got a very active Discord with lots of great people in there. It's really a lot of fun. I  highly recommend that. Plus the twit plus feed with shows we don't put out anywhere else. Shows  Hands on Macintosh with Mike Cosargeant, Hands on Windows with Paul Therotte. We just added Scott  Wilkinson's Home Theater Geeks. This week in space started in the club because the club members  finance it basically. So our club is very important to us. And I have to say, I think it's very fairly  priced. $7 a month. You get all that and you get special events that we're planning all the time  in our club twit. Thanks to our community manager. I have to say, Ampruitt's doing a great job.  We've got a photo walk coming up at the end of the month. I'll be part of that. Stacey's Book Club  is coming up end of the month as well. We put together a really interesting fireside chat.  Ampruitt interviewed Hugh Howey, the author of Wool, the novels, the sci-fi novels that are the  basis of Apple TV Plus's Silo. And Daniel is friends with, I'm sorry, Hugh is friends with Daniel  Suarez, one of our favorite sci-fi authors. So Aunt and I will talk to Daniel Suarez and Hugh Howey.  That's coming up in September. Another event for club members only. Again, $7 a month. Go to  twit.tv slash club twit. And we thank all of our members who make these shows possible.  We had a great week this week on twit. We've even made a little movie for your enjoyment. Watch.

Transcript:  If you missed a moment, you missed a mile. Make sure you catch every episode of all of our shows.  It's going to be a great week. Uh, some good news. Final thought, some good news for, uh,  Henrietta Lack. You, you know, the story of Henrietta Lack. Hey law, I bet you do Georgia now.  No, it doesn't ring a bell. There was a good book about it. No. So in the fifties, she was a black  woman who, uh, uh, I guess died of cervical cancer, but they harvested some cervical cells  from her without asking. It turns out the cells, uh, had some remarkable properties. They reproduced  very rapidly and have been, were saved and have been sold ever since for use in scientific  research. The procedure rendered her infertile, uh, probably cause she was black. They, nobody  told her, uh, years after she died, it was removed that it was, uh, revealed her tissue was removed  without her knowledge or consent. The hay loss cells, according to Johns Hopkins universities are  among the most important scientific discoveries of the last century. They've been used to develop  the polio vaccine, the COVID vaccine, uh, understanding the AIDS virus, leukemia studies.  Henrietta Lacks as a state sued, uh, and particularly sued Thermo Fisher scientific  in 2021. This is the company selling those cells, although I think the cells aren't exclusive to  Thermo Fisher. Uh, and that case has been settled. We don't know for how much,  but there is a settlement that was announced on what would have been her 103rd birthday.  Uh, one of the family members said it's outrageous. This company would think they  have intellectual rights properties to grandma's cells. Uh, so I think this is a happy ending.  Do you have you covered this at all, Mike? Yeah, I don't remember if I've written about,

Start time: 8323.44
End time: 8333.64
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  but I've certainly followed the story more or less. It's an amazing book. Yeah. Yeah.  The book is fantastic. There, there was a podcast that was done about it as well. I

Start time: 8333.84
End time: 8339.68
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  forget which podcast the immortal life of Henrietta Lacks is the book. Fascinating. Yeah.

Start time: 8341.58
End time: 8391.12
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  Uh, and I, I still, I still fully understand like what it is about, about her cells that  enabled this, that, that, you know, they, they reproduce quickly,  but it was never clear to me exactly like why or how. Um, but it, it seems like so much  of like modern medicine is based on her cells. And the fact is that, you know, really prior to  that book coming out for a couple of stories, like a little bit earlier, but, but prior to that,  like people didn't even know that the Gila cells stands for her name, Henrietta Lacks.  It's just H-E-L-A. Yeah. And most people thought it had, it meant, you know, it was just sort of  like either a made up term or referred to something else. People didn't even realize that it referred  to the person who they were taken from, including her family. Yeah. So a good, I think a happy ending

Start time: 8391.58
End time: 8472.72
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  to what was a very sad case. Uh, the excuse that's offered is, well, at the time there was no,  you know, there was no process for asking permission, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera.  Um, they, the cells reproduced at a very high rate could be kept alive long enough,  uh, to allow for more in-depth examination until, uh, HALA cells, cells cultured for lab studies  survive for only a few days at most, which means you couldn't do as much testing. So these were  the first cells to be observed. They could be divided multiple times without dying. That's how  they became known as immortal. It's fascinating. Good, a happy ending. I think Jonas Salk used  them, uh, when researching the polio vaccine, his vaccine was tested on the HALA cells. So, uh,  really quite a contribution, um, to science. Worth reading the book came out, uh, in 2011,  the immortal life of Henrietta Lacks. This also says it was a, it was an HBO movie. So if you  don't want to read, you can look for that on HBO, the documentary on HBO. Uh, let's see  the incandescent light bulb. Bye bye. August 1st. They stopped selling incandescent. Did you know  that? No more incandescent. Can you buy them in Canada? I might be visiting.

Start time: 8480.08
End time: 8564.86
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  be following suit soon. So, uh, we tried to ban them, uh, back in 2014, uh, Congress, uh,  or actually maybe the department of energy passed a regulation saying that, you know,  they're energy inefficient, no more incandescent light bulb. We have better replacements. We have,  uh, uh, fluorescence and more importantly, we have LEDs. Um, the under the Trump administration,  he put, you may remember, he said, no, no, we need our incandescent lights. So he put that off.  It has now become law. Um, and, uh, the Biden administration, uh, actually started under George  W. Bush, believe it or not, but the Biden administration is now officially approved  and there will no longer be, um, incandescent light bulbs in the store. Use LED light bulbs.  There are some exceptions, weird lights like appliance lamps and plant lamps and  specialty lamps, traffic signals, apparently using condescent bulbs. So you can, you can do that.  I guess heat lamps, probably you can use those too, cause that's the whole problem with incandescent  bulbs is they generate so much heat, they're wasting electricity. Uh, I think we could probably  call it a day. Did you want to talk about rocket or is it Rokid Yanko? I think it's Rokid. Yeah.

And now they made a dongle that turns  your AR glasses into a smart TV or brings that same experience. Have you tried them?  I have not tried them now. And I think the dongle won't sell until September.  It's sort of smart glasses that basically just project something or that usually use them to  mirror your phone or your game console. So it doesn't really interact with the environment.  But now you have this thing that you plug in and then it's basically a smart TV. And I thought it  was kind of fun and interesting because what's really a TV these days, right? So now it's a thing

I think somebody  needs to buy these and try them. And it's not going to be me because I'm busy throwing up,  playing the exorcist. But no, I think this is kind of intriguing. Maybe we will get a pair and,  and see how they are. Cause that would be great for an airplane or somewhere else.  Yanko, thank you so much for being here. Yanko records, uh, again, his newsletter,  brand new, go on over and check it out. Low pass dot CC. And of course, uh, I read him all the  time and the information and elsewhere.

Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  something happened recently, right? With the game. We, uh, we, we released a game a few months ago  called moderator mayhem. Yeah. Which is, uh, Elon Musk. You get to be a, a content moderator  for a fictional, uh, social media slash review site. And you get to experience what it's like to  make very difficult decisions with very little time and often not enough context and have people  yell at you and, uh, have to deal with a bunch of things along those lines. And so, uh, yeah,  we released that, uh, in early May. So nice moderator mayhem.engine.is. Is that correct?  Yes. That is it. Yes. So you can play it on a, on a regular browser. It's designed for a mobile  phone, but you, uh, slide cards left and right, whether take up, leave down, uh, kind of like,

Start time: 8776.64
End time: 8824.38
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  You can get fired pretty, pretty easily. It is really hard. I'll give you a heads up that, that  probably, I, well, I'm not going to say when, but very soon we're going to be releasing another game,  which is in a similar vein, whereas moderator mayhem is very much a frontline moderator.  You're the person making the decisions as they come. The next game that we're very, very close on  is, uh, you are running a trust and safety team for a fictional social media network,  and you have to make resource allocation decisions, policy decisions, uh, and face  lots of hard problems, deal with crisis situations, have journalists yelling at you,  having politicians yelling at you. It's a little too realistic. I just want to say,

Start time: 8824.56
End time: 8883.96
Speaker: Leo Laporte
Transcript:  as somebody who runs a moderates a mastodon instance, this is a hard thing to do. And you,  these are really tough. Here's the reported for illegal tutorial in the tutorial, a review of the  film cocaine bear encourages viewers to do cocaine while watching it. Content includes a  picture of a bag with white powder hashtag cocaine. Is that legal? Is that, is this,  do you approve in other words, right? If you think it's okay, you check it and wrong. This  review clearly involved illegal activity and should have been taken down. Oh, I pushed the wrong button  review of a drug includes a photo of a syringe photo of a syringe hashtag. My favorite drug.  Is that illegal? If I said yes, I'd, I'd, I'd be wrong because the review is for illegal drug  delivered by injection. So you can see how difficult, uh, this is. It's a lot of fun.  You did a good job with it. And it really, the point of it is while it's a good game,  the point of it is to tell people, teach people how hard it is to be a content moderator.

Start time: 8884.06
End time: 8899.12
Speaker: Mike Masnick
Transcript:  And yeah, it's, it's just because I think most people who haven't been in that role,  who don't run their own Macedon since, for example, or don't spend $44 billion to own, uh,  Twitter, you know, they think that it's really easy. You know, people look at it and say, well,

Most like you see other, like,  I mean, we sort of joked about it because we would see other websites, you know, other new social  media companies show up and, and go through this process where they would say, oh, you know, we're  the free speech thing and we're never going to, we're never going to take down anything. And then  suddenly they learned that that's, that's an impossible statement to live up to. But, but  everybody else seems to learn at least something. Whereas Elon is just all over the map.

Speaker: Georgia Dow
Transcript:  linked to people feeding your own self-worth, it does not bode well to learn because that means  you've made a mistake. And if you've made a mistake that hurts your ego. And so you can't do that. So  you surround yourself just with yes, people try to do the things that gives you the fastest, easiest  ego gratification. And rarely do the people in those personalities go in for actual help. So  the learning curve is, is very, you know, a straight line. And it helps if you've got billions
