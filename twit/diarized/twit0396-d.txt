Transcript:  that Twitter thing. The 24-year  old intern may not have a lot  of success going to the grizzled  newspaper veteran covering city  hall and saying you need to do  this. It kind of helps to have  somebody who's had some  experience doing it. Plus I  think when you have somebody  who's my age who's excited and  enjoys social media and  understands it, it helps other  people realize that hey they can  get into it too. It's not just  for kids anymore. Chronicles can  do it for a long time. We always  can get better. Also with us

Probably the landmark  moment for South by Southwest was  in 2007 when Twitter was  discovered at South by  Northwest. Everybody was using  it there and that really put them  on the map.

It's just I've I've  never had the need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  something they call the idea  industry now. That there's an  industry right now that's  really good. I mean I think  that's the thing about the  Ted industry now. That there's  an industry that has risen  around ideas. And I wonder if  that kind of spoils it a little

Start time: 572.32
End time: 599.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  be great. I mean this is like a  really great distillation. I  think it's like 12 minutes long  and it's her just saying she  started out as a busker as a  person in a wedding dress  asking for money and that kind  of lack of shame that she  developed over five years of  asking people to give her a  buck on the street has kind of  put her in a place in her  career where she feels  comfortable valuing her art and  asking people to pay for it.  She tells it in a beautiful way  I'm not spoiling it by saying  that but that is the lesson.  And the other advantage is that

There  was a bunch on philanthropy  this year. Inter species  internet communication. What  other species? Dolphins among  others. Dolphins use the  internet? There was actually a  woman who showed this really  cool wearable computer where  you can see the pictures of  dolphins. And there's a  wearable computer where you can  mimic dolphin sounds when  you're swimming with them. You  need that for the bath tub. You  can speak back and forth to  them and your wearable computer  translates what they just said.  So they said like throw me the  red ball or whatever. Yeah.

Start time: 643.38
End time: 647.95

Start time: 648.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you would expect you know how  you go to a modern web  application and what you get  is very much the same. It's  very much the same. What you  get is very magazine like full  bleed photos with text  overlayed on photos and it's  all very visually oriented  like say Google plus. I  wouldn't know no one uses  that. It does look like Google

End time: 1166.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not so much influenced by any  application as following an  existing trend with web and  mobile especially I pattern  it's just bringing a very old  old ugly ugly interface up to  speed with the rest of the  entire Internet and they do it  pretty well. Now they don't  break any new ground. They are  not giving you something  revolutionary but they're also  not giving you something  that's so difficult to  navigate that users are going  to quote revolt. It's very  visual. It's gorgeous. It's  pretty. I do feel like

Transcript:  Facebook is in this kind of  endless cycle though of  taking out features and then  putting the same features  back in. I mean it's a move  forward. It's more modernized  but you know they used to  show us everything and then  people don't want everything  when they when they were  jealous of Twitter for a while  and then they took that away  and now there's like a feed  where you can see everything  and they used to be make a  little give you the ability to  sort by the type of update  and they took that away  because they said people  didn't use those controls and  now they're back in. So I  think that what I got from

Start time: 1192.44
End time: 1212.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  talking to some of the product  people when I was there and  some of the engineers is that  they just get these  overwhelming complaints. I'm  not seeing my friends or my  friends talking to me about  seeing my friends updates in  my newsfeed. That is the  number one complaint about  newsfeed and that's what they  were trying to fix. So now  they did they fix it. They did  because now there's a there's

Start time: 1212.56
End time: 1244.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  categories. Can you say well  here I'll give you an example  and this was very  controversial Nick built and  writing in the bits blog of  New York Times pointed out  that that subscribers  basically see very little of  your content. Your friends see  your content but Facebook  while they remember they  added this ability to  subscribe to somebody. So for  instance I have my friends  and it's just a few hundred  of them but anybody can  subscribe to my Facebook  feed. But what Nick seems to  have found is that nobody  sees these posts. Well that's  what Facebook is trying to

Start time: 1244.64
End time: 1286.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  change now. They're trying to  let you look at different  kinds of content the people  you subscribe to the people  you're very close friends  with and then different kinds  of content by you know the  type of content itself  whether it's photos or music  or whatever. They're trying  to fix this like every user  has their own content. They  have their own content. The  Facebook community user has  their own. I didn't see  enough of blank today on  Facebook and they're trying  to appeal to everybody at the  same time. Now are they going  forward or they going back  or they flip flopping. I  think they're trying to make  something that works for a  billion people and we're  watching them do it in the  public eye. Peter Kafka  they're not doing it all  behind doors like Adobe for  example when they make  Photoshop they roll out their  Photoshop update and that's  it. And they don't update it  again for however long a  year. They fix bugs but they  don't make any big changes.  Right and we're seeing

End time: 1328.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can I ask a question as a  publisher and somebody you  know we put out our content  on Facebook and hope people  in Houston share it. And so  there's some concern here  about how much publishers  content will be seen if  people are able to select  specific feeds and thus not  see the stories that we're  putting out. So when you  have the all the content  that's available to you  and it's all available to  people in the world and  that's what we're seeing  in the world. And so I  think that's the biggest  thing. I think that's the  biggest thing. I think  that's the biggest thing  that we're seeing in the  world. And I think that's  the biggest thing. I think  that's the biggest thing  that we're seeing in the  world. I don't know if  you've actually seen  all items feed. Do you  see the brands that you  have followed or do you  just see all of your  friends? I mean I don't

Start time: 1328.90
End time: 1336.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  follow any brands so I'm  probably not the best  person to answer that.  But I do. I do and I see  nothing but ads for those  brands. I mean you still.  That's just so, I don't

Start time: 1336.46
End time: 1349.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  have the new feed but  that's one of the things  that really bugs me. In  fact that was Nick's  contention is that really  he wouldn't get  engagement on stuff he  shared unless he paid.  You know what though  that's not how you  see it. That's not how  you see it. That's not  how you see it. That's not

Start time: 1349.86
End time: 1353.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  true. You know what  though that's Nick's  friggin problem. If  you're bad at social

Start time: 1354.24
End time: 1355.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  media if you think so.

Start time: 1355.18
End time: 1358.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If the things that you  are sharing are not  relevant to other people

Start time: 1359.00
End time: 1385.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if they don't want to  share it. No I think  that that's not true.  Now Peter Kafka did  have Facebook's  response if I can find  this. He says  Facebook said there's  no pay to play scheme  here because Nick  really implied that he  did an experiment. He  has 25,000 subscribers.  Nobody saw anything.  None of them saw  anything he posted  on Facebook. He  paid for it. Facebook  said no that's not  true. But then you

Start time: 1385.98
End time: 1420.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  know later Facebook  came back last week  and said yes there  was a bug in our code.  Right. We fixed it.  And in fact we  noticed more people  seeing our stuff  before than the numbers  had shown us previously.  Which you know made  us feel better but  still it doesn't seem  like you get in front  of as many people.  You know what we're  sharing is news stories.  We're not necessarily  these aren't ads.  We're not necessarily  these aren't ads.  They're stuff that  people may want to  share with each other.  And so it's  frustrating to us to  kind of have our  stories out there  and not be promoted  unless we pay for it.  Well exactly and  that's kind of what

Start time: 1420.91
End time: 1426.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nick was saying.  He's a New York Times  writer. He wants to  he's not it's not  gossip he's putting  out here.

Start time: 1426.80
End time: 1429.36

Transcript:  14 year old in this  instance. Sorry Nick.  I have 800,000  Facebook subscribers  and I don't think  they see my stuff  either. I've noticed

Start time: 1441.66
End time: 1442.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the same trend that

Start time: 1443.36
End time: 1458.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  he's seen.  Well so what's whiny  that's I think that  Facebook what  actually does come  back to is what  Jolie is talking  about which is Facebook  puts out all these  features and then  they don't necessarily  have the follow through  on them later and  so they launched a  subscription thing.  It must have been

Start time: 1458.66
End time: 1469.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  like a side project  or something and a  year later they left  it out of the algorithm  and no one noticed.  That's what they  said. That's what  they told Peter.  They said Facebook  says we tweak our  Facebook and they

End time: 1482.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bilton who started  accumulating followers  these subscribers via  this site subscribe  option early may have  seen engagement drop  but they don't say  why. So maybe it's  a bug.  Well I don't know  that it's a bug.  I think that Facebook

Start time: 1482.66
End time: 1501.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  has a few things  that are really core  to its user experience.  One is your friendships.  People you know  who know you.  That mutual thing  that is really strong  and really valuable  and genuine,  real. And then the  other thing is  Facebook has a  really strong  network of people  and then the  other thing is  but they added  the subscribers

Start time: 1501.66
End time: 1504.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and things you like it  but they added  subscribers so they

Start time: 1504.54
End time: 1520.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  should support it  or not put it  in at all.  I don't think  it's core to their  product and their  values as a company  and I think that  they put it into  as an experiment  more than anything  else and I just  don't think that  it's when you  think about Facebook  I think it's  kind of tangential

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that if it happens.  I won't say  whiny,  because I think  that's unfair to Nick,  but it is true  that the only people  who care about  subscribers are  public figures.  That the subscribers  was created

Start time: 1574.58

Start time: 1575.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  were adding  and there was a  limit of 5000 people  adding fans as  friends and  public figures  were saying  this is no good  and they were  topping out of 5000.  So Facebook said  alright, alright,  you can have people  subscribe,  that's a different  category.  You can still share  to family and  friends and  a lot of...  But the only people  care about that  are public figures

Start time: 1598.85
End time: 1611.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and so  maybe Facebook said  we don't care about...  That content is  just less valuable.  If you and I  are friends,  what you have to  say is very valuable  to me.  It's going to rise higher.  Now if I'm just  a fan of yours,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  share links all the time  and it's very  effective because  that's what people  use it for.  Well and it's  completely unfiltered  but it's not  technically called  edge rank  but the algorithm  that is  popularly called  edge rank  that Facebook has  considers  is Nick built  in posting stuff  that people  are going to  determine how  much people  actually want to  see this  because as soon  as Facebook  starts to mess up  on how much

Start time: 1656.54

Transcript:  a little  befuddled  you know  I talked to  the Microsoft folks  about this  I think that  what they're doing  right here is  they're setting  expectations  for touch interaction  that are not  intuitive yet  because we are  still babies  when it comes to  how do we use  a touch operating system  what is a touch  operating system  that's not just  confined to  a tiny mobile screen  so I think  I'm not willing  to be uncomfortable yet  so Windows 7  right

End time: 5532.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of touch  that people understand  well I think Microsoft  is trying to  get in on that conversation  they're also going  a step ahead  and they're sending out  like they did  a big old white paper  for designers  and developers  on interactions  for gestural control  so they're trying  to set the stage  and set the concept  of conversation  for how we interact  once touch screens  are a thing of the past  once we're just interacting  in 3D space  and I think they're trying  to kind of get ahead  of the curve there  they're way ahead  of the curve on that one  maybe even a little bit

Start time: 5539.72
End time: 5592.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yeah I mean  so touch is like  the interface starts to disappear  because there's  an authentic relationship  between what you're doing  and what's manipulating  so you actually feel  like you're touching  something and making it happen  it's natural  so this leap motion  it detects within the field  in front of the computer  instead of  so it's a little puck  you put kind of in front  of your left  yes similar to Kinect  if you use that  you understand it  and you use  it understands the points  of your five fingers  so the demo that I did  that was really cool  was a piece of clay  rotating around  and you stick your finger out  as if you  while it's rotating  you carve a groove into it  as it comes around  and then you can  kind of go like this  and it shows you  the next angle  so you're getting  you're just like  you're feeling like  you're actually interacting  with a virtual object  the same kind of leap forward  that you get with  a touch screen  now it's like  even beyond that  because you're not  because you have space

Start time: 5592.58
End time: 5612.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you have multiple dimensions  now that's I think  that's a case where  gorilla arms or zombie arms  or whatever you want to call it  would actually be a problem  and I think Microsoft  in their white paper  on gestural interactions  they mentioned that  you can't have people  just waving their arms  in the air all day  yeah yeah yeah  you want it for a special thing  but either that  or we're going to have  to figure out  I'm into that  take me to the gun show  I'm ready
