We have the reigning monarchs of the gadget world on the show today, ladies and gentlemen.  The crown jewels of gadgetry.  I don't even know where to begin, so I'm just going to do it in alphabetical order, starting  with Richard Baggily, who is...  Hi there.  Are you editor in chief?  Editor, what is your title?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm the editor in chief of WirelessInfo.com, one of my minions below me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  WirelessInfo.com, which is a great site for wireless news.  By the way, this is going to be the iPhone show.  Give you a chance to tune out right now.  Those of you who said enough with the iPhone hype already, but we've got to do one show  where we really, now that we all have them.  In fact, I think among the five panelists here, we've got over two dozen iPhones.  So I think we're pretty well equipped here.  Welcome, Richard.  It's good to have you your first time on Tweet.  Let's see, that's BA.  Now, BE is Veronica Belmont from Buzz Out Loud.  She's a welcome member of the Tweet team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And also, of course, CNETtv.com.  With her also, BEBL, Ryan Block, who is the editor in chief of...and Gadget, the great...  Hello, hello.  The number one, I think, Gadget blog.  Is there any other?  I don't think so.  I hope not.  We won't mention those other guys.  And last, but certainly not least, the L in the group, which is Callie Lewis from Geekbrief.tv.  Hi, Callie.  Hey.  I'm so glad to get you all on because I can't think of really a better group to talk about  the iPhone.  We could have Dvorak on, but I'll tell you what, let me do what Dvorak would do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What would be the fun in that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, but I really wanted to do it with Dvorak.  All right.  I'll take turns impersonating Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was looking forward to that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No fighting.  I wanted to.  All right.  Tell me, Ryan, what would Dvorak say about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  iPhone, iPhone sucks.  John Dvorak.org.  Slash blog.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're done.  That's it.  We don't need John anymore.  We can channel him.  All right, John.  He's been all along kind of an anti-iPhone guy, and I doubt very much he's changed his  tune, and I certainly don't think he's had an iPhone.  And I think that that was one of the critical elements for me was that everybody on this  show at least have had an iPhone for 15 minutes.  And I know that's you, Callie Lewis.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You've owned one for longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was so excited when I got the activation email.  Finally.  So I had an inactive iBlock for a little while.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You bought it.  Did everybody wait in line here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did.  Ten hours for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ten hours for Callie.  How long, Veronica?  Oh, only about five.  Six for me.  Richard, I know you didn't have to wait in line, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, no, we did.  We were out there at 3 o'clock in the morning on Friday outside the mall in Cambridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Ryan, how about you, Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would say it was about 10, but I waited in a number of lines.  We kind of did a multi-city line blog.  Wow.  That's what I called it.  We covered every single Apple Store line that we could possibly do.  So I was all over the South Bay covering different lines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Instead of live blogging, they did line blogging.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The whole new adventure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You might say we were doing line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not only 24 iPhones among us, but also about 24 hours spent in line among us.  And here's the joke on all of us.  Today you could wander into an Apple Store, leisurely stroll in, plunk down your five  or six hundred bucks and walk out with an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not so in San Francisco.  It sold out?  There's another line out at the San Francisco store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting.  Yeah, but wasn't that for people returning it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I wouldn't give up the experience for anything, though.  That was amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a sense of community, wasn't it?  Oh, yeah.  It was like Woodstock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or the closest thing Oliver gets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say, I was nervous about being too public in line.  I went to the small AT&T store in Petaluma because I didn't want to look like a fanboy.  I didn't want to kind of blaze in my name out there as a fanboy.  I was waiting in line, as all of you were, because we needed to review it as soon as  possible and Apple wasn't going to FedEx me one Saturday delivery.  So I had to go buy one.  Do you think that in some cases the journalists were a little bit too, I don't know, pro-iPhone  even before it came out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there was the whole hype factor of the whole thing.  We really had no choice but to talk about it because that's what everyone wanted to  hear about for the most part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apple very cleverly managed the news cycle by dribbling out news releases over the six-month  period.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they're very good at that.  I think some people kind of got swept up in the whole thing though, you know, and it's  very easy to do.  You know, there was so much hype going on and this is, wow, so many different things  happening and they released all that news over the week before, just bit by bit, and  they managed that pretty well.  So it was kind of easy just to get swept up in the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the hardest part is being a journalist and kind of getting hosed by Apple was that  They gave it out to the four journalists, the USA Today, Newsweek, and then of course  Mossberg and Polk, and then all the other journalists just had to kind of fend for themselves  and wait for it to come out.  And it was kind of, you know, kind of a big F-U to the rest of the media world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, worse than that, I think that as a result, those big four, Newsweek, the New York Times,  USA Today, and the Wall Street Journal were a little bit kinder to the iPhone than it  deserves perhaps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but this is how it goes every single time there's an Apple product launch.  I would say the number one accusation that flies towards Pogue and Mossberg is that they're  Apple fanboys.  And that goes hand in hand with the fact that they're constantly getting pre-release Apple  units and they're among the only people in the world getting pre-release Apple units.  So I would like to say that I was pretty upset, but I really wasn't because we all knew in  our heart of hearts that they were going to get the units and we'd all prepared ourselves.  It wasn't unexpected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was just kind of annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was prepared to be more upset.  When the Apple TV came out, only Mossberg and the Wall Street Journal got it.  Pogue had to wait like the rest of us.  That would have upset me more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I remember Pogue having an early review.  Did he?  Yeah, at least he really liked it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, all right.  But not as early as Walt.  Walt got it a week before or 10 days before everybody else did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a solutioning moment for just thinking, you know, this is so frustrating.  They're so exclusionary.  You know, they've got this exclusive club of these four people and it's very frustrating  that they won't let anybody else in.  Well, they don't need to let anyone else in.  No, they don't need to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They needed the hype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The hype is taken to a new level because I asked my mom if she knew about it and she  doesn't know about technology news or anything.  She knew exactly what it was, what it did.  Even Neil's grandmother knew it as the phone that does everything but wash your dishes.  Is the hype justified?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's what the real question is here.  There's no denying that there was an enormous amount of hype about this device, but why  was there so much hype?  I mean, Apple always has a certain amount of hype going around its new product releases,  but why did this one touch such a nerve on pop culture in its entirety?  I have to think it's because it's really true that almost everyone hates their cell phone  and almost everyone wants something that's going to do all of these tasks in a much more  easy way for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was for many of us the holy grail.  We said Steve Jobs save us and we're going to get to, but not yet, whether Steve did  his job right and whether he did save us.  What I'd like to do organizationally is start with the line experience.  Go on to what it was like to buy it if you feel like it was well done.  How activating went, we'll talk to not Veronica Callie about that one because I know she had  some trouble.  And then I think at the end, and it won't be quite the end, but let's get to the user  experience and what it's been like using one of them.  You said Callie that the line was like Woodstock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  What I know of it and the closest thing I'd ever get to it.  I thought it was an amazing experience.  I wouldn't give it up for anything because we got there.  I was 28th in line and we all made friends with the five or six people around us and  we didn't care about if you needed to go to the bathroom.  Hey, we'll hold your spot.  It was a very friendly experience.  Unlike the PlayStation 3 lines, there was no violence.  Right.  Yeah, exactly.  But then we get 15 minutes out and people start trying to get in line.  The one lady that was beside me, she was super sweet the whole day.  And then somebody comes in line and she turns and she said, what are you doing?  She gets so upset and she starts, no, you're not.  She calls security over.  All right.  There's a big fight and we couldn't turn our camera on because mall security wouldn't  allow us to turn our camera on.  I wanted to capture that because I thought something was going down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ryan, you waited.  It was a woodstock experience.  Yeah, there was some woodstock there.  Don't eat the brown.  We actually had ice cream handed out to us from Cold Stone.  It was next door to the AT&T store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're lucky, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And AT&T was giving out water.  But AT&T matched their hospitality with something that I thought was a little weird, which was  the upsell.  They went down through the line several times trying to sell their DSL.  In fact, there were some other pitchmen.  There was a woman selling golf lessons or something.  There were other people.  You're a captive audience.  Ryan, you were line blogging.  You went to see a number of lines.  Is that experience that Callie had pretty typical across all of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it was a very palatable sense of goodwill in the air.  Everyone is really excited to be there, really excited to be a part of it.  Everyone is super stoked to be getting their device, which is no surprise.  I mean, anybody who's going to be waiting in a line like that, I think is going to be  really happy about picking this thing up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was there a difference between the Apple line and the AT&T line?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't actually get to check out any AT&T lines personally.  We had a couple of other people at the AT&T lines.  By and large, they were obviously a lot shorter.  They had a lot less phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they all had 60.  Mine had 60.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They had a lot less phones.  My suspicions were correct.  They churned through customers at, I think we mathematically calculated, at between 10  and 11X slower.  We actually saw people at Apple stores.  We counted about 150 customers would get through in the time that it would take between 10  and 15 customers to get through at an AT&T store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We noticed that as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it was pretty unbelievable.  Obviously, Apple was the place to buy yesterday.  Ironically, because I think where the community was strong at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even Steve Jobs said, or is reputed to have said in an offhand comment to somebody on  a panel, I would go to the AT&T store.  It won't be quite the zoo.  They had a lot more phones at Apple and they handled the purchases a lot more quickly.  Let's get from each of you.  If you have an anecdote about a person in line, I'll start.  Actually, it was kind of neat.  I had the same experience you did, Kelly, where everybody around me kind of talked and  became friends.  There was one woman who was a major gadget freak.  She said, I haven't bought anything since January.  This is it for me.  When she found out that she'd need to download iTunes 7.3, she called her husband, who she  said is not a techie at all.  He's a rancher and walked him through the process of downloading 7.3.  He said, should I reboot?  She said, yes, reboot.  She was ready to come home and activate that sucker right away.  There was also next to me a high school freshman, 15 years old, with his skateboarding buddies,  the three of them kind of hung out in line.  Only he was getting the phone.  He went to the ATM machine, took out his last pennies.  He had it down to the dollar and held it in his little hands.  It was so sweet.  Does anybody feel like maybe given that you can easily get one, I mean, I don't think  it's hard to get one now, that any of us were crazy or really was, I think it was worth  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it was worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was worth it as well.  It was just, it was kind of an experience.  We went along, we had some fun.  I met some nice guys from MIT.  We chatted for a bit.  Certainly where I was, everybody was very civilized and very polite.  There was only one thing where one guy in a wheelchair decided he suddenly wanted to  join the line three people back.  You know, and just, he just basically lifted up the thing and drove in.  Oh, geez.  Fortunately, the security guards saw him and they quickly pulled him out.  But that was the only sort of thing I saw that was any unpleasantness.  Yeah, it was very, very, very civil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in line with Ryan as well.  And everyone was just really nice.  If you had to go up and use the bathroom, they'd hold your place.  People were leaving their laptops even and having people they didn't know watch their  laptops when they were going out to get coffee and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I left my Sony ebook reader, but nobody stole it, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was very impressive.  I have to say, I got caught up in the whole thing because I wasn't even planning on buying one.  What?  I was just there to get another review unit for CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right.  And so I was hanging out in line and I was covering the line for CNET TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then I, you know, I finally, I get up to the front and we're talking about it and  everyone's all excited.  And I get to the checkout and they're like, so what can I get for you today?  And I just go, ah, two eight gigas.  And I see that.  And the people with me were like, what?  You're getting one?  And I was like, I don't know.  I guess I have to.  And then I came home and I got back to work and they're like, oh, I see you got two.  And I was like, yeah, one's for me.  But I'm happy I have it now, although I can't activate it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never seen anybody spend more, spend 700 bucks or 600 bucks.  I mean, impulse buy, but not just you, everybody gladly forked over this.  What really is a lot of money.  They were smiling.  Nobody, there was no pain being felt.  Even this 15 year old who was spending his life savings.  He was gladly happily doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How can I mean, I really think this speaks to this complete vacuum in consumer electronics  where people, everybody carries a phone and nobody likes their phone.  So for once we got an opportunity to, you know, for a lot of these people anyway, I  don't want to speak for myself on this because I use a variety of phones, but a lot of people  got an opportunity to get a phone that they felt would really kind of meet all of their  usable and fun in such a way that they've never really had an opportunity to experience  before.  And I think that in itself, you know, really kind of proves the theory of the iPhone and  that's that usability and design and user interface and, you know, the human factor,  so to speak, is far more important than specs or, you know, features or any of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's very true.  The amount of wonderment and awe that you get from using the phone, it's not something  you ever get from a kind of like handheld device like that, especially not in the mobile  department.  You know, people are using this phone for the first time and flipping through photos  and flipping through their list of contacts and everything you do with the phone is just  a new experience that people aren't used to.  And it's the whole between like how it looks and how it feels and how it works.  I mean, that's what's getting people really excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're still in the honeymoon period, guys.  I think there are some negatives here that people are going to come up with and they're  going to be more and more frustrated.  We'll get to that though in a little bit.  Any other stories from the line anybody wants to share?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I was at the Palo Alto store and Steve actually ended up showing up there later,  but I wasn't around.  There were some real celebrities there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was Bill Atkinson was there.  So was, I've forgotten his name.  Scoble?  Scoble was there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Weren't the Dignation guys there too?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I'm thinking more Apple celebrities.  And was of course waiting in line, but not in that store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, yeah, I actually got an opportunity to speak with Wals.  He was at the Valley Fair store and he sat down and gave a little chat for an engaging  interview.  Super nice about this whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's great.  I think he enjoys being, he and gets it and enjoys being among those people.  That's why he goes on the geek cruises.  He's not, he doesn't want to hide out.  He wants to be among his fellow geeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anyway, so the anecdote is that I was at the Palo Alto store and this is a few hours before  Steve got there.  I think it was maybe about one in the afternoon, so about five hours before launch.  And I'd walked all the way down the block, you know, maybe 200 people deep into the line  at the end of the corner.  And as I'm sitting there kind of photographing the line to put in the line blog, this car  pulls up to the left of me and I didn't really notice it because, you know, it was a busy  street.  And then they stop and just lay on the horn and they were obviously trying to get some  attention. I look around, I'm like, what is going on here?  And there's five people leaning out of the car, all snapping pictures on real proper  iPhones, like laughing and hooting and basically like trying to catch everybody's attention.  And then as soon as people start noticing it's a car full of iPhone users, they peel  out and that's just me.  Yeah, it was pretty cruel, but I don't think anybody enough people notice to inside a riot

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or obviously Apple, renegade Apple employees, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apparently so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was the first person who was out of the store with the iPhone where I was in  Cambridge and I was kind of concerned that somebody was going to jump me.  So I actually did was we kind of ran off and we one of my colleagues had his motorbike  there. We'd like zoomed off into the distance, get it back to get it back to review it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oddly enough, AT&T seals the bags.  They have adhesive on the inside of the bag.  Apple didn't do that.  They AT&T was odd.  They sealed the bag.  I think it was so that you wouldn't take it out in the store and open it right there.  But maybe it was to keep it from being lifted.  I don't know.  So activate.  Actually, let's go to the buying experience.  Any any issues with buying it?  It sounds like the Apple is very straightforward.  You hand over the dough, they give you the phone.  I think the only problem I had at Apple was I had to high five everybody in the entire

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  store. We got that too.  One of the first people in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's neat. Yeah, Scott.  There's a picture of Scott Bourne on the San Francisco Chronicle.  Practically. I don't know if he's actually touching the ground, practically walking on  air as he leaves and a bunch of happy Apple employees.  Callie, what were you going to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I just thought they did an amazing job at making you feel like a celebrity, you  know, with the line of employees clapping you on and everybody's cheering and going  in and going out. And partly I was you know, we were taping inside there.  So it was even more of a boost for me, I guess, coming in and going out.  So because I was on tape as well on camera for the for the show.  But I just the whole experience, I mean, everybody was smiling and everybody had drunk  the Kool-Aid. Actually, literally, we had Kool-Aid outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, let's be fair.  I think that if you're dropping six hundred dollars on a phone, plus it to your contract  with no subsidy. Yeah, you should probably get the celebrity treatment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You see, I would like to hire a bunch of Apple employees to just follow me around  and make me feel better when I drop six hundred dollars on anything.  Like when I bought like a four hundred dollar Marc Jacobs purse, where were they clapping  and cheering? That's not making me feel bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The economy. Yeah.  Well, maybe they ought to be cheering.  Sounds like they have a lot of extra phones in stock.  Now, you said that the San Francisco store is sold out, Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're not sold out. They have they had a line again this morning, though, because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you go online, there's a Apple phone finder.  And last night, after the stores closed, I went through it and there wasn't a single  store that didn't still have phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they've obviously heavily supplied the AT&T stores are dangerously close to selling  out if they haven't already. At least the eight gigabyte versions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody in line for mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They sold out. We're hearing rumors that like five people would walk in and then walk  back out and they would be out of eight gigabyte versions right away.  So they were sorely understocked in a lot of different places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting. But they are interested in getting them from the AT&T stores.  Yeah, they weren't. I mean, it's not the same experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but some people don't have an Apple store in their area.  AT&T is all they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what? Yeah, I got the phone there. I don't mind.  I didn't mind going to AT&T.  I have to say I had that very store.  I had been in with a singular phone and thrown up my hands and canceled my account  some years before because of the lousy inattentive service.  And I don't know if they it was because it was the iPhone or they were heavily  trained, but it was a very different place when I went in there.  They were very friendly.  It did take about 18 minutes.  The computer they said our computers are really slow.  I think it's because the AT&T stores were validating credit.  And, you know, the they were actually doing credit reports on people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Were they were they activating in store?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They weren't doing any activation, but they were doing kind of a pre  qualify it looked like. Oh, weird.  Now, I had an advantage because I have an AT&T phone, a Blackberry that I,  you know, so I was just taking over a new phone.  So it was much faster for me. It was very quick.  But there was quite a sluggish line for a while, which is good.  They only had 60 phones. If they had 500, it might have been a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a very interesting experience with calling my AT&T, my T-Mobile  customer service yesterday.  So I have T-Mobile currently and, you know, I was, you know, just wanted to see  how much time I had left on my contract.  So I gave them a call and I said, I just want to know, like when my contract is up.  And he said, oh, July, July 10th.  I'm like, oh, OK, I thought it was the 28th.  And he said, why are you are you canceling?  And I said, no, no, I just I was just curious.  And he goes, OK, you're not you're not planning on getting a new phone today, are you?  And I was like, no, dude, I was just curious.  I, you know, I just wanted to know how much time my contract was left.  He said, OK, well, if there's anything we can do to make your experience  more enjoyable, just let me know.  And I said, OK, I got to go. Bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've actually been very happy with T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a horrible breaking up with T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like T-Mobile. I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it depends where you are, but I think the customer service is very good.  But you're right. Very good.  There's signals pathetic in most places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so I still can't activate my iPhone for another two weeks or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's why you haven't activated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Luckily, I have enough to play with between home and work.  But I can't actually activate my true iPhone for another until the 10th,  because I just don't want to pay another two hundred dollars  on top of the six hundred dollars I've already spent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't believe you.  You had similar.  You had real problems, Callie, activating your phone.  You know, mine activated in a couple of minutes.  And again, it's because I wasn't doing a transfer of numbers.  I think that's what really took most people a long time.  I talked to somebody today on the radio show who was moving over from Verizon.  And they said, maybe, maybe Sunday.  What happened to you, Callie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, I did transfer over numbers.  I transferred over my first one and I said I chose the option  that I wanted to do both to iPhones and went through the process.  Said it would take six minutes.  Of course, then I got the message saying that it's going to take, you know,  another who knows how long and they'll send me an email and didn't get the email,  didn't get the email. So I called and they said it'll take 24 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And who was your who was the carrier you were transferring?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  T-Mobile. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think you're the most carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I called T-Mobile and they suggested because there had been some problems  that I because I had mentioned that the second line, it never gave me an option  to give them the information on the second line that I wanted to transfer over.  And so they suggest I call them.  So I did call them.  And both AT&T employees, I called back two times just to see what the two  different employees would say.  And both times they said, you know, you do this and this and this.  And then I confirmed, OK, so I do this and this and this.  And they said, well, I believe that's how it works.  Yes. And I said, you believe that's how it works.  And yes, yeah, it's not instilling a whole lot of confidence in me.  It did work. I went ahead and did what they say and  did the second line and it activated right away, which I was very upset.  That was Neal's and it activated right away.  But then mine activated shortly after.  So but I was without it for a while.  And but the the way they they don't know anything.  I mean, if you talk to any of their employees, it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this AT&T that didn't know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, actually, AT&T and Apple.  I called Apple last night when I first got my phone and  they he was tripping over himself.  I was a little negative  on the extra data plan that they that they require you to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I should play a little bit here from your most recent geek brief one.  Not to you.  You don't exactly lose it here, but you're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're not happy with direct Internet access, along with visual voicemail  and a host of other goodies under pricing and availability.  The release says all plans include unlimited data, email and web visual  voicemail, 200 SMS text messages, rollover and unlimited mobile to mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were not happy because it wasn't, in fact, flat rate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Everywhere you go, you go from one page to another page.  And it says all unlimited.  All plans include unlimited data and you get to the activation process  and you have to pay additional for for additional data.  And that is for the second phone phones data.  But they don't present it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All you have a family plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I had to do a family plan.  And so I was I was upset about that.  And I did talk to an Apple employee and he was tripping over himself.  He didn't know how to respond to me one bit.  He was. Well, I don't.  Well, OK. Well, I mean, that's the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, he probably hasn't seen the iPhone himself yet.  He's probably only been trained five minutes before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're all getting one in July, though, right?  Every Apple employee with a year, ten year or more is getting a free iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did hire a lot of seasonal employees, seasonal being for the iPhone employees.  So maybe they just didn't know the ropes yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  AT&T 2000 seasonal employees are probably not to adapt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. So everybody here has activated,  except those of us who have declined to to save money, T-Mobile money.  Was the activation pretty straightforward for everybody else?  Callie's your yours is now activated, right, Callie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, I got about 45 minutes prior to getting onto the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So so she's playing with it right now. I am pretty sure about that.  Everybody else activation went smoothly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't actually mention before, but I'm talking on the iPhone now,  which is why it probably sounds less. Oh, you sound good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  High quality. Yeah. No, wait a minute.  Wait a minute. I got to say, this doesn't sound like a cell phone.  It sounds like a landline. Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it is. And I'm talking on an 8GIG iPhone.  But yeah, I activated two units yesterday.  Both went through within just a couple of minutes.  And this is right around lunchtime when I'm sure that they were under their heaviest load.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Put it on the speakerphone. Let's hear how that sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, give me a second.  So it's on the speakerphone.  I'm pretty sure, you know, just uses the same mic pickup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are you are you holding it close?  Can you can you hold it a little bit lower? So it'd be like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  yeah, so now I've got it down on the desk. Sounds excellent.  Sounds like I've actually tested the speakerphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then do you have the the earbuds? Can we try that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I can just a second. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say the phone, the phone seems to work quite well.  It seems to be a pretty good phone.  Richard, I'm sure you guys are actually doing real testing  instead of subjective impressions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We have a very high end audio testing system we use for our phones,  which does frequency analysis and all sorts of things.  And we ran it through and this  was pretty much one of the best phones we've seen.  Certainly for the sound that you receive, such as somebody talking to you.  It was it got the highest score we've had so far.  And we tested, you know, a lot of phones.  The sound wasn't quite so good.  It was pretty good.  But the receive sound was just was really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also noticed there's not a lot of, you know, usually on a cell phone call,  you'll hear a lot of interference and hissing and so forth.  I always thought that was the carrier, but maybe it's the mic.  I mean, I don't think all of a sudden AT&T has changed how they how they.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it it's a question of the interaction between the carrier  and the device and and, you know, whoever you're talking to is network as well.  So certainly on all the calls I've made with the with the iPhone,  you know, walking around the streets of Boston, I've had no problem.  And it's it sounded really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about power? Is it a pretty powerful radio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I haven't done an analysis on the signal strength yet.  I did some rough stuff on that.  And it looks like it's got a fairly good antenna in there.  There's some guys, I fix it dot com, who took took one apart.  And they show that the antenna is actually underneath a little plastic bit at the bottom.  That's the reason why you have that little bit of plastic.  That's where the two antennas are.  And it's a fairly good sized antenna.  You know, I haven't done our detailed analysis of the signal strength stuff yet.  So I'll have to pass on that for right now.  But I've not noticed any problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ryan, you have the headsets on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm on the headset. I transferred over to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leave that on. It sounds better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sounds good. Sounds excellent.  You know, it's almost never that you get a headset that sounds better  out of the box than what the actual phone sounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds very, very good, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They usually cheap out on the headsets, but this one looks sounds pretty good.  I haven't run our testing on it yet, but I'm going to do that shortly.  But it sounds pretty good to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something to keep in mind, the earbuds you get,  they look like standard iPod earbuds. They're not.  It's a three ring, three ring tip that obviously has phone control and microphone in it.  And it's a deeper recessed connector.  You can't just use my none of my headphones work in it.  You're going to have to get a ten dollar adapter if you want to use your Edimotics  or your Shores or your.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is an extremely annoying thing about the phone.  Extremely. I can't even understand why they would do that.  There's just no good reason to limit so many people  from using their favorite pair of headphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, that's the whole reason why you'd want to put a three point five  millimeter jack on a music phone like this.  And so you can plug in different headphones that have higher quality  than the out of box pair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be good for the aftermarket.  I'm sure that everybody will produce one with a microphone on it and the D.V.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple does a lot of things that are really good for the aftermarket  and not very good for the consumer.  One thing they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They just spent six hundred bucks on this thing.  I don't want to spend any more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree. And we're going to talk to talk a little bit about the.  Well, let's talk about it now. Why not?  To me, the biggest lack here is the lack of third party applications.  There are a number of things on this iPhone that we ought to have  that could easily be supplemented with a third party app that isn't there.  How long before Apple opens this up?  Ryan, you want to you want to say anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's been a lot of speculation about this and it needs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It needs to be opened up.  I think it's imperative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple knows that.  I think that a lot of a lot of things I've read from Apple,  you know, interactions with Apple employees specifically around WWDC.  There was a lot of, you know, rumor going around that Apple employees were saying,  yeah, we're going to do it.  Is, you know, hold out, hold on.  We're just going to do it right.  And it's not going to be a launch feature.  The impression I got when I was sitting at D watching Walt grow, Steve,  was, you know, at one point, Steve said pretty specifically,  we're going to give people what they want.  Just be patient and give us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I heard a rumor today that the SDK is in good shape on OS 10.  The thing that's holding it up is it's not very good on Windows.  Anybody hear anything like that?  I'm sorry, say it again.  There is an SDK, a third part for third party apps, but it's in its and it's ready.  It's mature on OS 10, but it is not near mature on Windows.  And they don't want to release it. OS 10 only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hmm. I didn't hear that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Could be just a bogus rumors.  I have to point out and I pointed this out on a break weekly.  There is a fourth row, empty row for icons.  It's not occupied.  And furthermore, there are two applications on here, stocks and weather,  that are very clearly Yahoo confabulator widgets.  Hmm. I mean, they're indistinguishable from the confabulator widget  that I have on my OS 10.  And then, of course, that makes sense because they're just JavaScript, CSS and pings.  There's nothing special in these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the stocks one has a little Yahoo logo in the corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's got the I mean, it looks exactly the same.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm definitely going to I expect there to be widgets,  widget like, you know, development very soon in the future for iPhone.  I just don't see why they would limit third party developers  from making something like that when they have, you know, widgets on OS 10.  Why not widgets on the iPhone or something that functions very much like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And every smartphone on the market allows third party apps,  even the lockdown sidekick allows third party apps.  You have to get approval, but at least it allows them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just feel so they probably just don't have a quality control thing built in yet  that made them feel comfortable with letting people develop the third party apps.  You know how controlling Apple is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to look at widget development.  I mean, widget development is something that is very, very different from app  development, because when you look at widgets, I mean, you're basically just talking about,  you know, XML, HTML, CSS, JavaScript and, you know, some HTTP calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not talking about the actual building of the widgets.  I'm talking about the letting third party developers create a program for the iPhone.  I mean, that ability to let them do that, not the fact that there's some kind of,  you know, physical limitation to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you can't, you can't actually download files or upload files from the iPhone.  There's no file manager.  So they've kind of really excluded any kind of file interactivity on the device.  But I mean, widgets themselves, there's no reason why they couldn't have launched with it.  At very least widget support.  So you kind of get that that same, you know, dashboard widget ecosystem going on.  The iPhone is as you have on a lot of other devices that have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was something I was expecting right off the top.  And when they said that wasn't going to happen, I was really surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of thought there would be at least a chat application.  They're trying to treat SMS as chat.  It looks just like iChat's got the little bubbles even makes the iChat sounds, but it's not.  It's SMS and you're paying for messages.  You get 200 messages a month.  But if you're doing it, if I'm chatting with you, that's going to go by in about three days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and the SMS client isn't that good anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, well, fortunately, if you want to get really tricky about it, you can actually log on to Mebo.  Right.  From the mobile Safari version.  And you can't do IM over over the web page through Safari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's an excellent hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Which which clients does Mebo support?  Is it all of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All of them?  Yeah, most major ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So cool.  So that's that's good.  I'm going to log on to Mebo right now.  That's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's no use if you haven't got a signal, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you wouldn't want to use it on edge.  It's another problem, which is that the edge network, even though it's been improved, is not very fast.  Have you tested the speeds on this, Richard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we looked at we did a number of speed tests and we'd never got beyond 100 kilobits per second.  And, you know, it's like, you know, that kind of makes the YouTube application rather pointless.  You know, if I want to look at skateboarding dogs, I want to look at them quickly.  No, and I just can't do that on the edge.  It just takes too long.  The Wi-Fi is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I find that really interesting because I was getting upwards of 160.  In fact, right before the night before the iPhone launched, I was testing on some other handsets and I was getting well over 250 Kbps on edge.  So, yeah, I mean, obviously it depends on, you know, where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're in San Francisco.  He's in Boston.  There's the problem.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, I mean, the networks are going to be different everywhere.  But, you know, part of that does happen to rely on where you are.  And out here, I guess the edge is just a little bit better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They did noticeably improve edge.  I mean, I was watching my BlackBerry and it felt faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did a lot of work on the network to bring out more edge capacity, I think.  But it's still not...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I have to say the Wi-Fi implementation is excellent.  When I walk into my office, it doesn't, you know, it doesn't say anything.  It just does it.  It's very easy to get access points.  It seems to be pretty snappy once you've got Wi-Fi working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The way I use the phone, I won't use the edge service.  I'm a hermit, so I stay in the house and I have Wi-Fi.  And if I leave the house, I have mobile broadband.  So I will never use the data service.  I'll just use Wi-Fi.  And so actually, I talked to AT&T and they said that you can cancel,  you know, after you set it up and everything, of course,  you can cancel your data plan.  So I'm planning on doing that.  Save myself the extra 20 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm not sure I follow you have mobile broadband, but that's not on your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So then I know, but then I can connect to Wi-Fi via that via her

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wi-Fi, carry a laptop and use the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, right, because I always carry that.  So if I want to use my iPhone, then I'll just connect to that and use my iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think this actually speaks something really interesting about what Apple has done here  and how they really missed the mark on the data.  The fact that people and you're not the first person I've heard say this,  are considering taking a laptop with a 3G card and using like sharing Wi-Fi  over that to get higher speeds on their iPhone.  That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Take the size of the iPhone.  It's a good idea until you actually really think about what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's completely ridiculous.  I think we really need to get 3G in this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm sure the second generation will.  But here we are with our six hundred dollar first generation phone.  Some of us more than one, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had a nightmare last night that they were releasing a 3G version next weekend.  Yeah, that would be a nightmare.  I actually had a nightmare that they were updating the iPhone  like right away after I bought one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now, there was a rumor going down the line and saying, oh, no, you know,  they're they're announcing right now before six o'clock.  They're announcing that they're giving out a 3G in two weeks or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would have stabbed myself in the eye.  Yeah, I thought that rumor is just cruel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just the main is spreading a rumor like that.  Who would do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would even be more ironic for me because I still won't even be able  to use my iPhone until that next version supposedly will have come out.  And then I'll just have like a dot of an iPhone sitting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you can return it. You have some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can. I know I'm just teasing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's talk about the keyboard, because this is another area where now  Walt Mossberg, Apple fan, Walt Mossberg said that, oh, give it time.  And a couple of just as Apple does, ironically, in a couple of weeks,  you'll feel very comfortable with it.  Now, we've only had it for less than a day, but I do not feel comfortable with it.  And I'm not getting better at it.  And I got to point out something. It doesn't like my name.  It has a predictive, as you know, it has a predictive algorithm, not T9.  And unlike T9, it doesn't learn.  So when I start typing LAP, it won't let me type O.  It wants me to type I or Q or almost any other letter.  But, oh, it says, no, there's nothing in my dictionary.  LAPO. You can't continue.  I have to actually lift my finger off, go back down as if I'm starting another word.  And then I could type the O.  Then it does the same thing with the T.  Now, you'd think after I did that about 20 times, it would learn.  But no, it doesn't. And I find this very annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had the same thing.  And obviously, just Apple doesn't think that I exist or something.  I don't know. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't know Baggouli?  No, it's a common name.  So this is a problem.  And T9 at least learns the first time you give it a new word.  It says, OK, I know Petaluma now and I'll get that right from now on.  That seems to be a problem.  Is anybody getting comfortable with the typing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought the typing wasn't too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really? Well, you have little pointy fingers.  I do. It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you using single finger or one thumb or two thumb?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I took the heeded the advice, Steve Jobs advice, and I started with a finger.  I haven't really progressed to thumbs yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I moved to thumbs pretty quickly and it wasn't too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hate you, Veronica Belmont. I hate you.  Really? So you're able to type pretty quickly on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't find it to be too limiting for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But do you normally use the widescreen or the?  Oh, that's another problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The widescreen keyboard is only in one application.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I yeah, I just have the QWERTY keyboard on my dash that I usually use.  And that's a pretty small keyboard as well.  So I'm not gaining or losing any kind of space for the keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you're not losing space, but you're losing tactility.  You're losing actual physical feel of key.  Yeah. And what I'm saying is I don't have too much of a problem with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Her brain is somehow adjusted to that notion that she doesn't have to have a key there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm having a lot of problem with the keyboard.  I mean, I can do it pretty decently on one finger, but it's just not working for me on two thumbs.  Yeah, I have pretty stubby thumbs and maybe my maybe my anatomy is just not  like compatible with the iPhone yet.  I don't know. I need more practice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Callie, you have fat fingers.  I didn't notice this about you.  I have fat fingers, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I doubt that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel the horizontal keyboard, the horizontal keyboard is so much better than the vertical keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it doesn't show up except on the browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it only shows up in Safari.  But when I'm using it on Safari, I can instantaneously switch over to two thumbs.  Yes. And it feels more comfortable in my hand because it's horizontal.  It gives me my fingers more room to actually grasp the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why in heaven's name would they not implement that across all apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. Maybe they'll see the demand that a customer...  Let's hope for a firmware update.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is an important point.  There are some things they can correct in software very easily like that.  There's some things they can't like a lack of a GPS.  No, you know, I mean, there's some things they're just not going to be able to fix.  The lack of Bluetooth stereo.  I was talking to somebody who said, oh, I can't wait.  I have a helmet that has Bluetooth stereo when I snowboard.  And I said, no, you won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually, to be fair, they can't add ATTP.  They can't have Bluetooth stereo software.  That's just a...  Oh, they can.  Yeah, that's just a...  Oh, it doesn't need hardware support?  No, well, the phone has Bluetooth 2.0.  Oh, OK.  It supports the ATTP.  They just have to enable it.  I assumed it was a hardware.  Which is almost more frustrating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think actually from the analysis I saw the components this morning,  the Bluetooth chip does come with...  It can directly support ATTP.  So I think they may have actually at some point decided  we're not going to do that right now.  You know, I'm not certain on that, but...  That could be a pushed firmware update.  Yeah, but certainly the Bluetooth is pretty much...  It's pretty much crippled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Singular...  Sorry, AT&T do that, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, this is all Apple.  Apple has carte blanche on the phone.  They can do whatever they want.  AT&T had no process whatsoever in the actual rollout of the device  and what features it did or did not have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That doesn't surprise me, given that AT&T probably had  the largest day in its history yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I took a survey in line.  I don't know if anybody else did this or talked to people,  but I asked probably about 100, 120 people  and 37% of them were switching to AT&T.  So the rest were already with AT&T or Singular.  And 100% of those people said that they would have switched  had they not been with AT&T.  So I found that interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's very interesting.  I'm surprised it's only 37%.  Maybe that's a Bay Area thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, well, Dallas, so...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, you're in Dallas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That doesn't surprise me, that's a bigger sound about, right,  from the gut feeling I had talking to people in the line.  I think AT&T had a very good day yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I hope they gave Apple a lot of the money that they made yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Apple is definitely going to be making all their money on this  via the hardware, and that's why the phone is so expensive  and it's not subsidized.  Is it really not? Do we know it's not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, we know it's expensive, but maybe it costs a thousand bucks to make.  You're pretty sure there's no subsidy here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's my understanding that there is no subsidy.  And I can't see how there would be, because again,  it's very expensive.  in these situations, I mean, they make their money on hardware.  That's where their margins are.  There's no software money for them in the iPhone right now out the door.  I mean, they're not making money licensing.  They're not making money selling updates or anything else for the iPhone.  They're definitely not making money really selling content for the iPhone,  since we all know that they make absolutely nothing on music  and very little on movies.  So really for them, it's about selling the hardware.  And that's why the phone is so expensive.  And AT&T is being such a stickler with the long contracts and,  you know, the almost $200 cancellation fee  if you cancel early, because they need to get their cut too.  And they're getting it on the service end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what my cancellation fee would be on T-Mobile as well.  That's $200. It's usually $175, something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. Some carriers prorate it, though.  So if you're you only have like two months left and they'll give you,  you know, that fraction of the cancellation fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've heard that Verizon does that, I believe.  But T-Mobile does not, to my knowledge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What speculates Apple's profit margin?  Anybody want to speculate on this phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hmm. I could be anywhere from,  you know, 200 to $100.  I mean, it's going to be significant.  They have the highest margins in the business.  And I mean, they're, you know,  whereas normal companies are, you know, going in like the single digit  percentages, they're usually in the double digit percentages,  sometimes up to 20 to 25 percent.  But to say for sure, I mean, they've been ramping up for this for so long.  They've gotten really great distribution deals with Samsung for for the flash  memory that they've gotten all these things.  And I mean, they've been they've been really ready to do this thing.  So I would not surprise me if they're making a ton of money on the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you broken down the hardware components, Richard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're looking to do that.  We've we've got a list of all the components from the I think it  guys who took one apart yesterday and they actually not break it.  That's too much.  There is nothing in that that from what I've seen so far that looks hugely  expensive, probably the most expensive part is the screen.  Yeah. The chips are fairly standard.  The processors are fairly standard one.  And the Bluetooth modules are all pretty run of the mill ones.  We've seen a number a number of other places.  So there's nothing in here that screams that, you know, this is, you know,  this chip costs five hundred dollars on its own.  So I probably would agree with Ryan.  I think that Apple's making a fairly good profit on these things.  I don't think they're subsidizing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How many phones do you think they'll sell this weekend?  A lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've seen early estimates that they moved a quarter million units.  There's no way of knowing they're not going to release those numbers,  not for a while, but in this one, that would be one of the best  selling cell phones that we're going to see in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say, what's the closest comparison?  Is there the razor?  What's what other cell phone has even come close to this kind of numbers  during its opening week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, even the razor didn't really have these kinds of numbers,  I don't think, during the opening week, because at the time,  the razor was also six hundred dollars or five hundred dollars.  If I remember correctly, at its debut, but people were not used to paying  that much money for a phone, as well as the fact that there is not this crazy,  insane, unbelievable, irrational desire to have this device,  because even though the razor was really sexy, it didn't do all these amazing  things like the movie, the music, and now that everyone's so obsessed with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think anybody camped out for the razor, as far as I know.  So this is unprecedented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I don't think there's ever been a consumer product of any kind  that's had this kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there's a PS3 in the Wii.  I think the closest thing to coming near iPhone mania  where the console wars this past year and Xbox 360 and the PS2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, those definitely had, you know, they evoked a huge reaction  from the mainstream consumer base, but this has been a whole other ball of wax.  I mean, we're talking about like a massive presence in the general.  Right. Yeah. I mean, you're talking about people are interested in video games,  but everybody, right. Everybody has a cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was interesting.  That's one thing you see in the line, an incredible demographic spread age wise.  I mean, just race.  I mean, it was it was a wide swath of the American populace.  And as we've seen from  polling, the huge recognition factor, 86 percent of all students  knew about the iPhone and a large number of them wanted to buy one.  Two out of three Americans knew the name iPhone.  And they really Apple did a good job of making or if they did it,  of making this a well known product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the first people that came out of the store that I was at  at the Stanford Mall was a probably a eight year old girl  that had an iPhone.  I was like, oh, no, she is spoiled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man.  Well, my daughter wants mine.  And I told her, well, if I go back to my Nokia and ninety five, you can have it.  And I'll be honest with you, I don't know which way I'm going to go.  It's going to take on users.  You love that Nokia. I do.  And I'll tell you, in terms of functionality, the Nokia has got this beat.  It's five megapixel camera.  It does video. I've got chat clients on and I can do everything I want.  It's got your Jaiqu client, Jaiqu, full GPS.  In terms of usability, the Nokia is clunky and it's like a PC versus a Mac.  It's not as elegant.  I have to say the the iPhone screen is is pretty stunning.  It's beautiful in any kind of light.  This thing really shines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we were looking at them outside today and you could see it.  I'm amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't do that with your Mac.  No, no, you certainly can't.  I don't know what they're doing in here, but this is a great it's a touch screen  works pretty well.  I have to say, there's no beach ball on this, but I know it's OS 10  because it does beach ball from time to time.  I don't know if any of you have experienced this, but there are moments  when the phone becomes unresponsive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only time I've really had that problem is when using Google Maps.  I've had it kind of get a little little jumpy, a little almost freezing  for a second, not quite.  And then going back into it when I'm zooming in on a point,  it's done that a couple of times.  And I was like, oh, God, I froze it.  And then it fixes itself right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I've noticed that in a couple of apps, too, but nothing too terrible.  And I have to say, I mean, I'm not this device is not without its shortcomings.  And I definitely have a number of criticisms about it, which, you know,  we haven't really touched on too much yet.  Things that we don't really like about the device.  But I will say that, you know, I think the total amount of time saved  in within the fluid UI and, you know, just the general user experience,  which doesn't have a lot of lag, that those few moments that it does kind of  lag up and slow down are probably going to add up to less time wasted  than on a lot of other devices.  Well, OK, I use a new phone like every three or four days.  And I've never really seen a UI experience.  It's really I agree. It's very snappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although when it's not snappy, it's not I wasn't able to pick up a phone call today.  It was not responding to the button press at all.  And I have it on video.  People were I was streaming at Stickham and people saw it.  So there are times when it gets bogged down.  I'm not sure what it is in particular.  We know it's not a third party app anyway.  I've also had trouble with the voicemail.  I can't record a new greeting for some reason.  It just doesn't respond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So is that an AT&T problem or is that an iPhone problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also earlier just before we went on, was trying to get my voicemail,  said voicemail unavailable, which is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I had that problem a couple of times as well.  I mean, that's an AT&T issue.  The phone system that they're using is new for them.  I'm sure they have a couple of bugs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd expect that. Yeah, I would.  Yeah, that's not surprising at this point, really, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, and I don't hold that in particular against them.  I do hold the ability not to answer a phone call against them.  It's pretty fundamental, really, isn't it?  Yeah. And I hope that was just an isolated incident.  I hope that doesn't happen again.  Well, let's OK, I'll tell you what let's do.  Let's talk about what we like about it.  Then we'll talk about the negatives and then we can sum up  with overall what what this phone means.  So I said I like the screen.  Any other things?  Everybody anybody want to say anything, Callie?  What do you like best about this phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in my 45 minutes of it, I love the screen.  I love the experience.  I, you know, I'm not often maybe it's my generation.  I don't know exactly.  But I when I see products that come out or services that come out,  I automatically think, yeah, OK, that should that's that's right.  It should have happened like this.  And this is one of the only things in my lifetime  that I have just been completely floored by and amazed by.  Unexpectedly good.  Yes. And you know what?  I mean, I've seen the videos.  I've been looking at this this interface for forever.  Right. But I didn't think I would be excited to slide to unlock.  But the first few times I did it, I was.  And so that experience was more than I expected, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I tell you, when you go through your photo album,  using your finger to slide through it and then to zoom in, it is pretty amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's almost like you can feel it when you're flipping through the photos.  There's almost like a weird mental kind of traction with your finger  when you're when you're doing it with the photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very strange. You're doing an acceleration.  I think it's not as not linear.  And so you'll see it goes it goes faster.  Slow. Yeah, a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really responds to when you want to do it  and when you want to play quickly or slowly. It's right. It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Richard, what do you like about this phone now, given that you've probably  done the most in-depth review of anybody here so far, maybe except for Ryan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, perhaps I'm at the least sleep as well.  So you'd like to bear with me on that.  I mean, we love the audio quality.  The design of the thing is just beautiful.  You know, I put this next to a tray of this morning and it was like, oh, yeah,  we look for this in the tray, which is like, yeah, you don't want to go back

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to the other phones anymore. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the interface is just really it's just very simple.  It's very Apple. It just works in the way it goes.  And I love the photo library, as you said.  I love the browser. I hate browsing.  You know, the browser itself, the software is really good.  And it works very well. Yeah, it's intuitive and simple.  It's kind of like Firefox, you know, in that approach.  And it just works very well.  It's very smart. It's a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's in the sense that once you get a page loaded, which does take a while,  but when you double tap on something, it knows how wide it is,  whether it's text or picture and zooms just to fit that object.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just intuitive.  But it's just, as you say, the problem is you have to, you know,  you want to go to the New York Times or wireless info dot com.  And, you know, it takes you five minutes to get there.  And so good plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's good, isn't he?  You get the Dvorak Award for the stealthiest stealthiest plug.  OK, how about you, Veronica?  What do you like about this phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I was really shocked and amazed that it did work  the way I wanted it to as soon as I started using them here.  You know, like Callie said, we've seen all the commercials.  We've seen how it's supposed to work.  But then actually having it in your hand and looking the way it does  is very surprising for someone who's used so many gadgets before.  My favorite thing is probably Google Maps.  I really like the Google Maps app and I like getting directions.  And I think it's very cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you not used that on another phone?  I mean, this is as far as I can tell, exactly the same as the Google Maps  on my BlackBerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My phone, my version of the dash is an earlier version  that doesn't have Java built in.  So I haven't used Google Maps on a phone before.  So, you know, it's kind of exciting for me.  I know other people are probably used to that,  but I think the integration with the iPhone is really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, you can't you can't touch Google Maps on any other phone.  So, no, no, I expect you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the edge connection does kind of blow.  But other than that, you know, it's got it's ups and downs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll get to what blows in a second.  Let's ask Ryan Block of Engadget and probably with Richard,  you probably spent the most time on this thing.  What is it that you like best about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think that there's a long list of things to like about the phone  and probably an equally long list of things that not to like.  So, I mean, it's hard to start off and I guess go through it.  But I mean, as far as devices go,  it almost doesn't even need to be said, but it's beautifully designed.  It's really one of the most attractive pieces of consumer electronics out there.  But it's slippery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nothing to hold on to.  So get a case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  I mean,  this is this kind of level of attractiveness doesn't really matter to some people.  And that's fine. But to me, aesthetics do matter somewhat.  It's not no amount of aesthetics is ever going to make up for a terrible device.  And I think we all know that.  And I would never let that pass.  But it is a very well designed device and, you know,  it's well designed on the inside as it is on the outside in general terms.  So I can give them props for that.  It feels really good in the hand.  It feels really good up against the ear.  And that's not something that every well designed device is.  I mean, you know, I've seen pretty phones that are just really not very comfortable to hold.  So, I mean, that's something simple usability, things like that.  And, you know, just going through and interacting with the device, I mean,  is it definitely has its own feel and it has its own design sensibility about it.  And I mean, even if you don't like Apple, even if you don't like the iPhone,  I think it's really hard to deny the fact this has really kind of changed the game.  For cell phones and raise the bar for human usability in mobile devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the mute switch.  There are a few phones I've had that have had that.  But BlackBerry had one.  But I think that's just every phone that had that.  Speaking as a broadcaster, that's a must.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a great feature. I like that, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The controls that are on it seem to work quite well.  The home button surprised me how much I had to press it.  I thought it's the most mechanical thing on the phone.  The on-off switch works very, very cool.  Yeah, there's a lot there is absolutely in its industrial design.  It's it's superb. And in many of the I think it's a breakthrough in terms of user interface.  I mean, one of the I mean, look, it's well understood how to make a cell phone.  What's what's been a consistent problem for every manufacturer is how to make a portable computer,  how to make a small handheld computer.  And I think this touch interface is is a very good deal of the way towards solving that problem.  It's not there yet, but I think it's a it's a good way towards it.  All right. Now it's time for the bitch fest.  I'll give you each a couple of things.  Who wants to start Veronica?  Is there anything you don't like about this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, like I said, the edge connection is just I think David Pogue put it best where he said  the Wi-Fi was like fast and wonderful in the end, the cellular data was the slow and horrible.  Yeah. And it is pretty slow and horrible.  I mean, it wasn't horrible. Might be a little strong.  I mean, like some things were coming up pretty quickly, but other things were very laggy.  And it just took a while to browse.  That's my main complaint, because I do like to use the Web on the go quite a bit.  And that's going to be kind of a an icky point for me in the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We should point out, though, that it's no slower on the iPhone than it is on any other AT&T device.  It's just that Verizon and Sprint have much faster networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you expect a little bit better. Even AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. Why doesn't it support HSTPA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we can go to the reasons why, but that's not really the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Right. All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ryan, what are a couple of negatives from your point of view?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, I'll try not to speak to the general lack of specs.  You know, for example, ATDP and GPS and the inability to send a mess and record video and these things.  I'm not going to speak to those bits.  Although that was a good list, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it just kind of did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That list goes on and on and on. And I'm not going to go into that list.  But I will say thus far, I've been a little bit unimpressed with the keyboard.  I still hold strongly to the fact that as human beings, we need a certain level of tactile and haptic feedback with the devices that we use.  So having a virtual keyboard, even though you get used to it, it's never really the same as having a keyboard you can feel and click on and actually know that you're typing with.  Yeah. And I don't feel that you should have to trust the device and trust that you're inputting things.  I agree. I think that you should just know.  It's not a matter of trust. It's a matter of knowing for me.  So the keyboard, even when even if I grow to like it and I'm not there yet, I think that I'm always not going to ever like it as much as a regular and proper keyboard.  The lack of 3G for me is a really big deal.  The edge is fast, but it's just not fast enough.  And the Wi-Fi is just a joke.  I mean, it does work well when it works.  But the fact that Steve Jobs actually expects you to leave the house and start connecting with Wi-Fi around town.  I mean, there's no handoff.  You can't be on the move when you're doing it.  You have to be sitting in a spot directly underneath some guy's open router, which is not even very common anymore, in order to get haunting user internet access.  It's just not a real common usage scenario.  So I think that's kind of a little bit out of the question for most people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe I should reframe this.  And you've already done it.  But for the rest of you, maybe what is it that people who buy this phone are going to be disappointed by or surprised by?  Or maybe something somebody should keep in mind before they buy the phone?  Richard, how about you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the browsing is the main thing, I guess.  The speed. But we've already covered that a little, I guess.  The camera. I was a little disappointed.  It's OK.  I kind of had a hope that if anybody could sort out a really good cell phone camera, it would be Apple.  And their expertise in engineering small, good cameras.  But they didn't. It's just all right.  And that's a little disappointing to me.  There's not a lot of settings with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's no settings.  Yeah, there's no settings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's no zoom. There's no white balance.  There's no aperture control.  There's nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I think at the end of the day, the camera really reminds us that Apple is still constrained by the same technological shortcomings as every other company out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, but wait, my N95 has a five megapixel camera with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. But your N95 is also much thicker.  I'm talking about, you know, if you have a fat image sensor, a really nice, large image sensor, maybe with something with autofocus and some good optics, that's going to add some girth to the phone.  And that's not something they wanted to do.  They wanted to use a very small image sensor with a very small lens.  And in doing so, they sacrificed image quality on the camera.  I mean, they're not miracle workers.  They are working with regular technology.  I think that's something worth remembering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're right, Ryan.  And this also reminds us that, you know, even inside this cool, stylish design, it's pretty standard components.  There really isn't anything that radical in terms of the hardware.  I mean, the other thing I was a little disappointed with, we just got some results on the battery testing.  We got about four hours, three minutes out of the talk time, which isn't great.  It's not bad.  But, you know, you always have to be pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But of course, you always divide, I always divide manufacturer's numbers in half.  Is it comparable to...  It seems like it's still better than the other smartphones in the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It depends. I mean, it's pretty much exactly the same as what we got with the Ocean.  But it's a little bit less than the Nokia.  But it's like half of what we got out of the BlackBerry 8800.  You know, the BlackBerry 8800 kept going for like 10 hours.  So it's acceptable.  It would be nice if it was a little bit longer.  But, you know, that's a little disappointing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's not as bad as we thought it would be.  And I have to say, my Nokia 95 will drain it.  You look at it, it'll drain the battery.  So it's better than a lot.  I have to say the camera, one thing I liked about the camera,  and maybe I've heard others have not had this experience, is it's fast.  I mean, I can get from off to a picture in a second or two.  And there's not a lot of camera phones that can do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, we found it very quick to do it.  It's not very quick in terms of taking one shot after the other.  It was very slow at that.  Interesting. I haven't tried that.  Yeah, I mean, we test all this stuff.  You know, we do digital cameras all the time.  The unlock standby to first shot was very quick.  That was 2.43 seconds.  But the shot to shot time was about one and a half frames a second,  which is just really slow, even for a cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Image quality is decent.  It's two megapixels, but it's not bad.  I have quite a few images now on Flickr that I've been taking,  and I've been pretty happy with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Low light is pretty bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh, yeah. No, yeah.  You have to have a lot of light. I did these outside. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, the cell phone cameras always have a problem  with low light because they have Facebook sensors.  Right.  Yeah, it's not about camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Callie Lewis, you have only had it for 15 minutes, so I...  It's a little early to come up with a negative, but go ahead.  See if you can come up with something you don't like about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well...  It's got to be my actual experience.  The keyboard, I had a little bit of an issue with, and the camera.  It took me a while to get something.  I was happy for my wallpaper.  But I think my main issue, because I haven't, you know,  I haven't played with the iPhone, but my main issue is that I feel like  I've made a deal with the devil with AT&T.  Right, right.  So, I mean, that's my big...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you don't have a choice, and you won't have a choice for five years,  I mean, unless Apple decides to break their deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, hey, Callie, if you ever decide that you don't want to use an iPhone  anymore, at least you're still locked into a carrier contract with somebody  who does have 3G, so you could switch over to another phone  if you wanted to, you know, put up a Windows Mobile or something.  Good point.  But I don't think I would want you to use an iPhone.  Not that I think anyone would ever switch from an iPhone to Windows Mobile.  If they did, you could at least get 3G.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where is HSDPA implemented on the AT&T network?  Is it in all the major...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not in all the major cities.  I mean, it's not in LA yet, but it is in a number of major cities.  It's in the Bay Area, so I mean, I use it frequently,  and it does have very good speeds.  I have EBDO on both the Bryzen and Sprint and HSDPA on singular,  and it's very comparable.  Not quite as good, but it's up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Comparable, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And everyone's experience with their customer service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  We don't know yet.  You're the only one who's really had to deal with them.  I have to say that when it was singular, it was awful.  They were among the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but Verizon, I've had nothing but nightmare experiences as well.  And I've had some pretty poor experiences with Sprint, too.  I mean, they're all pretty bad.  They all could use a lesson from somebody much more talented than themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, T-Mobile is really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think T-Mobile leads the way there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're overly polite, if anything.  Yeah, it's such a pleasure to talk to them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very sensitive. They're very sensitive over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They have the least amount of customers, so they try harder to keep them.  Maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not leaving us, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I kept my T-Mobile phone, so I've got both at T-Mobile.  Don't worry, you've got at least one customer here.  I have to say, I was a little disappointed with the way we get the pictures out of the phone.  Now, it's fine that it syncs up.  If you're using a Mac, it'll sync up an iPhoto,  I presume on Windows it would do the same thing with iTunes and Adobe Photoshop album  or whatever programs the iTunes supports.  But if you want to get it out of the phone before you get home,  there's only one choice, and that's to email it.  And it emails it, at least the test I did, at 640 by 480, not original size.  Maybe you can change that. I would have found a way to do that.  And it strips out all the EXIF information.  So it's really a phone where you take a picture and you take it home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And of course, you can't do anything by MMS either.  No MMS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was surprised, though.  Some of my viewers said the fact that you can't do MMS was a deal breaker for them.  Outside of everything else, that was the deal breaker.  I found that surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I feel that way, too.  Now, again, these things could be fixed either by third-party applications or by a firmware update.  And I think not at all unlikely that Apple will respond to some of these.  But it's just something we should point out.  And I think the most important thing is to point out to prospective customers,  everybody's got different issues. Everybody's got different deal breakers.  If MMS is important to you, you need to know that it doesn't do MMS.  For some people, that's big deal. I don't care about that.  So it's just I think that's why it's important to read the reviews at WirelessInfo.com and Gadget.  And frankly, I look forward to seeing.  PC World has a pretty good effect.  They've done a very good job in 24 hours on their iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And for the record, CNET also has a full review up with video as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they do. Very good.  And PC Mag and I think that's where I that's what I didn't like about the big four getting the iPhone two weeks early.  That's not enough people to really get a good sense of it.  And I want to see what the real professional reviewers do, not what Stephen Levy and Walt Mossberg do,  because with all due respect, those guys are great.  But but that's not their bread and butter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And which could possibly be why they got the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, interesting.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm staying out of this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wise man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's a British expression.  Do you mind to think that I couldn't possibly comment?  I couldn't possibly say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the good news is nobody listens to this podcast, so you're safe.  Although I do I do want to note that David Pogue did have twit on his iPhone in his video.  And I'm not going to say he was listening to it.  In fact, the album art was really, really old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I noticed that. I noticed that it was the twit was on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I said, David, you can get a newer copy.  We actually do them every week now.  All right. Let's talk.  Let's wrap this thing up really with the grand philosophy.  What what does the iPhone mean in the scheme of things?  Does this change everything in the way that the iPod changed an industry?  Or is it not such a big deal?  Let's start with you, Ryan.  How important is this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the iPod came in at a time when nobody was using digital audio player.  There was no market there.  And the iPod kind of defined that market and opened it up and made it mainstream.  And now there's a huge digital audio player market and everybody else can play in that market.  You know, Microsoft and Zune and I River and all these other guys have their units out there  because in part, Apple really opened that up.  Now, Apple is late to the game this time.  The iPhone is coming into a market that's already been really well established.  Billions of phones have shipped.  So they really have to make a mark.  They're not going to do something new for phones in making the mainstream or whatever.  I mean, everybody already has a phone.  What they're doing and I mentioned this earlier, is they're kind of changing the paradigm  for usability in portable computing devices, changing the paradigm for usability in cell phones.  That's what this is really all about.  It's about making cell phones both powerful and easy and not those two things,  having those two things being mutually exclusive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Callie Lewis, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's important in a big way.  I mean, this is technology consumers have never been able to get their hands on.  Of course, it's big and it's important.  We've got Microsoft Surface with multitouch.  Oh, come on! It's just a big-ass cable. Please!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now that I've actually played with the iPhone, it's so clear what a me too job that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'll be interested to see what comes out of all this.  And Will App will be willing to license their proprietary stuff.  And so you're right.  I think they've patented the hell out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they own this. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they don't own multitouch.  I mean, we should be clear about that.  They do not own multitouch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who owns multitouch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is no ownership of multitouch.  It's been something that's been in universities and in academia, in computer science for decades.  It's not a new concept. It's been around for a really long time.  This is just one of the first instances that's ever actually been commercialized for consumer use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Hahn, really, if anybody owns it, but I don't think he's patented it.  So it is that Jeff Hahn's pinch thing, though, the thing that we saw at TED.  And it's clearly that. And it's on the surface.  So that's interesting. So they didn't.  I'm sure they patented everything they could, but they couldn't patent that.  That's interesting. Veronica, what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think if it goes over as well as I think it's going to go,  a lot of different cell phone manufacturers are going to be coming out with devices that,  you know, do implement the touch screen more frequently.  I mean, we've already seen the LG Prada and we've seen the HTC Touch  and a lot of different phones that have much bigger screens and interfaces that act a lot like the iPhone,  even if they've come out before the iPhone did.  So I think it's really going to bring a new era in user interface and usability to the cell phone market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And finally, let's go to Richard Bagley from WirelessInfo.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, thank you for the plug.  I mean, I really agree with Veronica that this in terms of the device itself,  the hardware isn't revolutionary.  It's the approach to how you do things and how you perform the tasks that everybody does with a cell phone,  which is the interesting thing.  And I very much hope that this will make the other guys think, hey,  it's not just a question of stuffing 15000 features into a cell phone.  It's a question of looking at how you use that thing and how people really want to get the stuff done that they want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting. And nobody said it, but I'll say it.  This is clearly the best iPod ever made.  Yeah.  And if you took the phone out and just ignored it, it's probably still worth the price for an amazing iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just wish I don't know if I would say that.  No, you don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I got to say, even though the iPod did kind of change the game for portable audio,  I've never really been a big iPod fan.  Oh, interesting.  And even though it does work really well, I mean, music integration is great.  And having integrated calls and music fades out and fades back in and you have that little  cover flow and the.  Yeah, I mean, all that stuff works really great.  I will definitely test that.  But I mean, that whole end of the spectrum of the device, that is not what makes this thing for me.  Interesting.  And it's really the gestalt of all of these components put together and not just, you know,  the fact that it's a great iPod.  And I know that you really wanted to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do agree that it is a fantastic iPod.  And I think we'll probably be seeing an iPod that is just a standalone iPod that works this way,  you know, probably by the holidays.  And that's going to kill me because, you know, it's going to be an 80 gigabyte version of this,  probably for the same amount that I paid for the iPhone.  But Ryan's right.  It is the mashup of the phone with the player and everything else involved that makes it a great device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just I think, you know, maybe it's because I said nobody listens to music on their phone.  The music isn't important.  Forget that.  Before this came out.  And now here I am thinking I love this iPod.  I mean, I was listening to it all the way in.  And it's the phone.  The phone is fine, but it's a great iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't have any headphones that work with it yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Without activating it, can you use it as an iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think you have to activate it before you can use the features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can't do anything without the device.  You can't do anything without the device without activating it.  You can do absolutely nothing except make emergency calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I would also point out that you cannot attach it to any other copy of iTunes.  Once you choose the iTunes, the machine you're activating on,  I wasn't able to get any other iTunes to even recognize it.  And that's kind of a bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you might have to do a software reset, but that's kind of the same thing that happens with your iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I could plug the iPod into another one and said, oh, this guy's attached to another machine.  You want me to erase everything?  This didn't even see it.  It doesn't even show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's a way you can do that.  I think if you do a full reset, I think you can still do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Start over like it's a brand new phone.  Do I have to activate it again?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the point I'm making is if you did do that, if it did have the same unexpected behavior as an iPod had,  you basically have to erase it in order to start using it on another machine and syncing with that content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's fine.  I just want to make sure that I could at least do that much.  But it didn't seem like I could.  So that's good to know.  I'll have to try reset.  How do you reset this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's in the options.  You can actually drill down into the option there.  So I got a full phone reset, sort of factory default mode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that doesn't sound good.  I'm not sure I really want to do that.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not trying it either.  We haven't finished our review yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I'll save that for after when I give it to my daughter.  That's when she'll she can she can do that.  Well, I want to thank you all for joining us.  Remind you, of course, that this podcast, as all our Tweet podcasts,  was brought to you by audible dot com, a chance for you to get an absolutely free book  just by going to audible dot com slash Tweet, a free audio book.  You can try it out, give you an idea of what it's like to listen to audible books  on your new iPhone, if you should so choose.  We traditionally recommend a book.  I didn't prepare you guys, so I won't spring it on you.  But I think I have an appropriate book for people who are iPhone users.  You might want to read I was Steve Wozniak's autobiography,  How I Invented the Personal Computer and Had Fun Along the Way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually have that as an audible book.  Do you?  Yes, I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there you go.  And you're listening to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I listened to it several months ago, probably six months ago.  And what do you think?  It was a good book. It was cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've heard all his stories, so I kind of know what's in the book.  And Gina Smith's a good friend.  So I haven't I haven't actually downloaded it yet, but I think I'll get it.  But certainly Woz is the guy.  And to see somebody like Woz show up at Valley Fair Mall  and sit on a bench and wait for his iPhone.  He's a good person.  He's just a good man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have it in my library. I can't wait to listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. All right.  Well, there's our free book.  And I got three recommendations now that is audible dot com slash twit.  We thank so much.  We thank audible so much for their support of the network.  We really appreciate audible dot com slash twit for your free audio book.  Well, I can't thank you all enough.  Really did have the royalty of gadgetry on with us today.  And it's been really great.  I hope you all come back.  Ryan Block is the editor in chief of Engadget,  Engadget dot com or something like that.  Did I spell it right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's about right.  If you type it into Google, you'll get an auto correct for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I was in the ballpark anyway.  I absolutely read it religiously every day.  And it's just fantastic.  And I'm so glad we could get you on the show, Ryan.  Thanks for joining us.  Callie Lewis is with Geekbrief.tv.  Just a wonderful video podcast about gadgetry four times a week.  And make sure you watch 192, where she rails about her data plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or you can just move on.  Rails about her.  Now that I have an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you going to now do one about the iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think maybe.  I think I kind of have to.  And I hear we've got you coming up to Vancouver to do the TV show.  Yeah. Good. Yeah, in August.  I will save a twit hoodie for you.  We've got our new fleece hoodies and they're beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm bringing Drobo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you? Good.  You better you than me.  I'm not bringing Drobo across the border.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I may have it sent out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this so? Well, it's a data robot.  Uh huh.  Also, Veronica Belmont from Buzz Out Loud, my favorite tech news podcast.  She just slumming here with us on Twitter and CNET TV.com.

One of these days, you know, usually takes me, I don't know,  Veronica will tell you, it takes me about seven or eight episodes.  Then I get your name right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've heard all variations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
