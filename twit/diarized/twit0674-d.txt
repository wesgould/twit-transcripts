End time: 993.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People in the world one billion. I wonder if the challenge for some people is to be able to hold to seemingly conflicting ideas where  Poverty has gone down, but we still have to address it as a problem. It hasn't been solved yet  So we can be like hooray  There's less extreme global poverty while also saying there are still an unconscionable number of people in the world who are suffering needlessly

Start time: 993.44
End time: 1012.98

Start time: 1059.62
End time: 1072.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 1072.64
End time: 1096.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, one of the things I that we're probably going to have to address in a systemic way either in education or otherwise is  teaching people  How to discern narratives how to how to learn how to trust sources or ask?  Why are they telling me this story?  What benefit is to them is there for telling me this story, you know audiences are going to have to the motive  critical thinking and they didn't used to have to because there were not that many outlets and

Start time: 1098.06
End time: 1122.04

Transcript:  How do you I'd like to see this score the scorecard they kept  Just pointing out that whatever you want to  I just talked about  You know I talked about interrogating the narrative  I think another thing that we're gonna have to start talking about especially with tech and AI is interrogating the data and  Finding out how is it collected who decided how to sort it who decided what was worth collecting and what was not?  Why did they decide that what is the point and for things like this is this particularly as you move from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't call my office suite intelligent in any respect at the moment you see we're talking about single-use intelligence  The crossover comes whether you go into generally  Build a general AI system which can learn to do a lot of things

Start time: 1434.18
End time: 1470.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This has been my contention is that what we call single-use intelligence is indistinguishable from algorithmic  Solutions it's programming  Which is not artificial intelligence its algorithms. We used to just call code  It's become the fashion to say everything is AI  See machine learning informing some processes  That's for sure. I don't know if you'd call that intelligence  That's just that you can that a machine can in a way create its own code from a data set, right?  So that's a step, but I I wonder I think there's a quite a big leap between that in general

Start time: 1471.68
End time: 1508.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a lot of so I cover this a lot because of in you know covering business technology and talk to a lot of people that  Are working on AI and their frustration is not that it's too smart, right?  It's that it's so dumb and they cannot get it to do the things that they wanted to do that doesn't mean that we  Shouldn't take the leap of like it will get better. You write that the data will get better  one of the biggest problems is  if you want to have AI you have to have a really great set of  disciplines and  Organization around your data because that's what and and most of the world doesn't have that well

Start time: 1508.56
End time: 1519.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To that point I often think that we have  Fetishized the notion of AI to the point where we're starting to trust  So called AI to do things that they can't do face recognition. There's a story

End time: 1558.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

They can talk to me. It is the greatest also has a motion sensor  So they don't even have to ring the doorbell if they just come up onto my porch  I know they're there and I've got video to show ring has now a neighborhood feature where you can share if you wish  with other ring doorbell owners in your  Neighborhood just kind of a neighborhood watch a digital neighborhood watch it really works  They tried it in a Southern California town. They cut crime by almost 50% and and that's the point  No, you know as soon as people see that ring doorbell they go  I'm going to somebody else's house ring is of course expanded their line. We now have the ring floodlight cam  This is actually a really I put these around the house, too  These are LED you've seen floodlights motion activated floodlights around house. It's very common. These are better because they're brighter  There are LED you never have to place a bulb and they have the ring camera  Attached high def video of what's going on plus of course the same speaker and microphone setup so you could say hey  What are you doing? What are you doing there?  There's even a 110 decibel alarm that you can trigger if it's not enough to just say hey  What are you doing there sometimes raccoons just to give you an idea.

Transcript:  This is what I was about to say though is here's one of the minefields that we ran into at a former employer of mine  I was on the social media task force and they wanted to mandate that every writer in the organization  get a social media feed and  Dedicate it solely to promoting the organization's work and about half of the writers already had their own personal Twitter feeds and the question  I brought up was so what do we do?  Do we just start separate accounts for promoting our work?  They said no, no, you've already got followers  Of course, we're just going to require you to start promoting your stories on your personal feed stuff  It's so far which is pretty much what I said was why are you expecting someone else who's done all the work to build an audience?  Why are you expecting that that that is suddenly your asset?  Yeah, and I think part of the thing that we're still working out now in terms of social media as corporate asset is you cannot hire  Somebody who has their own independent following and expect that to become a corporate asset  You can control and the companies who do that are hurting themselves more than they're hurting the people they fire because they're gonna get the reputation  for being the ones that are  That are that are stealing someone's work or reputation and trying to pass it off as their own

Start time: 6219.40
End time: 6252.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so I'll play devil's advocate with them for a minute because  knowing some of the people that are working on municipal and are like ready to invest in all of that and they're like  Then they look at what's happening in 5g  Which is moving a lot faster than we expected and it's kind of like by the time we build this thing out  We're gonna be we're gonna get leapfrogged so quickly that it's a it's a tough  It's a tough argument to make to invest there  So so I understand it from that perspective  But but it's one of those things that we've we have to figure out a way

I was the first time for Derby for Derby corn last year, and it's fantastic  Yeah, yeah Derby Derby con very big there. Yeah  Yeah, but it is  To the point you and I were just saying like it's anti-competitive if you want competition  Yeah, and if a metro area like Chattanooga wants to build its own  Fibers been laid there. There's a bunch of dark fiber sitting around then by all means they should be able to do it  I think that the argument is that well if they do it then they can give themselves breaks  And they can you know cut the price and then you know as the major telcos receive no subsidies whatsoever  Right and so it's different kinds of anti-competitive right is what we're kind of arguing

It was going to be what's LTE, but it's also y-max  It's also enhanced 3g and with the first round of 5g things were coming look at it's not true 5g  It's basically just slightly enhanced 4g and they the telcos are using this and well you can get wireless  So why do we need to put put lines in at the end of the day?  It comes down to the National Highways project or something like that when you look at countries like Korea and Finland and  Other countries around the world which basically the government said look this is coming  We'll pay to put some fiber in there  and you can have open competition over that and this is what Google fiber was originally about and  It's just being slowly in in in remorse. It's shut down by the big players because they don't want competition

End time: 6448.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I was schooled in this by Stacey Higginbotham is a 5g  At least the 5g technologies we're talking about right now require lots more sites and lots more back. Yeah  So in fact, they don't go as far they don't go as far  So there is in fact a much bigger demand for you know, land fiber in the ground. So I had a bit

Start time: 6449.00

Transcript:  this is interesting one I've had a  interesting conversation with some wireless engineers about this because I think that they've designed it  This is only a theory I think they've designed it in one sense that it's not just physics involved  But they've also designed it in one sense to have to have more or meshes more sites for one for backup  Also too because you're gonna have so many more devices on those towers, right?  You're not gonna be able to put but that's the number that's exactly the problem

Start time: 6476.78
End time: 6496.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is the telcos designed for dense urban areas? They don't design for rural areas  So that means of course San Francisco's to get a 5g but Lassen National Park is not gonna ever get 5g  So that really is the argument that you've got to allow  Municipalities under certain municipalities to do what to do their own so great if I'm wrong

Start time: 6496.92
End time: 6509.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I wasn't here wait for 5g. It's not coming in the mid 90s  Didn't the major telcos get a massive government tax tax tax right off?  To fiber up the country and I think we're still waiting on that one

Start time: 6509.76
End time: 6521.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a lot of that fiber that got laid and is still not been used there's a lot of dark fiber  So that could work in our favor for 5g, right?  Cuz a lot of that 5g or a lot of fiber was put in the ground and can serving densely populous areas
