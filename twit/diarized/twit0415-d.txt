End time: 643.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

I'm laying in bed and I pull it up on my phone.  Because my phone has access to the camera data.  And I was like, holy s***.  And then Dario was like, what are you talking about?

Start time: 689.06
End time: 716.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Here's the way that I would phrase it to anyone.  I'm not out to hurt animals, obviously.  There's one of two ways I could throw that raccoon.  Up the stairs or down the stairs.  If I throw it up the stairs, it's going like back into my house.  So I had to get rid of it.  I wasn't going to like shoo it away.  And so, you know, it was just a happen to spin.  And look back in the camera in an awkward way.  And it's just like, I'm not like actively trying to like kill raccoons.  You would have done the same thing, Jolie.

Start time: 717.00
End time: 723.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would have done that and worse.  If anybody came after my little puppy poo, I don't care.  I mean, I'd go into mama bear mode.

Start time: 725.04
End time: 734.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Wow.  It is weird how you flip into that mode.  I don't have kids, but I got into that mode where I was like,  this is my like little baby dog.  I thought it was killing it.

Start time: 735.00
End time: 736.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, you did everything but pound your chest afterwards.

Start time: 737.30
End time: 744.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Right.  I think you should edit it now so the raccoon turns into some sort of violent monster at the bottom and comes up the stairs.  And then you get into a movie.

Start time: 745.00
End time: 746.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Has anybody approached you up for options?

Start time: 747.00
End time: 747.71

Start time: 753.06
End time: 760.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're so desperate in Hollywood.  So, Kevin, you say you have video of it in the cloud.  Were you able to go back and see the initial encounter between your dog and the raccoon?

Start time: 761.00
End time: 771.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that was the first.  Because the second it detects motion, it takes like a second or two for it to start recording.  So the first that you see is the first that I saw.  So what we don't know and we'll never know.  Who started the fight.  Yeah.

Start time: 773.24
End time: 774.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_11

End time: 797.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Post it.  It's the first reaction.  And Daria said, yeah, post it.  I didn't think anyone was going to believe me.  When I told Daria, I went back up on my phone and said, yeah, I'm going to tweet that.  And she said, yeah, post it.

Start time: 799.08
End time: 813.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't think anyone was going to believe me.  When I told Daria, I went back up the stairs and I was like, I just tossed a raccoon in the air.  She's like, what?  I'm like, you don't understand.  You're full of crap.  Yeah, it sounds like something.  And then when I have the video footage, it's like, you got to show your friends that stuff.  It's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's not that they can't afford it, but it's kind of...  First of all, maybe you can help us with this, Kevin.  Or any of you. Why would a company  take a...  Just say, okay, you know what?  Why wouldn't they dribble it out over a few quarters?  Why say, hey, we lost a billion,

Start time: 1333.18
End time: 1348.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's over? Probably for the bookkeeping reasons.  Yeah, there's something there that they need to write it down.  It's financial. They have to write it down.  Or they want to write it down. And clearly they're going to continue to lose money  on this, because I see it as the future of PCs.  So they're not going to back down.  No, they're not going to back down. I think they'll abandon RT.  And the sequel is probably coming, I suspect.

Start time: 1349.00
End time: 1352.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe. You think? Yeah, I think they're  going to do another one and try to do it better.

Start time: 1353.04
End time: 1387.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So the story was, I think that because  they're taking the right off because they dropped...  They had to drop the price to $350  on the basic,  the base 32 gig model.  That's $150 less than list.  And probably significantly less than cost.  So they're going to take the loss on it.  But you don't think that  that's an abandonment  of Windows RT, that they're going to stick with RT?  Or, see, I think  RT's over. I think they're going to  say, oh, we should have just stuck with Windows  RT is bad for users because  they get it and they go, what, you can't run Windows

Start time: 1387.87
End time: 1411.00

Transcript:  software with this?  They're doing Windows 8.1 RT.  So they're continuing with it.  They're not stopping with it.  When they were here in Houston a week  ago for the Partners  Conference, they were  giving away, or not giving away, but they were  giving steep discounts on both the Pro  and the RT. And there were  lines of the attendees that were  90 minutes long to get either of

Transcript:  them. It reminds me of the Blackberry Playbook.  Remember when they dropped the price to 99 bucks  in the Playbook? It sold out.  And people said, oh, Blackberry, you should make more of these.  Yeah.  So you can lose lots of money.  No. So yeah, of course,  people will line up for a $99 tablet.

Transcript:  It's cheap. Right.  And that's probably, you know, for Surface  RT as a fire sale, that's  probably about right for  what it's capable of. That's what it's worth.

Transcript:  One of our chatters works at  Microsoft. He says, no, Leo, RT's not  the same thing that we are all in on RT.  I think it's confusing. You've got  three operating systems now. You've got Windows Phone 8,  you've got Windows RT, and you've got  Windows 8N on the Surface, if you'll  pardon the expression. They all look the same.  If you put them all together,  they all have the same Metro Start  screen. And I think  that's confusing for users because they think that  that means it's the same OS, and it's not.

And you can run Microsoft Office  on a phone, and you can run OneNote on a phone.  And I think the  average user is like, ooh, pretty.  You know? I mean, eventually  they'll be woo pretty.

Transcript:  Yes, yes. I think you still need the desktop.  And one of the reasons I think  they're sticking with Windows RT  is because it primarily  works on the Metro side.  And as Microsoft  goes on with this design,  you can bet that the desktop is going to be  deprecated and you'll see less and less of it.  Windows RT on ARM, they  probably think of it as their future.

And obvious, either he knew better  and was just, they  didn't have the App Store ready, or  he turned around because a year later the  App Store comes out and is a huge  hit. And HTML5 apps did not take off.  Is HTML5,  you're a good guy to ask, Kevin. You do  mobile development. Is HTML5 good enough  now? No, I mean the problem

And you don't need a postage meter, by the way.  You'll save like 100%.  It's 100 times less expensive.  That's like a thousand percent.  It's a deal.  That's a 10,000 percent.  Wow.  If I say that, it sounds like you're making that up.  It sounds like bull crap.  You know why? Postage meter is  not effective anymore.  The ink is so expensive.  With stamps.com you get the USB  scale. You plug that in the computer. You plop the  package on there. You always have exactly the right  postage. It even should suggest what  class of mail is appropriate for that particular  package. I want you to try stamps.com.  We've got a no-risk trial offer. Visit the  website. Click the microphone in the upper right  hand corner. See that kind of fancy  old fashioned mic?  Enter the offer code TWIT.  And that $80 bonus value  turns into a $110 offer.  That's $55 in free postage.  You get the scale. You just pay shipping  and handling. It's about five bucks. You get a $5  supply kit to make up for that. And of course a month  free of stamps.com.  Stamps.com, if you do mailing, you need  stamps.com. Please use  our offer code TWIT.  I don't know  where we found this or why we have it.  But I believe it's a  raccoon puppet.  And frankly, I missed a bet.  I should have interviewed you.

The Daily Mail has  had a campaign to  get the British government  to insist that porn be blocked  in every home in the UK.  I've been hearing about this.

Apple's dev site has been down  since Thursday. And this is kind of  interesting too. They say when  you go to developer.apple.com  and click,  this is the site for paid developers,  they say  we'll be back soon. We apologize that  maintenance is taking longer than expected.  Since Thursday  during an iOS  beta.  It looks like it's hacked. People are starting to think  that it's been hacked.  A number of developers have tweeted  that they keep getting password reset emails  from Apple. But that doesn't  mean an attack. That means somebody's trying to get their  password. I don't know if it's related.  But it is a long time.  Four days. Five days.  Leo, it is back. It's back up and running.  It is back up and running? Yep.  Yep.  Well, I, you know...

But it has been reported that Apple's  considering buying them. PrimeSense  is the 3D body sensor firm that  designed and sold and licensed  Microsoft Kinect body  sensor technology.

However, we've not been able to rule out the possibility  that some developer's name's mailing has blah, blah, blah,  has been accessed. This was this a mailing  from Apple that they sent out?

In order to prevent a security threat like this  from happening again, we're completely overhauling  our developer systems.  Updating our server software.  And rebuilding the entire database.  We've been working around  the clock. Sounds like a cover-up story to me.  Apple says we plan to have the site  up again soon. Not August 9th.  But that... This makes sense.

And they really gotta look at this more closely.  That's something you don't want to  have happen. What you really don't...  Marco Armit pointed this out.  What you really hope is that the dev certificates  didn't leak out.  The master root certificate. Because if  it did, then you could create dev certificates.  A bad guy could create  certificates that would say, this is legitimate  Apple software. Apple has moved  to that certificate authentication system  both on iOS and on the desktop.  You cannot install  an iOS app without a  certificate from Apple. And on the desktop,  it'll warn you. And you have to manually  override that. If those dev  certificates got out... Right.

Apple's never made that possible for developers.  You have to just create a new version.  And a number of applications have done that.  And now Apple's done that too. They've  released Logic Pro X.  A new version of  Logic music making software.  And there's no upgrade path.  If you bought Logic before that, doesn't matter.  Admittedly, it's a very  affordable $199 for a very  complete music package. But still,  I think Apple would want to have  an upgrade path  for people who develop  the Mac app store.  Really impressed.  32 gigs worth of loops.  A whole bunch of stuff for $199.  I immediately downloaded it and  made a hit single.  Play it.  Play it.

Transcript:  So I don't know how  to anonymize this in the right way. This has nothing to do  with Google in the first place. This is  a friend of a friend that I talked to  that has used Prism  before. And they said  it is like a very helpful  tool. And one of the things that was really  interesting is that they said that  when they use  Prism,  they have to fill out tons and tons of  paperwork to use it in the first place.  And when they use it, the  court might not reject it.  But what they will say is  they'll ask for more information. They'll say, okay  we're not going to reject this. You know what's the name  of that court? The FISA court. Right.  So they won't outright  reject it but they'll say you have to give us more detail  on these ten different points. So  there's a ton of hurdles built in  to use it in the first place. I think the person you really have  to worry about is the  system administrator that has access  to Prism that is sitting there. They  can just type in anything they want.  What are the controls like at that level?  Not when an agency  is coming in to use it through the proper channels.  More about the people  that are actually writing the code that have the low  level access to that software.

The example that was given to  me is you find a terrorist phone  that you capture  somehow and you want to see who in the United  States they've been talking to. That was the prime example.  Which at that makes  sense to me. I think you would want to know that.  So you have this phone

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and you have these numbers and you say, well let's see what other  traffic has been around these numbers.  Who do they talk to? Who else do these people talk to?  One of the things that was revealed in  a congressional testimony this week was  it could be friends of friends.  It could be friends of friends of friends.  It could be 3 degrees of separation.  Which means that net could be cast

Transcript:  It was a former member of the FISA  court who was complaining. In fact  I believe he quit the FISA court because there wasn't  enough push back and that the government  was being taken at its face value too often.  At least the good thing about this  is that it has everyday people talking about  some of the issues that we've been talking about for years.  And that's a good benefit

And they went over those so-called  50 incidents, 10 in the USA.  And the guy says they're  bogus. Almost all of them had to do  with moving money into  terrorist organizations.

Start time: 3595.02
End time: 3608.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  theory. Toxoplasmosis is a  parasite. Right. It lives in cats  but part of the cycle is it has to get in humans.  Right. And so it comes out in the cat  poop. Humans touch cat poop. They get it  inside themselves. It breathes.  And then they fall in love with cats. Humans.

Start time: 3609.22

Start time: 3611.08
End time: 3622.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  have it coming. Here's the key in this  parasite's life cycle. It has to get the cat then  to ingest the human. Otherwise  the life cycle is cut off.  So the theory behind this.  Wait, wait, wait, wait, I missed something there. The cat

Start time: 3623.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Am I wrong? No. You're dead

Start time: 3637.06
End time: 3672.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  on. All parasites have a life  cycle and often humans are part of that life cycle.  They lay eggs in your brain.  It's pretty horrible. Yeah, next thing you know you're on the show. Right.  Exactly. Next thing you know you're on Twitter.  So  the toxoplasmosis life cycle  is cat-human. Actually it's cat-animal.  But the key is that in order  to continue the life cycle the cat has to be able  to re-consume the eggs  or whatever it is. The humans outlive the cat.  So the thesis is that toxoplasmosis  somehow modifies the neurology  of the host to make it love cats,  to make it hang out with cats, so that  the cats can eat it.  Now this would work with big cats, not so much with

Transcript:  You did actually.  SIM cards have been hacked. The flaw could affect  not every phone but about one in eight.  Which would be a lot of phones.  Millions of phones.  We don't know what the hack is because German  cryptographer Carsten Knoll will reveal it  at Black Hat.  Which is July 31st.  He says it's the first hack of its kind in decades.  He and his team tested close to 1,000  SIM cards for vulnerabilities  exploited by, get this,  sending a hidden  SMS.  So the two-part flaw  which is based on an old security standard  of badly configured code could allow hackers  to infect your SIM with a virus  via text message.  And then do things like  drain your mobile phone bill  by sending premium text messages or  surreptitiously redirect and  record calls.  Carry out payment system fraud. It's a fairly  serious bug. We don't know what the details are  because you don't find out until he  reveals it.  The real issue is not so much a problem  here I think in the US but in areas where  like Africa where SIM cards are  the way people pay  stuff. They do phone  payments, SIM card based payments are  how...

Start time: 4107.06
End time: 4140.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  would guess it's a they say because  of the intersection of software and a flaw  in the SIM it sounds like you could fix it in  software. You know there was a lot of attention  given to the flaw in Android  that allowed most like 99  percent of Android phones  to be hacked.  But Google patched that almost immediately.  The Play Store is scanning  for the flaw and many Android  phones like my Samsung Galaxy S4 already  have the fix built into it.  You know it was a patch that was downloaded a couple of months  ago. Is that your new phone?  It's just the cover makes it look like a new phone. May I see?  Yes. Let me just unlock it for you.

You can use Chrome on Android but Android is an operating system.  Chrome is a browser.  Chrome OS isn't an OS.  It's a damn browser.  It's an OS. It's just a very limited OS.  It's not an OS.

Start time: 4713.00
End time: 4729.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  There's something going on  about these maps.  They were much better 6 to 9 months ago.  Do you think they lost the license to whatever it is?  There's something, but they won't talk about it.  I've tried to talk to the public relations department  press at Google,  and they refused to even answer a question about this.

Start time: 4737.00
End time: 4776.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, they should talk to you.  I like Google Maps, and one of the things Google's done  is they are aggregating public transit information  from city governments.  It's interesting because some city governments  have locked it down, saying you can't have it.  We want to have our own app,  which I think is not what city governments should be doing with that data.  But apparently, Apple, which has lost its transit instructions  and Apple Maps doesn't have it,  when they got rid of Google Maps,  have acquired HopStop.  They offer walking, taxi, and bicycle directions,  as well as mass transit directions.  So that's something that will be, I guess, back in Maps  as soon as this acquisition happens.  I didn't have it on my Windows Phone.  Now, Bing, you have Bing Maps?

Waze is another one out there.  I love Waze.  Waze is great.  It's a great reason.  It's essentially a distraction  for a driver to play with Waze.  If you have a navigator, yeah, it's the best,  because they can be punching stuff in.  I agree with you. It's risky, but all maps apps are distracting.  Yeah, but this is really distracting,  because they've got little bubbles,  and you're supposed to respond, oh, there's a cop there, let me write it in.  You pull it to the side of the road,  or maybe you pull off into the wrong lane, you get killed.  I'm telling you, this is the most dangerous product out there.  It won't let you in if you're the driver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I do like the Waze.  The one thing I like about Waze is the gas station app,  which is within the product.  You click on the little bubble,  and it shows you all the nearby gas stations,  which saved me on some recent trip, by the way.  But you find all the nearby gas stations,  you can get instructions to them, but it shows you the best prices  within about five miles of where you are.  And it's updated constantly.

Transcript:  There's also a great app called The Road Ahead,  which I think, it's on iOS,  I don't know if it's on Android,  that does the same thing.  It shows you at each exit up ahead of you  what is there,  and you can use it to find restaurants  and gas stations that has their prices.  It jumps off to GasBuddy for the prices.  But it's a great app for a long road trip.

Transcript:  I'm, I'm, I'm sincere when I say I think  wearable computing  absolutely is the next big thing.  It's a challenge, though.  Because glasses aren't quite right,  because they're very visible and they're nerdy,  and not everybody wants to wear glasses.  A wristwatch isn't quite right, either.  I mean, really, a smartphone is, is, is,  is not so bad.  I mean, there's, that is, that is a good display now.

Start time: 5259.04
End time: 5273.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a 1080p display.  Well, that's if you need a computer.  Wearable computing could be a lot of things.  It could be a sensor. Well, exactly.  It could accomplish one task instead of 50.  Like, I think if you want a computer,  you certainly don't want one on your wrist or in front of your face.

Start time: 5273.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sensors.  I think it's all of that, right?  So I think maybe there is a computer in your pocket.  That's how Google Glass works. It's tied to the glass.  The glass isn't a computer by itself.  A watch probably wouldn't be either.

Google has spent the last three or four years  kind of putting pieces together,  and people would look at what they were doing  and say, what is that for?  Then they had Google+,  and Google is trying to pull it all together,  and that's what she's doing.  She's pulling the pieces together,  and at some point, there's going to be some spark,  and everything will kind of come together  like the Terminator, you know, with the...  I think that's the right analogy.  That's what's going to happen.  That happened at Google,  and that's where she learned how to run a company.  That's what's going to happen, is that at some point,  everything will come together.

A cross between a railgun,  the Concorde, and the  air hockey table. It would  deliver people 360 miles,  LA to San Francisco in 30  minutes.  That would be awesome.

Transcript:  I got here in three hours.  We could take an eight-hour bus ride.  No, it's bad. AT&T,  T-Mobile, and  Verizon all now have  very uneconomical  upgrade plans.  T-Mobile started it with their jump plan.  Every six months, a new phone.  AT&T said, well, if you're going to do jump, we're going to do  next. Verizon says,  if you're going to do next, we're going to do edge.  So far, nothing from Sprint.  All of these allow you to get  a new phone every six months.  I mean, there are people, not  normal people, but  the kind of people who listen to this show or are sitting in our audience  who want a new phone every six months.  But what are you paying for this?  A lot.

Start time: 6357.18
End time: 6394.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's six months for  Verizon and  T-Mobile and a year for AT&T.  And the problem is, is that  T-Mobile, when they did this, they  reduced their prices  when they changed their business model  because they dropped  contracts and subsidies.  But neither Verizon nor AT&T  have changed their  prices. So, even though  you get this phone and you get it separately, you're  paying for it separately, the prices  you pay for the service plan still  have the subsidies built in. So, it's  like paying twice for the same  phone on those two  carriers. It's not a good deal at all.

I'll tell you why it's a story, because  Netflix, which was originally  the idea of DVDs by  mail, which now seems kind  of antiquated, is completely  pivoting into a content creation company.

There's one other one  I'm looking at right now that's currently in this  Y Combinator class coming out  in a few months. So you think cryptocurrency is  here to stay? I don't know if Bitcoin  is going to be the winner, but I would imagine that  10 years from now, if we open our eyes, will there be  a decentralized digital currency? I would say  yes.

Transcript:  That's kind of intriguing, because  when you look at, for instance, credit card  companies saying, you know, we're not going to enable  payments for VPN services anymore,  because we feel that they are  being used for piracy.  Of course, VPN services are used for a lot of  legitimate, completely legitimate things.

Start time: 6981.00
End time: 6995.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Anyway, that's going to keep things like  Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies alive,  because if you want to use a VPN and you can't use  a credit card, suddenly  Bitcoin seems very desirable.  It also preserves your anonymity, so you can really  steal stuff privately.
