Transcript:  Fe, New Mexico, Mr. Ed Bott  of ZDNF fame. Hi, Ed.  Hi, Christina.  Did you come up for the  Microsoft briefing this week?  I did.  The one hour briefing?  Flew up one afternoon and flew  back the next afternoon.

Transcript:  of us thought it was going to  be.  Tell me about that.  What did you expect and what was  it that you didn't expect?  I think I expected Windows 8

Start time: 187.80
End time: 216.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there's clearly more to it  than that.  I think it was a big story.  I think it was a big story.  I think it was a big story.  The choice of the name Windows  10 was startling to say the  least.  And they clearly have some  ideas more than just  transplanting a start menu onto  Windows 8.  There's some interesting stuff  happening there.

Start time: 216.76
End time: 237.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, because I mean, I think a  lot of us before the event  thought that Windows threshold  which is the code name at the  time would be to Windows 8 what  Windows 7 was to Vista, a  polishing of the edges, fixing  of some of the cosmetic stuff.  Is there stuff under the hood  that's significantly different?

End time: 243.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we haven't seen it yet, if  it is.  Well, you're using it right now,  aren't you?

Start time: 243.80
End time: 244.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, but this is a technical

Start time: 246.90
End time: 301.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  preview.  And in historical terms, this  one is made up of a lot of  things.  This one is missing.  This reminds me a lot of  Windows 8 when it first appeared  and didn't have, you know, there  were several key features that  appeared in it later that  didn't exist in Windows 8,  including I think some key  aspects of the start screen and  Metro apps and so forth weren't  there.  So I think we're going to see  another build of this probably  in January that will have a lot  of new features in it, including  some of the stuff that...  What was bizarre to me about  this week's event was they  positioned it as an enterprise  preview.  Right.  And yet most of the discussion  is about the things that are  fairly superficial on the  desktop, and the new features  that are going to be in the  Enterprise Edition aren't going  to appear until later.

Start time: 303.02
End time: 311.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we're only seeing the  beginnings of this.  One thing that surprised me was  the...  They said that the release of  the beta is a year out.

Start time: 312.51
End time: 345.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not a year.  Mid...  Middle of next year.  Middle of next year.  OK.  Yeah, so that's probably nine  months, which means three months  from now for a consumer ready  beta, three months after that  for a release candidate, three  months after that for a release  to manufacturing or release to  the web, whatever they want to  call it these days.  So I think you're probably six  months away from having a  feature complete product and  nine months away from having a  commercially finished product.  So this is really pretty early

Start time: 346.02
End time: 347.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in the cycle for...  Still, yeah.

Start time: 348.10
End time: 352.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's early in a compressed and  fast moving cycle also.

Start time: 353.35
End time: 359.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the other thing.  Yeah, there seems to be some  hustle to get a replacement for  Windows 8 out as quickly as  possible.

Start time: 361.16
End time: 361.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, next year will be three

Start time: 362.04
End time: 364.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  years.  Which is right.  That's the normal time frame.

Start time: 365.10
End time: 371.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the normal time frame.  So it's not really a hustle.  They've just been...  It just feels like a hustle.

Start time: 371.00
End time: 373.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels like we just got  Windows 8.  Well, it'll be three years,

Start time: 375.00
End time: 426.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  except it'll be six years from  Windows 7.  And they're still trying to...  They had good enterprise  upgrade uptick on that, but they  didn't really have that on  Windows 8, which they said a  number of times during the  event.  So I think that's, to me, the  big takeaway was that it's an  enterprise focus, right?  But it's enterprise focus in the  sense that they want to talk to  the stakeholders and the people  making purchasing decisions now  before they set their budgets  for next year so that they can  go ahead and budget to upgrade  to Windows 10 and not lose  another upgrade cycle for these  businesses to...  Or even worse, lose them going  to Chromebooks or God forbid,  Macs or virtual machines or  something like that.  They want to keep them in the  Windows ecosystem.  And it's important for them to  talk to them as early as  possible because Windows 8 was  so fast, so fast, so fast.  Because Windows 8 was such a  huge failure on the enterprise  front.

Start time: 427.08
End time: 460.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and that's the first  thing that leaps to mind for me  is, are desktop operating  systems important going  forward?  They seem like they're less and  less important, and who knows  by next year how important  they'll be?  Ed, do you feel like...  Clearly, Microsoft made its  bones with Windows and to a  lesser degree, Office, but it  also seems like the future is  operating system independent.  It's cloud.  And it seems like Nadella is  very aware of that.  He's very cross-platform.  How important is Windows 10 to  Microsoft going forward, I  guess is the question.

Start time: 463.17
End time: 505.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's a key part of  their DNA.  Still their flagship.  They can't afford to screw it  up.  And they have basically good  architectural underpinnings for  it in Windows 8.  They just have a bunch of  deployment blockers that they  need to remove there.  The desktop PC market space  isn't getting smaller.  It's the number of screens that  we have on which we can  interact with our world is  getting so much bigger that as  a proportion, desktop PCs are  less important because there's  so many other ways that we  interact with things.  That's a great point.  There aren't fewer PCs out  there.  We just have many other ways

Start time: 505.18
End time: 511.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of interacting with things.  And I think that's a very  important point.  We don't have many PCs out  there.  We just have many other ways

Start time: 511.57
End time: 532.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of computing.  Right.  And so that's with things like  Office 365, for example, which  will be released on Android I  think this year.  It already exists on iOS  devices.  It exists on Windows devices.  And so you can, with a phone,  a phablet, a tablet, or a PC,  you can do work.

Start time: 534.30
End time: 537.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And you'll be working likely on  the same document in the cloud  on each platform.

Start time: 540.00
End time: 585.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  And it might be in a private  cloud on an Office 365  enterprise server that's  managed by an enterprise, or it  might be in a publicly available  free cloud like OneDrive, which  is more of a consumer service.  But in either case, you're going  to be interacting with that on  whatever screen you want running  whatever OS you want.  I think Microsoft has pretty much  realized that it needs to make  sure that that experience is  good, solid, capable, productive  regardless of what the operating  system is and what the screen  size is.  And I would guess that security

Start time: 586.71
End time: 600.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is another...  You already mentioned the  blockers from the point of view  of the enterprise, which are  mostly user interface issues,  right?  Things like the start menu.  Right.  And most of the coverage is,  okay, they've got a start menu  with tiles.

Start time: 603.38
End time: 605.30
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So it's a little bit of both,  but it's still a start menu.

Start time: 605.88
End time: 615.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've got a menued Metro apps  now no longer full screen.  Or windowed, I shouldn't say,  not menued.  They're no longer...  Windowed?  Yeah.  They can be full screen.

Start time: 615.40
End time: 619.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's the option for full  screen.  That's just how it should be.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 620.36
End time: 626.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sometimes it's a little bit  of a challenge.  Sometimes it's appropriate for  full screen, especially in a  tablet environment.  Sometimes not.

Start time: 626.38
End time: 643.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Give me the choice.  So to sort of close the loop on  a question, a really good  question that you asked just a  couple of minutes ago, I think  the real challenge for  Microsoft next year is going to  be to establish that it can  deliver mobile devices that  will be...

Start time: 643.73
End time: 659.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  What the hell was that?  I'm sorry.  If you're watching at home,  Chad just decided that we  would...  Did we get it?  Goal!  Oh, we got three points.  That's good.  Thank you very much.  Okay.  That was an error.  I just thought I had said  something really smart.

Start time: 659.44
End time: 659.58
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Goal!

Start time: 660.46
End time: 675.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's only for you watching  home.  For the audio listeners,  nothing to see here.  Sorry about that.  But it is an issue as desktop  operating systems are not...  Clearly it's important to  Microsoft.  They can't abandon Windows.  But they also have to  acknowledge the fact that the  world has changed quite a bit  since 1995.

Start time: 679.21
End time: 692.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So you have tablets and you  have these two-in-one devices,  which Intel and Microsoft and  a lot of the OEMs, Lenovo in  particular have been very  successful with getting these  two-in-one devices.

Start time: 692.20
End time: 694.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have they been successful?  The convertibles, they've been  successful?

Start time: 695.12
End time: 709.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have been.  I think the latest numbers that  I saw said in the retail  channel, something like...  I should probably look it up.  But I think it was about one  in four PCs sold in 2014 are  going to be convertibles.  Interesting.

Start time: 709.96
End time: 721.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that really reflects just  people are confused and they  don't want to...  I don't know.  Do I want a tablet?  Do I want to...  Let me get one that does  everything.  Or is there really...  That's what I want.

Start time: 723.25
End time: 783.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's an awful lot of choices  out there and a lot of people  make their choices on the basis  of whatever random factor,  including price, including  availability.  Including what ad they saw last.  What ad they saw on the Sunday  paper.  They still read Sunday papers.  But I think there really is a  genuine business case there for  people who are using a computing  device for work and for personal...  That dual use kind of thing.  It's a hybrid.  Yeah.  So you can take that thing and  you pull the keyboard off of it  and you're sitting on the couch  and interacting with Twitter as  an 18 inning baseball game is  going on.  Holy cow.  Yes.  And so you can do that or you  reattach the keyboard and you're  sitting in a hotel room trying to  get a PowerPoint presentation  done at 2 a.m.  It is a little bit of

Start time: 783.46
End time: 789.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  acknowledgement though that  Windows is most important to the  enterprise.  Right?  That's where they really focused.

Start time: 789.54
End time: 794.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think there's ever been  any lack of acknowledgement of  that.

Start time: 795.92
End time: 835.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They know that.  That was a big misstep with that  though.  I would actually disagree with  you there.  I think that Windows 8 was them  thinking that they could dictate  how the enterprise would move  forward.  And I think Sanofsky, who was so  gung-ho about the ideas of  Windows 8 and on paper, I think  they looked really great.  And then we all saw and we all  seen the feedback in the early  previews and it was funny.  I remember when we were  preparing our coverage for  Windows 8 and I was really,  really kind of like, I don't know  guys, I think this is going to  be a bigger bust than we're  thinking.  I was like, no, no, no, this is  going to be huge.  And I was like, no, we need to  start prepping how to get the  start menu back.  Like articles.  Like we need to start on this.  I know that this is going to  start happening.

Start time: 836.16
End time: 837.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mashable is very consumer  focused, right?

Start time: 838.41
End time: 900.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We are.  We are.  But what I'm saying though is  that we also, I think that  there's actually a lot that goes  in hand with the consumers who  don't like change and the  enterprises that don't like  change.  I think there's actually a whole  lot of crossover there.  And the focus was so much  consumer side on Microsoft's  part.  And when that didn't work and  they were kind of trying to  push that into the enterprise  part, which didn't want to be  encumbered by some of the start  screen stuff and some of the  artists formally referred to as  Metro, the modern design stuff,  that was a real step back.  And that put a lot of the good  will that they built up after  Vista with 7 on the backburner  for a lot of places.  Because I talked to a lot of  businesses who were really  buying tons of iPads and were  happy to start building iPad  centric software for their  salespeople, but were not at all  impressed with Windows 8 because  they saw it as kind of a  clutch and it was confusing to  their users.  And the IT people just didn't  want to be bothered because it  was confusing to the users.  They didn't want to bother with  it.

Start time: 901.62
End time: 919.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got to be a little  frustrating because there's no  perfect solution.  iPad's not a perfect solution.  No, it's not.  It's not by an end in itself.  Maybe they weren't happy with  Windows 8.  If you look at the stats,  Windows 7 is about half of the  installed base.  XP is 25%.  Windows 8 is 12%.  Right.  And I mean, I think that,

Start time: 919.76
End time: 930.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  honestly, I mean, I look at  Windows 10 as an acknowledgement  that there can be one operating  system for everything, strategy.  Well, that's the other thing  that I find fascinating.  This one product, one platform,  one store thing.  What the hell is that all about?  I'm going to call BS on it until  we see it because we've been

Start time: 930.74
End time: 935.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hearing this since the Java days  and it never works.  Nadia, tell us something about  the fact that you're going to  have to go to the store and

Start time: 935.80
End time: 942.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you're going to have to buy  a new iPad.  And I'm going to call BS on  it until we see it because  we've been hearing this since  the Java days and it never  works.

Start time: 942.70
End time: 956.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nadia Sotelo said this and it  was a kind of a shock.  And then Microsoft backtracked,  but maybe he did mean one  Windows.  Right.  What do you think?  I mean, what do you think about  that?  What about the whole one  Windows thing?  Yeah.  Well, it's a.  That's genuine.

Start time: 956.90
End time: 977.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  When Steve Jobs introduced the  iPhone, he held it up and said,  and it runs iOS.  I mean, it runs OS 10.  Which it didn't.  And well, which it didn't.  But in a way, he was  saying that it runs iOS 10.  And he was saying that it  runs iOS 10.  And he was saying that  it runs iOS 10.  And he was saying that  it runs iOS 10.  And he was saying that  in a way, he was saying one  OS.  Yeah.  You know, you already know how

Start time: 977.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to use it.  Sure.

Start time: 979.78
End time: 1071.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because the kernel is the same  and a lot of the directions of  application development and user  experience on Apple's desktop  and Apple's touch oriented  devices are converging on the  same place.  So they started with two  different operating systems  built on the same kernel with  similar user experience  guidelines that converge  somewhere into the future.  That's what people really want.  And Microsoft is doing the same  thing, but they've taken a  different path to it.  I think, you know, Christina,  you're right about the tactical  errors.  There were profound tactical  errors in the launch of  Windows 8.  But strategically, Microsoft  needed to accomplish two things.  It needed to get its enterprise  customers off of XP and onto a  modern operating system.  And I think they knew that that  was going to be Windows 7.  That's the long term support  version.  And so they succeeded in doing  that and they thought that they  could build this, you know,  consumer focused thing and then  converge them in the future.  And you know, I think just as  you did, I looked at it when it  came out and I said, this is  going to be jarring and  uncomfortable for people and  there's going to be a lot of  people who are going to reject  it.  And it played out exactly as we  thought it was going to play  out.

Start time: 1071.82
End time: 1078.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what about the convergence?  What about the Windows 10?  Now it's time to bring the paths  together.  Is this it?  Is this going to be it?

Start time: 1079.20
End time: 1125.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there's a bit of  marketing in the convergence  part.  One thing that you get is the  opportunity for developers to  build universal apps and to sell  them so that they can be  licensed and used on multiple  screen sizes and multiple OS's  across multiple locations.  That's probably the biggest  advantage of the one Windows  thing is, you know, if I'm  selling an app, a communications  app or a social media app or  something like that, I don't  want people to have to go and  pay for it all over again every  time they go to a different  location.  I want them to be able to pay  once and use it anywhere.  Microsoft's leading the way with

Start time: 1125.52
End time: 1127.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that with Office, right?  That's kind of how Office works.

Start time: 1128.65
End time: 1207.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I mean, that's a  subscription, you know, kind of  offering too, and that works  really well.  I guess to play devil's advocate,  I would say I think that the  idea behind one Windows and one  core kernel, one core kind of  set of libraries that can be  shared across things, core set  of user interface things that  can be shared across, data that  can be shared across, that's  great.  Except we haven't seen anybody  embrace modern apps on any  sizeable level.  Any big companies bring out  modern apps, at least that you  charge for on any large level at  all.  I mean, Microsoft doesn't even  have the modern version of  Office out.  And so I'm genuinely curious.  I don't want to be a hater, but  I'm genuinely curious, at what  point do we just say this is  really great in theory, but is  anybody actually going to change  how they're developing software?  Are they going to build the apps  that will run on the phone?  Are they going to build phone  apps that can also run on the  desktop?  Are they going to build the  game stuff that can go  everywhere?  Or are they going to continue  to do what they've been doing,  which is to have siloed out  stuff where you're building your  application for Windows for the  traditional desktop as you  always have?  Maybe you're doing some sort of  web interfaces and maybe some  APIs so that your libraries can  talk to one another, but they're  not building something for the  store environment.  And that's what I'm not  convinced about.  And that's, I guess, why I hear  this one Windows stuff and I go,  yeah, but we've been hearing  about this for years and no one's  actually bothered to build  anything for it.

Start time: 1209.50
End time: 1245.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but maybe the time wasn't  right. Maybe now this is the  step they need to take.  We're going to take a break and  come back. I want to ask also,  Ed, why Windows 10 instead of  Windows 9?  And maybe that was, I'm sure  there's good reasons, but seems  like that got all the attention  instead of all these other things  that really probably Microsoft  would rather be talking about  than the numbering of the  We've got Ed Boss here.  Let's see if I can get this  camera working.  All right. We have a little  technical difficulty with that.  We're going to get him back  online. He's using Windows 10.

Ed Bott, are we is he back yet?  Should I have done that? Should I  have taken longer to do the ad?  We're still working on getting it.  Why were you? What were you  thinking? You know, Paul Thurotte  does this to me too.  Oh, I got the new Surface Pro.  Let's see how this works.  You guys, I guess you have to dog  food your stuff. You got it.  You know, if you're going to talk  about it, you have to use it.  I love Tim Moynihan's article on  Wired magazine.  He says ambitious Windows 10  is an attack designed  as a retreat.  He, like many, feels,  observed that I certainly felt  like, oh, it's Microsoft's giving  up on this whole new UI,  but it isn't really, I think.  Well, it's an it's an interesting.  Is it a pivot?  It's a retreat.  I don't know if it's an attack.  He says Windows at its best is most  boring. Is its most boring  as a blank napkin for productivity?  Well, maybe.  Why, Ed, if are you there?  Yeah, we got him now.  Now we don't have his audio.  Yeah, we hear you. Good.  OK, why 10?  I saw one speculation  that at first I thought was you.  I first I thought no.  And then I thought, yeah, then now  I thinking no again, which is that  programmers in the days of Windows  95 and 98 and XP  would do a check on Windows  nine star  to see if it was 95 or 98  to check for compatibility.  And Microsoft might be afraid that a  lot of that code, probably the case,  is still out there and it wouldn't  work with Windows nine.  Is that credible at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's more a matter of  numerology  in all seriousness, if if it's  if it's Windows nine, it's  just another version.  Yeah.  And and you and everyone's going to  say, no, let's just see.  Let's wait for Windows 10.  This one they they really and truly  did say or the  meta message they were sending was  this is the last one.  This is the this  this is the you know,  everything that will be beyond this  is an incremental update to it.  And there'll be that's interesting.  And and you know, there won't  be a Windows 11  work there, you know, just as  OS 10 was introduced in what?  2001, right?  Right around the month.

Start time: 1533.36

My friend John Marshall, whose  icon master on Twitter, he said  what I think is the funniest thing  that's also probably true.  He said that the reason they called  it OS 10 or Windows 10 is because  nine is too close to eight.  And they want to get as far away  from eight as possible in people's  mind.

Start time: 1595.46
End time: 1616.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think I think that's  right, though. I mean, numerology  is a real thing. I mean, I think  when you go I mean, Blackberry  kind of mean, OK, they failed, but  they tried to do the same thing  with going from Blackberry seven  to Blackberry 10.  And now I think they're going from  Bez 10 to Bez 12.  There is something about going  into like a big firm two  digit version number that  signifies this is for real  and this is a really big deal.

Start time: 1616.66
End time: 1624.51

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But OK, but to be fair, I mean,  have they ever been great at  branding? I mean, we went from  like three point eleven to  Windows 95 to 98 to  Millennium Edition to  two thousand to  XP to  Vista to seven to  eight.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and most people see,  see, we live in a tech bubble.  Yes, we we know  things about version numbers and  branding stuff.  Most people just go, they buy  a PC and they use it for four  years. They buy an iPhone.  They use it for two years.  They buy their latest Android  device. They use it for a while.  Updates show up.  They accept them.  They don't accept them.  If something goes wrong with the  update, they call their most  technically sophisticated friend  or they go online and try and  figure out what went wrong with  it. I don't know.  But the number I just have the  latest.  No, I know that on the radio

End time: 1829.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So OK, so there's nothing to be  said about 10. It's just the  number. It's just the next  version. But.  And maybe this was intentional,  maybe unintentional.  It seems like much of the press  attention has been on the number.  Was that I mean, really,  that's not I mean, is that what  they wanted? Oh, good.  Let's everybody focus on the  number.

Start time: 1831.32
End time: 1858.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think that they  very clearly by by going  with a different number, I think  to as pointed, it's very clearly  going for a different brand and  they're making a big statement,  whether they want to acknowledge  that maybe it's because Windows  8 didn't work, maybe it's just  because they're they're going in  a different direction or what it  is. I mean, but it's very clearly  making kind of a different  definition. I mean, they even  joked about saying, oh, we could  have called it Windows one, you  know, kind of like Xbox one and  what not. But oh, we've already  done that.  I thought they might do that,

Start time: 1858.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1859.59
End time: 1929.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did, too, actually.  And I think that that would have  one windows mean that's been kind  of a long philosophy.  That's kind of their long  saying philosophy.  But I think that, yeah, I mean,  there's been a lot of, you know,  discussion around the name.  But I think there's also been kind  of a discussion about the fact  that this is in a  great, greater sense, a return  to what they're really good at,  which is kind of what Satya  Nadella has been really saying  his whole time as CEO is really  kind of trying to get back to  their roots and get back to what  Microsoft knows it's good at and  really pushing that forward rather  than maybe trying to be everything  to everyone, which I think is a  good thing because Microsoft is  really, really good at  being Microsoft.  But it's where they falter  sometimes, I think, is when they  try to branch into areas where  maybe they're not as adept.  And that's where we all kind of  suffer. But I mean, to the  statement, I think you'd be hard  pressed to say that there's a  better office suite out there  than Office 365.  And I think that for a lot of  people who are managing, you  know, thousands of computers,  you'd be hard pressed to say  there's a better client, you  know, workstation system than,  you know, Windows 7 or presumably  Windows 10.  And so they do a lot of things  really well, but it's just when  they kind of try to get out of  that bubble and go into other  areas where they falter some.

You can make the guts better,  but I feel like it's the same way  once they got to the current  MacBook Air design, which I guess  they did, I think, in 2010, 2011.  And it's and it's basically  it's perfect.  There you get a certain point  with the design that you can't  make it any better.  I feel like the iPad Air is that  point for this iPad.  I kind of I don't know how you can  make that any better from a design  perspective. I feel like it's done.  You can update the guts.  You can add touch ID.  But the design itself,  it's perfection.

But I remember the markup on  certain audio equipment sometimes  was up to 90 percent for certain  brands, 90 percent markup.  And that was the employee price,  which means that there was  already there was even greater  markup than that.  So, I mean, for for home audio,  for car audio, for,  you know, personal audio, the  markup is insane,  which I mean, I think  that's why it was to me.  I thought about more it made sense  for Apple to buy Beats because  that thing is a cash cow that just  has no signs of stopping it.  And the margins on that stuff is  better.

Start time: 2278.80

And this is the one where  if you take Windows  10 and install it on a touch  capable device  that you've learned to use with  Windows 8.1, you're going to go,  ah, what happened?  Right.  They took my touch out.  Where did all that good stuff go?  No more charms.  It's so the charms are still there  on a touch screen device.  They're they're just that  all works as expected.  There's no  Metro version of Internet  Explorer. There's no touch friendly  version of Internet Explorer.  There's just one browser  in this.

Transcript:  Here's my problem with that is that  they lived in two different worlds.  So if you had a website open  in the touch version and then you  went to the desktop version, the  website wasn't open there.  So your tabs didn't it was the  states were completely separate.  That is what drove me nuts.  That to me was like what was  unconscionable.  Like if you want to have two  different interfaces, fine.  But at least I let my websites live  in both places, having them be  completely separate.  To me, I was like, you know what?  I can't do this.  I can't do this, Microsoft.  Sorry.

Transcript:  Yeah. So it's coded.  It's it's it's not coded  into the technical preview.  But the idea is and again,  this is intended for those  convertible devices, those  two in one devices so that  and they did if you can.  I think I might have linked  to it in that article, but maybe I  didn't.  But they did they did a video  and they showed how it would work  if you take a surface or  an HP X2 or  HP.  One of those convertible devices,  a Lenovo Yoga, and you  switch it from you  either remove the keyboard or switch  it into tablet mode.  And their their goal is  for some  interface affordment,  affordance to come up and  allow you to say, OK, I want to be  in tablet mode now.  And that would make the touch  targets bigger.  Yeah.  And and so on.  And then when you reattach the  keyboard, you could say,  no, I want to be back in mouse  and keyboard mode now or where  the touch targets get smaller  because you've got a fine  precision pointer that you can go  after them with and you can take  advantage of richer,  richer apps.  It's you know, that's a really  fine problem  to solve and a really difficult  problem to solve.  So it'll be it will be  enjoyable at the least  to watch how this develops.  I mean, it could be a train wreck  or it could be a thing of beauty.  And you just don't know.

Transcript:  Larry Dignan, before the event,  gave some strategic goals  for Microsoft.  He said that Windows he said  nine, but 10 needs to be a cloud  jump off point.  Keep Microsoft relevant,  be the last of Microsoft's big  bang releases, entice  the enterprise to remain Windows  based and advance Microsoft's  mobile ambitions.  Those do seem like kind  of big goals that Microsoft needs  to focus on.  Do you think that this does that  job?  Acknowledging that Larry's your  boss.

Start time: 2544.56
End time: 2647.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is they they need  to circle the wagons  in a sense for enterprise  customers. They don't want they  there's there really aren't a lot  of options for  enterprise customers out there.  So the question isn't  to keep them  from going elsewhere.  The question is to keep them  happy and  and in the fold.  Right.  And so you're going to see.  So what you didn't see  in terms of the name and  the start menu and stuff, you  didn't see a lot of the security  features that are coming in.  One thing that was leaked  in a blog post from a Microsoft  employee, it was it was pulled  about two hours later when  somebody came to him and said,  you weren't supposed to publish  that stuff, but he published a  detailed list of the enterprise  features that are going to be in  there. And so there's a lot of  a lot of multifactor  authentication stuff, for  example, that's going to be  baked into  the the core  authentication of the operating  system, not a layer that's added  on, but  but, you know, baked in there.  The ability to  compartmentalize data  on a device so that if you bring  a personal device into work,  the operative and your management  using lightweight  device management tools, the same  things that they use to manage  iPads and phones  now, they can use  to compartmentalize the data  on your device so that  when you leave employment, they can  zap the work files  and not touch your personal files  or apps at all.  And those are the those are the kind  of problems that people are looking  to solve in the enterprise today.

Transcript:  Everything's becoming a mobile platform.  You know, really, the screen  is just an endpoint.  And, you know, the idea  of how you get whether you get to  it on a laptop or on a big tablet  or a small tablet or a smartphone.  You know, you should be able to  get to the.  Get to the inner get to the back end  that has the thing  that you need to do  and control it from whatever  endpoint you happen to have, whatever  the size of it happens to be.

Transcript:  That's, I guess, getting back to my  original question, which is how  important is the desktop anymore?  And it's just one one kind of  avatar of what you're actually doing.  It's an abstraction  to what's really there, which is your data.  And it seems to me that Microsoft has  and I think is probably knows this  and is working very hard to do this,  has to really have a strategy that  goes across all these different.  I hate to use the word avatar,  but that's kind of what it is,  is this this kind of realization  of what is at core, which is your  your actual work, the data you're doing.  So mobile desktop tablet.  And it sounds like they want to own  all of these.  Instance, they want to be  instantiations of it.

Start time: 2729.28
End time: 2761.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They want to be playing in all of those,  whether they can own them or not,  I don't think there's there's sort of  a cult of monopoly  in in Silicon Valley,  where you're only successful  if you have at least 90 percent  market share, you know, so that,  oh, my God, Apple only has 31 percent  share selling seven hundred dollar  devices, each with a profit margin  of 30 percent.  You know, in a market of a billion  devices, you know, you don't need a  monopoly to be  to be a significant player.

There's the good news on Squarespace.  You don't have to worry about fads.  What's happening on the Web?  It's changing so fast.  I just I just saw that  one of our favorite Web 2.0  companies got sold.  And I think somebody wrote an  article saying it's the end of Web  2.0. This stuff moves so  fast.

Can't have you got to have the  parallax view.  You got to have the big images.  No, no more.  This is it. You don't have to worry  anymore. Your data is separate  from your design.  Your designs are state of the art.  Every Squarespace template is  written to take advantage of the  latest Web technologies  like responsive design.  So your site looks good on all  sites.

Transcript:  Wow.  I'm feeling old.  All right.  Speaking of feeling old, it's been  exactly three years to the day  that Steve Jobs passed away.  That was a very sad day here.  We were interviewing, who were we  interviewing?  We're doing triangulation.  Kevin Marks, right?  Kevin Marks.  Who had worked at Apple, had  worked for Steve Jobs when the  news came that Steve had passed.  We knew, everybody knew he was  very sick.  He had already stepped down as  CEO of Apple.  Still a real shock.  Tim Cook sent out an email to  Apple employees on Friday.  Team Sunday will mark the third  anniversary of Steve's passing.  I'm sure that many of you will be  thinking of him on that day, as I  know I will.  I'm sure, I hope you will take a  moment to appreciate the many  ways Steve made our world better.  His vision extended far beyond  the years he was alive and the  values on which he built Apple  will always be with us.  Enjoy your weekend.  Enjoy your weekend, especially  for those of you who will be  working here all weekend long.  And thanks for helping carry  Steve's legacy into the future.  One of Steve's legacies we learned  from Dom Melton's interviews on  the debug podcast, Renee Richie's  great podcast on iMore, was that  the weekends really weren't  weekends for Apple employees,  especially executives, because  Monday was the big meeting day  and you had to have everything  ready for your boss to bring to  Steve on Monday.  So Sunday nights were extremely  high pressure for Apple  employees.  I wonder if that culture has  changed.  As we remember all those great  things about Steve, he was also a  tough man to work for, I think.

Start time: 3204.44
End time: 3240.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think the  difference here is that it  wasn't just the execs, it was  all the underlings, too.  And I've talked to a lot of  people who were on, you know,  Craig's team and on Scott's team  and on the Mac and the iOS side  and who had to do those  presentations.  And their bosses were the ones  who were obviously up all night.  But then the people below them  had to be up all night, too.  And so it kind of became part of  the culture where everybody in  Dawn's interview and the other  people who were former employees  were kind of alluding to that  was that you kind of got mad at  the people who worked below you  if they got a good night's sleep  and you didn't.  So it kind of permeated from the  top down.  And I don't know if that's the  change or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say, I think  that that's one of the big  differences is that at Apple,  especially if you were,  I mean, at Apple, I think what's  different about versus how it is  at Google is that at Apple,  the designers are kind of king  and they kind of sit above  where the engineers are,  whereas at Google, obviously,  the engineers are king.  And the hierarchy is much  more flat, I think, at Google  versus at Apple.  So but, you know, I mean,  it differs from company to  company.  I think you could make the  argument that I don't think that  at Yahoo, for instance,  I don't think there are a lot of  people who would get, you know,  feel compelled to be up until  four o'clock in the morning,  Sunday night.  And that's not really a  criticism.  I just think it's a difference.  But, you know, yeah, I mean,  I think a lot of these consumer  companies, I mean, yeah,  if you want to be if you want to  make it, you've got to work  sometimes these insane,  ridiculous hours.  But that's also, I think,  one of the reasons why you see so  much burnout from people, right,  because there's a certain point  in your life where you're going,  I can make this much money  working for any number  of companies.  Do I really need to be doing  this when I'm however old I am?  And if I have a family,  do I really need to be in a  position where I can't,  you know, go to bed until three  or four o'clock in the morning  on Sunday night because I'm  presenting to someone and my boss  who never sleeps might be sending  me an email that I've got to be  ready for.

Start time: 3352.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, that's what I'm saying,  because I mean, at a certain  point, if you're doing this  your whole life and your whole  career, to what end?  I mean, if everybody at the top  is still having these sorts of  work hours, then what are you  working towards exactly?  Right.  With it, if taking a vacation  means you also have to check your  email four times a day and that,  you know, that was one of their  points that on vacation you and  you would you would say, oh, only  four times.  But, you know, Don was was kind  of secretly judging somebody.  You know, he even as much on that  podcast.  You only checked email four times  on vacation a day.  And you're thinking something  wrong. Well, well,  but you also kind of wonder, OK,  well, maybe I just don't want to  do this. I mean, there are a lot  of jobs where you can make good  money and get to have a life.  And I mean, to me, that's kind of  why I see some of the big  perks that these companies offer,  you know, notably Google and  Facebook as kind of being bad  things. Right. Because it seems to  me like they're really just  encouraging you to like live at  the office and to make  your entire social circle, your  entire, you know, work life.  Everything revolves around the  office. And you think, oh, it's so  great. I can do my laundry here.  You know, I can sleep here.  I can eat here. I can do all this  other stuff.  But doesn't that at a certain  point just mean that your entire  life is your job?  And I mean, maybe that's OK.  Maybe that's what you want.  But I think that for a lot of  people, we like to have the idea,  even if it's fake, that we can  have lives beyond what we do.

Transcript:  Right. Because those are the  people that can afford to get that  sort of stuff up.  It gets harder to make the decision  to be able to put all of your life  into that when when you're older.  I mean, I'm 31, but I  have to say it would be harder for  me. I'm married and  I've been at this for a while to be  willing to work  18 hour days or for  a job if I didn't have significant  equity or I weren't building it out  myself. If I were just being hired  as a cog in the wheel, I don't know  if I'd be willing to do that, if I'm  being honest.  When I was 20, 21, 22,  sure.  But even just in the span of a  decade, you know, things change  because what you value  in your life changes.  And I think it's especially  different if you're married or if  you have a partner or, you know,  especially if you have children  where you go, you know, I don't know  if you want to give those sorts of  things up in exchange for  the perceived potential benefits.  And that's why there are so many  young people in startups.  Sometimes I think to the detriment  because, you know, the startups  could actually probably benefit from  having people who are more  experienced and have gone through  things more and have a better  perspective.  But you just can't find people who  have that sort of experience usually  who are willing to give up their  entire lives, you know, for  the company and to be in that  kind of go, go, go, you know,  working 18, 19 hours.

This really isn't anything new, is  it?  I mean, you get glory,  but but but  I guess this has always been the  case.

There's a certain amount, I think,  of disconnect when you have  something like this, which costs  a lot of money and that we see as  a status symbol and then you see  how it's made.  And there's a certain amount of  guilt, as I think there should be  when you think about the  sacrifices that go in to being  made, the people who are sourcing  the materials, the people who are  putting these things together,  and not to mention, you know,  to be honest, I don't I feel for  some of the people who are  building the software, but I'm  not going to cry over for somebody  who's making a six figure salary  by their choice.  I'm going to cry and feel bad  for the people that are being  paid pennies an hour  to put these things together, the  people that are sourcing the  minerals that make this stuff.  But I think that that's kind of  one of the, I guess, the  interesting dichotomies with  tech, at least for me, is that we  are surrounded by all this  amazing stuff that makes our  lives so much easier.  But at the same time, so many of  those advantages come at the  expense of real human capital.  And that's not a fun thing to  really address or look at.  And I think that's why a lot of  us don't, because it's very  uncomfortable to kind of, you  know, put those two things in  juxtaposition.  And but it's something we  probably should do more of.

Transcript:  It actually reminds me of the  Tony Shay story that's going  around about downtown Las Vegas.  Tony Shay, who is the former  CEO or still CEO at Zappos, even  after the Amazon acquisition,  really great guy. I love him,  wrote a book about bringing  happiness to everyone and  had decided and I thought this  was a really interesting project  to revitalize downtown Vegas, to  create startup capital funds  down there and bring startups in  there.  And it's Shay just stepped down.  Thirty of the 300 employees have  been laid off. And the worst  thing is there have been three  suicides this year by people  involved with the downtown  project.  And of course, the headline in  newspapers is, is it possible to  be happy when you're trying to  bring happiness to everyone?  It's damaging.  So this is in another this is  another side of this.  Shay says, hey, there's suicides  all everywhere.  This isn't you shouldn't focus on  that.

Transcript:  Well, and I think that that's a  fair point, but it's also I think  in that case, it's really you  have to kind of look at the big  culture of things he was bringing  in where you're talking about a  very stressful thing of having a  startup. You know, my father was  he's retired now, but he was an  entrepreneur. And I know what it  was like growing up where, you  know, my mom was kind of the  stable breadwinner.  My dad, you know, sometimes  things would work out really  well. Sometimes they wouldn't.  And starting your own business,  you know, is very difficult,  whether it's whether it's a  startup, you have funding or  you're starting a restaurant and  getting a small business loan or  you're doing something else.  It's it's very tough.  And most of them fail.  The reality is most of them fail.  It's hard on you and your family.  It absolutely is.  And so you have a situation with  the town down Vegas, the  downtown project, where, yes,  they had a lot of money where  they're trying to revitalize this  very downtrodden, very  dilapidated, very crime ridden  area and kind of trying to do a  civic duty and also, you know,  kind of trying to treat it kind  of like a tech startup.  So you convince a lot of people  to leave their homes and their  support systems come to this new  place that has its own issues  and then kind of, you know,  power together through the  spirit of, you know, Kumbaya and  build something bigger.  And it's a great idea.  And I certainly don't want to,  you know, condemn the idea, but I  definitely feel like that does  become kind of a perfect storm  in a sense for the problems that  are going to exist anyway, to  only become even more  exasperated once you look at  kind of the situation of where  you are, what the economy is  like, what the people in the  town are like.  And then you've got all the other  day to day, you know, really  realistic struggles of starting  a business, especially when the  person that's leading kind of the  command is very charisma,  charismatic leader who wants  everyone to be happy to the point  that I feel like maybe that  becomes a negative thing because  you feel like, well, if I'm not  on the outward looking like I'm  happy, if I don't talk about my  struggles, if I do talk about my  struggles, maybe that's going  against the message.  And so maybe people don't feel  comfortable to to be open about  what they're struggling with.  And so, yeah, I mean, I think  it's a real shame.  And but I mean, I think the  downtown project, I mean, they  obviously had to do some layoffs  this week and there's we don't  really know the whole story  behind that.  But I feel like that's I don't  know. I love the idea of trying  to go into a downtrodden area  and try to build it up and do  good. But I don't know if you  can apply some of the lessons  that you do with a typical  startup, if you can take out the  civic planning.  I don't necessarily know if the  people who were in charge,  what's been kind of coming out  has been that maybe some of the  people in charge of some of these  things weren't the best people  to be in charge.  And civic planning is hard  enough doing startups is hard  enough doing both of them  together.  I don't know. I mean, maybe it  was too ambitious, but I hope  that I hope that the project is  able to be ultimately successful  and that, you know, more that it  can work out better, you know,  going forward.

Transcript:  Oh, without a doubt.  And I think he's done a lot for  the downtown Vegas community.  I just feel like.  You know, it's it's one thing to  to build a successful business,  it's another thing to build a  bunch of successful businesses  and a community that can kind  of build upon itself.  And I mean, to his point, you  know, he released a letter that  said, you know, look, we knew  this was a five year plan.  You know, we're accelerating  that the typical process much  faster. So there are going to be  successes and failures that  accelerate faster, too.  And that's a valid point.  I just think that, you know, the  narrative that we like to see as  journalists and as storytellers  and people who follow the media,  we want to see things happen  in a certain way.  And I think so many people went  to downtown Vegas and were kind  of enamored with the process.  And then when it doesn't work  out, you know, become upset  that that it didn't work out.  But I mean, we're only  in the middle of kind of what  they think their fighter plan is  going to be. And so I think it's  hard stuff in the right place.  And and definitely I'm not  willing to count these things  out, but I think it's just proof  to all of us that, you know,  money alone isn't going to be  able to create success and that,  you know, it's hard work to  build a business and it's a hard  work to build communities.

Doesn't say why Microsoft  didn't do it sooner, but first.  Ouch. They tried.  Or did they?  I don't know.  You know, they had a watch.  They had that spot watch was awesome.  I don't.  We're going to take a break.  And be back with more in  just a moment. Our show today  brought to you by audible.com.  Here's something we can all agree on.  The best way to relax  and to seal out the the world  and all those three  AM phone calls is an audio book.  And as somebody who spent  a lot of time on an airplane  this week and last week, too,  I got to tell you, audible  is a lifesaver.  You know, in England,  there's audible ads in the in the tube  in the underground station  everywhere on the trains.  And what was the slogan?  I loved it.  I can't remember.  It was a great slogan, like  there's always time to listen  or something like that.  It was wonderful.  It's true if you commute,  if you spend time in the car,  if you spend time at the gym,  if you just do housework, anything.  There's lots of time in the day  when you can't hold a book,  but you could be listening to a book.  And you'll be amazed.  It brought reading back into my life  when I started listening to audible  14 years ago.  I started in the year 2000  because, you know, we have  busy lives who has time.  But it turns out there's a lot of time  where you could be listening  and audible brings those books  into your life.  I'm right now I'm listening to  I think I used to have this  rule one book at a time.  I don't know how I got out of that,  but now I have like three books  going right now.  One fiction, one nonfiction,  and then maybe one random one.  There's so much great  listening at audible.  One hundred and fifty thousand titles  recorded not just by, you know,  readers, but by actors,  by people who bring these books  to life in such a great way.  And sometimes it's by the author.  I just listened to the Neil Young  by autobiography and he's reading it.  That's really great.  Not Neil Young.  Well, that's one actually.  There is a new Neil Young book,  Graham Nash, and actually the next one  on my list is Neil Young,  because I love the rock and roll stuff.  I'm also about to listen to Gone Girl.  You know, that movie's coming out,  I think this week.  A thriller, but I got to tell you,  as good as a two hour movie can be,  there's nothing to compare  with the novel as you're listening to it.  And this plays out in your mind.  Your mind makes the best sets.  Sometimes I think I've already seen this movie  because I've read or listened to the book.  And that's what.  So if I always recommend before you see the movie,  get the book Gone Girl.  Who? Yeah, absolutely.  Don't know what the movie will be like,  but I know you're going to love this book.  Here's the deal.  I'm going to get you two books free.  What about that?  All you have to do is go to audible.com slash twit two.  That's audible.com slash twit.  And the number two,  you'll be signing up for the platinum plan.  That's two books a month plus the Daily Digest  or the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal.  Cancel any time in the first 30 days.  Those books are yours to keep forever.  You pay nothing,  but I think you're going to want to be a member for life.  I know I am.  I'm, that's it.  Ooh, new Neil Gaiman.  A full cast production of the Graveyard Book.  I haven't read this.  Have you read the Graveyard Book, Christina?  Because it seems like you'd be a Neil Gaiman fan.

Transcript:  I always read the, before I see the movie,  I almost always try to read the book first.  For some reason, that's just how I am.  Audible makes it possible.  And again, I think your mind is better  at creating scenes, creating, building the set,  making it happen.  That's why to me, science fiction,  as much as I love those great sci-fi movies and TV shows,  you gotta read the book.  The book comes to life, whatever it is.  Peter F. Hamilton, Isaac Asimov,  great selection there too at audible.com.  Try it today.  Two books, you're free for you.  Audible.com slash twit and the number two.  Audible.com slash twit and the number two.  There's always, I think I said there was always  time to listen, something like that.  Oh, Lisa's happy because the Niners won.  I thought she was cheering for Audible.  I like Audible too, she says.  She listens to, she's listening to Norrell Roberts.  She's, I think you're gonna go through  all the Norrell Roberts books.  And John Grisham, yeah.  She likes those thrillers.  It's fun, and she's in the gym like eight hours a day,  so she really needs something to listen to.  Bill Gates, interview with Bloomberg TV, Eric Schatzker.  Talked about a lot of stuff.  Talked about Bitcoin.  See, Bill's slant has changed a little bit  now that he's a philanthropist.  He's not so interested in business.  He's interested in how the world,  especially for the poor, can be transformed.  And he thinks, for instance, Bitcoin is huge for that,  but he also thinks that virtual forms of virtual money  and virtual payment are really important  because, especially in the developing world,  a lot of people don't have bank accounts,  but they might have cell phones.  They can't write a check, but they can pay by a cell phone.  He says, Apple Pay, this is a quote from the interview,  is a great example of how a cell phone  that identifies its user in a pretty strong way,  I guess he's talking about the fingerprint, the touch ID,  lets you make a transaction  that should be very, very inexpensive.  So the fact that in any application,  I can buy something, that's fantastic.  The fact that I don't need a physical card anymore,  I just do that transaction,  you're gonna be quite sure about who's on the other end,  and that is a real contribution.  And all of the platforms,  whether it's Apple or Google or Microsoft,  you'll see this payment capability get built in.  But he thinks Apple will help it get to critical mass  for all of the devices.  I think he's right.  I think this is something we've been poised on the verge of,  but Apple Pay, it's just gonna be,  I think it's gonna be that final bit  that puts us over the top,  especially because of the touch ID,  which works very well on iPhones.

Transcript:  Well, and they also have a very deep connection  to a very wealthy core demographic.  And so that is-  Which merchants would love to get to.  Exactly, and that's what makes it possible  for the payment system to be successful,  is because you know that people are going to be coming in  with money on their phone that they can interact with.  You know, and so-

Start time: 4488.72
End time: 4501.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 4503.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I think he's right.  I mean, it's interesting actually,  because if you look at the developing world,  they've actually been further ahead, at least,  than America when it comes to paying by phone.  They do it in different ways.  I remember speaking with Osama Badir,  who was at PayPal at the time,  and then he was at Google,  and I'm not sure what he's doing now,  but he was at the time PayPal's big payments guy,  and he was telling me about how,  I mean, this was probably in 2009 or 2010,  you know, that a lot of people in Africa  would have dumb phones,  and would use these kind of micro payments to buy things,  kind of with individuals acting as kind of banks  to transfer funds from one device to another.  And that they were-

I mean, I think obviously NFC is not a new thing,  but what hasn't happened in America anyway  is that the merchants haven't gotten on board.  And to Ed's point, you know,  they will get on board when you know that  you've got 10 million people buying an iPhone,  you know, six, you know, the weekend it comes out.  And when you've got a few hundred million people  with Touch ID, you know, capable devices  who are going to be going into places like Whole Foods  and, you know, Target and the Apple Store  and other places to buy stuff.  And that means that upgrading your equipment  and your point of sale terminals makes more sense.  And the big thing-

Start time: 4591.90
End time: 4647.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we've talked a little bit about that  on the MacBreak Weekly, that the timing is critical.  Because in the US, we're going chip and pin  by the end of 2015, that is a federal mandate.  Merchants will have to buy new credit card equipment anyway  before the end of next year.  So your timing is excellent.  If you're a merchant, you're about to do this,  well, you're going to make sure it works with Apple Pay.  And obviously, since Apple still is not even half  of the universe in the United States,  you're going to make sure it works with Google Wallet  and NFC and any other touch-to-pay system.  And I'm sure that that's exactly what's happening  is the companies that make these devices  are now making sure they're completely compatible  with all the possible touch-to-pay stuff.  And that's going to empower it.  We were in a London taxi.  They take touch-to-pay, many of the London taxis.  I could have paid with it my Google Wallet.  I was poised over it, but I just,  there's a hump to get over.  It's like the first time you use a credit card online.  There's just a little hump to get over.

It's like this month or last month, it was three years  that I used that on a Galaxy Nexus on Sprint.  And I connected my Capital One credit card to it  because that happened to work  and it only worked with the Capital One MasterCard.  It wouldn't work with Visa.  It had to work with the MasterCard  and only for a couple of payment carriers.

End time: 4784.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't have a card with a chip in it  and there aren't enough readers  but I definitely would feel comfortable with that.  For me, the bigger hump has actually been,  will this recognize my existing banking system  or do I have to go to another bank?  The big thing I think that Apple has  that was absolutely a requirement  and they obviously thought to do this  is that they are going to be coming out of the gate  supporting Bank of America, Chase, Citibank.  All of the major banks are begging to get on board  and then MasterCard, Visa, American Express  are all on board.  And so when you've got that ability there,  if I can very easily add my existing card  to the wallet very easily  and I don't have to go through a bunch of hoops,  which I had to do with Google Wallet  and which you kind of have to do with ISIS,  even for people who are not maybe comfortable,  if you can get over that hump of easily adding your card,  just scanning your credit card and having it in the wallet,  that's a lot easier.

Start time: 4785.04
End time: 4797.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I'll get comfortable very quickly.  I need to do it a few times  and there's just not much opportunity to do it.  And I do think the touch ID in an iPhone  will make me feel better.  I gather what happens with wallets  is you have to enter a PIN.

Start time: 4798.52
End time: 4848.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have to enter a PIN and then the NFC might be working,  maybe it isn't and it was clunky.  When they introduced it three years ago  and because of the ISIS back and forth,  they never really got it off the ground.  And it was a shame because it was seriously,  but I mean, but it was a great first attempt.  But when I was using it three years ago,  I was like, there's no way this will go mainstream.  Apple for whatever reason,  A, they're really lucky with the timing.  As you said, people have to upgrade machines anyway,  but I think B, they aren't going to launch a product  that is going to have that sort of experience.  They're not going to do that.  They will wait until the ecosystem can be where it is now,  because if it were just about launching a product,  they could have launched something like Touch ID  or Apple Pay a couple of years ago,  but they're gonna make sure they have people out there.

And I mean, I was embarrassed handing over a credit card.  I'm sorry, you have to swipe this.  Right.  You know, I'm terribly embarrassed.  And they'd say, that's okay, we understand, you're American.  But we were horribly behind on GSM.  The rest of the world adopted it wholesale  long before us.  And I think the rest of the world is going to benefit  from electronic payments long before the United States does.

You feel embarrassed if you have to have them swipe the card.  You know, I mean, at least there they'll take $20 bills,  but, you know, it's, you know, for the most part,  depending on what part of Canada you're in,  they'll pretty much take up to a 20  and have the same conversion rate.  But yeah, I mean, it's, we are definitely way behind.  I hope that Apple Pay is what pushes us to catch up  and that the other payments,  it won't become the de facto standard, of course,  but that that will be what will force merchants  to finally get on board.

And we really, we don't like to think about  how unsafe our current credit card systems are,  that they're being swiped  and sometimes manually written down.  And that sort of stuff, the fact that anybody, you know,  you give your number over the phone, you know,  anybody could be writing that number down  and putting it someplace else.  I mean, our payment system as it exists right now,  it's very insecure because we still are using  these antiquated practices that the rest of the world  kind of looks at us and they're like, really guys, really?  I thought that you're like USA number one.  It's like, yeah, not really.

Transcript:  Well, you know why?  Because we were in the forefront of protecting consumers  in that regard and because consumers really don't pay,  at least not directly for any losses, the banks do.  There's been very little pressure for consumers  to come up with a more secure system.  It's all come up from the banks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They should be, because they don't want to pay  for the upgrade of the systems.  So it's been kind of the historical thing.  They don't want to pay, you know, $1,500, $1,800  for a new terminal, you know, if you're a small business,  which is why a lot of people, even after the target hack,  we're fighting this, you know, federal mandate  that we're all going to go, you know, chip to pay.  But at this point, there've been enough problems that,  yeah, I mean, they're going to have,  everybody's going to have to upgrade.  But even after that mandate comes through,  you know that there are going to be tons of businesses,  just like there are in Brooklyn,  where there are tons of people who don't take credit card  because they don't want to pay the taxes on it.  You know, they take cash only,  or, you know, they use things like Square,  which are, you know, kind of a, you know,  less expensive way of having to get around the system.  So I don't know, we'll see.

Transcript:  So I'm looking at a Wall Street Journal article.  They got it wrong too.  They've corrected the article.  Apparently you'll still be able to sign after October 2015,  but you will have to have the pin in your credit card.  And it will be encouraged that people use chip and pin  as opposed to chip and sign, which is all-

Start time: 5113.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, which is the same way it is in Europe.  Yeah, I could sign for stuff.  In a civilized world right now.  You can still swipe and sign, but it's strongly encouraged.  And you're much better protected against fraud  if you're using a chip and pin system.  I think the big cultural shift  that we're going to have to make  is starting to think of smartphones as,  like they literally are like your wallet.  You don't want your picket.  Yeah, you know, you don't want your,  a pickpocket to take that from you  because it's as valuable as a wallet  filled with 20s and hundreds.

Transcript:  Well, that's again where the fingerprint,  where Touch ID gives you some reassurance.  Apple has also improved their,  I think this is great, their activation system.  Now they have a tool you can put on a phone and say,  is this a stolen phone?  They make it very hard in fact to steal a phone  and then use it again.  All of that stuff, it's more than a kill switch.  I mean, it really, it really kills it dead.  All of that stuff really is important.  And Apple really can lead the way,  but, and I hope that Android devices will follow.

Start time: 5184.40
End time: 5255.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I think they definitely will.  I mean, I just think that Apple,  because they are, even if they have less market share  than Android as a whole,  when it comes to an individual company,  they obviously have the most market share,  for a single type of device category.  More iPhones are sold than anything else.  And so they have a huge opportunity at that point.  But yeah, I mean, I think that you're absolutely right Ed.  I mean, we've got to start thinking of our phones,  like our wallets.  And I mean, to be honest, I've lost my phone once  and I was able to get it back,  but it did feel like a violent,  I mean, I felt this sense of loss.  I felt not having my phone was akin  absolutely to losing a wallet.  And at this point, there's as much personal data about me  on my phone as there usually is in my wallet.  I mean, maybe I don't have to go,  I don't, just as I don't carry my social security card  with me, maybe there are certain things on my phone  that might not be as inherent to my identity,  but losing one or both is basically kind of the equivalent.  You feel screwed, you feel violated  without either piece of information.  But I think that the concept that we can just say,  oh, it's just a phone.  No, your phone becomes this core part  of your identity in a large sense.

Transcript:  Here's an interesting sideline to this.  According to this new law that goes into effect  October 2015, there's also a shift of who is liable  for fraud.  The person with less technology is liable.

Start time: 5286.46
End time: 5291.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  if there's card fraud, whichever party has the lesser  technology will bear the liability.  Wow.  That's smart.  Yeah, I guess.

Start time: 5303.02
End time: 5348.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think that that's honestly,  that's probably the only way they can convince  some of these merchants to upgrade,  is if it becomes a liability issue.  And at that point, it would come down to,  for some retailers, it would come down to,  is our insurance that we have out against fraud,  is that going to, is that rider going to be more  or less expensive than what we would have to pay  to upgrade our systems?  And then it just comes down to whatever's cheaper they'll do.  But I think that that's probably the only way  you can get places that have hundreds of thousands  of terminals to upgrade en masse,  is if you start saying, okay, well, if you don't have  this system in place, then if there is a breach,  we will hold you responsible and you will be liable.  And your insurance or whatever policy you've got  into effect will have to be responsible for this.

Transcript:  Apple's strategy, not to get back on Apple,  but I think it's interesting that Apple has decided  that they're going to be the privacy company,  the security company.  And even despite the fact that these iCloud accounts  got hacked and so forth, I think that's a smart move.  And it is in a way seeing the writing on the wall  that people are going to depend so much on these devices  that you need to be able, for instance,  Apple says, we're not going to be able to decrypt,  we're not going to help you anymore in law enforcement  if you ask for a decryption on the iPhone.  Currently, there's a queue, you can get in in a few months,  Apple will give you decrypted data from a bad guy's iPhone.  Apple says, we're not going to do that anymore.  Although Matthew Green, the cryptographer, has pointed out  it's not really any change in the way Apple works,  they're just going to move more data than before into there.  In the past, mail, text messages, photos were excluded  from the normally encrypted data on your iPhone.  Now everything, including attachments, managed books  from the book program, iBooks, app launch images,  location data will be encrypted with keys protected  by the user's passcode, calendar, excluding attachments,  contacts, reminders, notes, messages, photos,  and health ancillary data implement protected  until first user authentication.  So this is a good move on Apple's part.  They see the writing on the wall.  This is a way to make more money, some more iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Microsoft has been doing the same thing  with mobile devices for a couple of years now.  Yeah, encrypted by default, they don't have the keys.  And that's the real issue is who has the keys.  Yes.  And the Washington Post did a spectacularly naive  editorial yesterday where they talked about,  well, there has to be a way for law enforcement  to be able to get this data.  So maybe the wizards on Apple and Google  could come up with a magical way to create golden keys  that they can save and reserve.  It's called a backdoor.  When they get the proper warrant.  Well, it's called KeySGrow.  KeySGrow. KeySGrow, which has been, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you trust him?  Yeah, no, I think this,  I understand law enforcement's upset.  They don't want there to be anything  that they can't look into if they need to.  But I think, I don't think there's any question  Apple has the right to do this.  And that consumers want this.

Start time: 5540.02
End time: 5558.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely, I mean, especially when we've seen  how law enforcement oversteps their boundaries.  I mean, I want you to have a warrant  and do your job as police officers and detectives.  And I recognize that maybe not having access  to some of this stuff might make your job harder.  And that's too bad.  But what did you do before there were cell phones?  What did you do before all this information was around?

Start time: 5559.00
End time: 5582.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just to play devil's advocate.  Shouldn't we then be making sure that law enforcement  follows the proper procedures and does have warrants  and it's court supervised, but still have KeySGrow?  I mean, shouldn't we,  and why did you say that was a naive proposal?  I mean, we do need some way  of investigating terrorists and criminals, don't we?  Well, we had the Patriot Act, which was passed in 2001.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think we just bring a unicorn to court  for every warrant hearing  and then everything will work properly.  The reality is we've already proven beyond a shadow  of a doubt in this country that under the proper fear level,  legislators will pass laws that make it possible  for things to be done in secret that we don't know about.  So if you have a key that is held in escrow  and you have a law that says,  we are the government and we can have a warrant  and you can't talk about this warrant  for national security reasons,  for the purposes of fighting terrorists or for whatever,  then that escrow key is used to decrypt your data  and nobody knows about it.  And you can talk about all of the procedural safeguards  for making sure that constitutional rights  are respected in a situation like that.  But the reality is that if you have the key  and someone else can get to the key  and they can hold a gun to your head and say,  don't tell anyone that I got this key from you,  then whoever thinks they are the actual owner of that data  doesn't really own it.  The only way that you own that data  is if you are the sole owner of the decryption key  and nobody else can access it except you.

Transcript:  I just worry that, I mean,  there's some pretty horrible actors out there  like the Islamic State.  I wonder if these people  would then all switch to iPhones and-

Start time: 5704.36
End time: 5855.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's the thing though.  It's a false premise, I think,  because just because Apple's not offering up  the decryption keys doesn't mean  that people can't still access this data.  It doesn't mean there aren't still people  who can reverse engineer things.  And people in fact do.  In fact, there are a lot of people who,  Jonathan Zdz, I can't pronounce his last name,  Zdarsky, who's fantastic.  And he wrote an article on his blog  and he's pretty much, I would say,  the foremost iOS kind of a security  and forensic guy out there.  There's still software and tools out there  that these agencies can get.  And I would think especially at the high levels  of people who are wanting to do things  like investigating the Islamic State.  What this doesn't make it as easy for  is for say like the Polk County Police Department  who's trying to investigate a drug user's iPhone.  Maybe their job is going to be a little bit more difficult.  But let's be honest.  I mean, maybe it should be.  Maybe they have been, to this point,  we're not sure because as Ed was pointing out,  these things that are in place where people  are able to gain access to these warrants  without having to have any sort of paper trail  or any sort of transparency.  We don't know how they've been getting access to stuff.  But I firmly believe that just because  Apple's not handing over the keys,  it in no way means that there's no way  to access this information.  And that's, it becomes more difficult granted.  But I think that's kind of one of those trade-offs  we have to have with being a free society  and having a system of laws is that if we are going to say  that we have rights and that we have a right to privacy,  that means that companies shouldn't feel  as if they have to hold hand over the keys  to all these systems to the government  because to me that really bothers me fundamentally  as an American, the idea that we would entrust  the government automatically with this stuff  and say that just because you're law enforcement,  you get access to this.  Because there are probably easier ways  than even going that far for people who are skilled  to break into this stuff if you really need  to get the information.  Right.  So I feel like it's a false economy.  Orin Karr saying things like, oh, this is,  pedophiles or whoever the man was who said the pedophiles  all use the iPhone.  Okay, first of all, that's really incendiary language  and it really bothers me kind of using that sort of rhetoric.  Second of all, it's not as if you're going to say  that no one can ever break into this.  That's not what it's saying.  It's simply saying that Apple from a matter of liability  and let's be clear, Apple's not doing this  because they love their users.  They're doing it because they don't want to be liable  for having to be responsible to unlock this stuff.

Start time: 5855.20
End time: 5871.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also a very good positioning for Apple  to say we're the privacy company.  Oh, without a doubt.  Although there will be some backlash from people  who quite reasonably say, yeah,  but now who's going to protect us against terrorists?  So believe me, I'm playing devil's advocate here.

I remember talking to Phil Zimmerman about PGP  and of course the first thing he say is,  well, great, you're now providing completely secure email  for everybody, easy to use.  That wasn't, does it turn out that easy to use?  Easy to use.  Aren't you empowering terrorists?  And Phil was very clear.  He said, yeah, but we live in a free society  and it's important that people be able  to protect their privacy.  And it's like the First Amendment.  You just have to do it.

Transcript:  Well, it's no different from a law enforcement agency  saying criminals live in houses.  Houses have front doors with locks on them.  We need to ban locks because the police need  to get into criminals' houses  and whenever it's necessary.  Fine, you need procedures to break through locks.  There will, I guarantee it, be ways for law enforcement  and especially national security to target the information  of the really, truly bad guys.  They're just going to have to deal with a landscape  that has shifted in favor of privacy.  And we need to take that.  I like what Apple has done in terms of talking  about law enforcement, but I want to see that shift  to the commercial sector as well.  I want to see far fewer web properties  and advertising agencies and data marketers  indiscriminately gathering wholesale amounts of data  on people from around the world just because they can.  I would love to see, not just for law enforcement,  but for everything, to see the expectation  of privacy shift to something that is in favor  of the individual.

Transcript:  Still illegal in Australia  and other British Commonwealth nations.  No, in fact, I feel like streaming media  is so dominant now.  And I don't understand, I mean,  I guess Redbox just sat down there streaming service  or their net, whatever it was.  It's just, but we're gonna get 4K  and Sony has announced a new Blu-ray capable,  Blu-ray player that's gonna have to buy a new one  for 4K video.  And I guess 4K is so big,  you're probably not gonna stream that, right?

Transcript:  Right, I mean, you can with Netflix a little bit,  but it's-  It's not good quality.  No, well, the thing is it's gotta be 15 megabits sustained,  which most people, if you're getting Netflix,  you can't have that anyway.  So it's gotta be a huge pipe.  And then the quality's not as good  as if you could get it standalone.  So for 4K, I mean, I actually,  it was funny at the beginning of the year,  I was on some news program and I was making predictions  when we were talking about 4K  and I kind of half-joked, was half serious.  I was like, well, actually maybe disc will come back  because of 4K.  And, but I only say that because the file size is so big,  but for everything else, I mean,  I think until 4K TVs are really out there in abundance,  yeah, I mean, I love physical media  because I like the quality and I like the extra features.  But if I'm being honest, 99% of what I watch  is still from streaming from other places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They do, they do.  And that's the only way you can get them  is if you buy the Blu-ray and the DVD.  And so a lot of times I buy.  I think we can fix that.  We could, it's just, sadly,  fewer and fewer people care about that.

Transcript:  It is without a doubt.  Scorsese's commentary on Taxi Driver is one of the best.  Roger Ebert does a commentary on Citizen Kane,  which is fantastic.  Oh, I'd love to hear that.  He also does one with Spike Lee on Do the Right Thing.  I mean, there are all these great commentary tracks  where you learn so much about the film.  And I worry about that.

Start time: 6527.24
End time: 6555.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Basically, yes.  They do like featurettes and maybe some deleted scenes.  Yeah, they're featurettes, yeah.  And the featurettes, what's not good about those  is those are the ones that like you make,  the studio makes to promote the film  that like they put on HBO in between movies.  And no one cares.  So it's not even a real like documentary  because there's some things like,  there's like this two hour Jaws documentary  that was on the laserdisc and then on the DVD  and the Blu-ray, which is fantastic.  If it was that quality, great, awesome, but it's not.  So like I don't want to see the studio, you know.

Start time: 6556.40
End time: 6569.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've heard studios say we don't do extras,  we don't do commentary because nobody wants to do them.  Like the directors don't want to go in there  and do these kind of things.  They see it as a chore.  It's a chore.  I think that's a chore they don't get paid for either,

Start time: 6569.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  by the way.  Well, they usually don't,  but there have been so many good ones.  Jerry Maguire, Cameron Crowell,  his commentaries are great, but there was a great,  the whole cast got together and Tom Cruise  and the director for Jerry Maguire.  And that one was really good.

Start time: 6605.16
End time: 6652.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He does, he does.  And I think he does actually,  as for some of his podcasts, he does some of those things.  I know Battlestar Galactica, a lot of the episodes there,  they did the commentaries as podcasts  and then released them on the DVDs.  But more directors need to do that.  I don't know.  I feel like we lose so much  when we get rid of some of these extras.  I'm not so concerned about the films that are out now.  I'm more concerned about when stuff goes out of print  and then you have,  I don't want to lose Coppola's commentary on Godfather 1.  Know what I mean?  I don't want to lose that time.  I don't want to lose some of this stuff  when these things go out of print and the rights are gone  and then they're just lost in the ether.  And we've got this historical moment,  which is so incredibly important  and it's such a great educational resource.  And then it's gone just because technology moved forward  and we didn't bother to bring over the extras.

Start time: 6697.64
End time: 6723.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Was to fill the space on DVDs.  And so what I thought was fascinating this week,  what I thought about as soon as you started talking  about DVD extras was AT&T is now doing  a big promotional special where if you sign up  for a new account, they'll double,  if you sign up for the 15 gigabytes per month plan,  they'll double it to 30 gigabytes.  Yeah.  And I'm going holy-

Start time: 6723.30
End time: 6725.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How much data you'll never use?  Holy crap.

Start time: 6726.00
End time: 6772.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who would use 30 gigabytes of data per month?  But if you are using that as your only source of data-  No, we'll charge you for that.  And all of a sudden, I mean, these guys aren't stupid.  Are they anticipating a world two years from now  where my measly two gigabytes of data a month that I use  suddenly becomes 20 and I have no choice  but to pay for their high price plans.  But the bottom line is that the movie producers  have always been Philistines.  And they do not care about the quality of the art.  They care about butts in the seats and tickets sold.

Transcript:  Bott has two T's.  And the Ed Bott report, ZDNet.com slash blog slash bot  is absolutely a must read if you want to keep up.  And we didn't mention this, but I think it's interesting.  Microsoft actually, you can sign up, anybody can sign up  and get the Windows 10 right now, the technical preview.  Yep.  Should they do that?  Is it, how reliable is it?  Does it short circuit your microphone  and make your ears bleed?

End time: 6911.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, you can use it.  It's a Windows.  It's very, very solid.  I would call it Windows 8.2.  Something like that.  It's very solid, missing a few little things,  and if you sign up for it,  the Insiders program they call it,  and you install it today,  you will get the updates installed automatically.  That's part of the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One interesting thing about it is that  this is finally a version of Windows post-Windows 7  that works well in a VM.  The Windows 8 interface with the corners you had to touch  to make things happen.  It's driving me crazy.  Oh, it was nuts in a VM,  because getting your mouse,  oh, damn it, I went into the parent operating system here.  But with this one, you click the start button  and there's the start menu,  and everything's in a window and everything has a menu.  And so for somebody who's coming from Windows 7,  it should be a very familiar experience.  Ironically, for people who have adapted  to Windows 8 and 8.1 and have learned the workflow  and raked all the shortcuts,  it's going to feel like two steps forward and one step back.

Set your user agent for Internet Explorer  and it'll let you download the ISO  and then you can install it on your VM.  Otherwise, if it recognizes that you're not  on a Windows machine, they won't let you download the ISO.  But if you change your user agent,  that's all you gotta do.
