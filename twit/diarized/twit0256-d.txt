This Week in Tech, the show that covers technology news.  We bring on some of the best minds in the tech community, the journalistic community to talk about the week's tech news.  And we have a great panel this week.  We have Joshua Tupolsky back.  He is the editor in chief of Engadget Magazine.  Hi Josh.  Good to have you back.  Good to be back.  Also with us, Mr. Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle.  We've been trying to get Dwight on all summer, but he's just got a busy schedule.  Traveling man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm back.  But I'm here.  I'm ready.  Let's party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's party.  Blogs.cron.com slash tech blog.  And lo and behold, longtime No-See Mr. Will Harris, who is rapidly coming up to be the, what is it?  The number two most often used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no, I've got a while to catch Patrick, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Will, we love having Will on.  He hasn't been on in a while from channelflip.com in the UK.  And you're on because this is Soccer Sunday all over the world.  Yeah, baby.  We won't give you any spoilers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're like Alec Baldwin on Saturday Night Live, right?  Steve Martin has the most hosts and then...  Alec Baldwin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Absolutely.  I'm trying my best.  Almost as good looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that hurts.  That's got to hurt.  Well, who can forget Alec Baldwin's Skype performance in It's Complicated?  It's burned into my brain, that's for sure.  You probably didn't see it.  It's a chick flick.  I got dragged there by my wife and then I had to see it again in Blu-ray.  Oh, wow.  He had to buy it and see it again in Blu-ray.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I had to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He is flirting with Meryl Streep.  They have a Skype call going on.  Or no, maybe Meryl Streep has a Skype call going on with Steve Martin.  And they're having a little thing, but her ex-husband Alec Baldwin decides to sneak into her bed naked.  Doesn't realize that Skype is there.  Steve Martin comes back to Skype.  He's left for a while.  And there's a big, fat, naked Alec Baldwin on Skype.  It's a great moment for Skype, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Big, fat, sexy naked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It makes you want to Skype.  Thank you, Liam.  Now I don't have to go see that film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spoiler alert!  Yeah, you're ruining the World Cup.  We will not say who won the World Cup, although somebody has won the World Cup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We will not, I promise, blow the vuvuzela anytime soon.  Or anytime in the show.  It was a team.  It was a European team.  So even though England didn't make it to the end, I think that there must be some happiness in the northern hemisphere.  In the northern hemisphere, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it was nice to have an all-European final.  That was nuts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you consider England... England's not in Europe, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, technically we are, yes.  You're in the EU.  We are a member of the European Union.  But geographically...  Something about the British kind of, you know, character that doesn't quite gel with the sort of European...  I don't know.  No galois.  Yeah, exactly.  It's just, you know, we're a little bit less refined, I think.  Is that it?  Than the rest of Europe.  We're a little bit more blunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But geographically, Leo, I think they are geographically part of Europe.  Are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I always thought that Europe was not everything but England.  And then there's the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, there's some people in England who'd be very happy with that.  But strictly speaking, yes, we are all Europeans here.  I don't know.  This is not what the show is all about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  God knows.  It's not?  It's not?  No.  One of the reasons I'm glad Joshua's here because one of the things this show has been about for the last few weeks is smartphones.  In fact, in many ways, technology talk these days is more about smartphones than it is about computers.  And it is about...  I mean, we don't talk about netbooks or PCs or desktops or laptops.  We talk about smartphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I get complaints on my blog.  That's where the innovation is happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  You get complaints?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I get complaints from kind of old school readers who say, you know, this is a tech blog.  You should be talking about Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We just got a complaint today like that.  We get those all the time.  But you're in Gadget.  In Gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gadget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  We're trying to cover Gadgets.  How dare we cover the hot new Gadget?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I always thought actually Gadget was kind of pejorative, kind of a diminutive phrase.  And I never liked doing, you know, whenever I do mainstream and I stopped doing that pretty much television,  they always wanted Gadgets.  We want to see Gadgets.  Like that was not as scary to people as talking or boring mostly as talking about a technology,  about computers, about the Internet was.  But Gadgets isn't really appropriate when you talk about a smartphone that has more power than your computer did five years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's you know, what was a Gadget something you might have because it's cool or fun to use or, you know, you're a complete nerd.  Now it's everybody has one and they're much more powerful.  So I mean, is it I don't I mean Gadget, I kind of I feel like it still applies.  I think there's something about a smartphone that is almost like the perfect.  It's the perfect Gadget.  You know, it is the ultimate Gadget.  I think that and I think that's why we cover them so much.  So I feel like it weirdly works really well with when it comes to smartphones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you have to think about, you know, when you look back to what our sort of, you know, early mid late 90s definitions of Gadgets were, you know, the sort of James Bond stuff.  And smartphones really are that.  They are, aren't they?  You know, video conferencing everywhere.  You know, it's the equivalent of the old, you know, the, you know, the video screen on your watch or whatever, where you're talking to somebody, you know, who can say that FaceTime isn't exactly that.  Right. You know, knowing exactly where you are at any point in the world, you know, and how to get to anywhere else.  The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, you know, it is the book.  And that's all it needs is a button that says, don't panic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you said, I don't have a panic right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does it on your I think we're at the point with Gadgets or smartphones that we were with PCs, say, in the late 90s and that the best is yet to come.  And that these are you're in that same growth period that happened when when Windows was, you know, about to be on every desktop.  The Mac was dying, unfortunately, at the time.  And I think that it is a that that what we're going to see in the next 10 years is just going to blow our minds compared to what we have right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to agree. I have to say, I think that the innovation we're seeing in the mobile space right now is just unbelievable.  I mean, it's unbridled. You know, it's like the brakes have been taken off and we have this whole new space to explore this entirely new platform, really, where you can do a lot of things you could never do with a computer.  And the I think the reason why we cover it so much and the reason why we're talking about it so much is that the amount of technological innovation that's happening in the smartphone space is unparalleled, except maybe when you look at the the PC race, when it really got going, when people really started figuring out how to get to the end of the world.  I think it's there's some big ones, you know, PCs, Internet, and I think this mobile space, the mobile Internet, smart devices is just barely tapped at this point.  Let me get a little philosophical on you. Do you think the rate of innovation is constant?  In other words, the human condition is such that we will innovate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what happens is our attention shifts from platform to platform.  So the now that the PC platform is mature, and really we've seen it both Windows 7 and OS 10 Snow Leopard, there's not a lot you can do new, you know, all of the both of these were refinements of an existing OS.  Maybe our attention is now shifting to a platform where there is more scope for innovation.  Do you think that that's the case that it's just kind of a constant?  We just are looking for an outlet. And this is what the smartphone is looking for.  Well, I think there's a degree to which the innovation has been driven by hardware or the lack of hardware innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, the sort of PC massive race that we talked to, you know, just talking about was when, you know, Intel was constantly making new chips.  The gigahertz were going from 200 megahertz to one gigahertz to two gigahertz to three gigahertz to beyond to multicores, dual core, all these kind of things.  And that's kind of tapered off now. You know, we haven't seen a processor ever hit four gigahertz commercially.  We won't get to four. We're done.  So what we've seen now is that all the innovation in the hardware is now moving into the mobile space.  Things like the A4 chip, which suddenly allow you to start really accelerating that pace of change in the mobile space as well.  And so I think although there's definitely an element of, you know, we're sort of choosing to move between spaces, I think that's the thing that's really been a big part of the innovation.  Of, you know, we're sort of choosing to move between spaces.  I think there's a good degree of, you know, it's dictated by what the hardware guys can actually make happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The traditional conventional wisdom is that hardware outpaces software so that you get a lot of innovation in hardware and then software is kind of slow to catch up and take advantage of it.  Are we in that? Do you think we're in that situation now with smartphones that the hardware is outpacing what the software is capable of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would say definitely with one exception, and that is that because Apple is controlling both the hardware and the software, I think that maybe within that space and on that particular platform, you know, you may have a neck and neck situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But yeah, but you can see like the Retina display. I mean, as good as it is, when I look at stuff on my iPhone 4, very few apps are yet taking advantage of the Retina display.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it just, it just, they just released it. You got to give them time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm in a hurry. Come on now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I, you know, I think you touched on...  At what point do you say, at what point do you say hardware is ahead of it? I mean, you're already starting to see apps that do take advantage of the better display.  The reading apps look much better for those that have done it. It's not that hard to do. The libraries are in the software development kit that Apple releases.  So on Android, I think you have more of an opportunity to kind of have catch up for the software because it's almost all independent. Google gives you the libraries. It gives you the design.  But ultimately, it's going to be up to the developers to see if they can make the potential of it. I think Apple delivers more of the potential faster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think that, but this touches on something that is, has been an issue in the desktop and laptop space, which is a real lack of innovation in that software.  I mean, you, it seems like people hit a point and they said, this is what a, this is what a desktop environment is going to be like. And we're good with this. Let's not innovate anymore.  You have to think about OS 10. It's built on Unix. You know, Windows has been Windows for ages and you've got Linux and Linux is built on Unix really as well.  I mean, it's very similar concept. So you've got two of the big ones built on the basically the same thing. You've got Windows, which hasn't changed and arguably hasn't changed drastically in, you know, 15 years or 10 years.  So there's not a lot of innovation happening. And I don't know if that's just because people have become comfortable with what's available or there aren't any good ideas out there.  But what's interesting is you're starting to see the mobile space sort of loop back around and impact the desktop and laptop space.  So we're getting used to all this touch input, all this gesture based stuff, and that's starting to creep into how we interact with our laptops and our desktops.  And I think that'll hopefully spur some of that some of that innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't be surprised if you don't see in the next version of the Mac OS that it looks a lot like the iOS based off the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are rumors that Apple may even abandon OS 10 and kind of start doing an iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's probably at least one more release of OS 10 out there.  I have to admit that I keep touching my screen on my laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've now become I've come to the expectation that I can manipulate it with my bare hands.  But you know what? That is not the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not comfortable. That's not comfortable to reach out and do this on a desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not. But on a laptop, it's a little more intimate. I could do that on a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's still if you if you use the iPad in the dock or with the wireless, the Bluetooth keyboard and it's in the case.  And when you have to do something on the screen that you would normally do with a mouse, you want to reach for a mouse touch it.  Yeah. Right. That's kind of weird. It's kind of irritating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's kind of weird. But that's what I'm saying, Dwight.  I think that that's because we're dinosaurs. We're used to the mouse and keyboard.  I think if a generation grows up with touch screen devices, whether it's the iPad or something else, they're going to get used to that.  That's going to I think that in many ways may be the form factor of the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think non dinosaurs on the panel think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's just you and me, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I actually think the iPad doesn't go far enough.  I mean, I was pretty disappointed and I remain sort of underwhelmed by what Apple did in the iPad OS.  I think, you know, it's it's basically iOS through and through.  There's nothing that really feels like it's made for the iPad in that version of iOS.  So I think that Apple could go further.  And I think that, you know, what you're saying about it, you know, is the is the tablet going to be what the laptop becomes?  You know, I think it probably will be.  They just have to come up with a much more intuitive and comfortable way to use it.  I mean, I think the iPad is OK, but I don't think you can just slap the iPhone OS on a larger tablet and make it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think we'll have all of them all of the above? You have a touch screen. You'll have a mouse.  I mean, that's there are some PCs with that form factor. You'll have a trackpad.  You'll have one of those nipple devices on the keyboard. You'll have a head mounted sensor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the nipples are well gone now.  I hope so. Let's hope so.  Surely it's time to ditch the nipple.  You'll have Microsoft Connect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think Microsoft is implying that Connect will make it into Windows 8.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They talked about using sort of motion.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My sense from that slide, that leaked slide of Windows 8 is that it would have all of the above.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Microsoft, they always have lofty goals.  They have a huge R&D department.  I mean, you'd be blown away by the stuff they're working on.  And how much do you actually make it in?  Right, like the courier. Remember how awesome that looked?  And they work on stuff like that 24 hours a day.  And then you see...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, even the file system. Do you remember the sort of debacle of the file system for Windows Vista?  Longhorn. They were going to do this Longhorn WinFS.  They had a lexical system that they did the whole thing and then they just canned it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And now they're talking about Windows 8 and there's no mention at all of any change in the file system.  Still NTFS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they've got the cloud... what is their cloud...  Azure.  Azure.  That's right. Azure. That's right.  And is that going to be tied into 8 or is that just an experiment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who the hell knows what that is?  It's going to be tied to Ray Ozzie's ankle for the rest of his life is what it's going to be.  But I mean, interesting...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I could see easily if...  We talked about the idea of it not being comfortable reaching up and touching your screen.  But if you were reading on a notebook computer or on a desktop and you want to turn the page and you just do this in the air...  That's natural.  That's really... that's very natural.  Or to do like this and not have to reach up, that's... I think that that... I would like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's talk about one of the forces that's going to impede all of this and we really got to do something about which is patents.  And there are two patents that were in the news this week that really do impact that.  One is Microsoft says we're going to apply for a patent for the page curl.  The turn where you see the page and you see the back of the page and you see the front of the next page as it turns over.  First of all, let's get rid of that please.  But apparently Microsoft thinks it's important enough to patent it.  Is this... I mean, I guess why not patent it?  Do you think the page turn has much life in it?  Do you guys like it?  I turn it off immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do like the page turn. I think it's a...  You know, I found that when I started using iBooks, I realized I did something with books that I wasn't even aware of,  which is when I'm reading, I'll kind of curl the edge of the page while I'm reading.  This is a weird little tick.  And I noticed myself doing it a little bit when I read in iBooks, which is maybe disturbing or weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you mean? You actually... you like hold your finger in the corner and kind of slowly...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just kind of run my fingers along the pages on the side, you know, and I'm usually shirtless.  That's the image of that.  Okay, TMI.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very sexy stuff.  Thank God it doesn't have a camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, not yet.  But I think it adds a little... I think we need some of that humanness in the design.  I think Apple understands that better than almost anybody.  Let's add the thing that maybe is superfluous, but also makes it feel a little bit more human and tangible and real.  So I like the page turn. Is it patentable? That to me doesn't seem... that doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could patent the process involved in making it happen in software.  Yeah, the code.  The code is patentable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's so much... there's surely so much prior art.  I don't know what...  In terms of other people have done this before, haven't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I'm sure that Hypercard probably had it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does seem like it's a little late in the game for patenting the page turn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's two things you could do on the iPad with. I don't know how well this will show up, but you could do the page turn like this.  Or you could also, if you don't want the page turn, you could just tap it.  Right.  No, you still got a page turn there.  You still have kind of a look to it.  And this is the Kindle app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See, I turned that off. There's a basic page turn in the Kindle. You could turn on the settings that just... you tap it and it slides. You don't get that... thing.  I turned that off.  You hate the page turn.  I don't hate it, but it's like, why waste the time?  I know I'm turning the page.  You're so busy. You're like, I can't wait for the page turn.  There's no physical... what do we...  You know, I always... I actually think that I understand why initially when new technologies come along, you make them look like the analog world.  But at some point, that is kind of a little concrete and you could probably let go of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it feels to me like Apple is...  It's like having a mouse pointer look like a hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember in the early days of the mouse, it was a hand.  Like that made you feel better.  It still is. You can click a link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's still in browsers.  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it seems to me like Apple is just trying to make this stuff more accessible.  Right. They're just trying to make it more familiar and less like it's this scary digital thing and more like it's an experience you can relate to.  It's like the whole desktop metaphor. We could have left the desktop metaphor a long time ago.  Yeah, we did though, haven't we?  Yeah, they're probably...  But we haven't because it's familiar.  It's probably holding us back though. There's probably a better way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People like it familiar.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But books have... I mean, come on, they've been around a while. Books have really made their mark, don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's the negative. But by being bound to this notion that what you have is a stack of dead tree material that you're turning,  it binds you to a concept of serial data that isn't required by the form.  And so I think it limits the form and it means...  Some forms need limit.  So, Leo, what would you like?  How would you like?  Well, I don't know. I mean, I have to get out of that mindset too. I'm also in that box.  But I'm thinking, for instance, I'm sure you'll see this, that books no longer are static text on a physical page.  For instance, why do we turn a page at all? Why don't I just scroll up? Why do I need a page?  Why does this page have anything to do with anything? It was because we couldn't make an infinite scroll of paper.  So get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, when you look at on a web page and a long, long, long scroll, people don't like that.  That's true. They want a page.  They want a break.  No, you're right.  And I think there's a mental break that you have to make with the page.  And also Apple is about making things comfortable, warm and fuzzy.  You know, there's that one of the slides that they've done.  They did this both at the iPhone 4 announcement and the iPad announcement.  The intersection of liberal arts and technology.  Yeah, I actually like that.  That exactly speaks to that.  They love that sign.  But I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I made sense.  I think some forms need limitations.  I think that they don't necessarily. You shouldn't say, well, let's just blow apart the concept of a book.  You know, look, why do I need words in a book? Why can't it just be a sound or something?  Well, it might be.  I think that, well, yeah, but I think that, you know, you get people who say, well, every word should hotlink out to something else.  And there should be all sorts of contextual stuff going on.  And there is something that is valuable in the isolated, straightforward experience of book reading.  So the page turning, you know, things separated by pages and that even that animation, which ties into it, isn't necessarily a I don't think it's necessarily evil or it should be should be exercised.  You know, I think that I think there's some value to the isolated, straightforward experience of reading a book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Another another pat applied for by Amazon could hurt Barnes and Noble.  It's the patent and could have hurt the courier.  Maybe this is why Microsoft killed the courier.  It was a patent on dual screen technology.  What what exactly, Dwight, was it that they were claiming they're looking at right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The nook has this has two screens on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The nook is which is which is, by the way, it's chief advantage as a color strip running Android, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, yes, right.  And it's running Android.  And it's the maybe an advantage depending on on what you think of the performance, which is not necessarily zippy.  No, but essentially you you control page turns and you control other things by touching the screen down below the screen up above is like the Kindle.  It's a static or non touch screen e ink display.  And so if you have if you have the ability to kind of control it down here, the theory is it's a little more friendly.  I don't know. I haven't read the details of the exactly the details of the Microsoft patent.  But obviously, you know, they could come to they could come to Barnes and Noble and say, hey, you know, there's there's two patents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a there's a Microsoft dual display patent that they filed.  We reported on June 30th and then Amazon was granted a patent for a dual screen ebook reader.  So I don't know if there's any interplay there. I don't think there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder if this was the reason the courier was killed, because that's exactly what courier was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I don't think Mike. I think if the courier was killed because Microsoft couldn't get it together.  I don't think they weren't like, hey, Amazon might do.  Oh, my God.  I think that it was that was purely that was 100 percent Microsoft if they killed the courier.  But, you know, these dual display devices, I mean, actually the nook, you know, you mentioned the performance.  I noticed with the update, the performance is a lot better.  But I still think it's sort of a failed experience to have that little display down below and then the display up top.  And we've seen other devices, the the edge, something called the Entourage Edge, which has two screens.  One is LCD and one is E Ink. Also kind of an uneven experience.  I think like anything, what really makes this stuff work is a great user interface and a great user experience.  And a lot of these companies forget in the excitement of, hey, we can put two screens on this thing.  They forget we also need to make an experience for the user really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there that's all there is to say about that.  Everybody's just like, I did not know you said the definitive final word is the final word.  There was nothing more to say. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually, I have one question for Joshua to beat this dead horse.  Have you played with the Sony touchscreen reader?  I haven't played with that. What is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know I haven't. I have not played around with it.  I did play with the what is this? The the Q reader, which is the it's not out yet, but it has a touchscreen overlaid.  Very expensive. Yeah. The plastic logic.  It's great. It's just very I mean, the UI is actually really beautiful and it's elegant.  It's just, you know, the response time of E Ink is painful to to experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Bing search shares up seven percent in June.  Google down one percent now one percent doesn't sound like much, but I was told at one point, I think Jason Callaghan has told me that one percent of search is worth like a billion dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it's a significant shift.  If you have a 90 billion dollars, you probably won't miss one.  One. What's one? You have 99 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I can work out is if Google lost one, a Microsoft gained seven, we lost six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Alta Vista, Alta Vista, Ask.com. I don't know. Ask Jeeves. Ask Jeeves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I wish we had more search competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're right. We need it. And I think we're going to add lately.  We're going to see it because I think that the I think Google knows this very well, that the idea of searching an index of pages is not what people want is is is rapidly becoming obvious, which is why Google's adding real time search, why they bought this.  What is it? I.A.T. the airline guide because people don't just want search.  This is why I think why Bing might be gaining some traction.  The whole premise of Bing was, hey, it's not just search will help you buy tickets, will help you find the right flight.  And Google's now started to say, yeah, if you do a Google search where you say I have seven hours and a thousand dollars to spend, where can I go?  We'll be able to give you the answer now. Like somebody would actually search for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know who would want that.  Seven hours, a thousand dollars. Where am I going?  Tell me where to go, Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But isn't it true we're getting past the kind of search that Google is so good at to something else? I don't know what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a lot of people who are saying that, you know, the idea of search being trawling lots of information that you have kind of no stake in or no interested in.  That's what those crazy is kind of done.  Have you seen the new search is effectively recommendation?  I mean, if you want to search for a great restaurant to go to dinner, do you want to search Google or do you want to ask all your friends on Facebook?  Have you seen it?  We probably haven't seen these in Britain, these Microsoft Bing commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you seen those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the decision thing where all the people go crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're crazy. It's they call it search overload syndrome.  And they grab you because they're so bizarre.  At first, here, I'll play one of them just to give you since you're stuck in the great in the great UK where you can't see these fine commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think these do really need to find a new place for breakfast.  The Breakfast Club in 1986 called Classic starring members of the Brat Pack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So do you want an LCD or plasma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Plasma is an ionized gas.  Next time we got to find cheaper tickets.  Cheap skates. Cheap thrills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm having this backpack.  Backpacking back to school. Johan Sebastian back.  Seriously, we need a new place to eat.  Let me eat my dog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These people seem like Stepford wives.  They seem so strange.  They're the Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Google is turning us all into infused robots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Robots, artificial intelligence machines.  I am robot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you think you don't you feel like Google search has gotten?  I mean, there's so much noise.  What's wrong with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's too much noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's so much noise on the internet.  Here's what the internet has now become.  Right. It just feels like to me when I search for something, it isn't like, hey, I went and found this thing that I needed.  It's let me sift through this enormous amount of noise to try to find the one piece of usable data that I really wanted to get at.  I'm really I mean, I feel like the state of search.  The whole this whole SEO race has destroyed our ability to find and use real information.  I think that we have a flood of scraper sites, a flood of associated contents with, you know, millions of articles.  I mean, the other day I was looking for something.  I found an article that was a review of deodorant.  It was literally a thousand word human.  So a human being wrote a review of a four dollar tube of men's deodorant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what were you searching for, Joshua?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was searching for deodorant reviews.  I was searching for alcohol for deodorant or something.  But, you know, but the fact of the matter is.  Wait a minute, though, Joshua.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the strength of the internet.  If you happen to be looking for a review of deodorant, somebody's written it.  I was saying I wasn't actually looking for a review of deodorant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was looking for something else.  I just happened to cross this thing and I said, I got to see this.  It was like, Jovan must deodorant review.  That was probably demand media, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was associated content.  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the company Yahoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the whole the whole this desire for everybody to make money off of search results has really polluted our search results.  It really is just has it's another way to spam people.  You know, if you don't get the spam email for Viagra, you get the spam search results for Viagra.  So it's like, I don't know, I think there's a real problem.  I'm not saying Bing solves the problem.  They may just be adding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think this is why Facebook has attributed to it so much value because the potential is that you can get all the information that you want.  You know, you can get your deodorant reviews, but you can get it from trusted sources within your social network.  You don't have to go outside of that network to people that you don't know or don't want to know or to spammers to get that kind of thing.  I mean, that's why ultimately people think Facebook is or why Google is so worried about Facebook.  Because as you know, as Facebook gets bigger and as your social circle gets bigger, you know, potentially there's no 90 percent of questions that you're going to want to know can be answered by someone in your social network without having to ever go to Google potentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you know, we had Nicholas Negroponte on the end gadget show and he had written previously about 15 years ago about this, this system of looking at news and you would have a little slider that you'd be able to go to the left and to the right.  Depending on what news you were going to see, if it was conservative or liberal, you would literally slide this thing.  And I said, who's going to be the editor of that? Who would be the person in control?  The arbiter. Yeah.  Yeah. And he said, now this is exactly what we're talking about. Now that person is your friends, your circle of trusted people who you're getting, you know, you're being able to sift through their picks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's very powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it is as well. I mean, it's certainly better than a robot. I think an algorithm can't figure everything out.  You know, an algorithm, you have to get to a point where you say, it's like, didn't we just hear about Google News starting to use human editors to sort through?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was tech tech meme that changed to a human editor.  Well, Google News is doing it too.  Are they really? Yeah.  That's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I think what people are finding out is that when it comes to things that are really important, like medical information or news or things where you really need to get or even less important, like a restaurant review or something, you now there's so much out there, so much content.  It isn't enough to just say, well, it'll all the good stuff will bubble to the top.  The bad stuff will bubble down to the bottom because you can game it.  You know, if you can game it, then you end up with bad information.  You end up with skewed results.  And so we the human being is really that barrier between the game and the person on the receiving end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what people like Matt cuts who works at Google fighting spam.  That's exactly Google has many, many people working on exactly that trying to to see what people define as spam is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Josh is saying, you know, this this sort of really kind of cruddy content from sort of content machines like associated content is basically the modern equivalent of all the search equivalent of spam.  And, you know, for Google, that's kind of a legitimate business that feeds money back to them via AdWords.  So as you know, who defines what spam is in that sense?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's so OK. That's why your social graph is so useful here, because your friends presumably know what spam is.  That's why I think Kevin's doing dig for.  I think that's the whole idea of dig for is you find the news that your friends tell you about.  He's a little late to the game, though.  This is why people love Twitter, isn't it?  And and I guess why they pay attention to Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is also why Google is is reportedly working on its own social network that will obviously incorporate its own search.  And, you know, once you apply Google search, which is very, you know, works well when it finds what you what you're really looking for to a social network like it, that it would run itself with your trusted sources.  That could be pretty powerful.  And I think Facebook probably should be a little nervous about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to go ahead, Joshua, just in a second, we're going to take a break.  So go ahead. Final words on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just say that we know we seem to have decided actually, I don't know who decided this, that making money off of ads was the only way to to make the Internet profitable for businesses.  And we have just sort of locked into that idea.  You know, Jaron Lanier wrote a book called You Are Not a Gadget, which touches on this quite a bit.  I don't know if you've read it.  But the idea that we are just have decided advertising is the only way to make money off of our content online.  And of course, I speak as a person who makes money off of advertising.  That's what Engadget does.  But I think it's we need to explore some of those other ideas about ways you can, you know, because you don't want to get into that cycle of of of spam, basically, because it's easy to gain that ad system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to take a break and come back with more.  Actually, Google has made a move, apparently, that is going to help it with this imaginary Facebook clone by going directly to one of Facebook's biggest contributors and investing in it.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  Before we do, though, I want to mention our friends at Citrix, the creators of the great GoToAssist and GoToAssist Express.  GoToAssist Express is something that we started using in this, let's see, I guess, 10 years ago almost on the screensavers to help people with their computer problems.  We'd be able to get into their computers and fix it.  Well, it's better and easier and more effective than ever before.  Faster, too.  The new GoToAssist Express.  You could try it free at gotoassist.com slash twit.  Here's the idea.  You know, whether it's a family member or you're in an IT department, you've got to support your users or maybe you have some software you support.  You got somebody with a problem.  They're across country.  They're around the world.  Maybe they're just even down the hall, but you don't want to get up from your desk.  You want to solve the problem not on the phone, but by reaching into their computer and fixing it.  That's what GoToAssist Express is so good at.  They don't even have to have the software installed.  Just tell them go to GoToAssist Express.  Here's the code and they enter it in.  20 seconds later, you're in their system fixing it or you can send them a link.  But the first step is for you to install it free for 30 days.  Go to assist.com slash twit.  Up to eight sessions at once.  Sessions can be unattended if your users let you do that.  You get a complete assay of what software is running on their system, security software, operating systems, background software.  You can drag and drop files from one computer, your computer to theirs.  So if you've got a patch or install, you can just move it over.  And that's where those eight systems, eight sessions at once really come in handy because you've got an install going on one.  You don't have to sit around waiting, playing Doom.  Does anybody still play Doom?  No.  No.  Only our sys admin.  You can go to the second one or the third one or the fourth one.  Up to eight sessions at the same time.  I use it with my family. It's so great.  They do have day passes if you don't do assist support all the time.  But if you are a regular support professional, you're going to want to get the monthly.  Very, very effective, very affordable.  128 bit encrypted so they can use it in an open access spot without fear.  24 seven support for you.  Go to assist dot com slash twit.  Give it a try.  Absolutely free for 30 days.  It's just fantastic.  So TechCrunch had this story.  And, you know, I always a little suspicious when I first see TechCrunch.  But then the venture beat confirmed it that Google has put one hundred million dollars into Zynga.  The creators of Farmville and Mafia Wars.  Zynga's apparently raised half a billion this year, which sounds like a lot until you realize they're well on their way to making a billion dollars a year.  Selling bits to people who are farming in big air quotes on their Facebook page.  I guess it's a good investment. It wasn't the venture arm, though.  It was Google itself that put one hundred million into Zynga.  I guess it's a good investment, but it does sound like they're preparing the launch of Google Me.  And in fact, this rumor may even be that they're and this is this is what Gamesbeat said that they're going to do a Google Games as part of this new social platform.  Does that make sense, Dwight?  Dwight, I can't hear a thing you're saying.  Unmute your theft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you I think it does, if you have a if you have a if you look at how addictive all these games are, everything from Farmville and the various games that are on Facebook, Mafia Wars, Mafia Wars, all this.  I think that casual gaming as much as this is more than casual gaming, this is virtual goods, virtual goods and and really addictive gameplay.  Yeah. And I don't think it has to be virtual goods.  My my wife is a serious words with friends at it.  Me too. I got seven games going now.  Right. Right. And she you know, what what was funny was we would go out to dinner and she'd, you know, give me grief for looking at my email.  And now I get to give her grief for playing versus playing Scrabble.  But the addictive nature of this, you can Google has already said that.  And to get back to our first discussion of the of the night, Google has already said that everything is going to be mobile first.  And so I would not be surprised if you don't see this launch with a mobile platform as well as that platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I was going to say this seems like it would tie into I mean, potentially, if there is this Google Games thing, there's going to be if Chrome OS exists eventually, which they say it's going to, there's going to be an application store for it.  Or in their case, it's not really an application store because everything is web based.  So it's like something like Farmville makes perfect sense because it is online.  You know, it's something you play inside of a browser for the most part.  I just understand where people are finding all that. Maybe it's just me.  Who has time to play these games? There's so many people playing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's the strength of it, Joshua. It takes a second here or there.  It's not like you're playing a very long, elaborate game.  If you've got to get the seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're working too hard. Stop working so hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you can always you know, there's always a time when you're sitting waiting for a phone call or you're in line somewhere where you can play a quick game of Scrabble, you know, not game, quick move in Scrabble.  You know, I mean, you're sitting here, you're looking at your board and you say, oh, I got to make a move.  And I think these are very compelling. I play a number of these casual games and there's something about playing it socially that really makes it fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My question about people keep saying Google me. That's what their social service is going to be called the social network.  Supposedly. Yeah. What about Orkut? What happened to that?  Have you used Orkut? It's still part of their offerings. I'm just saying.  I tried. It's big in Brazil. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I quit Facebook, I said, everybody, let's go to Orkut. And I went there and I went, oh, never mind.  Yeah, it's just not a great experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other thing to keep in mind is that Apple has announced as part of iOS 4.  It hadn't shown up yet. This gaming central feature that will let you find other players online.  I suspect that Google that Google is so intensely competitive with Apple right now that may be a part of this as well.  Here's what it would allow them to do that on Android so that it stays competitive with iOS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is making me this is depressing me. Just looking at this. Yeah, this is my Orkut page.  What do you update? Is this you updating your status? Yeah, there's my status. Look at that.  There's the wall. Wow. You know, it doesn't look buzz.  It's like looking at this is the beta for Google me. Yeah, my I mean, you use Leo. You're a buzz user, right?  I love buzz. Yeah. I mean, buzz is to me is isn't that a failed Google experiment?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I disagree. I don't think so. I mean, what is what is first of all, what does Google need for it to be a success?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These people need to use it more than Twitter. That's not going to happen. Or instead of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think I think that's the question. Does Google me have to be used more than Facebook to succeed? No.  I think it just does Google Docs have to be Microsoft Office to succeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Surely the point of Google me is exactly that it needs to be not necessarily more popular, but the default social platform in order.  You know, if we all sort of agree that search is going more social and social recommendation than for Google to stay the leader in search, it needs to be become the leader in social.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's a tough road to hoe. I agree with that. I think if you're going to make a play for that space, if you're going to go to say we're going to start a social networking service, I don't think you're doing it to be complementary to Facebook.  I mean, I highly doubt it if it's I mean, Google has to go all in and get that demographic over to their service because it's easier. It's more integrated. It's it's more fun.  I don't know. But I think that if you get a you have to play to win in that space, I don't see any other way to do you know, just like a light social networking light for Google doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you make of the reports that Eric Schmidt and Mark Zuckerberg had a little private tete a tete at the Allen and Co. Was that before or after Mark was served?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Two really awkward people. Yeah, really. I would love to see the body language analysis of that one.  Yeah, I don't know. What were they supposed to have spoken about? Just like Eric was like, I'm going to take you down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you know, I've been to the Bohemian Grove. When you get people. Yeah, when you get these big shots together, they just talk about BS. How's the wife? How's the kids? You know, they don't. What are they going to say? And they're and they'll dance around the fact but they're in there. You know, they they don't compete face to face. They're not competing face. They're not going.  Do you really think that that at the the fabled Steve Jobs, Eric Schmidt, Starbucks meeting that they talked about the wife and kids, they didn't talk about nothing. That was a that was a photo op photo. I was a total PR move. I don't think that's true. Of course it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. They were casually. They just went out to their regular coffee place. Sat in public, waited for people to show up, get some pictures, then went back inside. What does job? What did he say? They're going to see it anyway, so they might as well. So really mysterious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, which by the way still makes no sense. Yeah, or maybe it does. We don't have any proof that that was staged though, do we? No, but I think it was pretty clearly staged. Don't you think it's just a weird why? Why? Yeah, right. Do you know why they stay? Yes, I'll tell you why. Because there's been all of this ink going on about how Apple and Google are at loggerheads and that's not good for either company internally to start thinking there's this rivalry. We got to get Apple. We got to get Google.  We got to get Google.  Work for Microsoft and Lotus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, no, with that, I mean, you know, the whole rivalry, the Apple, you know, the Apple-Microsoft rivalry was effective in, for both of them actually when you think about it and really you see Apple kind of reaping the benefits of that fanaticism now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a certain amount of that is good and clearly Steve thought so too because when he spoke to that all hands meeting, he, you know, he did kind of rev up the rhetoric. I think what happened was right after that he thought, and it's getting a little out of hand. Let's look a little more collegial. Eric used to be on our board. We do still use a lot of Google stuff on our phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What about the Bing move? That's a that's a that's a gauntlet thrown down there, if you ask me.  Well, did it happen? I mean, is it? Yeah, Bing is on the is in it's an option. It's not the default. If it were though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But when you go to Bing, when you go to Bing on the iPhone, and this happens on Yahoo as well, when you go to being on the iPhone and you do a search there when you when you complete the search, it says, do you want to make Bing your default on the iPhone? Yahoo's been doing that for a while, but this is the first time that Bing has done that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, the fact that it's on there at all. I mean, this is Microsoft we're talking about. And this is the enemy, right? I mean, if there's an enemy here, really, I know they've collaborated and blah, blah, their buddies.  And, you know, but the truth is, if you think Steve Jobs is psyched about Microsoft, you know, you're crazy. So I think it's interesting that they put being on there that they they went that far. I mean, it's not essential being as an essential to the life of the Internet right now.  But Jobs thought there was some good reason. I feel like that was a sign that was a signal to kind of a say no to Google to say, you know, look, we don't need you. I mean, we we could move away from you. Just keep in mind. There are other things out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. It wasn't like iPhone users were saying, oh my God, I got to have Bing on my iPhone.  Yeah, definitely not. Businesses and nations need enemies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't know. Yes, that's true. But we don't really know. It may be that Microsoft said, well, we'll give you a check for $500 million if you put it on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, Steve Jobs needs the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think Steve's the kind of guy that's going to walk away from money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much cash do they have on hand? It's something ridiculous.  30 or 40 billion or something like that.  They just need to buy a few other companies in cash. That's no problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. So is Google really going to do a Google me? And do they have a shot at taking on Facebook?  Is it going to be done wave style? Okay, waves of flop. I think we can all agree that I think buzz has.  You know, here's the thing. I think Google has some aces up its sleeve that it hasn't played yet that aren't going to be much use much longer.  So they're going to have to play them pretty soon. They have to do with search.  For instance, Google me will be clearly tied to Google profiles as buzz is tied to Gmail.  I think you can tie them all together if you use your search kind of creatively.  For instance, if you make sure that if you search for Joshua Topolski, what shows up at the top of the search is his buzz profile.  By the way, profiles of buzz are the same tab of one page.  And then maybe there's a meat tab. If that's the first thing you find when you search for Joshua Topolski, doesn't that suddenly become a very powerful platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What if Joshua Topolski, who is your friend, has already searched for something similar, found what he's looking for and favorited those and then you come back?  That's built in. They already do have that feature.  Right. Right. So the other thing, you know, the thing about buzz is buzz is a new friend feed.  It looks like friend feed. It acts like friend feed, which ironically was bought by Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. And by the way, I use it instead of friend feed now to do the same things I was doing with friend feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I really think and somebody record this, put it on the Internet.  It's being recorded. I hope so.  That this is a mobile play and that Facebook has, you know, limited does limited stuff with mobile.  Google is going to do a serious mobile social network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The failure is the only thing really that buzz is the reason you would say buzz is a failure right now is because they were slow to come out with a third party API.  It's still fairly new. So remember, it took Twitter a year before anybody even heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's there's an intrinsic problem with buzz that they right out of the gate.  I really wish had not occurred. I mean, which is the connection to your Gmail account.  I mean, first off, I made a mistake there. My main email. I use a hosted Gmail account.  So I don't automatically don't have buzz in the place where I really live in terms of email.  Second, it is attached to a profile that I don't want it to be attached to.  It's part of a system that I don't want it to be a part of. Now, if Google me existed and you said Google me and buzz or companion products, they live together, but they don't live inside your email.  They don't live in your analytics or whatever other Google services you're using. Fine.  I think their biggest mistake here was not saying this is a standalone product. We're going to use our resources.  You can connect it to your email account if you want, but it's a standalone product. You can have a separate account here.  I mean, one of the big things that Google is doing now that I find rather annoying is the desire to connect each part of your Google experience with the same account.  So now when I log into YouTube, for instance, it wants me to connect YouTube to my Gmail account to another account so that I can log in with that.  And that is necessary. Not necessarily something that I want or need to do.  And I feel like the idea of the unified login, the one login for everything is not only dangerous, but it's actually a little bit annoying when it comes to separating the different parts of your life.  I may want to use it to personal projects. I don't want it to be connected to my work email.  I may want to use buzz for talking to my friends and I don't want that connected to my work email.  I mean, there's just I think there's a lot of problems with their premise. The idea that you want these things to live together, the buzz living inside of my inbox is not going to be connected to my work email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's really interesting because I think what they're trying to do in that sense is build what I feel is kind of like the 70% use case scenario where probably you are in a sort of 30% band where you're sort of hardcore power users.  You've got a hosted Gmail thing, your own Gmail thing. You've got different profiles. You're probably uploading stuff to multiple YouTube accounts, all this kind of thing.  And the unified login is a nightmare because actually for you to be able to distinguish all these separate parts of your online life is really crucial.  For most people, the ability to just sign into anything using the same Gmail or Facebook account, whether it's Amazon or Netflix or anything like that,  a unified login would just be like a massive hassle saver. And so I think what Google is trying to do is build sort of a...  It carries NASA security risk.  Well, yeah. It's trying to build a...  I mean, the single login...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a tough position for Google because they do they want to leverage what they've got. But you're right, that's Joshua, that's going to piss off people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, don't get me wrong. I like the idea of being able to log in in a lot of places with one thing. I'm not saying that the premise of that is a bad idea. I'm saying I wasn't given a choice when it came to buzz.  Because if I could log in...  I think you're right. I think they made a mistake.  I think they made a mistake.  Yeah, they made a mistake.  Just give me the choice and then I'll decide after.  You know, it's like, I think Steve talked about this at D8 and obviously it was a big conversation there about the opt in or opt out.  It's like, don't make it opt out. Make it opt in. Give me the power to start with and then go from there.  I think it's frustrating when you have a company like Google, which has so much access to so much of your personal information.  And I'm not a big paranoid guy. I'm not worried about what they have access to for the most part. I don't think they really are going to abuse it.  Because look, their motto is don't be evil. So how could they possibly be evil?  I just think... But I think that you've got to give people the choice first and then let them make the decision.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think they have learned lessons that they'll apply to Google Me or is the temptation to use kind of the expansive nature of what they've got already such that they will make that same mistake again?  I mean, it's very tempting to pull together everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a real mess. I mean, they really got some flack for what they did with Buzz.  They have to have gotten it that this is not the right way to proceed.  With Google, it's weird. I feel like a lot of times the stuff they do isn't because they're trying to be evil or malicious.  It's because they have this mentality where they say, let's just do it. Let's try this out. This seems like a good idea. We'll see if it works or not.  Everything's very beta. It's a beta mentality. They're sort of tweaking and changing and experimenting.  They probably thought they made this decision fairly... in a fairly arbitrary way.  Somebody probably said, hey, this makes sense to me. Let's do it like that. And a few other people said, okay, we agree.  I'm not sure that they had a... maybe they had a strategy.  But somebody... I feel like if somebody had known this was a potential, that the backlash would be so strong, they wouldn't have done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I sort of feel like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe. But we assume they're perfect. They're not perfect. They're just a company.  Well, they're very engineer-driven. And that's a very engineer-driven approach.  They're not normal humans. Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and you also sort of assume that these people have got sort of all these experiences before.  I mean, the idea of the massive amount of privacy needed in the online world has really only come around in the last couple of years as things have gotten more personal and more privacy-invading.  I don't think there's really a sort of offline precedent beyond sort of your government papers or your hospital records or something,  where you're so keen to do something in what is effectively a public forum, but still maintain your privacy.  And I think that although in many ways, what the rules should be are relatively obvious,  I think there are many cases where it's just not that obvious and people are making mistakes because nobody's done this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's interesting? Google, Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, all of the big players, the four horsemen of the Internet, if you want to use John Doar's terms, have made some pretty big blunders of late.  You can see all of them kind of stumbling. It isn't because they're moving so fast.  Yeah, it's not an easy thing to do. And it's not immediately apparent what people really want.  And I'm sure Facebook thought that it acted in good faith to do exactly what people were looking for and was probably a little shocked when the response was so negative.  I'm sure Google didn't plan for Buzz to be such a hot button for people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is this a case of geeks and millennials? Is this a situation where...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that might be true, too, that the market's very fragmented. There is no one user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is no one user and that the people who are developing these things are younger. They are engineers.  I hear from people who work in the design areas at Google who express frustration privately about the idea of everything being engineering driven and that UI doesn't get much of a feel and possibly even just simple rules of etiquette don't get much of a hearing in Google's products.  And so I think if you look at kind of the engineering mentality, kind of a younger group of people for whom, you know, what do I have to hide?  Privacy is not that big of an issue for me. And then you put it out there and the masses get it and they go, Whoa, wait a minute. Hold on.  And I think that that may be the case. I think people, I think maybe they need more diversity of development and design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And culture. They do suffer on the design side. Design is where Apple is so good at design. Google is so bad at design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's such engineers when it comes to even their logo. I've always thought the Google logo just is so not designed at all.  You know, it's like somebody came up with it one day. They're like, we need a logo for this thing. Let's just have Joe, you know, put it together. Just keep it clean, man. Just keep it simple.  Yeah, make it simple. Whatever. You know, they arbitrarily picked a few colors. I do feel like they have this design thing where it's not even about, you know, it's not about function, form following function.  It's in the computing space. I think they have to be on the same form and function have to be on the same level. And in many ways, they're the same thing. Right.  Form is function. Absolutely. It comes to how we interact. They know that at Apple. They know that. I sure do. Yeah. And it sings in their products.  You can see in the iPhone, you look at the iPhone OS from start to finish as an is an experience that is fluid and natural and feels complete.  And you look at Android. I mean, it's taken a year or two years just to get up to snuff really to any kind of fit and finish.  And it's still very it feels disjointed. You know, and I think that they need to start putting an emphasis on that if they want to move into an OS space, you know, with Chrome OS.  And if they want to really convince people that Android phones are the way to move the path of the future, they have to convince people not just on the on the functionality, which is great, but on the form as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, they remind me a little bit of Microsoft and of Windows in the in the early decades where you have they were in the same situation where you weren't really controlling the hardware.  You had a lot of different hardware designers putting their own spit and polish on the Microsoft operating system.  Microsoft was not a very good, well designed platform. I think you could say it was fairly ugly. XP comes to mind as one of the ugliest operating systems I've ever seen.  It is so utilitarian.  Hey, I think XP's start menu looks a lot like the Google logo.  I mean, I don't think there's the colors. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we've been here before. It's in Microsoft is starting to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And when you look at Windows 7 and you look at slick kind of, you know how they got there, though, they copied Apple and look at like Windows Phone 7, for instance, is a completely I mean, a kind of a breathtaking design departure for them.  It's really striking. You know, and I think it'll work. I think it'll be good. But it's like nothing that we've seen in the mobile space. It's totally different from Microsoft.  Well, it's a zoo. It's a zoo.  Except for a zoo. But the Zune HD, which obviously is a branch off of the main trunk of this design language.  But, you know, I think that there's an old clip of an interview with Steve Jobs where he's talking about Microsoft.  And you don't know talking about right where he's talking about there. He's like, you know, they're not they don't make bad products.  He's he's like, they just have bad taste. And he's talking about, oh, yeah, wait, fonts are spaced and and just really specific design stuff.  And you know that he is feels just totally turned off by what Microsoft does in the design space, which is not a lot right that back then.  This was in the late 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that was the the famous moment from the D conference, right, where Steve Jobs and Bill Gates Steve Jobs and Bill Gates were on stage.  You know, Bill Gates was asked, what's the thing that you most wished you had?  And he said, Steve Jobs sense of taste.  So he admitted it. Yeah, I don't have that.  I mean, that's a it's an amazing video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you talk about engineering driven companies. Wasn't Microsoft the original engineering driven company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. Yeah. And and that's what I mean.  Google's a little different, right? They have a little I think Microsoft is very managerial.  You know, they had a lot of hierarchy, right?  So I had to and you see in products like the kin, you get the impression and you hear all these stories.  It's still that way. It goes through all of these steps and rigorous sort of managerial levels.  Google seems to be much more like the spokes are somewhat independent.  They're sort of doing their own thing.  People are allowed to experiment and push experiments out into the world in a much freer way.  So you get a lot of innovation there.  But there is that same kind of lack of aesthetic that was happening at Microsoft throughout the 90s at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's take a break. We're going to come back and talk more with our great panel.  Joshua Topolski from Engadget.com.  Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle and the tech blog there.  He also has a radio show, which I have been on in Houston, which is just awesome.  You were a great guest, Leo. I love that show. You're wonderful.  And you just celebrated an anniversary. What was the anniversary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The show is Technology Bites. It's on Wednesday nights on KPFT.  You can listen to it on the web at kpft.org.  It starts about eight o'clock Central Time. It was our 15th anniversary.  That's amazing. I haven't been with it 15 years.  I've been with them since about 2003, I think.  We talked about the idea that when we first went on the air 15 years ago, we were talking about Windows 95.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. When I first started in tech radio, Windows 3.0, DOS 5.  So I'll beat them by a little bit, but not much.  A little bit.  Yeah, not much.  Also, our good friend, longtime friend of the show, Will Harris from ChannelFlip.com.  We'll get back to our conversation in just a bit. I hope you're enjoying it.  By the way, you can follow along on our chat room, irc.twit.tv.  Give us feedback. I watch it, the whole show. I know some of our other panelists do.  So it's a good way to kind of, as you're watching live, participate or watch live.  We do the show every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Time, 2200 UTC, at live.twit.tv.  The chat room is irc.twit.tv.  And we're glad to have you here.  I want to mention right now our friends at Squarespace.  We're glad to have them on board.  One of our favorite sponsors.

We thank them so much for their support of our program of this week in tech.  This is a story from the New York Times that you posted, Dwight, and I thought it was very interesting.  The cost of electronic gizmos may go up soon because of labor unrest in China.  Increasing costs in components, shortages.  A big jump soon in how much these gadgets cost.  We've been kind of living in a fool's paradise, haven't we?  I mean, the cost of computing has gone down, down, down to the point where companies can barely,  you know, you look at Dell's earnings, they may say millions of computers,  they can barely make any money on them.  Maybe it's time the costs went up to reflect the real cost of this gear.  What do you think, Joshua?  You're one of the people who's dealing day in and day out with this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, what if the quality went up with some of the stuff as well as the price?  I mean, I think that it's become very easy to make things very cheap  and I think that there's a lot of cheap stuff and I think that there's a lot of stuff made cheaply.  Those aren't necessarily the same thing.  I think there are conditions in China that we're starting to learn about, really,  that we should be feeling more responsible for.  I think that, and I don't mean us, just in the tech community, I mean people on the whole.  I think that you have to realize that this stuff comes from somewhere.  It's made by somebody.  And if those places, if where that stuff is coming from, if the practices there are bad,  if the people are being abused, if they're underpaid, if they're overworked,  you have to start thinking about it as a human being.  You have to say, do I feel comfortable with this?  Is this what I want in the world? Do I want people to feel that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe we aren't paying enough. We're kind of living on the backs of workers who are being mistreated.  Cheap labor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing is that I think the products themselves could stand to,  it's hard to say this because we report on this, but what about less crap and more really good stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked about this last week. Dell sold 13 million computers with bad capacitors they knew about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. I mean let's get back to a point in the world where we,  where things you bought really were made with some level of quality and care.  That's not going to happen.  I think the one thing you can say about Apple, and I know that the haters will not like to hear this,  but look, their stuff is, it's made better than other people's stuff.  I mean you look at the devices. I mean you have an iPhone 4 sitting there.  Compare that to even the highest end Android device that's on the market right now.  And in my opinion when it comes to build quality and materials, there is not a one-to-one comparison that I can find out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's true, but I think Apple is kind of very guilty of just occasionally pulling outrageous howlers and completely failing to admit it.  The number of first-gen MacBooks with fan floors or that run desperately too hot,  the recent thing with the iPhone 4, although I definitely agree that when Apple gets it right,  there is no, they are peerless in the technology world.  There's some pretty serious flaws in this iPhone 4 though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My proximity sensor doesn't work properly. There's that incident issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Apple. There's this quality control. I mean this is my question.  I've talked to Laura, my wife writes for NGadget as well, so we talk about this stuff pretty much 24-7.  And I've talked about it with the other editors.  My question is, look, these things were, they sold how many? 2 million in three days?  So there is a production line somewhere in China that was working at a pace.  They're probably still going at a pace that is completely insane.  And this gets right back to the heart of this question.  And Apple is, talk about being guilty, Apple is as guilty as anyone of not doing as much, I think, as they could about the working conditions  and the way that things sort of are run in China.  But you have to imagine some of this is quality control.  I don't believe, I have trouble believing, and I'm not defending them because I don't know the answer yet,  but I have trouble believing that Apple let this device walk out of their testing with these major flaws.  And they just said, well, it won't matter. We'll sell a bunch of them anyhow.  And if people complain, that's not our problem.  So I feel like there is a quality control issue with some of this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The yellow glue dots are probably the quality control thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a great example, right? People were complaining about the yellow screen issue.  It turns out, oh, the glue wasn't done drying because they were rushed so quickly out of these plants in China that literally the glue had not dried.  So I mean, I think there's a question of that. But I agree with Will.  I mean, there have been blunders and they have every now and again, they've got something that is just like kind of unbelievable.  How could you not catch this?  But I do think the general build, I don't think that the design and build quality, I do think it tends to be better than a lot of other C companies.  And I just wish that I wish there was a way that we could find for all of the companies to really start concentrating on, hey, what are the materials?  How is this made? What's the care that's taken to put it together and not just say, oh, we can get a hard drive from over here and some RAM from over there.  And there's these plastic cases that everybody uses. We'll just grab those too.  And there's a computer. You know, I feel like it just leads to an entropic state.  And we see it, you know, it's sort of this lowest you get down to the lowest common denominator, the cheapest thing you can possibly make.  And the market is flooded with a lot of a lot of crap.  Of course, I might be especially sensitive to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see more crap than the normal person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We had to start doing a section called Crap Gadget, which is like the USB thing or just like the USB rocket launcher, just whatever kind of that stuff is a sort of novelty.  But you do get to a point where you there's so much that people are churning out and you're like, why does this exist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, by the way, just don't don't say your your wife's name on words with friends on the air.  Apparently, I showed my name. Look at all the new games that I've been invited to participate in.  Oh, no, I won't. You know, Apple, Apple uses the same Foxconn, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They use the same manufacturers in Asia that the people who are making the crappy devices do.  And, you know, for example, they use a lot of the same components in the in the MacBooks and their desktops.  Sony used to make the laptops.  Right, right. And so, you know, they're why is it that Apple turns out a higher quality product using these same lines?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think you get the choice. In fact, I bet you there's a little dial practically that you can turn and say, they say, OK, welcome to Foxconn.  They have a website, they have a form or something.  Move the slider. Where do you want quality?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get the guys, the more expensive guys on the production line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. I'm sure that that's the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hard to say. How do you explain the glue then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they were Russian.  It just hadn't dried yet.  Yeah, apparently.  These guys are probably dead now.  Speaking hey, Apple's in a little bit of trouble because there's a class action lawsuit.  I don't know the merit of this saying that the Apple iPhone AT&T.  Exclusive is monopolistic.  The point being, yeah, they always say, oh, you can terminate any time and go to another carrier, but the other carrier doesn't have the iPhone.  So in reality, do we have choice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can't have a monopoly when you don't control the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you can't. It doesn't seem like it's a traditional monopoly, but there's a point.  That's it. That's not a bad point.  If you want an iPhone, you have to buy from AT&T.  I guess it's in a way a measure of the success of the iPhone that they could even send.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that like saying like if you want a Dell computer, you've got to go and buy it from Dell?  Yeah.  It's a vertically integrated product, right? It's not a monopoly.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's similar to the case where people were saying it's a monopoly that Apple says you can't put OS X on other computers.  You can't make a computer that runs OS X.  And that doesn't fly because their market share is so minuscule that I mean, if the iPhone were, I don't know, maybe 40% of all smartphones, let's say it was half of all smartphones for iPhones.  I think you can make a really good case.  It's not though, is it?  It's not.  Now it's not even close. I mean, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, with the success of Android, now Android's close to having a hundred thousand apps in the app store.  They're installing, according to Google, as many as five million new Android installations a month.  That's five million new handsets a month. That's huge.  They're doing very, very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have real competition and Microsoft is not going to... is not sitting still when Windows Phone 7 comes out.  I mean, that could give them even more competition.  This is a... you have to remember the smartphone market is a burgeoning market.  It is just starting to become this huge sort of beast, you know?  And so it's wide open. Apple doesn't control it.  They happen to have what I consider to be the best product in that market right now.  They don't control it and you've got Android devices that are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there's no... on the face of it, there's no merit in this lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although the FCC has looked to scant at some of these exclusivity deals and not just with the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it's consuming... look, there may not be legal recourse, but as consumers, we can look at scants at it and say, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the biggest problem is the way our industry is arranged, which is you have to buy a phone that's locked into a carrier at all.  I mean, the whole idea of that to me seems unfair.  There should be two separate things that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should be an unlocked handset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You buy a device and then you choose a carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  I mean, the fact that we don't have it set up in that manner, that you have to say, if you want this device, you have to go over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I use a Nexus One, frankly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, can you...  It's locked to... what do you have, T-Mobile or AT&T?  It's not locked. It's unlocked.  It's T-Mobile or AT&T bands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right, because it's GSM.  Those are the two GSM carriers in the US, but I could take it to the UK and I could use it there with some other carrier, just pop a SIM chip in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, but you still have to use here in the US one of those two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The problem in the US also is that we have very heterogeneous networks.  We have GSM, we have CDMA.  Even the GSM, some of the 3G's are on different frequencies from here, from different carriers and overseas.  How many companies carry the iPhone in England, Will? Is it just one? Is it two?  No, they all do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all do. See?  There's five different carriers in the UK, all of whom have different networks and all of whom carry the iPhone.  So this is what happens.  I hate to tell you guys, you're selling the network is the product of massive deregulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I disagree. I think our cellular network is the product of being at the first.  It's legacy. It's because we had cellular one put in CDMA and then GSM came along and because it's old, we don't have the homogeneity of your system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's true.  I think a lot of it's that.  All GSM, nobody's ever heard of CDMA over here.  And there's also a lot of, the government is pretty heavy on making sure that telephone companies give consumers good deals.  I mean, they're really heavy on it.  That's a big deal.  And so the fact that you can get the iPhone on all five major networks.  And they all compete with each other and there are different price plans and the networks have different price points.  So there's some places you can get the iPhone cheaper, but you pay more for the talk time.  I will grant you this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That is because we have the free market orthodoxy here that the best way to have diversity is competition and deregulate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, right. Which is obviously is, you know, it kind of gets back to what we were saying about ads and if it can be game, then it will be gamed.  If our deregulation can be game, then it will be game.  Then you can be sure it's being gamed right now by the carriers in this country.  And the fact of the matter is we do need every once in a while, it's not the worst thing in the world.  If the government steps in and says, you know what, let's actually regulate this to make it fairer for consumers.  I'm not, look, I'm not saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I gotta get Brian Brushwood on here because he's the libertarian in the bunch and he would argue with you on that one.  But I mean, look at the situation that you've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've got, you know, the free market kind of scenario there where it was Apple and AT&T or you've got over here, you know, the hefty regulation where you can get it on five different carriers at five different price points.  It's kind of QED.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'd rather have what you've got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the best carrier for the iPhone?  Who do you like?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Over here.  Yeah.  O2?  Well, O2 were the guys that had it originally.  And so they put quite a lot of effort into their, you know, upgrading the capacity of their 3G network.  But I hear reliable reports that Vodafone has actually got better 3G coverage overall.  So if you're in a good O2 area, it's possibly better than a good Vodafone area, but you're more likely to get a good Vodafone area somewhere, you know, across the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, I would point out, Joshua, that we do have that situation with Android and we were talking before the show.  This is a problem for Android because there's so many handsets.  Every carrier has an Android handset.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they're different handsets.  It isn't, they haven't, like the next day.  But isn't that good?  You've got choice, but that confuses consumers.  Choice is good.  What I'm saying is my dream is that you have the choice.  You've got the incredible, you've got the Droid X, you've got the original Droid, you've got this new Motorola Charm, whatever.  You've got them all, right?  But they're not carrier dependent.  They're all available.  They're on all carriers or it's available as a device.  And then you get the device, you say, I've got this device.  Now what carrier do I want?  You know why that's not going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they're going to cost $500 to $700 each.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this goes back to that, should we be paying more for the things that we, the gadgets that we own?  Is a phone that I'm going to use for a year or two years, is it worth $500?  It isn't $500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's $500 plus the $2,000 for the bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, there's a really good point, right?  Because over, and this, you know, particularly relating to what we were just saying, the iPhone 4 when it came out over here, you could either buy it, you know, for a hundred, 200 pounds attached to a network with a contract.  Or you could buy it direct from Apple.  Apple sold it unlocked for any carrier that you wanted.  You could just walk into any carrier, you know, a retail store and just pick up a SIM card and put it straight in the iPhone.  But they sold it for 600 pounds.  But you had the choice.  It's like, that's the real cost of these things.  Yeah.  Well, it isn't though.  We know the iPhone costs under $200 to make.  Well, yeah, but I mean, that's the, you know, retail cost.  You have to make your money.  So it's like, bought straight from Apple and just whacked any old SIM card into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The truth is, the cell phone companies make money like pirates.  How much is $100 a month times two year contract?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How about a text message?  Forget about that.  They charge $1,500 a megabyte.  They charge 25 cents for a text message.  Yes, it's $1,500 per megabyte.  The bandwidth text messages used are like a rounding error in terms of the overall bandwidth that these networks have.  I mean, that it is criminal, criminal to me that they can charge 25 cents.  I mean, the fact that we don't rise up with like pitchforks and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's because everybody has a group or a bulk text messaging.  You pay one fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, you have $20 for a thousand messages.  That's a ripoff too.  $20 for...  But not for a thousand unlimited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've got, for our whole family, $30 for unlimited text messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what the bottom line is?  We got it because we put up with it.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.  Hey, Will, I have a question for you about...  You've got to rise up.  I have a question for you about the iPhone and O2.  Everybody is predicting that when AT&T loses its exclusivity and let's say the iPhone goes to Verizon,  that there will be a large churn at AT&T as people drop away and move over.  Did that happen with O2?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what?  Not massively.  I don't know the data, but anecdotally, I think what most people who were the early adopters of the iPhone  have kind of stayed with O2.  I think that from my understanding, most of the people who have picked up the iPhone on different networks  have gone there because they were on that network already or they're new users.  So I think O2 hasn't seen a massive amount of people suddenly leave O2 and go to a different network  because frankly, there isn't a vast amount of differentiation between the networks at all in the UK.  They all have within a stone's throw the same kind of coverage and the same kind of data speeds  and the same kind of price plans, which I guess is the competition of having these five guys  keeps all the prices down.  They're constantly coming up with better deals.  So I don't think O2 has lost massive amounts of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What carrier has the best overall coverage?  If I was in Europe and I wanted to be covered everywhere I went, what would be the carrier?  In Europe?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Deutsche Telekom.  Deutsche Telekom, yeah.  Because Deutsche owns, well, I mean in total owns T-Mobile.  Including the UK.  Oh, including, yeah, yeah, yeah.  So including the UK, Deutsche owns T-Mobile, which is obviously as big around Europe,  and Orange in the UK, which is one of the biggest in the UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They own Orange?  Yeah.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Germans have written everything.  So that's why I am going to, my next phone is going to be, I was looking at the Droid X, like the Droid X.  In fact, when we come back I want to get your guys' opinion.  I like the Droid X.  I'm interested.  But I'm looking at the Samsung Galaxy S line, and I think that the T-Mobile one is the one I'm going to get  because it's a GSM.  I can take it out of the Nexus One.  I can put it in there, and I can go around the world.  We'll do that in just a second.  We'll talk about that.  And Google.  Google and China agree on a fiction.  What is going on in China?  We'll get the details in just a bit before we do, though.  Time to talk about audiobooks.  Who here listens to audiobooks?  Anybody in the panel?  Oh, everybody in the audience, and Will Harris.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You kind of want to hear Clapton reading it though, don't you?  It's written first person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, we're going to lobby for that too.  So Bill Nye's got six books on audible.com.  So there you go.  Excellent.  Audible.com slash twit2c.  Here's the problem.  Pick in two.  Audible plays on everything.  Your iPhone, Android now has the best audible application.  Oh, it's so good.  You can download any of your audible books directly onto the phone.  This is something the iPhone needs desperately.  I hope they do one for the iPhone.  It also many GPS devices, almost all the MP3 players, Kindles.  I mean, you know, 500 different devices.  You can listen to your books wherever you are at the gym, at work, on a commute.  I listen while I'm doing the shows, to be honest with you.  I'm not paying any attention.  I'm listening to an audible book.  Audible.com slash twit2.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  I think this is probably, I probably buried the lead on this, the big story of the week,  which is that Google, which is about to lose its license in China, its internet content  provider license, decided to stop redirecting Google searches at google.ca and to Hong Kong  so that they can get their license renewed.  They replace, this is weird stuff they're doing.  They in fact didn't get their license renewed on Friday.  Because well, so here's what they're doing.  Google has replaced a search box on google.cn with a picture of a search box.  When you click it, so it's not, you can't type any, no field.  It's just an image.  When you click on it, it takes you to google.hk.  And apparently this was about face saving because the Chinese authority said, okay,  that's all we care about.  So Google's still in China, still redirecting, but you can't fill out a form.  You have to click a link.  I think the real issue is that Google is something that the Chinese elites weren't really willing  to give up.  And so that's why they blinked.  What do you think guys?  Dwight, you have any thought about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the thing with the image is weird.  I don't quite understand why that would mollify the Chinese government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they wanted to be mollified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I guess so.  Oh yeah, you put that there and it's not, I guess because you're not actually typing  in a search at google.cn that then goes to google.hk.  You're clicking on, I guess a portal that takes you there.  I don't know.  Yeah.  It's probably, it's a cultural thing, I suspect.  But yeah, the headline on there, they agree to a fiction I think is apt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Remember, this is the country that invented diplomacy.  I mean, this is, they've got ways and ways around this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm glad to see that Google is at least kind of doing what it can to stand up for what  it originally said it was going to do.  They could have caved in order to keep that license and they found a way to continue to  offer unfiltered searches.  And good for them.  I suspect the people in China who wanted to get unfiltered searches could have gotten  them anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's difficult to know what Google's, I mean Google's motivations, their outward  motivations are to, they don't want their search results censored.  But I'm not sure that, I mean, I don't think this is the only situation where the search  results are being censored.  I mean, it may be a little more extreme than other places, but Google obviously, each localized  search is going to have that region's idiosyncrasies.  I mean, I don't believe that they're just straight up unfiltered search everywhere in  the world.  I can't tell if there's another business reason here why Google is doing this or if it's purely  altruistic.  They want to stay in China.  I mean, of course they want to stay in China.  I mean, they're not winning in the search market race there.  They're being beat pretty badly.  But I don't know if it's just pure altruism that they just want to bring freedom to the  Chinese and their searches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I'm sure you followed this, that the, you know, that the Schmidt, Eric  Schmidt didn't want to abandon the market, wanted to give in to Chinese authorities and  follow Chinese law and that Larry Page was the purist who said, no, we can't, we can't  do that.  That violates our deeply held beliefs.  I don't want to be in China if we have to filter our search results.  And what's happened is both sides have found a compromise that lets them not lose face,  but kind of win the point.  I think in a way that you'd have to say the Chinese government is the one that gave in  on this.  I mean, you still can search, you have unfiltered search in China now via Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They give in or how they reach us are really face saving.  Like you said, it's kind of like, you know, here's what I mean.  How much, how much they care.  I think is the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I think a you're right by do the Chinese search engine is huge, much bigger than Google,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which I'm sure is under complete control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course it is.  The government completely censored.  But the Chinese elites, and I think this is not to be ignored, use Google and wanted Google.  So the Chinese government said, well, look, as long as the people don't find Falun Gong  in their search results, they keep using by do we know our, we want to keep our elites  happy too.  And so this, I think this is a way of, of, of mollifying the elites by letting, letting  Google stay in China.  That's who, that's who uses Google in China is the intellectuals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The idea of elites in a, in a communist country is, oh, there are elites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's not a communist country.  It's a very capitalistic country.  It's the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the worst of both worlds.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The worst part of communism, which is like a dictator, fascist dictatorship mixed with  the worst part of capitalism, which is unbridled greed, unbridled greed at the expense of any  human life.  You know, look, I don't, you know, I'm sure I'm going to get a lot of hate mail from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  JC Wayne's putting out in the chat room.  This is true that there still is the great firewall of China.  So you could find Falun Gong pages, references, but then to click on that page, you won't  necessarily be able to get it.  So the search results are unfiltered.  Google is returning information unfettered, but China still controls what pages you get  to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So are we about to have another China in Australia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that's interesting, isn't it?  The Chinese, the Australian government has for a long time and really trying to filter  search results or pages in effect.  They now demand, is this the law now that they demand that ISPs block certain sites?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What sites are they blocking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know that they've, I'm not sure that they actually have, I think that law is percolating.  I'm not sure it's necessarily in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not in place yet.  The Perth boy, who I presume is in Australia, says not yet.  I don't think that's in place.  That's the goal.  There's a lot of opposition to it.  Well, this is the same country that proposed that filters be put on all computers.  And of course, the filter was immediately broken by people.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, in Australia, sorry, I was going to say in Australia, the sort of the governing  party there has said they want to roll this out.  And they've said that since 2008.  But as of yet, they haven't yet done it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Current status according to Perth boy and our other Australians, and we have quite a  few in the chat room, is that the law has been put on hold for a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was really interesting, I mean, the comprehensive is wikipedia.org slash internet censorship  in Australia.  There you go.  It's all there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what is the, what was the goal here?  What were they trying to, I somehow have missed this.  I think you have a few.  What was the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I should think of the children.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you have child porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you have a very reactionary wing of the Australian Parliament or government or  whatever they call it, that is really scared of the internet and really does want to filter  it.  And I think that you also have, there are a lot of cooler heads, including, I understand  most of the ISPs in Australia who hate this idea.  They don't want to have anything to do with it.  Facebook, according to Inside Facebook, Facebook's June US traffic did not grow so good.  Facebook's growth slowed in the US.  Only 320,000 new monthly users in June compared to, get ready, 7.8 million the month before.  Didn't, not only didn't grow, it crashed.  Now the question is, yeah, I think it's over.  So let's call it.  It's over.  Let's call it 4.50 PM on June 11th.  What's going to be hot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good thing that Google, Google me is stepping in to take the place of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's a question.  And I think they debated this on TNT earlier.  We have a great daily news show now, by the way, everybody should listen to with Tom Merritt,  Becky Worley, Sarah Lane, Dr. Kiki and many others.  And that's every weekday afternoon, 2.30 to 3.30 on live.twit.tv Pacific.  That's 5.30 to 6.30 Eastern.  But they debated this earlier.  The real question is, is it that Facebook saturated?  Like everybody in the world is already a member, so you're not going to grow as fast or people  are reacting to the privacy issue?  I have to think the former, right?  That it's just saturated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are not reacting.  I mean, there are a few people who are reacting to the privacy issue.  Most people aren't, are barely aware of the privacy issue.  I think the fact is that, you know, in the, in the sort of the markets that Facebook has  you know, primarily Western markets, they are pretty much saturated.  I mean, who do you know who's online doesn't really have a Facebook account.  The major growth, I think, and I think Mark Zuckerberg said this at a conference a few  weeks ago, is going to come for Facebook in developing nations.  And that's how they're going to get to a billion users.  But they do say that, you know, Zuckerberg said that a billion users is inevitable for  Facebook.  They're unquestionably going to get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know the place where Facebook needs to break through is, the place where Farmville  needs to be played is the places where people are actually farming a lot in real life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think that could cause a collapse of the food chain and we would all die.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree that, I agree though, that it's a question of saturation.  I mean, well, I mean, they don't have everybody, but they've got a lot of people.  And when you balloon to a certain point and then you have to hang out there a little bit,  you know, and I think that, I don't think the privacy issue is real to a lot of people.  I think we've talked about this on the last show that I think that it's a small group  of people.  I mean, how successful was the quick Facebook day?  Not very successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think 30 or 40,000 people quit, not a huge number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's probably about how many people are really upset over the privacy issues then,  or even aware of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  I think you're right.  So, saturation.  We vote for saturation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or it's dead.  Or it's totally dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or it's dead.  Yeah.  It would, I think, you know, it would have a chance of being dead if there were an alternative,  but there just isn't.  And this is where the network effect is so hard to overcome.  You know, when you've got a billion people, or in this case, half a billion people using  something, it's pretty hard to get them to move all at once to somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a monopoly.  That's a monopoly.  You want to sue somebody for a monopoly?  You can start Facebook.  So they monopolize the social networking space online and it's simply impossible to break  into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, these same kind of things were said about AOL when AOL was edited.  That's right.  It cannot be killed.  Right.  And AOL, to me, Facebook is AOL.  I mean, I've seen this before.  I agree.  And the difference is that AOL had a fixed distribution system, kind of like newspapers,  where they had, they connected and got to people through dial-up modems and they weren't  able to make the leap to broadband and that's kind of what killed them.  But at some point, there could be something that Facebook basically just doesn't deal  with well that could take it offline.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to have to be something like that.  So do you guys, any of you play Star War, Starcraft rather?  Back in the day.  Back in the day.  Loved that game.  Starcraft 2 is out.  Land parties with Starcraft.  I've always had the sensation when you play online with people, not like land parties  like your friends, fine.  But when you play against strangers on the internet, that there are just some people  who live in a different world from you and me.  And now I know it for sure.  This is from a documentary called The Hacks Life.  Got this from Ars Technica.  They call it Actions Per Minute.  To be a truly good Starcraft player, or I guess any game like this, you have to be able  to click 200 actions a minute.  My God.  Look at this guy.  This is not right.  This is not sped up.  This is in real time.  A top class Korean player.  He is playing Starcraft 2.  And he is up to 200 actions per minute.  He said it's an average rate of how quickly your fingers move.  To win a championship it should be at least over 200 and in the low 300s per minute.  And you've got to see this video because as he's clicking, I don't know how he's thinking.  I can see how you could click that fast.  But I don't know how you can think that fast.  He says he puts sandbags under his wrists to speed up his speed.  You've got to watch this guy.  Look at this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wow.  When he's not doing this, he's pushing out iPhone 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When he's not doing this, he's not doing anything.  I think this is all this guy does ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a professional player.  He doesn't even cut his nails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think he has time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look at this.  He probably needs longer nails until he gets to reach less far to the keys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you've ever played Starcraft and you wonder why do I keep getting my ass on it  to me, it's because of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this part of his money making scheme?  No, no.  This isn't gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do they call it?  Gold digging golf?  No, grinding.  This is just this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He just likes it.  Likes it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Likes to play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a champion.  I used to be a pretty avid Quake 3 arena player.  I was horrible.  I had the...  My online name was The Llama King and there was a reason for that.  But what I would do is I would go to QuakeCon and I would play just for the experience.  I'd play against some of these fatality and so forth as part of the press tournament.  It was just astonishing what these guys could do.  I couldn't fathom either watching them, standing behind them or playing against them, how they  did what they do.  It just doesn't seem human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like Ender's game.  Their brain is plugged into that environment in a way.  I like playing FPSs.  Every once in a while I'll play a multiplayer death match.  We played a couple of years ago at CES.  We had a few nights where we...  Late late at night we had some unreal matches with the whole team, the whole Engadget team.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fun if you're playing with friends because they're not way ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We were all in the same room so it was like 25 people in the same room playing which was  an enormous amount of fun.  But I was surprised because I had played it before and had not played it for a long time  and it comes back to you.  It's like riding a bike.  It's this weird memory.  It's like you get in there and then you can do it.  But they're operating.  The guys who do that professionally are operating on a level that is just completely...  The government should be talking to those guys about...  I'm sure they are.  They're running the Predators.  I'm sure it's the same guys in the basement in Las Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It probably is.  It's pretty impressive.  But that's why, just so you know, that's why it's so hard when you play online with real  people.  We used to do a LAN party at the screensavers.  In fact, it was so much fun.  We'd play Halo.  It was so much fun that sometimes we'd be coming back from the commercial and it'd be  like, no, wait, no, wait, no.  Because you just don't want to stop.  It really is.  It really is a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It makes me want to have a LAN party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know.  Well, one of the things I've wanted to do, we will do this.  Ryan Brushwood runs a Team Fortress clan.  But I think we will do this.  In fact, if anybody listening can do this, I would like a level of some game.  Could be any game.  Could be Quake, Quake 3.  I would like a level of the Twit Cottage.  We'll send you plans.  We'll send you pictures.  Make a level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm there.  Wouldn't that be fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Make a level.  And then we had this.  We had a screensaver set level of Unreal.  So make a level and then we will host a big LAN party after Twit every week.  I'm into that.  Wouldn't that be fun?  Quake 3 would be great.  Quake 3 would be good.  Yeah, that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That'd be a good one.  It's kind of the lowest common denominator game now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, anybody who's got the skills.  Look, if you're the designer, you get to choose the game.  But we'll send you anything you need, all the schematics.  It would be a good thing because we don't know what the hell is going on in here anyway.  We probably should make some schematics.  Josh and Wittulpulski, so nice to have you.  Editor in chief of Engadget, Engadget.com.  Great to be here.  The Engadget podcast is every week, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every week we do it usually on Thursday or Friday.  We put up a post and let people know and then we do the Engadget show once a month.  It's a live event here in New York and we'll be doing one pretty soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'd love to get you back on the Twit network doing that too.  It was really fun when we broadcast.  Timelcast, I guess, your Engadget podcast.  Engadget.com.  Dwight Silverman is the tech blogger at the Houston Chronicle.  Blogs.cron.com slash tech blog.  Must read every day and his link role is especially useful.  He also hosts Technology Bytes, one of what, like just 12 hosts or something on that show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there's six of us.  A lot of people.  Yes.  It's basically, it sounds like a bunch of guys sitting around making fun of people with  computer problems for two hours.  It's a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really a great show.  If you're in the Houston area, you must, is it on all of Pacifica or just Houston?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just on KPFT, but you can get the podcast at geekradio.com.  The podcast goes up the next morning kind of the way Twit does and you can listen to  it.  It's also on iTunes.  Excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Called Technology Bytes.  So great to see you again, Will Harris.  I know it's very late.  Did you stay up and watch?  We won't say anything, but you stayed up and watched the game.  Oh, I can't hear you.  I potted you down.  I'm sorry.  Have you been trying to talk this whole time, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm always trying to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I accidentally turned you on.  Actually, poor Will.  No wonder you're sitting there with your head in your hands.  I'm so sorry.  I had you potted down.  I apologize.  Level fail.  I thought it was the vuvuzela mic I was turning off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought this was the one place I thought I could escape from that sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Never, never.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I saw somebody did with the vuvuzela, they did like a layering of them with different  pitches.  So it started off with like the ba-ba-ba-ba.  Of course you get the ba-ba-ba-ba.  Yeah, which is perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Will is the guy who runs a great network out of the UK called Channel Flip.  ChannelFlip.com.  Such as technology video, video on all sorts of subjects, it's really I think the future  of IPTV.  I know you're doing very well, so congratulations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Always a pleasure.  You can go to bed now.  What time is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Four?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's one in the morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, that's not so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got to go to work tomorrow.  Oh, well just blame me.  Tell him to blame me.  Tell him it was the vuvuzelas that kept you up.  Something like that.  One thing we know that it wasn't the late night celebrations of the England victory in the  World Cup.  Oh, just leave it out.  I was rooting for you right until the second round.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody else was rooting for us over here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it is the land of football, we know that.  Will, it's great to talk to you.  We'll get you back very soon.  Thanks everybody for joining us.  We are going to Detroit.
