Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a mainstream tv show without a simian or a porn star or something going on in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah hike it up  alright so what did ev that was it that's the ad go to meeting.com try it  right now go to meeting.com should pay should pay three times

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we gave him about three ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  go to meeting.com slash twit that's what i had to tell you  so you're talking to ev

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah so i talked to ev about this issue and  he is a little frustrated that he  he's frustrated that he can't have a soup to nuts experience where people  have you know a twitter client on their iphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's bad because it was the API that put twitter on the map the fact that  third party applications exist

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  he knows that however now twitter is going to mass adoption and your mom  doesn't is confused or maybe not your mom but  you've heard from my mom  yes i know we're going to get her online  she just wants to they just want to have a basic twitter application for android  for iphone for blackberry that has the basic features that is you know brain  dead simple on the website and he's basically considering doing it and then  what he would have to say to the people which he's had to do already with things  like lists and things like the group tweeting etc  you have to move up the stack and provide more value so  he's not going to make a multi-user you know twitter client but i guarantee you  he will have a twitter client this year on every platform names the twitter  client so right now that he told me the promise you search for twitter in  the itunes store and it's a bad user experiences well which one do you use  right issue be enough visual one that is easy to use now that one doesn't have  to have the feature set of hoots we'd receive make between deck with the other  leading ones that are out there and it certainly won't  and fact they don't want that they want the simple basic one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what have you seen sees me look  i have the i love it's gorgeous

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sees me is i have to tell you i'd  uh... louis gasping invest in his company when it was that  the thread comments  as you know what the people who are in the comments on blogs  are ugly people  they're never going to turn their video cameras on right not to look at it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because it's a trial and sees me to have the video thing just died paul yeah but

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  however i didn't make a mistake because you should bet the horse  not you know  uh... whatever the race and  uh... he i i knew he's i know he's a great entrepreneur and he's a little

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  again you should bet the horse not the race

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah so like  uh... you want to be the the horseman out when this race but he will win a  race at some point  but i'd rather own the horse and just bet on the horse for this race  and so as an investor i should have bet on him not  the race he was in with the video comments cuz even if he loses that race  which i knew he would  he wasn't aware that he would you that but that's part of being an entrepreneur  as you got a bang your head against a wall  uh... any bankers had against the white he tried  for two years and then he bought that to what it i twitter rific  which were if you bought an area and i can't world he brought all that's what  you are all and rebranded it and uh... god bless them  he makes i think the best client out there and i don't know if he makes any

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  money on others i don't know exactly where the business he's basically he's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  good friends with evan  uh... i would say sixty seventy percent chance he's make its bought by twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they'll buy the leading well that's what made me think if you if if they're going  to a desktop that uh... app they should do look i mean this is beautiful it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and it's and it's beautiful but it's it's looking at you use it for a while  it gets a little frustrating to use i think even if you're a uh...  a new but all of you poke around in there it's kind of confusing as to  what's happening where

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i thought that i thought it's using windows presentation foundation to be  pf i thought it was gorgeous and i just thought well it's not for me because i'm  a power user but for my mom it might be good but you don't think so

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  i think that  what it does is it pushes you towards kind of the suggested users and when you  first fired up and you go in it  it's got these channels it wants you to use it on test difficult yeah to get to  your friends and your time line  it's like a different thing than than a traditional twitter client  but you know if if they're interested in having their own twitter client and they  were to end up buying something like a seismic  uh... twirl which has it with a stop development on  uh... now that they're doing that the seismic client stuff  it would be really interesting to rebrand twirl as a as the twitter client  and just keep it as simple as it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  easy easier to monetize twitter if you uh... hold the client  i guess it is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well it's uh... if you're doing ads or if you were charging for the client but  there you know if if you're having a client we don't pay we don't pay for it  and you're putting ads on it you under the same problem the twitter has  if somebody if they do a really simple  and they have the competition of things like echo phone which is  very easy to use and you don't have to be a genius to use echo phone  why would anybody use something that doesn't have  as many features as something like echo phone when they can use that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  well here's what's coming since the man  i actually know what's coming  there's going to be a  uh... there's two things that are coming one is uh... there will be in stream  advertising so it doesn't matter what client you use that's important because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  otherwise you can completely defeat it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right so  every fifth or twentieth or two hundred  call maybe let's call it every two hundred tweet will be an ad in your  stream and we based on what people are talking about in your tweet stream

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so let's say location aware so it'll know to send me stuff that's around me

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of course it will and so you're going to have is leo and i are talking on  you know twitter  and we both are at south by southwest and it's like you know here's an ad for  dell computers you know party in south by southwest or an example but  you know it it it will know that we both have the android phones or whatever and  give us an android ad  uh... need to pay to not see the ads  uh... i don't think they're gonna have that i mean words

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i'd love for you to buy i i i think it's with buzz uh... here at if twitter does  that there's an there's a group of us not certainly the mainstream not the  millions of what is it fifty  what they just say was five million tweets a day or some ridiculous number  yeah yes i mean it's i mean those those people are going anywhere but i'm i'm  going to go to buzz in fact i'm kind of mostly on buzzer

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  i think that's gonna happen is you will you say that now but when you see one  ad out of just like you can be do you block your ads when you do google

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  search no in fact i see google ads all the time in my gmail and everywhere else

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so i mean you're complaining but you're not going to go anywhere if it's if it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  modest it's not in your stream it's not right there in your face that's what i  don't like is it's part of the editorial it's essentially part of the editorial

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it will it will be clearly labeled when you go to engadget and you page down you  will see a medium rectangle ad every blog has that and it's in the twitch and  it's in the content stream and we just said that for the meeting in the stream

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is your you're well right here is your experience as a blogger jason in the  past that that's those of the ads that work not the side bars but the ones that  are really in the car

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ok here's what happens if you if you make a if you make a beautiful graphic  ad on the top a leaderboard and on the side of medium rectangle those things  can capture people in the general audience but for sophisticated users  putting an ad within the content column will if it's if it's a content-based  ad like if it's text and it has good clickable links in it that will work  better  you have to know which ones to use beautiful graphic ones on the top of the  side and content rich ones in the middle cleavage apparently according to what  Jacob Nielsen that's if you want to click through but you know you're trying  to get other things like messages but anyways for the point is funny it's just  ridiculous it's just so obvious but it's where it actually works yes then the  clients the clients will then have the ability to sell their inventory on the  top so the top tweet on your deck could rotate and be from a specific person so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's what you're going to see but see here's my thing with advertising I gotta  say the Facebook ads are starting to get more specific to the point where I'm  actually paying attention to them so clearly they they they're skimming my  profile to know how old I am where I live and I'm assuming they're reading  the messages that I send back and forth but you know it makes the advertising  more effective I think if I'm looking at it that means it's better so if they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  going to watch my tweets and Facebook or just are I mean the way they use the  context and your demographics are really ham-handed I keep seeing ads I'm 53 I  keep seeing ads that say 53 year old men want me to an iPad I get that ad too  that's ridiculous 53 too I just thought everybody click that button and go we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  get the other ad as well believe me believe me so so I agree not everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is handling their demographic information properly right right it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's more than what you it's more than just looking at it it's got to be  relevant and it's got to and it's got to be smart and and as Jason said it has to  do more than make you click on it it's got to got to draw you in and make you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  kind of what you're doing here is you say how many how many clicks is it going to take  to get to the center of the candy but look see. Clock. He's like whiskey tango. Clock.  Clock.

What yeah I mean  I don't know what to say. That's just that's what but it seems to me unfortunately that that's what  the internet was invented for. That's what the song in Avenue Q says. The internet is for porn.  That is not even porn. That is just what I don't know what that is. It's time wasting. It's it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the internet is this next generation's television.  Just like when we got you know I remember when I was a kid and we got cable tv it was like we  went from having five channels to having 35 channels and 30 of them were junk and now the  internet it's like you went from having a thousand channels to an unlimited number of millions to go  millions and this is what we've done with it turned our cameras on and watching random people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Miguel helped writing in the New York Times this week says Intel was also a victim of the kind  almost exactly the same kind of cyber attack that occurred on Google and other companies.  Intel is I think this only the second or third company to admit it and we're starting to see  indications that maybe hundreds of companies were hacked by the Chinese at this time.  Chuck Malloy at Google said the only connection between what we saw in January and attacks on  Google is timing but according to the New York Times Intel was part of the same wave of attacks  that affected the Google and Malloy said later based on more research we can't rule out there  may be other similarities between the Google and Intel attacks. There's also a story in computer

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  world that says that more than a hundred companies were targeted and if you're a company you know you  don't want to be on this list because it makes it look like you know you don't have control of your  people a lot of this was social engineering and fishing and so I you know I don't see a lot of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people wanting to cop to this. And yet I'm kind of in a way I think Google should get some credit  for stepping forward and saying it happened to them exactly I mean look if Google got hacked

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  these guys are sophisticated. Well and you know it gave Google a chance I think to do something  that a lot of its executives had wanted to do for a while which is I think was find an out in China.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Walmart adds its clout to movie streaming also from the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Walmart says it's agreed to buy Voodoo. Remember Voodoo? Yeah whatever happened to them. They got

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bought by Walmart. Well yeah. That's what happened to them. It was three years old it was a movie  service. They were actually building them into Blu-ray players and the TVs. According to the Times  60 the price for the company was over 100 million dollars. Best Buy, Amazon, Comcast and Echo Star  had also shown some interest in Voodoo. So what does this do? I think it's great because

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it needs to happen. The movie streaming stuff needs to happen. Yeah well so is this like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Roku kind of thing? I love the Roku. I do too. We're on the Roku. We love the Roku because we're on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the Roku. And you know what here's my complaint about the Roku. I love it. Don't get me wrong.  But there's not enough movies. There's not enough like blockbuster movies. There's  plenty of indie films and documentaries and TV shows but I want you know I want that HBO  to go thing which I actually get now because I have the Fios. The Verizon Fios. You have Xfinity.  Yes. Wait a minute. No Xfinity is the Comcast. Verizon Fios is test marketing that HBO to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well when they say to go what do they mean to go? Like you could take it with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can log into HBO from your computer so effectively you could do it at work and waste  more time and watch HBO content kind of like you can with the on-demand. So I think it's great.  It's Hulu for HBO. Yeah. But you know HBO is the big kid in town so they can be very restrictive  with their content because they have very desirable content. They're the one company  making content people will actually pay for. Or wait for. A lot of people wait. You just have to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  prove that you have an HBO subscription to get it right? That's going to be the plan? Well I have

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to access it. I have to use my Verizon Fios login email which I hate to admit this. I never set it  up so I don't know what it is. I have that problem all the time. I use Gmail. I can never

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  remember what's my Comcast email? What are they talking about? Yeah exactly. When do you ever use

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  your internet service provider's email? I'm not going to use it. So I can have a Verizon Fios dot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  net password or email? We're outliers. We're not real people. We're outliers. I like my email  portable. I like it portable. Very interesting. I was watching the tsunami coverage yesterday. Of  course everybody was worried. Their alarms were going off all over Hawaii. Everybody was worried  that Hawaii was going to get hit by a pretty big tidal wave. Thank goodness it did not. But what  did you see on CNN? On all the local stations? Ustream. Yeah they were Ustreaming it. I saw  Ustream coverage of Chile. Yeah and Skype. And they were talking to people in Chile via Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Skype. They were tuning in to like three or four TV stations over

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ustream. That was a watershed moment. I think so. Did Ustream just got a pretty big influx of cash

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  as I remember? $75 million from Masa from SoftBank. I know Masa. He's a friend of mine. He  runs SoftBank in Japan and he was the richest man in the world at one point actually. Sun Sun.  Yeah Sun. He's a Korean but born in Japan I believe. He's lived in Japan his whole life.  He's the most powerful guy in Japan. He put in $75 million I think and he bought most of the  company and he is going to be bringing it to China and Japan. He sees it as the future. So those guys  are Brad and his partner. Just congratulations to them. Yeah big big. Of course they're one of our

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  streaming partners. In fact they're the ones that allow us to do live streaming on the iPhone just  through Safari because they have an H.264 stream which we love. So yeah. This is a real business  and I didn't know. Do you think they're the winner? I mean we have Bit Gravity, JustinTV,  there's live stream. Yeah they're going to win. Do you think it's because of $75 million they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  going to win? I think they have the best product. Okay because I was going to say is it no longer  that you've got the hippest name for the most users? Is it that you actually have to have the  best platform and the best infrastructure? I think they're all the same platform. I'm sorry we use them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think there's that much difference. What do you use? You use them all? I use Ustream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think that Ustream is a little more robust than JustinTV. I don't think JustinTV is bad.  JustinTV feels like a lot of people like putting soccer games illegally online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that's a big problem for all of these. Stick Ammo is a big problem because they had a lot of cam  girls and it was very hard to live that down you know. Yeah Ustream feels like they're doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  content deals correctly. Right. It's all about the content. Like they have a deal with CBS so they can

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  actually put CBS online legally. Right. And they do. I hate to see anyone win only because it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  good for us that there's some competition and there are different streams. If you go to live.twit.tv  you'll see along the bottom you can click different streams and find the one that works  the best for you at the moment. I'd hate to see one just dominate that. It's not going to be one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They'll be the winner but they'll be like winner with 30% of the market. Right. Okay good. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  fine by me. No I love Brad. Brad's a good friend and he's been very supportive. We started streaming

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on Ustream many many moons ago now. I think that what they really need to do is just take the top  and content and lock them in and do like multi-year deals with them and just go to somebody like you  and say we're going to buy your stream for this many years. Right. Just knowing where the direction  they're going and they should lock in the top content the top 10 people. That's smart. We were

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  exclusive to Stick Amp for a while and I didn't like exclusivity because if their servers had  problems and everybody has problems from time to time then I would be down. But I guess if you have  that much money and you have that much infrastructure now it's not as not as much an issue. Yeah I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so. Oh it can still happen regardless. Yeah I know. I mean diversity is good. That's one reason why  your setup works well Leo is that if one doesn't work well you choose the other. We learned. We

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  learned the hard way that that's kind of what you have to do. Hey this portion of the show brought  to you by my friends at Squarespace. They are going to be really a great friend to Twit because  it's their offices that we're going to use for our New York venture. I'm very kind of them to  step right up. They just we're big fans of them and they're big fans of Twit. I want you to go to  squarespace.com slash twit and and visit Squarespace. It is a web hosting company slash  software company.

And I just want to point out everybody in the audience  if you're hearing my voice it is your geary your humble responsibility to thank the sponsors on  Twitter and Facebook and buzz. You just go thanks at audible that's underscore C O M at Squarespace  and at go to meeting. Just thank them. Yeah I do. I thank them. Boy do I thank them. We wouldn't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You know in fact one of the reasons we can even contemplate this morning show is because the  advertisers all of these advertisers including Squarespace and Citrix has stepped up and said  Ford's going to come along. They said yeah. What is this. I heard about this on the this week. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  was listening to this week in Google and they alluded to it. What is going on. So Squarespace

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  has is moving into a new office. They have still a long term lease on their old office. It's on  Broome streets and so how it's beautiful. Beautiful. And they said well why don't you use it for a  twit east. And I said well you know what I'd like to do is build a studio out there and hire  somebody like I don't know Brett Larson and we're talking to other people as well and I won't say  names but to host a morning show early morning show out daily Monday through Friday live out of  there that is like twit. It's tech focused but it's fun. It's upbeat because we're on all these  portable platforms like the iPhone and the Nexus one and streaming everywhere. You know as soon  in the next few months we'll be streaming everywhere. So couldn't you wake up to a morning  show that is on the Internet instead of on a radio. Wouldn't that be cool. And then you get up you  get up and start making breakfast and you turn on the TV. It's there too. You get in the car. It's  still there. And so that's what that's what we want to do. And I just think that this is going to be  not not merely interesting for us but I think a breakthrough for Internet media

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to I agree. It's it's it's the one it's the it's the final frontier. Yeah it's bringing  it's bringing it all together now because it's on all the platforms. Exactly. And it's that that  prime market of time. As someone who used to employ me once said the only growth in media is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in the morning. The morning shows that's where people are getting up and that's where they listen.  That's where radio makes all of its who is that. Okay that's better. It was just you know with  some interference or something. So I was thinking I was I already got you know Kevin Sellis who does  Internet. It does a weather podcast. He wants to be the weatherman so we're gonna have a staff  meteorologist. But then I thought you know we shouldn't do weather we should do Internet  forecast. Well it's a little congested over May West and going down to the south. Wouldn't that be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be awesome. Are you gonna do any you know you say it's gonna be an Internet show.  You're gonna do any traditional news. Yeah I think we'll have news. Yeah absolutely. We'll have news

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  at the top of every hour just like you would on a regular radio show. Fewer units you know we're  only gonna do maybe five units instead of they do they do you know I work in commercial radio still  19 minutes an hour of commercials. Of commercials. When I take my radio show and edit out all the  commercials news and traffic a three hour show becomes two hours long. So we won't do that much.  We'll do maybe five units an hour. But we will have a lot of those features because it's full  service right. When you get up you need to know those things. Right. And I think you really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be fun. I feel like if you can give people that information entertain them a little bit  and give them a bit of information about a subject that they like which everybody loves tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're golden. Exactly. Anyway it's a really exciting idea. And one of the reasons I'm really  thrilled to have Brett do this is he's in New York. He's cool. He's hip and he knows you know  technology. So it's perfect. We need people like the funny, lively, interesting, young 18 to 34.  You're still under 34 right Brett? Yeah actually I am. Thank goodness 18 to 34. That's why I'm not  doing it. That's why I'm not involved. I'm too old for this stuff. I'm going to become a mogul.  Will it be branded twit? Yeah I think it'll be called twit morning. I don't know exactly what  we're talking about. Oh that's a great idea. Yeah. Oh it'll be branded twit. Yeah wouldn't you listen  if it were especially your fun? Of course. Yeah I'm trying to talk Clayton into doing it with us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a lot of work to do a daily show. I mean it is. We'll have staff for it because it is.  It's a ton of work. You're going to need two engineers and two hosts and a producer, five

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people right? Yeah that's exactly what we're planning. Actually we're planning  four hosts, two of them producer types as well as hosts, an executive producer, engineer.  And then a lot you know what's funny as soon as I mentioned this people have volunteered like crazy.  We have there's so many people back in the New York area who want to be part of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah there's a lot of talent and it's not like there's any place for them to go right now  because tech tv is gone. It really is very little opportunity for a on-air talent. The local news  stations have imploded. Exactly. Yes they have. So the problem is these guys get you know the guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from local tv are overpaid. Well I know and I can't pay that kind of money. So I look for people who

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  are out of work. They have to be entrepreneurial. They have to want to get a percentage of revenue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what we're doing. We're doing a rev share. That's exactly right. Yeah so that will that will

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  see that to me is the way it should have always been. When I was in radio I wanted to cut the ads.  Right. Give me five dollars an hour whatever the crap money I was making but give me a 10 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you're doing the ads so you the the results are tied to you and all that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What time would you start Leo? What time? I don't know what Brett was saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say six to ten and then Brett says that's too early nobody's up at that hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Eight o'clock. The New York metro is weird though because it's it's you've got multiple you've got  it's like multiple rings of people where you've got the people on the island and the people in  New Jersey, Long Island not Manhattan, who get up at five to get into the city by eight.  And then as you get closer your commute you know shrinks down. So your commute times go all the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  way to nine o'clock. And then you'll repeat it because that's why we do it back east. We  pre-did it again for the west coast and frankly you know what I think we're gonna have a separate  channel for and just repeat around the clock because we have people all over the world who  listen who would love to get up to this. Those girls in Denmark you know. They had they said

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they had a lot of snow. There's a lot of snow out here in Denmark. I know why they didn't have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  camera on because because I could tell they were hot. Yeah they were they were definitely  in a hotel with snow around. Yeah we are wearing white ermine earmuffs but that is all  that is all. Lenovo says businesses don't want slates. They they refresh their their tablet  you know they have the Lenovo makes these great convertible tablets but they said we're not going  to make a slate. We're not going to make it which is something without a keyboard. We think our  audience our business audience wants a keyboard. They want convertibles. We are not going to do an

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iPad or anything like it. Yeah it's highly vertical I think if you want to do a slate.  You know doctors I can see these slates. People in the medical profession and something where you  would normally walk around with a clipboard but beyond that I don't see the average business person

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know wanting to go without a keyboard. Are you still Dwight you were kind of negative on the iPad  the day of the announcement. Where are you now here we are a month in we're a month away I presume

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  although we still haven't seen a preview. I'm still I'm the jury is still out. I think  interestingly don't tell my parents they don't listen to this but I would love to get one of  these for them. I think exactly really suit them exactly. I could see like my grandmother

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  wanting to use that. I want to use it. My parents would want to use it though. Well I think one there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's some appeal to older people with it. First of all you can make the fonts on it bigger  very easily. You just have to touch it. I don't see them needing necessarily to type a lot of stuff  into it and I think if you apps will get better things like the dragon dictation app will get  better. I suspect that you'll see probably some of the voice recognition that was in the iPhone 3  GS expanded for more use in the iPad and but is it going to be powerful sitting in the living room  and tapping it reading things on it looking at media on it. I think it's a really good device  for people who aren't necessarily interested in the pain that a real computer can bring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just look at it. Well I look at it from how I would use it and I see it as it looks like an  iPhone that got run over by a steamroller. So it looks like a big iPhone and I don't like I think  that would be kind of nice to take to the gym to have to watch like a TV show while you're running  on the treadmill. But then when you're done you got to carry it around if you want to listen to

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  your music. Yeah no it's not. It's too big for the music. I think it's going to be a bigger success  than anybody realizes because I think there's all these individual little use cases like reader,  TV, gym and there's enough of those in a lot of different slices that people will buy them. I  can't wait to play scramble on it and some people will buy them and then they'll go they'll be all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  these other uses for it. Yeah. What I'm curious to see is what will happen with magazines because I  feel like I mean and this is I'm not looking at a crystal ball this is obvious. Magazines are just  dying by the waist by Left Right Sunday. I feel like if it was done right this really this could

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be good for magazines. John Battelle though he wrote and I thought a very good point where in  which he says look at this is just more media lock-in. It doesn't make sense in the age of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  web to lock content into Apple's you know. 100% right. But there is a browser on it Jason.  I know but the problem is the whole selling of content he's going to try to put through  there like you lock down music and it's just bad. Any publisher who supports this is you know if  it's closed like this it's not a good idea. This is what Jeff Jarvis says he says it's a step

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  backwards this is not the web as we know it the open web and in the long run it has doesn't have  that that ebook reader open format. It supports EPUB. Yeah it's EPUB with DRM on it. Oh there's DRM

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  not necessarily on their on their applications or the books that they're selling it'll be

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have DRM. I think it's I got some inside information though that's pretty interesting about this.  Okay. I talked to a very large publisher and I was like how could you give Steve Jobs all of  this information without getting the email address of your customers because you're in  charge of circulation. If you give away your circulation you're crazy. He go and he said to me  major you know publishing person no we will not do it and I told Steve Jobs we will not do it  unless we have access to the list of people who subscribe who are the subscribers you know. So if  you subscribe to x newspaper the newspaper deserves to know who their subscribers are.  And Steve Jobs rolled over like a puppy and got his belly rubbed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was he wearing that hat that they talked about that he was wearing? I don't know but he basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  acquiesced so I think he has to acquiesce. Well he didn't to the music companies. Yeah this is  different. I know it is but what it points out is is that he's a great poker player in the music  industry and the tv industry or not the tv industry music industry say to him if people

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  download our stuff we get their contact info. Right. If he rolled over then he got something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  as well. Yeah but I feel like the example of the music industry they desperately needed something  to stop the the Napster's and the in the limewire and all the all this rampant free downloading.  They needed something and I really feel like apple provided the best service for them and it  was a great obviously great starting point because of all the things that have come since.  With publishers I'm shocked I would feel I would feel like they would be rolling over just as like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  please help us. Why aren't they more desperate? Well they're they're not more desperate because  they do have an outlet they do have the web. Most most publishers I think have a stated strategy  where they'll give you a whole lot of content free they'll give you some that you pay for  individually and then to get a really good experience which is what the iPad will do.  They'll charge you for those apps you're going to see the New York Times app become a paid app  and they'll be selling subscriptions out of that and so there's like a three tier strategy  and there will still be the free stuff. I think breaking news is going to always be free because  that's a commodity what's happening right now but as things kind of spread out you get longer pieces  and more thoughtful pieces and content that you really can't get anywhere the Wall Street Journal  model you know you'll pay for that and then you'll pay for great presentation. And also it opens up

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the door for some of the larger networks to provide sort of a freemium you know like the you can you  can watch CNN on your cable and it's great and you can go to our website and get stuff for free  and now for a dollar a month this is I'm totally making this up for a dollar a month you can get  access to our you know CNN archives exclusive content that you're you're not gonna you know  they'll stop putting stuff on their website to get you to take it because I feel like news age  the only way news agencies are going to make money on the web because of what you're saying  news is it just a commodity everybody's doing it is archives they got it they got if you put that  stuff out there and you could go back and watch news back when it was really well done you might  people might be able to be going to pay for it. When was that? About 40 years ago. Before Brett started to realize where he was going with this when I was like it's been a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  On second thought. Newspapers have been doing this for a while they we we put our archives at first behind a wall you had to register to see it or even in some of the earlier days of the web you paid to get to the archives  and slowly they've kind of been taking these walls off of it mainly because they thought there would be a lot of page views from archives and it turns out that that at least for a lot of papers that hasn't happened and so  video may be different it'd be really interesting to see to see all these archives from from history on there but there's also the issue of getting them onto the web which is not trivial when you're talking about video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true but there's got to be there's got to be a reason to do it I a great example that I love to share because I thought it was genius when I was at when I was at CBS a couple years ago the subway went on strike and it wasn't the first time the subway went on strike  so what CBS did is they dug up I don't know how because we had this antiquated tape library that was like in a dark wet room.  There's a guy I know what it is it's a buying shelf. Yeah there really was to God rest his soul but there really was a guy you'd go and you'd be like school shooting 1974 104th Street in Amsterdam go down the hall there turn left bottom shelf red tape.  But that what they did was they put up all the news coverage of the subway strike from the 1970s so when we were doing this wall to wall coverage which local news is so fond of of this oh my God the subways aren't working right we could also say.  Hey you know this isn't the first time this has happened go take a look at what happened and see the resolutions and see the the progression of it from the last time that's where.  You can't just tell people here's our archives dig around you have to give people a well this isn't the first time a president has had a physical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know who does that so well is the daily show I don't know who they've got as their librarian or their editors step stream they're using a company called snap stream based here in Houston really.  Yeah that basically does contextual searches within video because they can find anything I mean they'll pull up and I mean in real time and almost because it means like 3 hours later they've got a clip reel on the daily show and it's just amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah it's a great company they've been around for a long time they started out with a they started out with a product that was similar to Tivo for PCs and they got out of the consumer market I think they it's TV beyond TV is what it's called.  Oh I remember that.  Yeah and they have kind of moved out of the consumer market and then are selling this technology to companies like like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To the daily show so they must have it do they have is it done automatically by computers or they have humans tagging it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still not taking in the closed captioning maybe marrying it to the video.  Clever clever clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are people also who will crowd source this for you really simply for a very small amount of money like tag this and then what they do is they'll run two people against the same program and they'll only put in the tags that match then the third person look at the deltas and figure out oh well this person said there's a horse and this other person said oh they're playing basketball oh I see they're playing the game of horse and basketball whatever so you have basically two people in India or Manila or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like it's the mechanical Turk kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah or America you know any place where you have low price workers available Utah Utah Utah.
