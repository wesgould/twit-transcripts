Here's this here's the hero shot with oprah in the middle  And by the way, they all changed their clothes  This is before the event. That's right. That's right.

Transcript:  This is in the steve jobs theater see on the right that elevator that goes down to the theater  We now know what that giant open space on the first floor is for because it's never been used  It was for getting all these celebrities together in one shot. Many of them did not get on stage  Those who did wore completely different outfits. There's m night chamomile and there's a jason mamoa  But there's also people who didn't get on stage people like jennifer garner  um  the uh  What's his name jessie from breaking bad?  erin paul  um, there's a bunch of celebrities here who did not get their shot in the limelight including the luckiest little girl in the world  I don't know who she is. I think she's in c  Of course, she's too young to really appreciate what she's experiencing here, but

End time: 899.42

Transcript:  Not everybody but there has been other little video clips that kind of popped up on social means and I think  Uh leo you had shown one that was oprah  Yeah  Jennifer garner and yeah  So people that were not up on stage some people that were not up on stage have kind of popped up as part of like  You know people just putting up video clips of them  So, um though it's not everyone that's on that stage confirmed  There are a few people that were not on stage that were at the event that we never saw  As far as I know they weren't sitting in the audience. I even did a quick scan. Obviously I was in the way back  So i'm not going to be able to tell from sitting in the back looking down  But I I would think that there would have been more  Sort of hype or fervor around any celebrities sitting in one of the front rows  So i'm not sure that they were even in the theater. I think they might have been in a different area

Start time: 899.98
End time: 921.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they were in the celebrities section, of course. There probably is a secret  Place one of the things I did have to note and i'm sure apple wasn't happy about this  Not a lot of apple watches in evidence on these rich and famous people a lot of nice watches  But I only count one or two apple watches and even those are maybe not apple watches

Start time: 921.54
End time: 927.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So and even from people that have like in the past sort of shown off their apple watches

Start time: 927.14
End time: 953.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You gotta figure tim cook says dude. I gave you that 25 000 gold watch. You're not wearing it  But that was series zero man. I'm not gonna keep wearing that  Give me the new one  Somebody tweeted and I think this was an apt tweet  That hollywood is the only industry that loves itself as much as apple loves itself  And so it's a match made in heaven, isn't it really if you think about it?  It's very self-congratulatory all of this

Start time: 954.90
End time: 970.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although each all those celebrities are being paid by apple to make their shows. It's not like they're  Falling over themselves to get on the platform. Let me say one thing about the upfront. It's in the up the audience for the up  Fronts, it's very clear is for the advertisers to let them know what's coming

Start time: 970.64
End time: 978.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They buy they buy ad time at that point. There's no ads here, right?  No, this is an upfront for the for the people who had subscribed to the service

Start time: 980.02
End time: 1032.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's what you'd think but um  Then you'd think you'd show some tv shows so that we'd be attracted to the service  I've got a new theory that that there are two other audiences that we're not thinking of it really wasn't an audience for the journalist because  I know I was disappointed and I wasn't the only one that that we didn't see more tv  the um  Uh, I think the the audiences were a wall street  Which which needed to be persuaded or it needed to be underlined that we're switching to services  And b  Was the creative the hollywood community that they they're saying look we've got oprah. We've got jennifer  You know, we've got all these people where we're look how much we're promoting them  Come to our platform to make your exclusive stuff for us  Uh, yeah, this was a b2b event

Transcript:  That there was one additional audience and that was the rest of the tech industry and that is for the same point that this was  A demonstration this is a show of force, right?

Transcript:  I combine yeah now philip. You're like me an old time apple fan  And uh in the early days I embraced apple  Because it was the computer for the rest of us. It was almost  Hippie it was I mean steve jobs was a hippie. It was  Counterculture it was those guys in the suits back to the 1984 commercial those guys in the suits use ibm  Were the creatives were the we think different. We're the lucky one, you know the the crazy crazy ones. We're  This is despicable from that point of view. I find this  Horrible. This is apple as the one percent

Start time: 1135.60
End time: 1137.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What aspect of it is despicable? Um

Start time: 1140.18
End time: 1251.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what's been happening to me over the last few years apple?  Okay, this is the most negative description you can all shoot me down  What has happened to me as somebody who loved apple as the crazy ones?  apple has seen a  Plateau in its sales and more importantly, I think a plateau in its ability to innovate  They haven't been able to find that secret sauce  Since the ipad maybe the apple watch certainly not people say the air pods come on really that's the  The best you can come up with so there's this kind of plateauing of  Innovation and what happens when a company gets to that point is sales  Plateau as well because there's no reason to buy the new thing if it's no better than the old thing  And we've seen this in other industries the car industry is a good example  They really weren't able to improve on cars much after the 50s  So they added fins they added chrome it became a fashion industry and to me  Everybody's talking about this is a pivot of apple from being a hardware company  To a services company. This is continuing the pivot apple's been making ever since the apple watch  from a counterculture  creative company to a fashion  Uh company they're all about  Fashion and why fashion because fashion you got to buy a new one every season  Doesn't matter that the hemlines are you know?  Better they're not better. They're just different. That's why you have to buy a new outfit and I think that's unfortunately  What's happened to apple and I I for one am disappointed and I think if you look at the macintosh  If if you look at the stuff that apple's put out lately, it has been a grave disappointment  Now  I'll let you go dan and then and then philip go ahead

Start time: 1253.32
End time: 1319.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry philip  We have been trained to expect innovation on a pretty  Unreasonable schedule meaning like every six twelve and eighteen months  And what apple did is is capitalize in the last decade decade and a half capitalize on  Uh the emergence and growth of gadgets in a technology ecosystem that was fairly sustainable we could grow from  uh  the  miniaturization of things like the ipod into  3g and then 4g because those were fairly fast iterations in the technology that supported  Uh the miniaturization of devices but the next real innovations are going to be  the internet of things data  And maybe powered by 5g, although these things are all coming a lot slower than how we've been trained to expect  uh the the tech innovation cycle to flow so it's just going to take a lot longer for things like  5g to power  iot and iot is just not as understandable by a consumer audience as something like a

Start time: 1320.50

Transcript:  Go ahead philip  Well, you raised a lot of points. So let's see if we can separate them. Um in terms of fashion, uh,  You know hiring the head of burberry's is uh, uh, uh, uh,  It plays right into your your argument, but she's gone now oddly enough

Start time: 1348.42
End time: 1350.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe there wasn't enough fashion for angela arons

Start time: 1351.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I see that strategy as looking at their install base, which is huge and and which is rich billion phones y'all  and uh  And marketing to it, you know, they they know who their customers are  They know what kind of disposable income they have a lot of the customers can afford to buy  A new color watch band whenever they change their suit and you know, there's money to be made. They're not leaving it on the table  It's it's certainly not steve jobs in an ashram, but it's  It's understandable what they're doing. The other thing though about innovation is I tend to think of apple  Kind of like the pixar of technology  They make hits  uh  They they do screw up from time to time whereas pixar doesn't but they you know, they've got this system for  Re it for iterating and and they've got they you know, they've got really good access to the next technology that's coming  Uh, they they hire some pretty smart engineers. So i'm assuming that what we have right now is sort of the interregnum  between  the watch and the  Uh and the air pods which I disagree about the air parts  I think the air pods are are magnificent, uh piece of technology that nobody else can equal right now  Because apple can miniaturize better than a lot of their competitors  But that that apple I assume is working on other stuff and we hear rumors and of things about you know  Glasses with with things printed on them on the inside and cars way way down if that ever happens  Uh  You're assuming that apple is is going to fail at those things  I'm assuming based on their track record that they'll probably deliver something either they'll deliver something that's  Pretty pretty compelling or they'll drop it like the uh air power  You know if if it ain't good, they're not going to make it  Anyway, that's that's my take on what you're saying there

I disagree  Well, yeah  But well, but that's part of the problem and and  one of the reasons, uh  you  um  Create a credit card if you're apple  Is because apple pay isn't as successful  As they would like it to be  now I guess we could debate the success of apple pay or not, but uh

Transcript:  Yeah, and I I don't need to debate the success or failure of apple pay. Um  it clearly the reason for the card is to is to uh,  Stimulate its growth  And I think that the card is maybe the most interesting thing apple announced on monday  By the way, one more thing before we get to the card only one thing that apple showed is available now and that's news plus  Which is a very little changed version of the texture app that they bought added to apple news  Everything else is down the road a piece the card maybe in the summer  The tv and the arcade in the fall no prices announced for those  So these are very early announcements of the other three products, but I think the credit card potentially is huge for apple

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was some really interesting little tidbits in there that actually I was impressed with for the the biggest one  I um mistakenly assumed that  The interest rate that you would get which is between 13 and 24  If you miss a payment or have a late payment that you would be um,  Charged a late rate. Yeah, we all reported that and panzerino said that's not true  That to me is a really big deal that that they're not going to charge a late interest rate because that is exactly one of those  um high expenses that makes  um  I'd rather have a late fee than to have my my interest rates go up even one or two percent because that that goes forever until you  Can reevaluate your your interest rate or your um  Uh your credit score so that's such a big deal that they are not going to do that that there's no late fee and there's no  interest rate charge  Um based off of off of whether or not you have a missed payment or a late payment on that

Transcript:  And it's dead on arrival if that's what it is. It won't come on. I read somewhere else  There was probably 70 plus which is more like it it from apple's literature. It sounds like  They'll take your credit. They'll they'll give you the card, but they're going to adjust your

Start time: 1997.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interest rates depending on how bad your credit. So this is what panzerino says apparel interest rates  Aren't really much different than other credit cards. The lowest is 13.24 percent. The highest is 24  But he says apple will do something innovative they'll place users who sign up at the lower end of the tier they land in due to  their credit score  so they you may get a lower rate from apple you'll have to  I think the most important thing and this is what i've been telling people is  Don't just say oh, it's apple. It's a titanium card. I have to have it  But but actually compare rates using nerdwalt or something like that to see  What the rate you're going to get but if this is true then apple might give you a better rate for your credit score than others  Will I don't know what the bottom what the minimum is?

You can get it immediately  Or you can wait till next day  Which is that that's pretty normal for those kind of like peer-to-peer style things  so it it's probably something similar to that where if you need your  You know one two or three percent cash back right now to give you two gallons of gas or something like that  You can pay that 25 cent fee or you can just wait until it goes into your bank account

All right, but but what you're saying is actually  It it's a design flaw that just because you've increased the the font so that you can see it better  I think that it's it's important for us to be able to digest the information the way the the  The way it was originally intended to be digested. So the fact that it truncates the headline it can be very frustrating. Um, I think on on  The ipad I had it all the way up. So i'm gonna so you're saying

I can't read them, but their headlines are all there  Okay, so I have two complaints about apple news. Let me finish because I do have one other  All right, and by the way, costco dad's still truncated  But just a little bit less  Hot costco dad charms the internet after he's astounded by a successful shopping tee  Don't know what it is  The problem is if I click on this  Apple news is going to take that as a signal that I like this story  And it's going to give me more crap that I don't want to read  So i'm not I can't even find out what the headline reads  But the real complaint I have is that it's a walled garden  There is no way to share into or out of this without sending a link to apple news  Which is not very helpful  Yeah, I is that just me am I doing that wrong also, but I feel like if I use flipboard I can share a link  To the actual article if I use the web I can easily share a link to the actual article. I use pinboard  That's how we do our news gathering here  You know, I come from the old school radio days where you clip out pieces, you know  Pieces from the newspaper you put them in a folder and bring it to the show  I still do that digitally, but I can't do it with apple news.

It's not intuitive  Which I think that will get better apple's gonna, you know make this work a little bit better for us  But there's been quite a few people who would say things like I don't I don't know where to find  How do I favorite a magazine or just like what you're saying? How do I find back issues?  It's not intuitive right now and the app definitely needs a lot of work to make those things more  Friendly for us as as readers and users, which I think apple will definitely work on throughout  The months they're going to figure out what works and what doesn't work and change that accordingly as best I can tell news

Transcript:  Plus is is really just a reskinned  texture and I think you'll for instance  one of the  things I really liked when they showed it off was  Some at least in some  periodicals you're going to get a kind of apple news layout and others you're just going to get the old pdf layout and  Right, I guess who was it that did?  Vitechi did a  Federico Vitechi. He looked at every single every single one of them and about half of them have have the new apple news  Production and half of them don't so right now so if time I can scroll the magazine cover up by the way  They showed all the motion covers. I don't find very many of them  You can scroll the cover up and see it a simple table of contents or scroll it left  Oh, maybe I can't do that. I could do it on the ipad  Uh, and I was getting the pdf version of the magazine, which is basically  A let me see if yeah, it does that here with pc world  Uh, basically a scan of the magazine, you know, so  I don't I don't know

Transcript:  Leo before we move on out of this and this is not  Going to make you any happier, but you can send a link or share a link outside of apple news  You just have to make an extra step by click tapping into show in safari  Oh, you have to open safari and then you can show right? I I know that that's still just  Does it's not what it should be and what you would want it to be but just you know, it's there  It's just not as convenient

Start time: 3161.04
End time: 3184.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I knew that there was an open in safari and of course once you're in safari you're in the real world again  I just I think really what i'm saying is it's a walled garden and apple really is  To me this is damaging to the web. I made this argument you were there lori on tuesday  That this kind of walled garden of content is  Damaging to an open free and open web  I don't know. Maybe again. I'm just an old-timer

Transcript:  And obviously that's what the magazines thought when they you know said, all right, we'll stay  wall street journal  Uh is there in some oddly limited form? Although there's some debate over how much of the journal you get  But the new york times and the washington post are not they're there as the regular news but not part of news plus  And la times is which is interesting. I think it's an opportunity  I think this is what you're going to see is la times says well  We would like to be seen as a national newspaper. Maybe this is a way  To get that kind of national profile on apple news. Yeah, I think it's smart for them

Start time: 3230.24
End time: 3237.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think andy and ako made a very good point  Which is that local papers are less enticed to be part of this because they give up so much  Not merely revenue but uh customer information that it just doesn't make sense  For them because they're local  Uh to be in a national play like news plus

Start time: 3256.42
End time: 3325.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what though if if there were more national news organizations that participated in the in the news app or in news plus  I think um  We might be more inclined to spend money on those digital subscriptions for our local newspapers. Um  like the sacramento b  Um has a has a paywall after you hit your five five articles paywalls are not a good solution. Are they?  well, it's it's  It's I they're trying to figure out a way to to make money in this new digital world  So there's going to be a lot of hits and misses and a lot of kind of experiments with how to how to make money  Off of this stuff  But if i'm only paying ten dollars a month for a bunch of international news or national news organizations  I'm going to be much more inclined to spend that extra ten dollars a month for my local sacramento b  Let's say or whatever your local  organization is just  Because you feel  Well, this is my community and I want to read more about my community  But I also want to continue to learn about everything that's going on in the rest of the country  So it could be good. It could help sort of level the playing field and kind of  Provide more opportunities for organizations to grow

Transcript:  I don't know. Uh, I I think we will find out in the future  Uh, like I said earlier my concern is that this could commodify news  Uh, we've seen that happen in the past with  Facebook and other outlets, uh, it it could be good. Uh like  I don't know that i'd be more inclined to spend money on local news if  Uh more national news outlets were included in apple news  But I do like the idea of elevating the profile of outlets like the li times and maybe the san francisco chronicle and others  um, I I don't know I  I'm very conflicted. I don't know if i'll continue to spend money on apple news  but every month a significant portion of my media diet and my budget goes to supporting news because it's incredibly  Important now more than ever that we vote with our pockets and and say hey look  News local and national is incredibly important  Vetted news reported news.

Transcript:  Um, I I think we can defer discussion of apple arcade and uh apple tv plus till they actually appear  Because there's a lot of question marks, you know a lot of things we don't know  I think the only thing I might say about apple tv plus is while they've got all those people on those dioceses and on those  Pedestals and it's pretty impressive  I think there's a lot of question about whether real whether creatives are going to want to go there  Given apple's apparent  Interest in making it a family  platform  You're not going to see a breaking bad there. You're not going to see  Uh true blood there. You're not going to see a sopranos there. You're going to see wholesome entertainment

Start time: 3447.66
End time: 3472.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right and there've been reports that the reason there's nothing to show yet is because  Tim cook and eddie q have been incredibly or someone has been intrusive and telling people what they can and can't do and you know if you  HBO is smart. They hire really good people and they say okay, you're on your own  We're not going to interfere right and that's what hollywood got some while I hear absolutely creatives celebrate hbo for that reason. I don't know if the new

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  time warner  Will be the same in fact, I think hbo's things might be different at hbo soon  Yeah, I think it's about to change which would be sad, but goodness knows creatives have many places to go  Just because apple's waving a checkbook  Doesn't mean amazon and netflix aren't and uh, I think ultimately creatives are going to choose the place where they can create  Their vision as best as they can  Um a couple more apple items then we'll get off this at this is not supposed to be the apple show  Um air power is dead  Yeah, yeah

Start time: 3506.30
End time: 3542.26

Transcript:  Wasn't that crazy?  Wow, I was actually in the middle of actually at the end of the the imore podcast show  We were we were winding down and we were actually had been making jokes about  You know will apple launch air power while we're in the middle of our our podcast  So I had twitter up just in case, you know  There was a sudden announcement while we were talking and we were saying our goodbyes and sure enough that tech crunch article popped up  And you know, we're all just like ah, and I said wait wait wait  And then we were just stunned the three of us just kind of sat there almost not talking for a second like

Transcript:  What just happened? It's not I mean, let's face it. This is not a major project project product  Apple did announce it two years ago with the iphone 10  Uh, in fact when they announced it there was no, uh, there were no airpod wireless charging cases  So we knew they'd have to do that too. They did do that  In fact people are starting to get their new airpod 2s already  But apparently it was difficult to make the air power. Ifixit had an article that's that guessed  That the problem would be fcc approval because apple, you know most uh,  Qi chargers wireless chargers have one or two coils  Those coils are matched to a coil in the device  and charge the device via inductance  But apple's air power wanted to have many coils up to 32  So that you could put the phone anywhere any position or device any position our device on the pad would work  Problem with that according to engineers is when you have multiple coils they interact  You get standing waves and suddenly you get a lot of radio noise coming out of these things  and so ifixit is is

Start time: 3629.62
End time: 3643.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, so if you take ifixit's article at its word, which really does make a lot of sense then this idea that apple  Um, you know, they failed to make it that's wrong. They actually did it made it. It's just that it's dangerous

Transcript:  Right  According to gruber, uh who heard from his little birdies six months ago  Uh, there was a just a heated debate within the apple engineering community  And half of them said it ain't they looked at it and they said it ain't going to work  And they're very smug right now because they were right

Start time: 3666.16
End time: 3698.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I don't this is one where i'm not going to hit apple for this one at all because they tried something  Yeah, yeah, and they didn't ship a bad product and they didn't ship something that didn't work or kill people  Two thumbs up on that good on them. Maybe they shouldn't have announced it two years ago  This is something. I don't know that i've been noticing a lot in the tech community  I raised this with the on windows weekly a lot of vaporware is back, baby  Mm-hmm google stadia. I mean not till the end of the year apple announced two products  That won't be out till the end of the year. Another product won't be out till the summer

Start time: 3707.32
End time: 3724.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  disciplined about not announcing stuff  The iphone they announced the first iphone in january  And it shipped in june, but that's because they had to get fcc approval and they didn't want anybody to know about it  I understand that typically though apple is pretty good about this  Why did they announce it so soon?

Start time: 3725.74
End time: 3785.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so yeah, especially  That's that is something that seems really strange about that if they weren't 100 sure that this was going to happen  They could have just kept it to their to themselves. There's no need to announce this at all  especially when um  If they if they would have eventually let's say instead of it  Being canceled they announced it and it and it launched on friday  At this point there's been so much hubbub about whether or not it will happen that a lot of people would have been  Disappointed in any way that or what it's just it's just another charging pad  And sure it would have had great features, but because apple took nearly two years to put it out  Everybody would have just kind of been like well who cares now  so, you know  Announcing it two years before it was going to be available if if it you know in  In a different universe it did become available. It really was kind of  Odd that they wanted to get everybody excited about this charging pad that they were making and then just not do it

Start time: 3786.22
End time: 3791.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Instead of keeping it secret established that they were serious about wireless charging. So serious

Start time: 3793.86
End time: 3832.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They announced it at the same time they took away the um, uh, the  the uh  Earphone plug earphone. Yep. So  Yeah, so they had to come up with an alternative solution to the to that plug  And that was because he lost your power. You lost your ability to both power and listen to music at the same time, right?  Yeah  But you know  I think the other thing that might have happened is in the two years or the year and a half that we were waiting for it  all these cheap, uh  Disks came out and the the fields become commodified  And one thing we know about apple is that they don't like to put out products that they don't make a lot of money on

Start time: 3833.04
End time: 3850.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So this even before apple went wireless. There were a lot of wireless chargers  Yeah, they were the last to the market with a char wireless charging  So, I don't know if that's changed dramatically but what but philip you've been around you remember the early days of the computing industry where vaporware  Was very common

Start time: 3850.98
End time: 3873.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sure, and you did it for a couple of reasons one was to chase people out of the market  You know let them know that you're going to come out with a killer product and it's going to come out in six months and it  Just kills the competition. Uh, if you you know, if you're the right kind of company, uh, it's the kind of thing dell tried to do  Well, the famous one was osborne computer you probably go back that long he osborne himself

And of course  Notice the problem is apparent in the headline in the article, but even better she's put switches in  So read with the e's on or off  Read with the r's on or off because I guess her keyboard's malfunctioning  Oh, maybe you'd like to read it with double e's another problem people are having my wife has a double space bar  On her macbook. How about double t's you can have double e's and double t's  And and on and on and on apple. I should turn all these off so I can read the damn thing  Uh read with e's and r's but do not read with double e's  and double t's  apple  Told her because it's joanna stern writing in the wall street journal  We're uh, we're aware that a small number of users are having issues with their third generation butterfly keyboard  And for that we are sorry  The vast majority of mac notebook customers are having a positive experience with the keyboard  That's it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I think when the macbook pro with butterfly keyboard first came out in 2016, I think  Immediately there were problems and  I get that it's a small portion of people but there were enough people that it should have been recognized immediately and  Something should have been done about it. And then sure they they put out the third generation  Butterfly keyboard which had the little  membrane that helped protect from from  Dust and dirt getting in so it was supposed to improve it  but  There for apple to be so dismissive about so many people and again  Obviously they they've got their numbers and it's a small portion of people but it's a large enough portion of people  I have it my macbook pro has double t's and double i's really so  Yeah, so there's two out of four of us. That's 50 percent of us that have problems with my wife. It's three

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's big. It's big enough that there should be something done about it and there's certainly  Um, like joanna was saying there's a point at which they keep putting out  more  Macbooks with this keyboard even though they know that we're all having there's a lot of us that are having problem with it  they're not they're not just throwing it away and starting from scratch they're trying to  Incrementally fix it but it's still a problem and at some point  Nobody's going to want to get a macbook pro or a macbook or a macbook air  Because they're not they're too worried about whether or not they're going to have a keyboard that's got some kind of fault to it.

Oh, wait a minute  Uh, actually this would make an excellent ipad if anybody would just make a 30 inch ipad i'd buy that  Our show today brought to you by a fabulous  my mattress  casper  The sleep brand that continues to change the mattress world. They were the first  to realize  That there was this huge inequity in mattress buying  The mattress manufacturer would make it then sell it to a middleman a mattress store  Where they would inflate the price by more than doubling it  And and all for the privilege of lying on that mattress for five minutes in front of a salesperson looking at you funny  And decide because you need to lie on that mattress before you buy it  Now perhaps that's true, but wouldn't it be better?  To buy direct from the manufacturer at a fraction of the cost and then have a hundred nights to sleep on the mattress  Before deciding that's the casper  revolution  They're cutting the cost of dealing with resellers and showrooms passing that savings on to you  And they know that you want to try before you buy so you get free delivery and painless returns within a hundred day period  You don't have to lie down in a showroom ever again. My goodness. These are nice mattresses. I love our caspers  We had the original casper mattress which combined multiple supportive memory phones  for this kind of wild  Sleep surface with but it has both just the right sink and the right bounce  It's both soft and firm at the same time and it's breathable  So you sleep cool and regulate your temperature throughout the night as you can see in the video. It comes in a very compact box  That's a queen size. This is our guest room  We just I just love these mattresses. Look at this and unlike any mattress. I've bought before there's no time to air them out  They smell fresh as a daisy from the moment you open the box  And are they comfy you will love your casper mattress buy it easily online  Completely risk-free  Long-lasting comfort and support we've had ours for several years now  In fact, we've bought many more. I got one for my son when he went to college  And uh, and it was so affordable after four years. You can leave it there. We'll get you a new one when you move into your apartment  casper knows  That you want mattresses made in the u.s  With to the highest environmental production standards.

Transcript:  So, uh dan patterson  I figure of all the people you've got connections  I don't know about do you know gavin de becker? Do you know of gavin de becker and what do you know of gavin de becker?  I do not know gavin de becker. So this is the guy he's been around for a long time  He's writing in the daily beast. He is  jeff bezos's security guy  For 40 years i've advised at-risk public figures and government agencies on high stakes security matters  My careers included working with the cia fbi at the reagan white house counseling foreign foreign leaders advising on controversial  murder cases  He's the guy who bezos brought in when  ami the publishers of the national inquirer  Said started publishing texts from bezos to his girlfriend  sex i should say  ami by the way, this is an opinion piece  But uh, so we're gonna have to consider it that uh break it down ami the national inquirer publishers  We're very quick to tell de becker in not quite in so many words but apply to de becker  That they got the texts  from bezos's  Girlfriend lauren sanchez's estranged brother  Who didn't like bezos?  and  De becker says ami I practically pinned a kick me sign on michael sanchez. Whoa, this is the guy  but  De becker's dug a little deeper  And bezos now believes in de becker confirms that in fact it was saudi arabia  That sold this information to ami  And that fact saudi arabia bezos says has been inside his phone and bugging him for a long time  time  Now I guess you know, I mean we I don't know why anybody would make that up  Um, I think de becker. I don't know how credible de becker is i've heard his name for a long long time  Um

Transcript:  He's considered a very serious, uh private eye, yeah  Um, you know, he's not lying about his record  I thought that the distinction was between the the the texts that the brother  may have had access to  uh because  uh, I don't know, uh, but  then  How did someone get a hold of the pictures?  that are in  um  The iphones and that that's not something breaking nation.

Start time: 5401.90
End time: 5456.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the key there is what you said leo, uh that it was a nation state or allegedly a nation state actor  And whether these allegations are true or not, we do know that saudi arabia has played an increasing role  Uh in silicon valley and we know that nation states are often threat actors  and that the targets are often  asynchronous at least in terms of  Their ability to counter these strikes we see the rise of iran as well  uh israel for sure is a powerful nation state actor  china  and  Russia are all acting on the national or international stage and their targets can be anyone raging raised raising  ranging from bezos to  Uh other large nation states or other large companies cyber war global cyber war is simply a fact of life now

Transcript:  Uh, de becker says he's handed over the evidence, uh to law enforcement. He said this is my last public statement on the matter  Um, he says we're not clear to what degree if any ami was aware of what was going on  But it was interesting that they so quickly threw sanchez under the bus  And of course you may remember new york times said that the saudis had a embedded  A spy I guess inside twitter twitter fired that person  That you know the saudis have targeted  um  Bezos has already been reported by cnn and bloomberg and the daily beast so it's not this is not new  Uh, in fact, there have been public calls for boycotts against amazon and it's saudi subsidiary suc.com  That's interesting I I don't I mean I don't know what to say about it I bring it up  Uh only because I think we're going to hear more and more stories of nation states getting involved in  politics

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the motivation here would have been that the washington post has been going after the murder of kashoggi  Full show you worked for the washington post. Yes  So and bezos owns it so that he would be the target. Yeah. Thank you for yeah for connecting those thoughts for us

Transcript:  Uh speaking of hacking asus  Is being uh accused of  Using having its updater used to embed malware on asus computers  This first came from kaspersky labs the russian security researcher later confirmed  for motherboard by uh, I think semantek  The story is kind of interesting because even though thousands of computers tens of thousands hundreds of thousands of computers  Asus computers had this malware installed signed certificate  From asus using the asus updater  But only 600 machine on 600 machines was it activated?  And it was activated if you look if you look at the malware was activated by mac address  So the perpetrators of this and I don't think it was asus  I think it's much more likely that asus had an advanced persistent threat a hacker inside their network  That uh was able to sneak this into a payload of an update  Which is why asus signed it and pushed it  But where did they get the mac addresses and why were those mac addresses particularly  Chosen I think is very interesting. I think this is pretty clearly another  Nation state and I I proposed when steve gibson talked about this on security now at an example scenario  Let's say  North korea learned that the uh, uh  Korean embassy in washington had just taken an order of I don't know 600 asus computers  It wouldn't be too hard to figure out what those mac addresses are and then try to infect them to put malware on there  Or the israeli government took 600 asus computers and the saudis, uh, perhaps there you could think of a lot of scenarios where  You would spread malware everywhere  With the aim of merely targeting a handful of machines  Any thoughts about this or is this just just yet another one to put in the folder

Transcript:  I think that the reason would I go ahead go ahead and then down  the fear that that comes to me when I read something like this is how dangerous it is that um, the supply chain is kind of a  a  Ground zero for what becomes a future attack a lot of times when we hear about  viruses or um  Cyber attacks a lot of us, um in the tech world that we can say to you  Don't freak out. The only way this will happen is if somebody has access to your physical computer and nobody has that access  You're fine. And then when you when you read something like this, you're kind of like, oh wait that this could happen  It in the supply chain that could then eventually  affect us in the future, even though  Nobody's you know sneaking into our house and turning on our uh, you know  Cameras at night or something like that. This is something that can affect us  Um in our hardware which could then eventually affect us in our software

That they've got  Spy chips in there already and that you know, that's the reason why the u.s  Has banned them and the rest they have the canadians arrest the c  fo  um  I have no idea whether it's possible and I don't even know how you  Make sure how would you test?  Uh one of these servers to find out if it was spying on you know was was  Was looking at every piece of traffic that went through it. How would you find out?

Transcript:  Well, I I think you know to lori's point in the supply chain the reason you  An attack like this exists is to obfuscate the intended target  And you know we as consumers might not be as at risk from threat actors, uh  performing behaviors like this, uh, but certainly those in uh government and  Contractors of the government are particularly vulnerable  and you know scattering this  across the supply chain is  has a potential for  A lot of distributed access by what you said there initially leo and apt

Transcript:  It's interesting because you may remember when c cleaner  Which is a very uh popular although I think of dubious value cleanup tool that pc users use  Uh  In 2017 was delivering malware to customers via a signed software  update  But to connect the dots in a weird way. This is from the motherboard article  Uh that it may have been the same attackers  Behind the c cleaner attacks and it is thought that asus this is according  Uh to one security researcher was one of the primary targets of the c cleaner attack  So this is this is really important to understand  how uh  persistent  and  Clever nation state attackers can be and how long term their goals can be if they  perpetrated a malware  payload in 2017 with the intent of getting into asus  So that they could lend later after sitting on asus's network for a while and figuring things out  You know target 600 a mere 600 asus computers two years later  That's a pretty this is a tough thing to beat  This is going to be harder and harder and we're going to see a lot more about this now  There is some question about what is asus's culpability if anything asus was slow to tell people about this  Uh, they were warned about it in january. They took their time. I understand, you know, sometimes it's embarrassing  To talk about this stuff. Sometimes you want to research it before you talk about it  They took a long time to tell their customers about it  That's got to change and that's one thing. I like about gdpr is time, you know short time frames for  Revealing breaches and things like that. You can't keep this stuff secret in the eu  We're going to see a lot more of this and then of course when you talk about supply chain lori that brings up the famous  Bloomberg super micro story, which has never proven  A supply chain attack a hardware supply chain attack on super micros computers. I think there's  I think there's I always look to you dad. I don't know why it's not like you're a hacker  But I feel like you have you have you have your feelers in this community  I feel like this is just known that the supply chain is vulnerable

I mean it's it is my community and you know as much as it's my beats us  Security is but um  I I mean the supply chain is vulnerable and will continue to become more vulnerable as it becomes more diverse  And especially as I I feel like a broken record every time I talk about the internet of things  But this is the next coming hardware  thing in edge computing and as we have  Millions or billions of more devices come online and how many of them have a default password of password or access?  Default password of password or admin or are made by some strange vendor somewhere  We can just assume that a certain percentage of the connected device ecosystem  Ranging from an iot device to a mobile device to a computer to who knows what is going to be vulnerable

Is that right?  You're just gonna have to guess  Normally we have a promo  uh our show today  I should have asked ahead of time before I started that tease our show today brought to you by  Hot wasabi wasabi is hot cloud storage good to remember right wasabi  That's that green ball on the sushi platter. You don't pop in your mouth  But on the other hand wasabi is the hot cloud storage alternative. You really do want to consider  I know when people are moving to the cloud, of course and everybody's moving to the cloud in one way or another effect  The estimate is that there'll be 163  zettabytes  In the cloud by 2025 in the next five years. That's that's 163 followed by 21 zeros  That's a lot of data  There are a lot of companies vying for your data the big three, of course  But I want to tell you I want you to add a fourth to your shopping list wasabi  Wasabi was founded by jeff flowers and david friend two guys i've known for a long long time. They founded  Carbonite and the thing that they discovered when they in fact patented  When they created carbonite was a revolutionary process that lays data on disks sequentially as opposed to  In blocks how everybody else does it that results in storage that's 80 cheaper and 600 faster  than amazon's s3  And that means wasabi can do it better for less  For you wasabi  Is going to provide cloud storage that is in most cases more secure than your on-premises storage  That's faster  It's very simple. There's just one tier of service  And unlike the other guys free unlimited egress  So you don't have to budget for well how much download are they going to want? No, you don't have to worry about it  And and I have to say it is really secure hipa finra and cjis compliant. That's important  And if you want to move a petabyte of data up to the cloud, you can do that with the wasabi ball  It's awesome. Is they send it to your premises you copy your data over you send it back now. You're in the cloud  Wasabi is awesome. I understand you've not heard of them before unless you've been listening to our show  But I want you to at least check them out  Wasabi.com  Add them to your shopping list check them out. There's one more feature  I really love the ability to say some data is immutable. That's so important. That means  No fumble fingered employee. No ransomware can modify that cloud data. It's immutable. It's safe  enterprise grade cloud storage  A fifth the price of traditional vendors up to six times faster  No hidden fees for egress. Oh one more thing  The api is the same as amazon's s3. So you already know how to use it  It's basically plug compatible with s3 for a lot less  Go to wasabi.com and use the offer code twit for a month of unlimited storage just to try it  Copy everything up there  Wasabi.com is the offer code twit  Or contact sales to find out more about wasabi  Bring that to your boss say boss  You never heard of them. I know but this company's 80 cheaper six times faster. They've got immutable storage  It's s3 compatible  We gotta at least try them out wasabi.com  Well, I don't know whether to say this is the end of the world as we know it or just the beginning of the end  Of the world as we know it  I'll let you be the judge  the eu has  approved the  Copyright directive we were all afraid they would approve  including article  11 and 13 now cast as article 17. So they might might fool you but a very scary bill now  It won't be law. It's a directive not a law. It won't be law until all of the  countries in the eu  Incorporate it into their own legal code, but that will happen quickly. I think in some countries like france who really wanted this  article 11 is  the snippet article  Uh, and this is something that was tried both in spain and germany with not the best effect  They don't like it that google publishes snippets of content they being axel springer and the other publishers in the eu  That as google publishes snippets of their content and search results. They say knock it off  Uh, so that's article 11. I'm much more worried about article 13 now 17  because that says that  uh  sites like facebook twitter  youtube have to proactively monitor for copyright violations  Proactively, that means before the content is posted  They have to make sure that the copyright is unencumbered  and  Honestly, this is very scary to companies like mine where almost everything we do  Including playing those apple clips  is a comment on  Copyrighted material there is no  Allowance for for fair use in the new law  Five million petitioners, you know five million people signed petitions against it  There were hundreds of thousands of protesters on the streets of europe last weekend  But it passed  So now what am I am I over am I overly worried?

Transcript:  When when the internet exists like start sort of started when the world wide web became more publicly  Available to all of us. I remember thinking this is the wild west right now  There's no regulations. You can do what you want. You can start a website with any name  There's nobody out there who's regulating it or owning it and making you license or buy anything  And I knew then and this was a long time ago that this would not last and frankly  It's lasted a lot longer than I thought it would it's it's like when  when um broadcasting radio  First started you you could just as long as you had something that could handle a channel  You could make your own radio station. There was nobody  Telling you that you had to buy or rent or license  You know whyz or something like that  It was just open to everyone and then regulations started coming into place people started owning the airwaves  And I think that's what we're seeing now with the internet.

There's the internet companies that  That like that they get to do it and then if if they do something wrong they can then correct it  And the copyright holders who say no, no, you can't put it up.

It's another thing  Well for us for instance  Are we gonna have to block our podcast from listeners in the eu because we could be liable to prosecution because we comment  Everything we do every one of these stories i'm pulling up an article from in a newspaper or magazine that we're referring to  That's what we do.

It's like, um  What do they call that when the firefighters start a burn going in the other direction to keep the town from burning up?  It's a backfire  Uh, you know damn do you have a thought on the articles 11 and 17?

Zuckerberg's  Mr. Zuckerberg's  Commentary the other day that this is what the entire tech industry in the united states is doing  Yeah, trying to defend itself by getting ahead of itself. Uh, you know  We've spoken with warren's camp  Uh, and interestingly, although he's not in the field yet, uh, john casick's camp has some fairly sophisticated thoughts about regulation  And so it'll be interesting to see the the rhetoric evolve over the next year and a half  During the campaign cycle, I don't know that we're going to see  Uh federal regulation anytime soon, but I think that we can absolutely expect state regulation, especially from california

Transcript:  Yeah, we already have a very extreme california privacy bill, uh passed into law.

Start time: 6804.34
End time: 6862.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah rubio has proposed that you know, um  For those of you who would like a fairly good example of what regulation might look like  In a form that still allows tech innovation to happen at rapid scale  but  Protects consumers. I would highly recommend reading robert magnum. E's book zucht  It's not just a takedown of zuckerberg  It's and it's not just a biography of magnum. E  It's a really good examination of what consumer privacy regulation might look like and what the posture of consumers  might want to have  Going forward, you know instead of looking at data as this kind of  amorphous, uh and and  Abstract thing that different companies own  Uh thinking about data a lot like your health care records  I think that we could see regulation look similar or take similar shape to what macmany has proposed

I actually went to school with him. He is a character. Uh,  I would love to know what he thinks about mark's uh op-ed on the washington post calling for more regulation  Because it's really a jujitsu move. I mean he's basically saying  Lawmakers often tell me we have too much power. We facebook has too much power for speech. Frankly, I agree  I've come to believe we shouldn't make so many important decisions about speech on our own  So we're creating an independent body so people can appeal our decisions and working with governments including french officials  On ensuring the effectiveness of content review systems  I think mark would love to pass the burden on to  government  You decide we don't want we don't have to decide

Oh, you know that self-driving car?  conundrum  Where uh the the car i've you know, it's been stated in a lot of ways  But but essentially the car is forced to make an ethical decision between let's use the most  dramatic case killing its occupants or running over a grandma and two young children  And what should the car do?  And you know some say well should always protect the occupants. Yes, but those young children  Have a life ahead of them and you're an old man driving the car. We should kill you  And and they're and and they're that's at least one meeting right there  That's a month shot right there on that subject alone  Let's take one final break  Uh, and then we'll we'll run through a bunch of uh smaller stories to wrap this  Thing up our show today brought to you. Oh, I love where's my quip. Do I have a quip here?  Oh, I have it at home my quip toothbrush i'm about to go on a vacation to hawaii and I will pack the quip  The quip electric toothbrush  Is the first subscription electric toothbrush accepted by the american dental association  It was designed to make brushing your teeth easier  More enjoyable and more affordable created by dentists loved by people it uses  gentle sonic vibrations  Dentists recommend people brush too hard. You don't want  A brush that's too hard. This is gentle on sensitive gums  Many electric toothbrushes are too abrasive bad for your teeth not the quip. It's built-in two-minute timer pulses every 30 seconds  So, you know when to switch sides make sure you clean your whole mouth evenly  90 of us don't do that  shocking  I do i've got the quip to remind me and I love the cover  which can either work as a stand or  I it has a little strip on the back that you could adhere it to your mirror or and then that way  It's I never forget to brush. It's right there staring me in the face  And also declutters notice there's no charger  One of the things I love about the quip and the reason it's the best travel toothbrush ever it doesn't have a charger  It has a triple a battery inside when it dies. You don't charge it. You just get another battery. In fact  I love this brush heads are automatically delivered on a dentist recommended schedule every three months for just five dollars  Friendly reminder when it's time for a refresh you put a new head on it stay committed your all health  Quip is one of the first electric toothbrushes accepted by the ada  They have thousands of verified five-star reviews add my name to that list  Backed by over 20 000 dental professionals and here's the best part if you've looked at electric toothbrushes at over 100  Dollars quip starts at just 25 dollars  It's so affordable. We actually got an extra quip with a couple of extra heads for sleepovers  Because you know what teenage boys when they come for sleepovers, i've learned this never bring a toothbrush, right?  never  Too bad.

That's not it. I searched for plan b and I found a different plan b  I'll find it  But the problem is right now apple's fighting it state by state because they want all repairs to go to the apple store or to apple  Directly, they don't want third-party repairs of iphones. They have there's some merit in that they one of the things they say is well  If you if you let a third party repair your iphone we can't guarantee its security afterwards

We're going to make the screws  Um, you know proprietary what you're doing is this is my phone that I paid for and you are acting like it's your phone  You're you're treating it like it's something that i've rented from you instead of something that i've purchased myself  I should have the right  To make it less secure that that is my right as the owner of this phone to make those decisions  Um, that's why I think the right to repair is a really great  A really great thing because we need to be able to right right now, especially with with iphones and apple devices  They're completely unreparable  Without going directly to apple or by using these really expensive things  They're difficult to figure out you have to know what you're doing. I fix it as a great  Organization that helps us learn these things but those kinds of um  user  Guides don't exist from the company themselves  And so we do risk potentially ruining our devices by just trying to do something as simple as fixing a cracked screen  That shouldn't be the case. I should have the right to get a screen fixed without worrying about  Um, you know with or just to be able to do it at all. Here's the story motherboard once again. They're good boy

It seems clear to me. It would be totally possible  To comply with right to repair  My reading is it's a plan b just in case  You get pregnant yeah, just in case  Uh, interestingly warren did not mention apple but did mention  John deer and the and farm equipment which is a big issue and i'm sure an issue in the heartland where obviously  a lot of voters live
