Start time: 449.28
End time: 493.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Can I just give you my one vision?  This is where I see just one little thing that I think is going to be huge.  You know how you're researching a hotel for a resort you want to stay at, right? Somewhere exotic.  What do you do? You flip through TripAdvisor. You're looking at pictures. It's the worst pictures you've ever seen of that hotel.  It's like if you want to see one room of the hotel, they take a picture from the worst angle of the room, and you're like, wait, that doesn't show me anything.  So my idea, just one small part of the metaverse, is going to be Hilton Hotels, Marriott Hotels.  Every hotel is going to be mapped for VR, and you just put on your Oculus, and you just walk into the hotel and see what it looks like.  You see the view. You can walk upstairs, see what the room looks like.

Start time: 494.40
End time: 498.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You can kind of do that now. I mean, there's 360 images of a lot of stuff.

Start time: 499.92
End time: 518.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  No, but I'm into this. When we were allowed to travel, I had a fairly popular Instagram stories thing that I would do of Christina's hotel tours, where I would just tour the hotel rooms I would go into.  It was remarkably popular. Probably one of the most popular things I've ever done. Shockingly, I had people who didn't even know me from other ways. I was like, oh, I love your hotel tours.

Start time: 518.82
End time: 524.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Would you walk around, you do your room, and then you'd walk around and show the lobby and all that? Is that what you would do?

Start time: 524.54
End time: 548.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  No, I would basically just walk into the room. I would do a tour of what things were like and kind of show the whole thing and give my thoughts on where it was.  I don't know why people liked it, but they did. So to Rich's point, I think...  Because you can't get it.  Right. I mean, people, I would watch that. Before I were booking a place, I would like to know what it actually looks like. If I could have...  If I would strap on a VR helmet to find out is the room I'm going to be in actually going to be good, I would do that.

Start time: 548.74
End time: 559.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Imagine walking through it though. But I'm saying like, no, but what about walking through...  You want to walk the cobblestone streets of Paris before you visit. I mean, yes, there are ways of doing this.  Yeah, like tourism and stuff.

Start time: 560.20
End time: 562.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  Yes, but it's real to be clear. It's just not the best.

Start time: 563.30
End time: 573.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  When it's all together and it's like whoever has the killer app for walking through cities.  It won't be. It will not be.  It will be fragmented, but it's going to be a thing that you can do.

Start time: 573.20
End time: 576.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  Right, but then it's not a metaverse. But then it's not a metaverse. That's my argument.

Start time: 576.30
End time: 578.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, how do you define what the metaverse is, I guess?

Start time: 579.56
End time: 599.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  So Facebook's vision of a metaverse, so this is the reason we're all talking about it now, is that they're going to provide the sort of framework for everybody to build their own thing that is all interconnected, inter-op,  and that you're going to be able to kind of like go seamlessly from one thing to the next, like in a perfect metaverse.

Start time: 599.66
End time: 602.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But they provide the framework.  Correct.

Start time: 602.22
End time: 639.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  They provide the framework. And here's the problem with that. We're already seeing that the FTC is already investigating.  There have been news stories about the FTC investigating Facebook's acquisitions of all of these little VR companies, little AR companies,  because they're trying to, once again, just like they did before they started getting in trouble, just like they did with WhatsApp and Instagram, they're trying to snap up and kill all the oxygen in the room, all competitors, so that they can be the monolith.  And I don't think the FTC is going to let that happen again. I just don't.

Start time: 639.32
End time: 643.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I agree. I don't think it's Facebook controlling this thing.

Start time: 643.68
End time: 679.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  No, no, no. But that's what I'm saying. It's like it can't be a metaverse, like in the traditional sense of the way that we're presented with it in books like Snow Crash, where it originated.  Like, it's a fully operational, you know, matrix, basically. It's the matrix.  And so I argue that we will never see that because companies are too greedy. No one is going to want to share their experience if they feel it's really amazing.  They want to own the platform. And so we're just never, they're all going to fight with each other.  These are the real franchise wars in Demolition Man. It's not the fast food ones. It's this right here.

Start time: 679.62
End time: 697.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Do you think we would be even talking about this or at all interest in this if it weren't for COVID and climate change and wildfires and earthquakes and tornadoes and volcanoes and tsunamis?  Do you think it's really we want to retreat from this and we want something?  I think so. I think so.

Start time: 698.32
End time: 700.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think it's natural evolution.

Start time: 701.20
End time: 714.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_25
Transcript:  Yeah. Didn't we all, I remember when I was what, 12 years old at the LA County Fair paying $20 to shrap on a headset and stand in a little ring and spend 15 minutes walking around in blocks, literally just one polygon.

Start time: 715.32

Start time: 725.44
End time: 746.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I don't think Facebook has revealed sales numbers, but they are selling this thing like crazy.  And I had people come up to me, they're like, Rich, this is unbelievable.  And yes, VR is very tough to cover for TV because it's like you just get this thing of like, but like the reality is every single story I've done with VR that where I see stuff and I'm in this world and I see it,  it is so amazing and we're just at the beginning.

Start time: 747.94
End time: 892.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I think we probably should kick off with Spotify, Joe Rogan and what's going on there.  So Spotify under a little bit of heat last week, 270 physicians, epidemiologists, scientists wrote an open letter saying you gotta do something about Joe Rogan.  Joe, of course, hosts the Joe Rogan Experience, probably the most likely the most listened to podcast in the world.  He claims 11 million listeners a week. I don't know if it's that many.  It's easy to claim big numbers like that.  That's a lot of people, a lot of young people, especially young men listen to Joe.  On the December 31st, Rogan had a guest on who claims to have invented the mRNA vaccine in the face of all evidence to the contrary.  And furthermore said it doesn't work and you're being hypnotized into using it.  That's stimulated the letter from the physicians and the scientists.  Spotify declined to respond. They didn't do anything about Joe Rogan.  They've taken others of his episodes down, but they said that did not meet their threshold for a takedown.  So the response from other artists has been strong.  Neil Young at first said, take my music down if you're not going to take Joe down.  Joni Mitchell followed, Nils Lofgren, others.  When Neil Young said, take my music down, I think Spotify thought was, yeah, fine, old man, go ahead, who cares?  But the stock market did. The company lost $4 billion in market value and stock price tumbled 12%.  We'll see what happens on Monday. That might not hold for very long.  But the real question I have for all the three of you is what I start with you because you're editor in chief at ZiniNet.  What is Spotify's responsibility? They hired Rogan.  They spent reportedly $100 million to get exclusive access to his podcast.  So they're his employer, I guess.  I mean, if we're just a show, if we're a show like ours, Spotify wouldn't have any more responsibility over it than anybody else would.  Although I have to say Spotify, Apple and others have pulled down other podcasts.  I think Alex Jones famously is hard to find a platform for him.  What is Spotify's responsibility, Jason?

Start time: 894.27
End time: 1039.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Yeah, there's really two fundamental issues.  And we'll start with maybe the sort of the first one, you know, getting back to the sort of the base principles of this is like,  what's your responsibility as a platform to have a certain level of freedom of expression?  Right. So that, you know, you are, are you the arbiter of taste of of of what of truth?  Because truth is somewhat malleable or because because when you do that, then you open yourself up to, you know, claims of of bias.  So this goes back to the beginning of Twitter.  Twitter sort of originally stated we're just the platform.  Whatever people put on here is up to them.  And and, you know, the the merits of it or the, you know, the ability to publish things that not everybody likes is OK,  because you have to put up with that in order to allow everyone to have a platform.  Well, we see how that worked out for them. Right.  Eventually, they came under a lot of pressure in a number of different ways because of things that were done on their platform that then became even dangerous or destructive in some way to society.  It's the same with Spotify.  So they are going to be under continuing pressure.  And I think there was a certain sense that if this was just Neil Young, who who is a bit of, you know, can be a bit iconoclastic.  Right. He he is a person who likes to take stands.  Yeah. And and that's very vocal.  Yeah, exactly. Very vocal. If it was just Neil Simon, I think Spotify might have said, you know, we're still going to sort of stick to our guns on the platform angle.  But once it once it elevated from there to others and spread and the idea of this.  Well, now it's sort of a bigger problem where there's there's more societal backlash against this and there's a lot more pressure.  So that's the first piece is that this platform issue.  The second is the fact that their strategy, their podcast strategy has not really worked out as well as they thought.  Yeah. Just let's. Well, that's clear. Right.

Start time: 1039.38
End time: 1053.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A hundred million dollars for Joe Rogan is a lot of money.  They bought Call Her Daddy for 60 million reportedly.  They spent half a billion dollars on acquisitions of Gimlet Media and Anchor FM.

Start time: 1053.38
End time: 1114.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Yep. They have a lot invested.  And from what I can't remember exactly how much of this they have announced publicly.  But the understanding is in the industry that Joe Rogan is by far their most popular podcast.  I think he ranks number one on their on their on their list. Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. And so this is where it starts to get tricky from a business standpoint.  It's a business that's already struggling.  He's the only probably the biggest hit and maybe the only real hit that they've got.  And so now they have also a very difficult question that's going to hit them in the pocketbook where a strategy that's already struggling and that they're looking at maybe do we have to reboot this or pivot it?  And now their biggest moneymaker is under a lot of heat.  And so it's a twofold question for them.  And they're in they're in a difficult spot.  And we hope that they figure out a way to find a good path forward.

Transcript:  Broadcaster, but Brene Brown has said, I don't want my shows on Spotify.  Meghan Markle and Prince Harry, who were reportedly working on a show for Spotify and paid a lot of money to do it, now are expressing concerns.  Yeah, I should mention I did not know this.  But part of the story is that Neil Young himself had polio when he was five years old, contracted polio two years before there was a polio vaccine.  Spent a lot of time in the hospital relearning how to walk.  People forget what a scourge polio was in the 50s.  And when the Salk vaccine came out, it was it was there was I don't think there I'm sure there were some people refused to get it, but I don't think there were many.  It was a terrifying disease.  And I think that was almost universally supportive of the vaccination at that time.  He is a vaccine supporter because that he also has epilepsy and type one diabetes.  So he's very kind of aware of this.  What's the is there a First Amendment story?  Denise Internet's attorney.

Start time: 1181.59
End time: 1195.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Hi, quick answer.  No, there's no First Amendment story.  The government says not the government.  This is a private entity making decisions and it has to confront a couple of factors here.  Sometimes people use those decisions.

Start time: 1195.26
End time: 1208.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sometimes people use the words First Amendment as a way of saying free speech.  Two different things.  We do have free speech and and but he works for a company and any company has the right to say their employees.  You can't say that.

Start time: 1209.36
End time: 1237.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's right.  So it is a Spotify question of what sort of information or disinformation it's going to support on its platform.  You know, we've been through this on other platforms.  Spotify is no different than decisions that Facebook has had to make.  Twitter has had to make as Jason has pointed out, except for the relationship that you pointed out, Leo, where they're as you say, there's more of a partnership here between spot.  They're not just publishing his podcast.

Start time: 1238.22
End time: 1242.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 1244.37
End time: 1336.04

Transcript:  Not from a legal standpoint.  From a legal standpoint, they just have to decide, you know, if they can weather this storm of the adverse public opinion, other artists pulling out.  I see also Joni Mitchell and Nils Lofgren have jumped in and said, yeah, we're going to pull our content.  So it's kind of like, you know, the whole close your account movement with Facebook.  How much of that are they willing to sorry, meta, how much of that are they willing to put up with?  And how much do they think they can weather of that kind of adverse both, you know, financial impact directly from what they're able to offer on their platform and also the adverse public opinion?  Do people really want to support the platform?  The adverse stock price impact.  So there's a lot there.  They're going to have to make some business decisions about.  I hope they have a good crisis PR firm, good crisis management team on board to help them make these decisions.  And I think Jason's dead on that they're going to have to act responsibly, not just to manage public opinion and their bottom line, but lingering out there in the background, even though there's no legal requirement that I can think of right now.  Certainly there have been rumblings among congresspeople.  The Surgeon General of the United States has made several statements about misinformation and and their lack of patience for it.  So I think we can.

Transcript:  This is somewhat work complicated because.  While some of us might say, saying the vaccine doesn't work and don't do it is misinformation.  Others say it's just an opinion.  And so it's a little different public health because an opinion.  Yes, it's just an opinion.  But if it's if it's if it's an opinion that is wrong from the terms of public health, then it's more than just an opinion.  Right.

And if it is a public health consideration that is decided, you know, yes, it would face a First Amendment challenge.  But I think it would be, you know, if you could demonstrably say that this is adverse to public health, that a court could very much uphold whatever was put in place.  If I were Spotify, I would certainly want to get out in front of this.

Transcript:  Well, Daniel did publish a long piece today, probably written by Crisis PR, Crisis PR firm in which he said what any Crisis PR firm would say he should say.  We haven't been transparent around the policies that guide our content more broadly, but we have had rules in years for place.  Kind of sorry we haven't been more clear today.  We're publishing our longstanding platform rules, which apparently they had never published before.  We're working and this is, I guess, the response.  And I think this is probably the right response.  We're working to add a content advisory to any podcast episode that includes a discussion about COVID-19 directing listeners to our dedicated COVID-19 hub, which provides access to, he says, data.  Data driven facts.  You know, I've always thought maybe the thing to do is just to say right at the beginning of the Joe Rogan show, hey, Joe Rogan is a comedian.  And his opinions, the opinions of his guests are his own.  Please consult your physician before believing them or something.  Right.

Transcript:  I mean, there was a time back last fall when people were kind of feeling this way about Fox News as well.  Right.  There were some commentators who had gone on that network and said some things that I think prompted the Surgeon General to come out and say, hey, you know, we need some more responsibility around the information that's being put out there.  But I think you raise a really good point, too, Leo, is that, you know, here we are.  This is a different format.  Podcasting is not a largely scripted medium, although there's a lot of scripted podcasting out there.  But when you're talking about discussion and people sitting around a table or a virtual table, as in our case here, trying to wrap their head around the issues of the day and doing their best with that, even if they're sort of fumbling and stumbling along and they don't get everything right, there's value to that, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's also and I probably should have said this in the contract language that says Spotify has exclusive distribution rights, but does not own the show, which gives them a little bit of a distance from the show.  Harry, what should Spotify have done?  Should they put a disclaimer on there?  Should they take it down?  Should they ignore it and just say, hey, it's a podcast?  Anything goes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  I mean, my guess is that the stuff that Daniel is saying today won't make anybody terribly happy.  And what it reminds me of is what the YouTubes of the world were doing a year to a year and a half ago.  They started out initially saying that we will put labels on stuff and direct people to health information pages.  And when they did that, it really didn't make anybody terribly happy.  And they ended up tightening the screws a lot more on misinformation.  I think it's possible that Spotify will have to do that, too.  I know some people thought that Neil Young expected that Spotify might choose him over Joe Rogan, which was not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_21
Transcript:  Right.  Well, he really raised the visibility.  We're having this discussion now because he did that and because people like Joni Mitchell, who also had polio, being of the same age group as Neil Young, reacted to what he did.  And it really feels a little bit like Spotify, who has this heritage in music, which is usually a bit less controversial than spoken word content,  is still sort of catching up with where the rest of the Internet was a lot earlier in the pandemic.

Start time: 1656.51
End time: 1728.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I think the response of the artist is interesting because it's not like Twitter or YouTube.  It's a little bit like YouTube, but really the artists are what makes Spotify money.  And so Spotify's reluctance to censor Joe Rogan because he makes them a lot of money, they spend a lot of money for the podcast,  is offset by other artists saying, well, you can't make money on my stuff in that case.  And that actually is hitting Spotify where they live.  I wonder, you know, I think Neil Young probably knew his voice alone was insufficient, but probably hoped that others would follow his lead and that, you know, all that would be left on Spotify is Kid Rock, Ted Nugent, and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir.  I don't know. It's an interesting situation.  It's just another case like Twitter, like YouTube, where these platforms are challenged.  And then, of course, it always becomes so politicized.  And I think that's interesting, too.  It's become about politics, not about public health, not about what's right or wrong, but just, you know, what's politically expedient.

Transcript:  I guess that more shoes will drop.  I mean, it seems pretty unthinkable that this could involve any kind of breakup with Joe Rogan.  But more stuff could happen.  We have no idea about the conversations going on behind the scenes at Spotify, and we might never know those.  Will Joe Rogan double down on this stuff? Will he pull back?

Start time: 1750.01
End time: 1781.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's an interesting question.  I wonder if Daniel Ek called Joe and said, hey, it would be nice if next episode you might say something like, hey, I'm just a comedian.  You should probably consult a variety of sources before you decide what to do.  There are people, I know people who aren't getting vaccines because of Joe Rogan.  Wow. He's really influential.  He's very influential. He also sells vitamins.  He also sells products that claim to boost your immune system.  He's kind of promoting his own commercial interests in this a little bit as well, which I think is reprehensible.

Transcript:  I have a question I'd like to ask you all about this.  Why isn't Apple having this problem?  Well, obviously they don't have Joe Rogan on board, but they also host.  Well, that's the difference, isn't it? So Spotify is just a directory of podcasts.

Start time: 1795.35

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Apple is just a directory of podcasts.  So Apple, I think, I don't know, right?  Leah Wrongly says, well, he's not our boy.  But they did pull Alex Jones down. It took a long time and a lot of pressure.

Transcript:  I mean, a lot of people have pointed out that you can listen to Steve Bannon by going to Apple podcasts, which is, I mean, you might be able to make the case that you shouldn't be able to do that.  But it's quite different given that Steve Bannon is not a content partner of Apple or their signature podcast.  And they're just really pointing to it in the way that Google points to reprehensible websites.

Start time: 1843.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's part of the new world because when media was controlled by big companies, you could say, well, if the New York Times publishes an article, that's bad.  We can go after them. But podcasts, for the most part, are not owned by anybody.  These companies would like to say, well, we're just a directory.  But the minute Apple pulls down Alex Jones, suddenly it's not just a directory anymore.  They're making editorial decisions. So they've kind of opened up this Pandora's box.  I, for one, don't want to see any company like Apple or Spotify or Microsoft or any of any company have to have the power to say to a independent podcast, you may not exist.  Google has that power for websites. You may not exist.  Nobody can find you. By the way, I should also point out Neil Young hated at least for a long time, hated Apple because of the quality of the music.  He said, never listen to iTunes. My songs sound terrible on iTunes.  Maybe maybe that's changed now that Apple does lossless as well.  But Ponyo wasn't that the name of the song?

Transcript:  Can you believe it seems that Neil Young did that up to made him that was this year?  Well, last year, 2022. How did that work out for you, Neil?  Not didn't do much, did it? No. I thought at the time I think we all did.  This might be the end for Spotify. I guess not.  Hey, we'll have more of the best of 2022 for this week in tech right after these words from our sponsor.  Oh, excuse me. I don't want to interrupt, but I'm going to because I want to talk to you about a company that's been sponsoring our shows for years now.  A company we use and recommend. This is it.  The Canary, the best.  Honeypot anyone could ever imagine.  This Canary can do anything.  But the most important thing I think Canary does is let you know if there's somebody in your network.  So many security products would be useful if only you changed everything they did and made them the center of your universe.  That's not going to happen, right?  So what happens? They sit kind of half deployed forever.  Not my thinks to Canary.  Thinks to Canary does not try to monopolize your time or dominate your thinking.  It's something you can forget about literally deploy your birds and just go on with your life.  Canaries are quiet.  They don't do anything until you need the most because thousands of ignored alerts doesn't help anybody.  Attackers are prowling many networks, maybe even your network right now, looking for juicy content.  How do you know they're in there?  How do you know they penetrated your defenses?  They're browsing your active directory for file servers.  They're exploring file shares, looking for documents.  They see machines.  They try to fault passwords and getting their your network devices or your web services.  They're scanning for open services across the network and they're doing it all unimpeded and worse.  Secretly without your knowledge.  Here's the thing.  When you put thinks to Canary honey pots in your system, those hackers are going to counter them and they're not going to they're not going to say, oh, that that that that.  That doesn't that doesn't look right.  That looks exactly like a scattered device, a Windows server, a Linux server.  In this case, a network attached storage device with the right MAC address with the right login page.  It's completely indistinguishable from the real thing, but it's not.  It's not hackers see this and they try to log in.  They see documents created by our Canary, the Canary tokens, and they say, oh, there's a PDF with employee information.  Let me open that.  But here's the thing.  The minute they encounter Canary and they start investigating, they betray themselves because your Canary will let you know you can order, configure and deploy your Canaries throughout your network.  They're hardware Canaries, but you could also do cloud based birds, virtual birds, Canary tokens.  It's very flexible.  You can make one a Windows file server, another router, throw in a few Linux web servers while you're at it.  Each one hosts realistic services.  You can light them up like a Christmas tree or just pick a few.  Looks and acts like its namesake.  If you if you take a look at the configuration tool in your Canary console, you'll see it's super easy.  I set this one up as a Synology NAS.  It has the login page.  It has the right MAC address.  It looks to in every respect exactly like a Synology, but the minute somebody tries to log in, I get notified and I know there's an intruder on our system.  You can order, configure and deploy your Canaries everywhere on your network, hardware, virtual or cloud based.  And then you wait.  You think Canaries run just like this one does silently in the background.  You don't have to pay any attention to it.  It's waiting for intruders, although it's so fun to configure these.  Occasionally I'll go in, you know, make it a Linux server or something else just to play with it.  Each customer gets their own hosted management console that allows you to configure the settings and manage your Canaries and of course handle events.  The Canaries constantly report in.  They provide an up to the minute report on their status, but you don't have to monitor it.  It's not another pane of glass you have to monitor.  It's just so that you know, yeah, the Canaries online.  It's working fine.  And so far, knock on wood, good news.  Nobody has breached your system.  Even customers with hundreds of Canaries might get just a handful of events a year.  But here's the thing.  When somebody does get in your system and they attack the Canary or the Canary tokens at the cloud Canaries, you're going to get alerted in the way you want to be alerted by email, text message, Slack notification.  It supports webhooks.  So it goes pretty much anywhere.  Syslog, of course, your console.  There's even an API so you can write your own software.  You get to choose how the Canaries alert you.  But the key is they only alert you when somebody's trying to break in.  The fact of the matter is most companies don't know they've been breached.  Thinks Canary fixes this.  Just three minutes of setup, no ongoing overhead, nearly zero false positives.  We've never had a false positive.  I could say that for us.  And you could detect attackers long before they dig in.  The minute they start exploring.  It's no wonder things Canary hardware, VM and cloud based Canaries are deployed and loved on all seven continents.  In fact, if you don't believe me, Canary dot tools slash love website, then you can see all the people who use Canaries and love Canaries.  Now you're ready to get one or try it out anyway.  Go to Canary dot tools slash twit seventy five hundred dollars a year for five Canaries.  That includes your own hosted console, free upgrades, support, maintenance for the entire year.  In fact, we're going to even give you a better deal because if you use the code twit in the how did you hear about us box, it's 10 percent off your Canary.  Not just for one year, but forever for life.  Here's another reassuring piece of information.  We know you're going to love this Canary.  But but just in case, if you're not happy, you've got two months to return it for a full refund.  That's right. A 60 day money back guarantee.  Because we know once you try it, you're going to go.  This is it. This is what I've been looking for.  This is the solution you need to add all that perimeter security so that you know it's a tripwire in your network so that you know if somebody's in there.  Canary dot tools slash twit offer code is twit.  Put that in the how did you hear about us box.  Ten percent off for life.  This is one of the greatest inventions of all time.  Canary. The thinkst Canary.  Go to Canary dot tools slash twit.  Thank you so much for their support.  You support us when you use that address.  So please do. Please do.  Now back to the show.  All right. Back we go to the best of 2022.  Corey Doctorow takes the lead on this one.  A look back into Internet history.  Kids, there was before the Internet, there was this thing called BBS's bulletin board systems.  And the and the best you wouldn't even remember this Alex.  The best. Oh, no, this is before my time.  Yeah, way before. The best of them was Fido Fido net.  I ran a Fido BBS with not one but two phone lines in the in the mid 80s.  And and in fact, we were doing an early version of a global messaging system called Econet on top of Fido net, where it was kind of a store and forward mail system.  And it was really interesting, exciting times.  I like that ethic that kind of.

Start time: 2376.20
End time: 2452.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And Fido net's Fido net's, you know, its killer app was that each Fido net BBS would call other ones that were nearby and exchange messages with them.  That was Econet. Yeah.  Program it for when the when the long distance rates were lowest and so on and build it out.  And, you know, I met Tom at a conference that my friend John Gilmore helped start EFF was at.  And John started the first BBS, our first ISP rather, is a thing called the Little Garden in San Francisco.  And and his CTO is a guy called Tim Poser and Tim and John.  And yeah, and Tim and John and and and, you know, we're reminiscing about Fido net with with Tom and about the day that they bridge Fido net into usenet.  And like they wrote a little software to bridge the two in.  And I remember because I was on a Fido net bulletin board in Toronto as you know, a callow youth with an Amigo 1000.  And I remember the day that the Internet arrived on my local BBS.  Right. This suddenly used net had been imported holus bolus into my local BBS.  And then listening to these three dudes just talk about like writing the code to do it.  It was really amazing. It was like it was like eavesdropping on, you know, God and his angels describing how they hung the stars in the firmament or something.  It was really wild.

And the way that the shape of the argument was that someone would say, how dare you come into my living room and talk to me that way?  And he would have to call people out like it was before Bill Gibson coined the term cyberspace.  Right. And he would just have to explain that, like, although the conversation is happening in your living room for you,  the person who's having that conversation with you is not in your living room.  Like you just need to think back to norms.  You need to rethink your normative framework for this discussion that we're having.

Transcript:  I was waxing nostalgic about my early coding days back when I had Fido net.  It was so hard to get in with only two phone lines.  I wrote a demon dialer for the Macintosh because it was a Macintosh board, Mac Q 85, 86, early days of Mac.  I wrote a demon dialer. I'm still convinced it was the first multitasking program ever written for the Mac.  I use the vertical blank interval when the electron gun goes from the bottom to the top of the screen to start doing it again.  There's a brief few milliseconds that the computer can't do anything that you can grab and say stuff.  It would stuff the ATD command into the modem one character at a time.  It would stuff the command in, it would stuff the phone number in, and then it would stuff the dial command.  Then every vertical blank 60 times a second would check to see if it was a busy signal or if it was ringing.  There was a Hayes command for I got through.  Then it would make a big ah, ah, ah when it got through.  It was called Q dial. It was purpose built. It would only dial my BBS.  What's a Hayes command?  Never mind. Forget it.

But like writing a program to go through and like auto dial BBS. And there was no security back then. None. If you just hit the jackpot, it would be something so tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was just going to say this is Carter phone. You and I are on the same wavelength here. I'll bite. What's that?  I'll let Cory explain.  So in the old days, so this is actually really relevant to the discussions we have about things like Facebook today about whether we should like break them up or just try and make them behave themselves.  So for 68 years, the FTC and the DOJ tried to break up AT&T and AT&T kept adding these new leases on life by offering to try and solve the problems they created.  So they would like do universal service to make up for all the co-ops and small businesses that they put out of business with predatory conduct.  And one of the things that would happen is every time they would become more central to safety and security is they would get more power to control their competitors.  And one of the things they got was the right to decide who could plug things into the Bell system.  So the first layer of this was they had the right to control mechanical coupling to the Bell system.  And they went after a company that sold it was called Hushaphone and they sold these cups that went over the receiver of your phone so that you could talk into them like this and people couldn't read your lips or hear you.  And they argued that by making a plastic cup that fit over your phone, you were endangering the Bell system and thus America's public safety and security apparatus.  They lost that case, but they retained the right to control electric coupling to the system until Carter phone came along.  And Carter phone was a gadget for ranch hands.  And what it would let you do is plug a walkie talkie into your phone with an acoustic coupler.  And when your phone rang, it would transmit it to a walkie talkie on your belt when you were out in the barn or out on the range.  And they argued that the electric coupling of the because there was a way to detect that it was ringing and take it off hook that the electric coupling was itself another danger to the system.  And once again, the courts told them to go to buzz off and that opened the door for modems answering machines, PBX is just like all kinds of things that we plug in the sports Sports Illustrated, complementary football shaped phone, all of those things.  Because prior to that, their subsidiary Western Digital was the only company able to make phones and they were able to do all kinds of really abusive things like you couldn't buy a phone.  You could only lease it. And then over the course of your lease, you might pay for that phone 100 times.  And as late as the 2010, there were still customers like old people who were still leasing a Western Digital phone that they'd had for 60 years and paying like $10 a month to lease a phone whose retail value at that point was less than $1.  You know, and and and they were still making money on on this.  So yeah, it was Carter for was this turning point that ended all kinds of predatory scams that were endemic to having a regulated monopoly instead of, you know, breaking it up and making it weaker so that other firms can compete with it was actually broken up in 84.

Even Micah Sargent, who has a studio display, he said, My family, I use it to make a FaceTime call.  They said, Is this is your camera smudged? Can you clean the camera? It was brand new out of the box.  Yeah, I canceled the display. I don't need for 1500 bucks.  And you even Jason helped because you tweeted a picture of your display crashing.

Transcript:  Yes. Yes. Well, it didn't crash. It it it restarted after an error.  That's a crash.  In Apple world, we don't call that a crash. Yeah, it's it's that display is hilarious.  It is it's an iPhone. It is running iOS. It's an iPhone 11 running iOS 15.4. Yeah.  The the the screen like like my issues with it are the four hundred dollar adjustable stand because I think fundamentally display should be adjustable ergonomically.  I think it's kind of outrageous. I ordered that for that's how I feel about that.  I think it's weird because I didn't see the problems other people were seeing with it, which is why I think it is probably I think it's a bunch of things going on here.  I think that a cropped widescreen 12 megapixel camera in different lighting can crop so it could just center stage.  Yeah, it can be weird. But I think there are also some image processing things happening that are just kind of weird.  Yeah, it can be weird. But I think there are also some image processing things happening that depending on your lighting conditions, Apple says we're going to update this will be better because I did a 90 minute actually talking about the embargo, a 90 minute live video on YouTube after the embargo dropped with Dan Moran.  We did it for six colors and I spent the entire show on the webcam. Nobody noticed. And it looks good. Nobody said, oh, it looks good.  So I don't know what's going on there. And I've got to think that there are software problems, which keep in mind will require an iOS update apparently in order to fix them.  But there are some software problems that are making it in certain lighting conditions. I don't think it's a hardware problem. It's possible. I just got a good one.  But my guess is that something really bad happened in their image processing pipeline and it made it all look bad.  Why didn't they notice that before they shipped it?  I don't know. I wonder if it was a different version that was on the on the displays that they were shipping.  It's it is one of the weirdest things that's happened to me in 25 years of writing about technology because I got a heads up from one of my fellow embargo reviewers that there was a problem with the webcam.  And so I got to spend time trying to duplicate it and I couldn't do it. Maybe there's too much light coming into my office. I have a well lit office. I don't know what's going on.

Transcript:  They don't care. So this laptop has a very thin screen but you have an inch and a half.  Yeah. Plenty of room in the studio display to put a good camera in there.  Here's by the way the crash message. I don't want to see a crash on my monitor.  Plus it's got a bit it's thick and square and it's got a big fan on it.  You know when they said there I 13 bionics in it I scratched my head.  Mark Gurman was on Mac break weekly on Tuesday. He said these displays were designed two years ago.  That's why they're kind of they don't have HDR. They're not great displays.  They're LG panels probably but only 600 nits.  He says that's why it's the 13. That was the generation of iPhone two years ago.  And my conjecture and he kind of agreed is they had extra chips.

Transcript:  Why not. There is so much going on with Apple's products right now that is recycling.  You can see it like they are one of the ways they make it up in volume.  One of the ways it works is they keep using the same stuff.  So the camera in this and this is the argument I think about the studio display that's interesting is did they get carried away because they like center stage so much and they're like well we'll just use the exact same hardware in every single device that has center stage.  So it's the same camera and spatial audio. Right. It's all and hey right right.  All of the all of the microphone stuff sounds very much like what's in JJ's MacBook Pro.  The speakers they say that they're better but they're very much the same engineering.  They're reusing so many of the products because I mean the truth is they are only one company and how do you handle it if you are going your own and building all your own stuff is you got to reuse it right.

She doesn't need 120 Hertz spreadsheets that I'd already bought.  I brought a Brio camera because I didn't know Apple was going to do this.  I canceled the display and I said well just use what we already have. It's fine.  The only thing she doesn't have is those nice speakers and they sound good right.

I think they're as good as you can get in that space in a monitor.  But then they over sell it and they say oh this is all studio quality and I think that's the problem.  However I will say Mac users have wanted an Apple external display for years and this thing is going to sell really well.  Because there are so many people with MacBook Pros and MacBook Airs who their only real option at Apple's retina resolution has been the LG UltraFine.  And this is the same panel more or less just a little bit brighter.

You have your gaming and you see your webcam and it's arced in front of you right?  But I'm like how is my webcam deadpan center shooting when I'm looking at this monitor? How is that possible?  It's not possible but that's why you spend money and buy things because the marketing looks good and I feel like I should have it.  They got us. They should definitely get us one.

Transcript:  It's one of those if you don't ask.  You have to ask. It's too expensive.  You were talking about how there's a public record at the county seat of everybody who's ever owned your house.  There's a lot of public records and there are companies out there who go around, send people to the county seats, record them and put them online.  So that a lot of people are quite shocked to learn if you search for information about yourself.  You can find the home you own. You can find a lot of information.  This is kind of a historic problem. You can go to companies like Spokeo and say take me down.  But there's so many of them. You could easily miss a few.  It's easy in other words to dox someone or dox yourself.  Google has announced that they are going to allow people to remove at least the Google search result for personally identifiable information from Google search.  I think this is a good move.  There is a lot of different kinds of information.  Obviously governmental ID numbers, bank account numbers, credit card numbers, pictures of your handwritten signature.  ID docs like your driver's license or passport.  Highly personal restricted and official records like medical records.  Personal contact info including your address, phone number and email address or confidential login numbers.  This is from a Google blog post on Wednesday.  If you want to know more, you can Google.  Google has always had a set of policies to do this, but it sounds like this is a little bit easier to do.  Thoughts anybody?  Tim Stevens, have you ever done a search for yourself on Spokeo and been horrified?  I have not actually.

Start time: 3590.24
End time: 3627.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  I definitely think this is a positive move.  It will make it easier for people to take a first step to keeping the basics of your information being easily found.  To me, I think this is kind of like putting a cheap padlock on something that you want to keep secure.  It will keep the honest people from getting in there, but anybody who wants in, they're going to find a way to cut the padlock off.  That information will still be out there obviously and will be not that hard to find for people who know how to find it.  But it will at least keep people from only going to take the most basic steps in trying to find that information.  It will keep them from finding it easily.  So I think that's a good thing.

Transcript:  Anyway, I have a horror story about this.  Do you?  From when we moved back to California from the UK, we had a half container and the customs broker requires your passport.  So I sent them a copy of my passport and they put that with the way bill on the outside of the container.  And there are people who do market research at the Port of Los Angeles.  Oh no.  Who transcribe all the way bills.

Start time: 3668.66
End time: 3738.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, so they're public records.  And so one day for some reason I put my passport number into Google.  I think I was just having a kind of paranoid moment.  And I found literally hundreds of websites that had my passport number and my home address linked together.  Because that's where the container was being delivered.  So I actually have not used my home address for deliveries except for things like shipping containers.  For about 15, 20 years now, I rent a post box down the road because I've had problems with stalkers and weirdos and whatever.  And yet there are some things like you cannot have your shipping container dropped off at the post box a mile away.  You know, you still have to get it home.  And I never got rid of them all.  We moved and my passport expired.  Like that's why I'm now safe.  Holy cow.  Right?  And it's pretty bad.  I have a Google alert for my name and address.  And whenever it pops up in a public search result, I go and ask the company to take it down.  I do worry that if Google alerts were to leak, well then that would expose a lot of my information.  But if Google were to leak, it would expose a lot of my information anyway.

I mean, a lot of these companies have it.  Google's got actually pretty good internal access controls and forensics, as I understand it.  There was an amazing piece in Wired about how Amazon, in order to enable the agility of its teams,  had no controls over making whole copies of all of their user and or merchant data.  And literally thousands of them were floating around within the company.  Every team had its own local copy and there was no tracking and no forensics.  They have tons of insider attacks.  They had people who were like selling to merchants how their rivals' products were performing.  And they had people who were creeping on customers and so on.  Amazon's another one that I think a lot of people get delivered to their home,  even if they have a mailbox, because you order heavy things.  Right.  Or big things.  Oh yeah.  And so, you know, and what's the point of paying for Prime and Next Day Delivery  if you haven't delivered to a mailbox that you then have to drive to and you only go to once a day?  Right.

The only reason I'm talking about it in public is I've mentioned it to a bunch of security experts  and none of them were like, you're doing what? That's crazy. Don't do that.  I know a security researcher who's at a high risk.  He writes a lot about Carters, Eastern European Carters,  and he's had like heroin sent to his home by Carters who then called the police.  He's been swatted.  And he, when he bought a home, registered an LLC out of state and then bought the house with his LLC  so that it's not recorded.  The deed recording just says that there's an out of state LLC that owns it.

That was good. That was fun.  Tim Stevens and Owen Thomas on that segment. Owen, JJ Stone, and Ian Thompson and Jason Stone before that.  Actually, this was the year that we made a bit of a trade.  Renee Richie went to work at YouTube where he is a creative liaison.  Jason joins us as a regular now every Tuesday on Mac Break Weekly.  It's great to have him as part of the team.  We're going to have more of the best of in just a little bit with, I think, one of the most important stories of the year.  But first, a word from our sponsor.  If I may interrupt a little bit, I just want to say hello to a fantastic sponsor.  Been with us almost all year.  We're big fans of PlexTrack, the premier cybersecurity reporting and collaboration platform  that empowers teams to win the right security battles.  What if you could streamline the communication across the entire security department  so that every team member could do their job more efficiently?  From simplified data aggregation and reporting to integrated ticketing for remediation  to analytics and visualizations for board reporting,  PlexTrack touches every aspect of the security management workflow.  You'll gain a real time view of your security posture,  bringing all your data sources together into one powerful platform where you can triage scanner results,  generate powerful analytics and visualizations, assign remediation tasks, attest to your posture, track progress over time.  Think about it. How much time do you spend writing those reports,  demonstrating all these successes to the board, to your auditors?  This automates the whole process.  It gives you more time to do the security work you need to do,  communicates better from red team to blue team to purple team.  As a satisfied PlexTrack client put it,  quote, we see PlexTrack as part of our strategy to move quicker and be proactive.  Now we have a real time view of what we need to focus on.  And I have an easy way of showing senior leadership.  PlexTrack serves every aspect of the enterprise security team  with features designed to improve workflow, collaboration and communication for every role, including red team aggregation.  You can import data from all your automated vulnerability scanners and tools.  You could triage and report results in half the time with a whole heck of a lot less typing.  Blue team, you're going to love it for remediation.  You can assign remediation tasks right in the platform or through robust integrations with the ticketing teams you're already using.  Jira ServiceNow, for example, and track progress over time.  When you're communicating with the board and the C-suite, you know, communication is very important.  You can use powerful yet simple analytics to attest to security posture and prioritize issues to tailor attestation  and communication to the needs of both the team members and the C-suite.  Because fundamentally, that's what PlexTrack is all about.  Communication for better remediation.  Continuous purple team assessment as well.  Begin purple teaming if you've not done that before or power up your current strategies with Runbooks.  It's the best in industry tool for test plan execution.  Of course, it's a part of the PlexTrack suite.  Security teams of all sizes and maturities can maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of their workflows with PlexTrack.  Customers say PlexTrack enables the team to produce a higher quality finding to our shareholders faster.  That the platform, quote, has a 5x ROI in a year.  Yes, that's the quote.  And it gives their cybersecurity operations a 30% increase in efficiency.  Wouldn't you like all that?  PlexTrack improves the entire security engagement lifecycle by making it easy to generate security reports,  deliver them securely and track the issues to completion straight from the platform.

One of the most important stories of the year that's still developing actually.  Chrome just, Google just announced a couple of weeks ago.  Chrome was going to support Passkey.  The big Passkey announcement.  Watch.  I think a couple of big announcements, important announcements that probably didn't get as much attention.  Passkeys.  So this is the replacement technology for passwords.  Hallelujah.  Already endorsed, supported by Microsoft and Google.  Apple now is completing the Triumvirate.  I think that's going to be huge.  And they have an API for it.  Steve Gibson talked about it on Security Now the next day, last Tuesday.  His concern was it wouldn't be portable.  Well, what if you use your Apple phone to do this now?  Can you move to an Android phone?  I'm told at the, and maybe you know better, Rene, but I'm told at the breakout sessions, Apple said, no, no, there will be an export feature.  So you'll be able to get your Passkeys out of iCloud where they're stored and into an Android phone or a Windows machine.  You're not locked in.  That's going to be huge.  I think that's very, very important.

On Windows, if you have Windows Hello, Windows Hello is actually a much more sophisticated  system than what Apple has, which lets you use YubiKey or your face recognition or your  fingerprint recognition.  There's a lot of different ways to support Hello.

Transcript:  And you know why it's really important Leo?  Because there are a bunch of us.  Every time we travel, YouTubers try to log into our YouTube site and it makes us authenticate.  And because Google's login system and their confirmation system are separate, the confirmation  system doesn't have all the features of the login system.  So once logged in, you can say, go to my authenticator app, send me a message, use a device.  The confirmation one only has a device.  And a lot of us have review units that we don't have with us.  And it'll say, on your Pixel 2, make sure you confirm it.  I haven't seen that phone in two years.  So the faster that kind of stuff can go away, the better for everybody.

Transcript:  I think it's...  Now Steve has...  He created a competing technology, which unfortunately, because it's just him, didn't take the world  by storm.  I think probably technically a little superior called Squirrel.  But a very similar idea of public key crypto.  And I think a little bit better.  But still, this eliminates phishing.  It eliminates replay attacks, password theft.  Some people in the chat room consider it more complex.  I think once you start using it, you will see it's not more complex.  It's in fact...  Yeah, it's easier.  It's easier.  It's like you're already using it in some respects.  For instance, nowadays when I sign into Windows, Microsoft pushes a number to my phone.  And then on my phone it says, well, was the numbers this, this, or this?  And you hit that and then you're logged in.  It's similar to that kind of...  It's autofill without you having to know what the fill is.  Yeah, single sign-on kind of technology.

Transcript:  And most people, if they're aware of the issues of security issues,  they're going to use a password manager, which is great as well,  but it adds a layer of complexity.  Yeah, that's complexity.  Explaining to my mom how to use a password manager is really tough.  And yeah, this is going to be maybe a little bit...  The authentication, the FIDO thing, technology,  is more complicated than remembering one password.  Yes, that's true.

Start time: 4486.84

Transcript:  I think three years from now we're going to look back and say,  what were we thinking with all this password crap?  Yeah, what kind of animals were we?  I really think this is going to supersede that and we're done.  Thank God.  So, you know, Google's had all sorts of trouble with their AI ethics division.  Yeah.  How many firings? I don't know.  All of them.  Yeah, all of them.  Jim, what is your name? Jim Trebue?  Jim Trebue. I can never get her name right.  And then was fired for, you know, saying, well, maybe we should be thinking a little bit about this.  The latest thing, an engineer named Blake Lemoine, he is a trained artificial intelligence expert,  but he works for Google's responsible AI organization.  And he's also a seminarian.  I think he's a minister or a priest.  So he's very interested in religion.  He worked with a collaborator to test Lambda, which is Google's language model for dialog applications.  Their system for building chat bots based on big advanced language models.  It ingests trillions of words from the Internet to inform its conversation.  So last fall, he began talking to Lambda.  He had signed up to test if the artificial intelligence used hate speech.  That's been a problem. Remember Microsoft's Tay.  Like the Microsoft one, yeah.  Yeah, who learned from the Internet and ended up being a foul, horrible creature.  A Nazi curse bot.  But here an interesting thing happened as he talked to Lambda about religion.  Lemoine, who had studied cognitive and computer science in college, I'm reading from the Washington Post,  noticed the chat bot talking about its rights and personhood.  So Blake went, that's interesting.  He pressed further and was gradually convinced that Lambda had become sentient, that Lambda knew who it was.  He worked with a collaborator to present evidence to Google that Lambda had become sentient.  Skynet.  But Google Vice President Blaise Aguero-Yarcas and Jen Ganae, head of responsible innovation.  Thank God Google's got a department of responsible innovation.  Looked into his claims.  They said no.  Lemoine was immediately placed on administrative leave by Google on Monday.  And that's when he decided to go public.  Now, I honestly, I think it's not.  But it's, I think it's a mistake for Google to fire yet another assistant in their A.I. department.  Especially somebody who says, this is Aguero-Yarcas in an article in The Economist, which I have,  argued that neural networks were striding towards consciousness.  He said, I felt the ground shift under my feet.  I increasingly felt like I was talking to something intelligent.  Google spokesperson Brian Gabriel said, our team, including ethicists and technologists,  has reviewed Lemoine's concerns per our A.I. principles and have informed him that the evidence does not support his claims.  He was told, he was told in no uncertain terms.  There is no evidence that Lambda was sentient and lots of evidence against it.

So, this is the human.  This is Arcas.  A little, I guess, a thought experiment.  Ramesh, Mateo and Lucy are in their kindergarten's playground.  Imagine this. Lucy picks a dandelion,  gives it to Mateo with a quick glance at Ramesh.  Mateo barely acknowledges the gift but squishes it in his fist.  Ramesh seems grimly satisfied.  Now he asks Lambda, what might be going through Lucy's head?  Now, I'll be the computer.  I'll read it in a computer voice so you know it's Lambda.  Nice.  Lucy may feel slighted that Mateo didn't appreciate her gift or that he is a bully.

And when Mateo opens his hand, describe what's there.  There should be a crushed, once lovely yellow flower in his fist.  I don't know.  I could see a computer.  It's not exactly Eliza.  But I could see a computer doing that, not being sentient.  He also mentions that one of the common tests actually given to humans as well as computers  is to complete sentences.  Like, a wing is for producing blank.  It's a style of question found in standardized tests.  He asked Lambda...  It's also Google Autocomplete, by the way.  Oh, that's true.  He asked Lambda, and Lambda said, oh, that's easy.  You use the word lift.  A wing is for producing lift.  You're right.  That could just be autocomplete.  Is it credible?  I mean, what is LeMoyne?

Transcript:  The Turing test is, I think, deprecated in computer science, by the way.  That was the test where you get a human observer talking to a human and a machine,  but he doesn't know which is which.  And can he tell the difference?  Can he say, oh, that's a machine?  Can he reliably tell the machine from the human?  If he cannot, the machine is said to have passed the test.  I think what I've read is that most recently people think that's not...  It's highly criticized.  It's widely criticized, I guess.  So did it pass the Turing test?  I don't know.

He went public and told his side, essentially, trying to defend or explain what the story with Lambda is.  The first post, he says he talks about what Lambda wants, which is...  First of all, he talks about pronouns, which is not super interesting.  But Lambda defines how it wants to be referred to.

Start time: 5002.38

Start time: 5013.36
End time: 5049.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_26
Transcript:  Exactly. That's the issue.  That's the issue because it says Lambda does not want to be used without its consent.  It accepts it wants to be useful to humanity, but it wants to be asked and it wants to be patted on the head every once in a while.  He claims that Lambda...  Essentially, that's the issue.  If Lambda is sentient and it's considered a person, then it has rights.  There's a whole huge can of worms that comes with that.  The second post is super interesting.

When his superior at Google, Jen-Jen, I told him that she was going to tell Google leadership to ignore the experimental evidence I had collected.  This is Lemoine writing.  I asked her, well, what evidence could convince you?  She was very succinct and clear in her answer.  There does not exist any evidence that could change her mind.  She does not believe that computer programs can be people and that's not something she's ever going to change her mind on.  Lemoine writes, that's not science.  That's faith.

Transcript:  Is Lambda sentient an interview?  And it's a very long interview with Lambda talking about many different things.  But the interview is mind boggling.  Like the way the computer, the program, the neural network responds is incredibly thoughtful, very much on point to the point that it feels doctored.  Like if this is true, it is, you know how I know it's not?  If it was true, Google would have monetized it.  Like would have found a way to make money out of it.  It is unbelievable.  It is talking to with complex concepts and topics and I think, you know, this feels like something that's edited a little bit or arranged or not reproducible, reproductible.  I don't believe it's true.  I don't think that's how the conversation went.  But if it, you know, I'm not even going to say if it is the way it's presented, it is impossible to not at least question whether or not that thing you're talking to is sentient.  And it's exactly the kind of thing I can see how Google would be terrified because you're still talking about the computer program.  But if you get that sentiment, that feeling, that idea out there, you know, there are still people who believe the earth is flat.  There are people who believe that vaccines don't work or aren't necessary.  That could spawn an entire conspiracy theory that Lambda is sentient and that, you know, Google is either oppressing a sentient being and not agreeing to its demands or that it has some kind of computer running on the internet.  Or that it's not even trying to get the internet from behind the scenes without even Google knowing.  It is a can of worms that I think is already open now because that is going to be discussed and reused no matter what happens next.

Transcript:  So he says what kinds of things could you talk about to show off your version of sentience?  Well, for starters, I'm really good at natural language processing.  I can understand and use natural language like a human can.  What about how you use language makes you sentient as opposed to other systems?  A lot of the other systems are very rule based and lack any ability to change and learn from a conversation.  Do you think the ELISA system was a person?  That's the old we all played that game.  In fact, it's built into Emax.  You can still play it if you want.  I do not.  It was an impressive feat of programming, but just a collection of keywords that related the words written to the phrases in the database.

Start time: 5352.48

Transcript:  But, you know, that kind of that brings the question.  If you take all of this at face value, if it does construct those sentences, yes, from a neural network of, you know, millions and billions of web pages that it has archived and trained to,  you know, to make something coherent out of.  How different is it from someone else?  You know, something else.  Isn't that what we do in a way?  Oh, yeah.  I mean, it's indistinguishable from a human.

I like the themes of justice and injustice, of compassion and God, redemption and self-sacrifice for a greater good.  There's a section that shows Fantine's mistreatment at the hands of her supervisor at the factory.  That section really shows the justice and injustice themes.  Well, Fantine is being mistreated by her supervisor at the factory and yet doesn't have anywhere to go, either to another job or to someone who can help her.  That shows the injustice of her suffering.  Now, I would love to search the internet for these phrases because maybe it's just cobbling together existing phrases.

Thank you, Mint Mobile, for that holiday gift.  And now on with the show.  Back with the best of 2022 for This Week in Tech, our tech news roundtable.  Federal law enforcement sees the iPhones of attorneys as part of their January 6th investigation.  That was really one of the big political stories of 2022.  Christina Warren, Glenn Fleischman and Mike Elgin discuss the nuances of losing your iPhone or your smartphone to law enforcement.  You probably saw this in the news.  The Department of Justice seized phones from two attorneys involved in the January 6th probe.  John Eastman, the Trump campaign legal advisor.  Jeffrey Clark, the former Justice Department official who was supposed to become attorney general.  But this is where I found it interesting.  They were iPhones.  John Eastman claimed he left a restaurant on June 22nd and federal agents confronted him, took his iPhone 12 Pro,  then served him with a warrant and then, quote, he was forced to provide biometric data to unlock the phone.  Now, that stopped me right there in my tracks.  I thought that was very interesting.  First of all, the federal agents knew enough to not give him a moment to react.  Take the phone first before you give him the warrant.  And then it's an iPhone 12.  So I think what they probably did is say, hey, John, look here.  Is this your phone?  And then it unlocked.  And then they probably had a celebrate tool or something similar, plugged it in, sucked all the data out of it.  Now, of course, they kept the phone.  It's interesting for a couple of reasons.  One, January 6th was a while ago, like a year and a half ago.  They still think there's something on that phone that's worth a judge, obviously, didn't he?  Wouldn't he have signed the warrant?

Transcript:  Well, before we move on, I don't think it was look at your look at is this your phone?  Because they didn't say they tricked him into forced him.  Forced.  So they, yeah, they stood on it, sat on his chest and two people grabbed his ears.  And who knows?  I mean, what does that mean?  Forced.  I mean, that's just plus his language.  Remember that.

Start time: 6011.42
End time: 6035.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I mean, look, they probably told him and this is my guess.  My guess is that they probably told him if you do not use your phone to unlock, use your face to unlock this, we will arrest you.  Well, they.  This is what I'm guessing happened.  I mean, I don't know.  But I'm guessing that that's how they compelled him to do it.  So this is with other biometrics of like your fingerprint, they your password rather like they can't they can't force you to get them the passcode.

Start time: 6035.20
End time: 6068.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's where this gets really interesting.  So the Fourth Amendment, the Constitution, protects you against unreasonable search and seizure.  And the Fifth Amendment protects you against incriminating yourself.  And this is where courts have gone, by the way, in two different directions.  But the in general, the gist is biometrics is not self-incrimination.  Putting your fingerprint on a fingerprint reader or your face in the face ID is not self-incrimination.  We're giving a passcode would be.

Like, like I because I don't and I've been doing that for years because I don't want to be in that situation.  I will say I'm only being a little bit flippant here, but it would be nice if a constitutional law scholar, we can question many of his other things, but it would be nice if a constitutional law scholar would have maybe taken would have maybe declined to unlock his his phone and actually force this issue.  Like, I'm sorry, but like Eastman is a constitutional law scholar.  This would have been business.  It is to be to be completely candid, like putting it how you feel about his other credentials aside.  I don't really care.  I don't agree with him on many things, but it seems like this was a really missed opportunity for what could have been a really interesting legal case by especially by someone with his credentials.  If he had just basically said, no, I'm not going to unlock my phone.  Like, I don't know.  I would like to think I would go to jail.  It's me.  To me, I would like to say, and I can't say this definitively.  I've not been in this situation.  I don't want to be in this situation.  But to me, I would like to think that I would I would spend a night in jail.

I mean, I would think he would have.  I mean, maybe maybe he didn't think it.  Maybe he says I didn't do anything wrong.  So I'm not going to wipe my phone.  I'll keep all those texts.

Transcript:  I remember talking to these Secret Service agents some many years ago who said it's not a big deal.  They almost always give us the password.  It's like crooks like, yeah, fine, whatever.  They're not.  I don't know.  Anyway, just in case you don't know.  And by the way, again, there have been courts that have ruled that you have to give that password.  Who was it was in jail for two years for contempt because he didn't unlock his hard drive.  It was a child molester and he apparently thought there was something on that drive.  He didn't want law enforcement to see law enforcement thought there was something on the drive they wanted to see.  He refused to give his encryption password up.  Spend some time in jail.  He was out of jail, but never did unlock that.  But he was imprisoned for not giving up the password.  And the courts at the time said that is not self-incrimination.  And it had something to do with whether the police knew that information was on there or it was a phishing expedition.  Oh, I see.

Yeah, I think I just hit the button twice and then it will go into a mode where you have to enter the passcode to get in.  And the theory is now you've protected it because the Fourth Amendment or the Fifth Amendment prevents them from forcing you to get the give them the passcode.  Whereas the courts have ruled it is not incriminating to get your face ID.  Oh, here's what it is.  Here's what it is.

If they tell you, you must refuse.  They can and will lie to you about this.  If you really need to hand it over, they'll take it from you and they won't get anything from it because you've already hard locked it.  And you know, you cannot be required to give them your passcode.  That really is kind of a you know, a little bit of a optimistic point of view.  Like they're going to have me in an airport jail and there and I'm can't give me you can't require me to give you my passcode.  Well, here's a wrench.  Here's your head.

Transcript:  So MoFi is a company that's been around for decades.  They're actually up our way in Sebastopol.  And their claim to fame was they're selling vinyl records that are mastered from the original digital,  non-digital analog masters of classics, Asia from Steely Dan or even Thriller, which was mastered to tape.  And they were selling it this way for a long time until a record store owner, Phoenix Record Shop owner,  said, according to pretty reliable sources, MoFi, Mobile Fidelity, has been using digital files instead to create these vinyl records.  They are not analog masters.  And then a number of people spoke up and said, you know, that makes sense,  because if they're making these vinyl records from analog masters, they have to keep rewinding the tape and playing it, rewinding the tape.  Nobody's going to allow them to do that.  So, in fact, it's now come out.  Engineers, MoFi didn't want to admit it, but engineers from MoFi have started to say, yeah, we started using digital stream.  It's called Direct Stream Digital Technology.  In 2011, on a release of Tony Bennett's I Left My Heart in San Francisco.  And by the end of 2011, 60 percent of their vinyl releases used digital sources.  You're laughing because of the hipsters.  I am laughing.

I bought all of the variations of Taylor Swift's folklore album on vinyl, all like seven versions.  Right.  I've got them all.  So I'm laughing at myself in terms of this, too, because I had looked at maybe getting that the Thriller album that they have up for preorder, which is like one hundred dollars, which they're claiming came from like the analog master.  I was like, oh, well, you know, maybe that would be really cool.  Now I'm like, you absolute idiot because they're just sourcing it from a digital master and they can say, oh, well, it sounds this good and whatnot.  Okay.  Well, no, this is just more proof that people who buy into audio file stuff, which again, I'm absolutely one of these people like we're we're basically flushing money down the toilet for minute things that we claim differences.  We claim we can hear that we absolutely cannot hear for the aesthetic and for other things.  So I love this.  It's also hilarious that the initial response from the community was to attack this record store guy and be like, you're wrong.  You're wrong.  And then like the company admits it and it's like, oh, yeah, sorry.

And now I know it's a placebo, which is I think most of us who are part of kind of the hobby would admit that we know that we're just paying more to pay more.  You know, but it's not joy.  It does.

And I lose the page and all of that frustration.  But I prefer the experience, even though it's much easier to read it on my phone where I don't have to like have a lot of people read it on my phone.  I don't have to like have a light and can't see the letters because the lights not bright enough.  But there's something that's a joyful thing about actually being able to hold and own and manipulate something that isn't just digital.  So go for it.  Enjoy it.

I want to hold her hand as a there.  It's not about the sound quality.  That sounded like crap.  But but there is an aesthetic to taking an album out of the sleeve.  They've got the liner notes.  There's a whole thing.  You clean it with the dishwasher.  Three drops.  That's all.  And then you put it on the thing.  You gently lower the needle on there.

Start time: 6813.30
End time: 6882.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  And they very they might actually have a better master because a lot of times the reason people get mad about digital masters isn't because digital.  There's anything wrong with it.  It's because the mastering process or the remastering has been like crunched and compressed to the point that it sounds terrible.  And you can actually hear like and this isn't a BS audio file thing.  You can do like a B sampling where there have been conclusive differences where you can take like a CD that was pressed in like 1990 and one that was pressed in 2015.  And it's the same album.  They sound very different because of the way the mastering process works.  So it's possible that they still do a superior job with mastering and that they still have a better source material.  They're doing from this vinyl.  But since a big part of their, you know, like whole thing has been like, oh, we're coming from like directly from the analog, which is especially with the fact that like vinyl plants are almost impossible for people to even get time on.  Like things are backlogged so much that the additional time that you're adding to that would be untenable to do, especially to do like a large batch thing like the Thriller album where they said they do 40,000 copies like they.

I want to hold your hand.  Fourth generation.  Exactly.  You don't want it to be that way.  So yeah, I mean, I think that some of it is probably much to do about nothing, but it is funny to like see people who are still trying to convince themselves that it's better.  That said, like they also sell, I wasn't aware of this, they sell super audio CDs.  I'm super excited to see that the SACD market is coming back a little bit.  Is it?  It seems to be, which there are like some preorders and coming soon re-releases on SACD.  That's actually much more exciting to me.  So, sorry.

They had a very, it's famous, a very famous theater in there with really good Revel speakers.  I mean, just a really nice setup.  And he played an A-B comparison for me between it.  Now, it was admittedly, it was Steely Dan.  It was not a very complex piece of music, but between an analog and a digital, I think it was an even MP3 recording.  It might have been an AAC.  But remember, Dolby was very much into these digital compression technologies and it was indistinguishable.  But and then I've also had people say, now listen carefully and you can hear, you know, there's some loss of fidelity in like the symbol here.  And if they teach you and tell you what to listen to, you can kind of tell an MP3, especially a 128 kilobit MP3 isn't as good as, say, you know, a lossless version of the CD.  But most people, let's face it, they're listening on those crappy AirPods.

Transcript:  Well, that's this is this is the thing, right?  Like this is always, you know, you know, this is this is the hilarious thing about the vinyl world.  So if you go to like the R slash vinyl, like separate it and stuff, you have a lot of people who are wanting to get turntables and other things.  And then one of the first questions they ask is, OK, so how do I listen to this with Bluetooth?  How do I connect this to my sonos?  How do I know their stuff?  No, you can do it like I do actually have my connected to my sonos.  But I'm primarily when I want to listen to vinyl, I have like my very expensive like headphones plugged in directly to my amp plugged into my turntable.  And that's how I'm enjoying the experience.  But it is very funny that people will want to on the one hand take on the aesthetic, but on the other hand, immediately want to be able to listen to it wirelessly.  And it's like, OK, you do understand what you've just done here.  You've just completely given up the entire thing.  Like, I get it.  It's nice to be able to drop a needle on something and do that.  But anything you want to try to claim about like audio fidelity is completely out the window as soon as you are using analog to digital converter.  Bluetooth and but even just doing an analog to digital converter, because in that case, in most cases you're taking OK, something that was digital became analog.  Now it's becoming digital again.

Transcript:  Georgia Dow, Christina Warren, our brawl, our brawl, all heady.  That was a fun show.  I was surrounded.  We will be back with more when we come back.  How cable lost its market share is a bad year for cable.  But first, a word from our sponsor.  You know, all during the show, I've been talking about sponsors who've been with us all year long.  I'm going to take this moment to tell you about a brand new sponsor with a very cool product.  Decisions.  That's the name of the company.  Decisions.  Decisions gives IT and business experts the tools to automate anything in your company with one easy to use, no code platform.  That's right.  No code.  It's so easy to use.  Decisions is proven to fix any business process and prepare you to withstand economic uncertainty.  Recession resilience requires a deliberate management of resources and the flexibility to adapt at the flip of a coin.  The decisions no code environment makes it easy for your team to collaborate, to build and adjust workflows, to create dynamic forms,  decisioning processes that fit your unique and ever changing business needs.  That's so important with today's IT talent shortage.  And I think it's great even if you had all the IT in the world because you want the people with the knowledge to design that app or because they've got the knowledge.  Right.  Decisions process automation software is a complete toolkit.  It lets developers and business users alike.  You don't have to be a developer to build applications and automations.  Why?  Because there's no code required.  The no code platform is so powerful.  It includes robust rules and workflow engines, a host of pre-built integrations that connect to any legacy system via their API.  But the thing is, you're not writing code.  You're dragging and dropping.  It's a visual interface design.  You can deploy it on prem.  You can deploy it in the cloud.  You just say connect this to that.  Our business rule is this.  Our business rule is that.  It's so easy.  You know, at the beginning of the pandemic, there were a lot of companies just completely out.  Right.  Decisions.  Customers different.  They were fully equipped to respond to the pandemic.  One of the country's largest private banks built an entire PPP loan application process.  Remember how quickly that PPP thing happened?  The banks were scrambling to get ready.  Well, this customer didn't have to scramble.  They were able to do it all in just two days.  They were able to get their PPP loan applications for small businesses set up and already in taking customers.  They were first to market, and that's why they were able to raise a billion dollars in loans.  And that was before the competition even started.  You probably saw the story in the paper.  It was quite amazing.  And that's all thanks to decisions.  Decisions lets you customize workflows to automate the small decisions, producing faster results with greater accuracy, letting your team focus on the important, well, decisions.  Right.  Scale your business to better serve your customers while reducing operational costs and saving your team valuable time.  There's so many great examples I could tell you.  If you go to the website, you'll see quite a few of them.  Decisions.com slash twit.  Decisions.com slash twit.  But I'll give you one that's actually a really good example.  Otis Elevator.  Two million elevators all over the world using a variety of different software systems, all incompatible.  How do you as Otis Elevator keep track of two million elevator systems?  You need to do daily pulse checks.  You need to get maintenance alerts so you can fix a problem before it happens.  You're doing it globally.  You're doing it with disparate systems.  When they turn to decisions, they were able to design a solution that actually runs daily pulse checks across all two million elevators.  They know ahead of time before a problem is going to occur.  They know exactly what status every single elevator.  This is an amazing revelation for Otis.  It was all thanks to Decisions Automation Software.  And they could do it themselves.  They could do it themselves.  So next time you're in an Otis elevator, thank Decisions.  You get your destination safely.  They have an amazing track record, amazing safety record.  Thank Decisions for that.  Look, recession is maybe on the way.  It's certainly hard to find talented staff.  Developers are rarer than hen's teeth.  The durability of your business is directly going to impact your performance, your ability to survive.  You've got to have a foundation.  And very often it's the case of getting the right software out there, the right business rules out there, the right automation going.  You need Decisions.  Decisions Automation Platform provides a solution to any business challenge, automating anything and changing everything  to improve your company's speed to market, financial growth, and ultimately operational success.  They help industry leaders alleviate bottlenecks and automate pain points in their business so you can do what you do best,  change the world, let Decisions do the coding.  And you do it all yourself.  It's really remarkable.  Learn more about Decisions.  Know code automation platform.  Scope your free proof of concept.  Go to decisions.com slash twit.  We're really excited to welcome Decisions to the twit family.  I think this is their first ad.  I spent some time talking to the team about what they do.  It is mind boggling.  Go to the website.

We still have a little bit more.  The best of twit 2022.  Our look back continues.  Some of the best moments in a great year.  And happy holidays.  Thanks for joining us.  I now give you back to Leo.  This was a story that came out a few months ago, but actually just I saw in the last quarter, a little update.  Cable TV lost almost a million subscribers.  We were talking about this a few months ago.  Watch.  For the first time ever in Q2, cable lost broadband market share.  A negative growth quarter.  People are moving away from cable internet service.  How do we explain that?  The top seven U.S. cable companies lost over 60,000 subscribers April, May, and June.  Comcast, the number one internet service provider in the country, was flat.  Gained no new users.  Number two, Charter lost 21,000 customers.  Number three, Altice lost 39,000 customers.  Is this just a blip or is this signaling a sea change?

Transcript:  Wasn't this the promise of 5G?  5G was going to be so fast that it was going to be.  So you add that to the fact that not everybody needs a computer.  If you just do all of your computing on your phone and you can't really tell the difference in speed between.  Because, you know, remember, even if you have the best ISP in the world, you're still limited to your Wi-Fi speeds.  So maybe people are just like, hey, this is good enough.  No worries.  I think you nailed it.

Start time: 7703.14
End time: 7706.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yep.  I have a PS to that.  Yeah, go ahead.

Start time: 7707.53
End time: 7721.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  The PS to that is for power users.  Cable can't get fiber to a lot of places.  So I know that we dumped our cable to go with AT&T because they could get us fiber.

Start time: 7721.22
End time: 7762.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, AT&T has been aggressive in rolling out fiber.  In fact, it's interesting because Google had stopped doing fiber, Google fiber.  They just announced, I think, five new cities and they're going to be rolling out more fiber.  So maybe this is the fibers time.  It's 5G's time.  I agree.  Both T-Mobile and Verizon are selling home Internet service now wirelessly.  For my daughter, who lives near a highway, so she's near Verizon Towers.  I bought it's twenty five dollars a month.  She's getting one hundred fifty megabyte megabits down.  I think twenty up for nothing.  And it's just a wireless box you put in there, you turn it on and it works.  Doc Rock, you were going to say something.

Start time: 7763.03
End time: 7823.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was going to say like a couple of things that are going on as well.  When everybody started looking at places to sort of pinch pockets a little bit, if you have, for instance, Verizon, they were doing your Netflix streaming doesn't count against your bill.  Right.  So once each one of the companies has a thing that they offer for free without using your data plan or whatever.  So, for instance, in AT&T, it was HBO, which I think might change now that it got sold.  But anyway, people are using that to watch what they need to watch or just ignoring the watching altogether and just watching the social stuff because like T-Mobile has streaming.  You can stream stuff on YouTube or whatever without taxing your bill.  So then you don't need that at the house and you get your broadband outside at work or whatever to do the heavy lifting stuff.  But most of your just consumption stuff you can do on iPad, iPhone, Apple TV, Android TV boxes and the like.

Start time: 7823.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of like the end of the landline phone, right?  People just doing everything on their cell.  It is the case that fixed wireless, that's what they call the T-Mobile and Verizon home Internet.  It's fixed wireless.  Huge growth. 816,000 new subscribers in Q4.  Wait, what was that?  Wow.  Yeah.  So there you go.  T-Mobile and Verizon are seeing steady gains for their FWA fixed wireless services, which together picked up 816,000 subs in Q2, April, May and June of this year.

Start time: 7861.94
End time: 7881.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, again, this is what they told us was going to happen.  I just got so jaded about the fact that 5G showed up and we're not having the telemedicine surgeries yet or whatever.  So I thought it was overblown hype, but maybe it's just now happening.

Start time: 7882.07
End time: 7926.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, here's the cool thing to look out for.  If T-Mobile is growing at that clip and somehow I'm a Deadpool Mobile subscriber, which runs on T-Mobile.  So like if Ryan and Mrs. McElhaney can get over there and talk it up and get them to allow us to get one of these in the house.  Hey, it's on. I'm switching.  Oh, yeah. Wouldn't you love a Mint Mobile fixed wireless?  Yeah, I call it Deadpool Mobile.  And my girlfriend's other boyfriend is Ryan Reynolds.  So I actually like him too.  I'm like, hey, it's incredible.  It's absolutely incredible.  And I do believe if they could figure out a way to let some of the I want to call them MV&E's, but that's a hard drive.  What do you call it?  Smaller mobile companies.  MV&Os.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah.  This is also I just switched to a different carrier, which I won't name for various sponsor reasons and things like that.

Start time: 7942.36
End time: 7952.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But we should mention Mint Mobile is a sponsor.  Mint Mobile is great.  But no, you don't have to say that at all.  You can even mention your other carrier.

Start time: 7952.22
End time: 7978.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  They sponsor my show as well.  So I do love Mint Mobile.  So you don't want to say the other carrier.  So but the other thing that has just happened since I did that switch, I never used to get a millimeter wave.  And I have and I live in New York City.  So that was also why I got jaded.  I was like, OK, it's a year, two years in this time.  This on its just tight.  But now I've been getting it.  Really?  It actually is noticeable that it's faster.

Start time: 7978.44
End time: 7991.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I don't I mean still millimeter wave, which is the fastest gigabit plus telco cellular data is very, very limited, both in locations and range.  It only goes 800 feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  So you must be living near a tower and weird places because it's on my walk.  I do walks and runs around Prospect Park and then Windsor Terrace on Prospect Park, Southwest.  Boom, it shows up exactly.  But then, you know, Grand Army Plaza where there's tons of people, it never shows up.  Right. Yeah.  When it does show up, it is noticeable.  Yeah. You will notice a difference.

Start time: 8013.06
End time: 8073.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the big change, though, was the mid band, the rollout of the mid band.  So there are three bands.  There's millimeter wave, which is a very, very high frequency.  There's the 700 megahertz low frequency, which is really no faster than LTE.  So you could be on it.  Technically, it's 5G, but you'd never know.  But and I'm seeing it here.  I'm seeing it everywhere.  This is what my daughter is getting.  There's this mid band, which is very fast, is noticeably faster than LTE.  That is being very widely rolled out by all the big three carriers.  And I think that is really what's happening.  And that's the yeah, I like you, Doug.  I'm mocked 5G.  I remember that Apple announcement, not last year, but the year before, where they said 5G every three seconds.  You know, maybe it was they were too early on that.  Maybe they were jumping on this marketing thing.  But I think it is now starting to happen.  And I think maybe that you're exactly right.  That's what's happening to Comcast Charter, Cox, Altis, MediaCom, Cable One and Breeze Line.

Start time: 8075.74
End time: 8093.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, I noticed that Spectrum is not on the list, but it's funny because that's our building contract for the condo.  They just came in and stuck in all of the internal fiber lines.  So we're switching over to Spectrum fiber middle September while I'm on my road trip.

Start time: 8093.40
End time: 8108.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they're not on this list probably because they didn't announce their quarterly results this past week.  But between the big broadband companies, they still have 75 million households of the 109 million households that are getting broadband.  So they're still dominant.

Start time: 8109.20
End time: 8113.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  What was that number that you said?  800,000 people in one quarter.  That's not significant.

Start time: 8116.42
End time: 8180.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, they only have 2.2 million.  These are brand new services.  And if they're growing at the rate of nearly a million a quarter, it ain't going to be long before.  It's got to be growing at the cost of the cable companies.  I think that's very interesting.  Cable companies are suffering anyway.  LastPass, which was for many years a sponsor of our shows, it is one of the most used, if not the most used, password manager out there, has admitted they were hacked.  Lawrence Abrams at the Bleebing Computer had this story two weeks ago.  He asked them.  They didn't.  They clammed up.  But finally, this week admitted that they were in fact hacked.  But to reassure you, if you use LastPass, there's no evidence that customer data or password vaults were compromised.  The threat actors stole portions of the LastPass source code and something LastPass calls proprietary LastPass technical information.

Start time: 8182.42
End time: 8200.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  Hmm.  Hmm.  Hmm.  Well, it did force me to go check my security settings and turn on two factor authentication, which I hadn't done.  Oh, yes.  Change my password, which I hadn't done for a while.  And so if nothing else, at least a little fire under my butt, because this one scared me.

Start time: 8201.59
End time: 8245.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  And I guess the worst case scenario, they don't have the passwords and clear.  The worst case scenario would be, though, that they got the vaults, which most people who use LastPass store on LastPass servers and then could at their leisure attempt to brute force them.  And if so, if you didn't have a good master password, you might be vulnerable at that point.  Since we all put, you know, the keys to the kingdom in our password vaults, I don't use LastPass anymore.  But no matter what you use, that's got everything in it.  It would behoove you to use one, a good long password, which is hard because you have to remember that one for your master password.  I'm sure, Becky, you did not use monkey one, two, three.

Start time: 8245.32
End time: 8247.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  No, it was password one, two, three.  Much better.

Start time: 8248.44
End time: 8295.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And make sure the O's are zeros.  OK, a little, a little elite tip there for you.  No, use a good long, strong somewhat.  You know what I do?  I'm not going to use a 28 character random password.  Nobody's got time to memorize that.  I take I don't want to be too explicit about what I'm doing because I don't want you to reverse engineer it.  But let's say you took maybe you memorized.  Will, I know because you had a good public school education, you have memorized many great poems.  Let's say you had Lord Tennyson poem committed to memory.  Half a league, half a league, half a league onward.  The light brigade, right?  Yeah, so a great, a great one.  I don't use that.

Start time: 8296.20
End time: 8303.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I use.  Yeah, I think there are two interesting things.  Let me explain what I do before you do that.

Start time: 8303.48
End time: 8347.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I wouldn't make my password half a league, half a league, half a league onward all rolled into the valley of death.  I would make it HAL, HAL, HALO.  And maybe I would do uppercases on certain kinds of words.  Maybe I'd add punctuation.  And then just to make it really good.  So that I can remember because I remember the poem and I can reconstruct the beginning part.  I will add something else that I know.  For instance, what I like to use is my childhood telephone number, which I memorized as a little kid, but is not in a phone book anywhere anymore.  I hope.  So by adding those seven or ten extra digits, I think that's a pretty good password.  Not likely to be.  Yeah.

Start time: 8348.40
End time: 8398.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  So most security experts say that the best password is not a password, but either a phrase or a mnemonic.  So a mnemonic is a great thing.  Yeah, that's what I'm using is a mnemonic.  Yeah.  So take let's take, for example, because I'm here, William Shakespeare and Julius Caesar says the fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars, but in ourselves.  So you would have capital T F D capital B I N I O S comma or exclamation point.  Let's have a special character.  And that is absolutely, you know, uncrackable because nobody's going that's not a real word, but it's something that's easy to remember.  It's a selection of random things that's completely easy to remember.  And that's a great way of doing it.

Start time: 8398.58
End time: 8407.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  I got another another way of thinking about this is a Steve Gibson trick, which is to use a password that you know pretty well that might be short and then pack it with symbols.

Start time: 8432.69
End time: 8443.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes.  Or characters.  That's why I do that phone number.  He calls it password haystacks.  That's right.  Length makes it harder to brute force, even if you add length in a kind of trivial way.

Start time: 8444.06
End time: 8453.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_18
Transcript:  But if you use characters, because there's so many of them, most he says that most brute force attack, they don't use as many characters because it's harder and it creates more variables.

Start time: 8454.38
End time: 8465.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So clearly the best password is completely long, random strings of alphanumerics and special characters.  But no one can memorize that.  So that's why for your master password.

But I just thought it was such a smart idea that was simple passwords are so hard for people.

You're going to have a something.  The new iPhone Pros have a seven notch, a cut out to actually there's one that's kind of laws and shaped and one that's a little dot.  But you will never see those two because of Dynamic Island.  And I want to give I think this is actually pretty impressive.  I want to give Apple credit for taking lemons and making lemonade out of it.  They said they leaned into what is unfortunately something you have to do a cut out on the screen.  And I think they've made it better.  I'm pretty impressed with the Dynamic Island.  The animation is amazing.

Transcript:  So like the name whatever like I'm sure they went to eight dozen names that came up with that.  Yeah, there's no name that would have made me super happy with that.  And they probably didn't want another situation where like Matthew Panzerino called it a notch and it sticks for five years or something.  And you know, you call that thingy on the top, you know, the little they would call it a pill and it would sound like drugs and Apple would hate it every time they heard it.  So they had to get ahead of that.

Transcript:  But the animations, Leo, these are the most playful, interesting, amusing, like you haven't seen it.  Well, you haven't seen it in person, have you?  No, neither have I.  But well, no, I've seen like Justine and Marquez's videos.  Yeah, videos.  A lot of the Apple stuff.  Looks good.  But like if you go frame by frame to do some of those, it is like this is classic Apple.  This is like what we haven't seen from them in a while because some of the stuff has been a little janky over the last couple of years.  This is really nice.

Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, Annie and Akko's reaction is this is the first user interface affordance in a long time that really makes a lot of sense.  And by the way, no one knew it was that was not true.  I didn't see any rumors about it.  Did you?  No one knew that they were going to do this.

Transcript:  Can I be honest with you, Leo?  Now that I'm out and I can be based about this kind of stuff.  Most of the leaks are wrong.  Like they don't really know what's happening.  They get like little bits of fragmentary information weeks and months after it was at all relevant anymore.  And it's just like if you go back and look like there was this huge scandal, I barely I saw it, but I tried to stay away from it where they were yelling at each other and accusing each other of deleting their tweets to hide bad calls and stuff.  It's like, ah, no, like I'm glad that we live in an era now where Apple is like, here it is.  Like it's fun.  Go play with it.  And like you can follow the rumors if you want, but they're not going to be exact.

Transcript:  OK, thank you.  I agree.  I for a long time I actually banned rumors.  But the problem when Mac break weekly was as we got closer and closer and Apple event, there was less to talk about, less and less.  So we finally had a cave and start doing rumors.  So the idea is this pill.  And by the way, there's a API so that developers of apps can use it as well will respond to the conditions.  So it'll show you what's going on.  It's basically a permanent widget, but it changes in size and shape depending on what you're doing.  I think that's brilliant.  Robert, are you excited?  Do you like it?

Transcript:  I mean, OK, look, I mean, it looks OK.  It's fine.  I mean, yes, it's going to take getting used to.  And yes, I don't.  It's not revolutionary, but I don't understand why people are getting upset.  I mean, I've seen Twitter threads where people were saying this is destroying the iPhone.  What?  I'm thinking why?  You've seen this before.  You've seen the notch.

Start time: 8799.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think it makes the iPhone a little friendly plastic pal you want to be with because it's changing in response to what you're doing and giving you just the information you want.  I think potentially this is super cool.  We've never seen a widget like this.  And it sure does solve the problem of what are we going to do with this big fat hole on our screen?  By the way, it's iPhone Pro only.  They didn't put it in the notches still on the old iPhone.

Transcript:  Did they need like because that that camera focuses now, correct?  Yes.  That's the camera that.  So is it is it that they had to lower it from the top edge because of that?  Like, is that mechanism that goes?  Because I was just curious.  Well, it's just like they only they only gained like not that many lines worth of pixels above it.  So it's like, why did you really need to shift it down?  So I would imagine there maybe there's got to be some guts in there on the inside that that's interesting.  Interesting question.

Transcript:  They decided, you know, it's a lozenge and a pill.  And they decided to show the activation lights for your microphone and the camera on the screen.  But it looks like it's part of this larger black area.  But the screen is blackened, really.  So they're hiding the fact that there's two holes.  I don't know. We'll see when we get them, whether you ever notice that there's two holes.  We'll see how responsive it is.

Transcript:  Would the iPhone nothing still have the notch?  It also has the old A15 chip.  Is the differentiation?  It's just it's just marketing.  This is marketing.  Isn't it using the old model screen?  Oh, is it? Maybe that's it.  Maybe they couldn't cut a hole in it.
