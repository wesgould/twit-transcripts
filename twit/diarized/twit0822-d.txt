Start time: 438.14
End time: 455.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  every time there's like a big rush on some sort of crypto suddenly Robinhood just goes down I mean  I'm not a conspiracy theorist I don't think they're doing it on purpose but it uh definitely is one of  those things that you could kind of roll your eyes a little bit um I'll just give you a little I  dumbly bought my Doge from them but it's also like if it if it goes to zero I don't care it's an easy

Start time: 455.82
End time: 464.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  way to buy it I think you know that's if if I didn't want to keep my daughter from losing her  pants I would have I would have told her get Robinhood but I wasn't going to tell her that

Start time: 465.60
End time: 508.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  absolutely well Leah I actually had a family member ask me the same question like how do I buy  Doge um because they started out asking me how do I sign up for Robinhood and I said well  so why would you do that stocks yeah yeah and you know I was starting to talk about the payment for  order flow problems and then it turned into Doge and I was like whoa whoa whoa whoa because you  you can't actually buy cryptocurrency on Robinhood oh what are you buying you can give Robinhood money  and they'll put an entry in your account that says that you have however many Doge coins but  you can't transfer it out and you can't transfer cryptocurrency you own in and there's no regulation

Start time: 509.02
End time: 523.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right now of this activity so should you go to somewhere like Coinbase instead yeah the  problem is with Doge doesn't do Doge yeah doesn't do Doge which really makes me wonder

Start time: 525.02
End time: 555.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Owen let's let's be serious about this like no one in the consumer world really wants to own  a cryptocurrency what they want is exposure to price appreciation of the cryptocurrency and they  can do that with Robinhood or you know Cash App via Square or PayPal whatever and so I've been  getting tweets about this all week people telling me that you know crypto volume on other provider  access not real because you don't own it not your keys not your coins people don't care the mass  market just wants to make money and so this argument that you shouldn't buy stuff on Robinhood

Start time: 555.80
End time: 568.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  to me is is specious okay so you can't you can't transfer it in you can't transfer it out and it  randomly crashes so how do you own it if you well let me you randomly can't access it the only

Start time: 568.26
End time: 585.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  concern I would have is if I buy it on Robinhood and they didn't really make that transaction and  Dogecoin goes through the roof can I reasonably expect to get that appreciation and somehow  capitalize on it can I do anything with it after that no so the great the great news

Start time: 586.56
End time: 633.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the great news is that the Biden administration actually appointed one of the world's most  sophisticated experts on cryptocurrencies Gary Gensler to be chair of the SEC and he testified  this week before Congress about all these problems and what I think we're going to see is that the  SEC is going to start regulating exchanges they're not going to be regulating cryptocurrency like a  stock like really tightly but I think they you know I think the Robinhood example is a is a great  case of why you need some regulation like Robinhood should be required to have some kind of uptime  requirement they should be required to let you transfer cryptocurrency in and out and they should  be required to make you good if you try to sell it and their systems crash and you can't sell it

Start time: 633.88
End time: 771.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and the price drops yeah no I totally agree with that I think I do partially agree with Alex I  think that some people especially for for coins like Doge where you don't really care so much if  you're owning it on the blockchain right like it's one of those things okay fine you own it you don't  you're day trading it it's a gamble it is pure gambling like I put money into it it is pure  gambling if it disappears all of it tomorrow fine but a lot but for something like say Ethereum or  more notably Bitcoin where there are limits right where it's not like actually a meme coin and and  people have given it some sort of value I wouldn't recommend that people buy it on Robinhood if they  are wanting to look at it as some sort of long-term investment and not something to just have and kind  of like you know a money market account because as to Owen's point you're you don't own it they own  the coin you own whatever value it is at that moment and because there's not the regulation and  they don't have the uptime requirements like other exchanges if and I don't think Robinhood is going  to go under but if some of these services did something happened they would probably be like  okay well we only owe you this amount but we don't actually owe you the coin itself because it doesn't  belong to you so because we never really bought it in the first place exactly because you're just  getting you're just buying the value of it and that said there are some real advantages of using  Robinhood or PayPal or Cash App or whatever one of them being the transaction times and those fees  because you can really quickly and and make money sped up if that's what you want to do without  having to wait the the you know time and pay the the fee you have to pay with with a normal exchange  I looked into buying Doge this was in January I looked at buying Doge an actual exchange and  I realized there weren't any reputable ones I actually wanted to give my information to so I  was like all right fine I'll open a Robinhood account by the time it was approved the meme had  died or so I thought and I forgot about the account and then three weeks ago and a half weeks  ago I started seeing the Doge was was going up again and I put money into it and sadly well I  mean fortunately for me but also hilariously if it all goes you know the opposite direction I it's  funny either way like I've now like tripled my money so there you go I feel like this is to say

Start time: 771.26
End time: 830.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's a meme coin is to really inflate the the value of Ethereum or Bitcoin beyond I mean it's  all the same stuff it's crypto it's let me play these I just feel like I don't know between  NFTs Dogecoin going through the roof GameStalks GameSpot stock going through the roof which is  the last time you were on Alex by the way yep I feel like we live in not the best time I worry  we're in the Weimar Republic right before the Nazis took power is what I worry about let me  play this clip from Saturday Night Live the only one I'll play this is Elon Musk who said by the  way in his opening that he was the first Asperger's host of Saturday Night Live which actually is not  even true whether he's Asperger's or not I don't know here he is playing a financial analyst named

Transcript:  great Leo is if we had comedians go on SNL because whenever they have a comedian on the show is funny  whenever they bring someone on he's not a comedian yeah it's not funny it's painful to watch him try

Start time: 857.96
End time: 873.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to read cue cards the cue cards yeah it's really painful it's not good so I was going to play it  until the point where he said that Dogecoin was just a hustle but I don't I think you got the point  I don't think we need to play any more of this I wonder if I can buy some GameSpot stock right now and

Start time: 874.28
End time: 954.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  just go full circle yes Alex yes so here's my thought about your point about you know if you  call Dogecoin a meme what are Bitcoin and Ethereum? What's the difference? Yeah I mean it's all the same isn't it?  Well here's my perspective on this and I wrote about this a little bit this week on my personal  blog so that way I wouldn't get TC in trouble if people made fun of me but like you know to me  Ethereum as a crypto seems to be building a foundational layer which people are kind of building  stuff you know like the whole NFT hype thing is kind of built on top of the Ethereum blockchain  and you know we can all quibble about NFTs and how material they are how long they last whatever  but it just goes to show you can build stuff that consumers actually want to buy or use or invest in  on top of Ethereum and the Ethercoin so cool that's fine with me but the arguments that you know  Doge is just a meme but Bitcoin is super solid is specious to me and like you say in the subhead  if Doge is dumb then Bitcoin is dumb oh wow that's my personal blog on Twitter I didn't mean to try  to endorse myself there but yeah so people were you know some Bitcoin maximalists that I follow  on Twitter were talking about how like you know guys be careful with Doge put your money in Bitcoin  and I was like well that's quite a statement and so I try to write about why I think it's a little  bit silly I think the hard cap arguments a little bit weak etc etc etc but I mean at least Ethereum  is a platform now you know people are building companies on top of it okay I'll get to that.

Start time: 954.98
End time: 964.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're saying there's some technology involved in Ethereum that makes it of more value let's say  than Doge or Bitcoin is that what you're saying?

Start time: 964.78
End time: 983.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yep because it's not just a quote-quote store of value which is essentially just you know people  buying it because they think other people are going to buy it right and so to me Ethereum has  a functionality and it has use it's it's not just. Is there any concern Owen that this is just like

Start time: 984.54
End time: 995.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  tulip bulbs that we've got that we're in just kind of a friends a financial frenzy that there's a lot  of greed and at some point the bubble is going to burst and we're all going to deeply regret

Start time: 995.58
End time: 1006.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  what has happened? I think if you look at the like total market value of these cryptocurrencies  it's not at a point where I'd really worry about like lasting damage to the the world.

Start time: 1006.70
End time: 1016.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But some people are going to get hurt I mean clearly oh yeah like if my daughter had bought  Dogecoin she I mean she doesn't have a lot of money she that would not have been. Yeah I think

Start time: 1016.94
End time: 1047.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  a top UK regulator said said over the past week like if you invest in cryptocurrency you should  fully expect it to go to zero like you should be prepared for it to go to zero.  And same thing with NFTs right? Yeah I mean NFTs are different because they're not you know  each NFT is kind of bespoke it's kind of its own thing and so it's you know sure any any NFT could  go to zero but with NFTs I think the analogy would be like a piece of fine art like yeah or

Start time: 1047.74
End time: 1057.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a baseball card you're buying something it's highly speculative you have no no notion of whether it's  going to go up or down but you know that presumably right? Yeah and the problem is more that it's

Start time: 1069.16
End time: 1112.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  about cryptocurrency like is it a new technology is it a store of value is it a price appreciation  you know mechanism. I think people buy cryptocurrency for different reasons I mean you  have to remember like in you know in over the course of various financial crises over the past  decade there are there are there were countries that did not have stable currencies like you know  the American dollar and they actually looked at Bitcoin mostly as like well this is something I  can buy and like I can avoid my country's hyperinflation or collapsing banks or what  have you. So there are actually real world examples where Bitcoin's been used as a better.

Start time: 1113.60
End time: 1126.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There are even some national banks including our own Federal Reserve looking at stable coin as a  as a possible offering right. They're thinking about instead of just printing money printing

Start time: 1126.36
End time: 1178.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  stable coin. Stable coin kind of takes that idea of fiat currency of you know a currency that is  just backed by a government which some people argue is no better than you know than a meme coin.  But they're essentially getting the benefits of blockchain technology and you know just you know  all the mechanisms by which you can trade cryptocurrency but attaching it to a stable  coin. But I think stable coins you know the problem with stable coin is they're they're not  exciting like you know Facebook there's no ups and downs. Yeah it's like why would you want that.  You know I think the prospect of you know the prospect of like of making money is what draws  a lot of people in. Yeah. I mean that's 100% why you know we have family members texting us

Start time: 1179.10
End time: 1201.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about like how do I buy Dogecoin. I think we've actually reached the end times because the star  of the the arch nemesis of the Tiger King Carol Baskin is now announcing she's releasing her own  crypto coin. She calls it a purr-ancy. Oh my gosh if Carol Baskin is issuing a crypto coin

Start time: 1203.40
End time: 1258.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  we're definitely at the end times. You know Leo your discussion of everything being kind of  an mania at the same time is applicable to several parts of the economy. I mean you know Owen and I  spend a lot of time looking at the stock market and we've been kind of enduring the rise of SPACs  and I think SPACs are a pretty good proxy for how speculative or risk on the traditional capital  markets are in the same way the NFTs and ICOs at different times have been I think kind of indicative  of how speculative and risk on the crypto markets have been. But everything seems to be pretty heated  at once and you know I don't know how long it's going to last. I think the youngest person here  is the least you know financial historical lived knowledge but to me probably doesn't end well.  You know when this stuff eventually unravels but it certainly is entertaining and fun to watch in  the meantime. I just don't have any of my personal assets in digital currencies because of journalism  rules but I would probably play along just for fun if I could. You know in most Western economies

Start time: 1258.86
End time: 1327.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  we've had low inflation a long time which means low interest rates and the response to pretty much  any kind of financial hiccup has been to batten down those interest rates to you know as close to  zero as possible. And so we've been kind of starved of you know we've been starved of like  sensible vehicles for you know for appreciating in value because you know interest rates are so  low you can't just put money in the bank. So I think that has like driven the appetite for risk  to a point where it does become kind of crazy because people are looking at it and saying well  like I don't feel like I can make really exciting gains in my forum. Okay the stock market has been  doing more than okay but you know that's you know like putting their money in an ETF slow and steady  dollar cost averaging that's boring. So you kind of have people you know like lacking entertainment  right because of the pandemic they can't go watch sports they can't go hang out at a bar  and super low interest rates and it just you know I think that creates this mania.

Start time: 1327.22
End time: 1350.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah so the risk aside to individuals some people will lose their shirts. Is there a risk though to  the financial stability of this country? Is there a risk to the markets to the global economy?  Is all of this investment in these kind of high-flying vehicles dangerous beyond just

Start time: 1350.70
End time: 1392.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  the risk to individual investors? We're starting to have a little exposure to the crypto economy  in Coinbase in Square right but I think as you know if you look at those holdings as a percentage  of the total market cap of the stock market you know if something bad happened to those companies  because of the crypto market I think we'd still be okay. I think the exposure of mainstream  financial institutions to cryptocurrencies is minimal though Goldman Sachs is starting up a  crypto trading desk so that means they're going to have some crypto related risk. Well you remember

Start time: 1393.10
End time: 1403.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what happened the last time the banks decided that they wanted to beat players we had the crash of  2008. There is that potential but you're saying they're being a little wiser this time and they're

Start time: 1403.94
End time: 1417.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  not and they're not. I just don't see a lot of exposure right now but you know then again  the thing you worry about is when they start building derivatives off of the stuff because

Start time: 1417.42
End time: 1424.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that like leverages risk. Yeah so you get little swings making these giant swings.

Transcript:  Run. Run for the hills. Hide your heart girl. Leo can I try this back to the tech world that  we talk about because I think probably some people are like oh my god they're talking about finance.

Start time: 1442.28
End time: 1468.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not a finance show I have two finance guys on and of course Cristina is an expert  on the speculative sneaker market so I think really the three of you really are all up on  this stuff and I am not but I do think it's tech in a way because well first it is it is kind of  what it really is is the impact of technologists on everything and in this case on the financial

Start time: 1468.84
End time: 1508.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  markets right. For sure but also keep in mind that all this cheap money is in many cases flowing into  young tech companies. So one one aspect of the stuff that Ohm was talking about a little bit  ago is that venture capital investment around the world is at an all-time high and what that means  is more money is being pumped into software companies and you know probably ever before.  So if you care about the technology world which is as we all know kind of grounded in software  well this stuff actually does impact your life. You don't have to care about it too much you don't  have to track all the stuff day to day like we do but I mean it is part of your world whether  you care or not so we're not being too obtuse. No and it's part of your world because you just

These private equity companies are really following chasing the  same thing aren't they Owen? They're trying to chase growth in an era of low interest rates.

Transcript:  I will say to the exposure point and this does tie it back into tech a little bit you do have  companies like I mean you know Elon Musk Tesla he said has a significant holding in Bitcoin right  and if you saw more companies following his lead I do think that although we be small you know at  to Owen's point in terms of like the the total financial thing if we saw more tech companies  saying we're going to put our holdings into you know cryptocurrency that has a real world impact  right because if those companies go down those are those jobs those are you know the people who  depend on those companies for contracts and other things so I think that opens it up a little bit

Transcript:  punting is this the right decision this is complete punting no I totally agree with you in fact that  was I was sort of excited that I wasn't gonna have to pay attention to this because I had you  know flown in and I was like I get to I get to give the baby I don't have to deal with it but of  course I know myself I'm like no of course I'm gonna pay attention to this and then I saw what  the decision was and at first I was like okay they reaffirmed the decision that seems fair and  then I read more about it was like oh no this is a complete punts because then they're saying oh  but you need to make a further decision wrong you gotta do it again if you really want to do it for  any longer blah blah blah yeah so I mean so the thing just seems a punt and more hand-wringing  to me and um I don't know I mean I personally think that the whole oversight board to be honest is  just smoke and mirrors and it's designed to make certain uh you know uh congressional  members of congress feel better about things but I don't really I think that it's a lot of it is  just pomp and circumstance and is uh smoke and mirrors and is kind of ineffectual to be totally  honest I don't feel like it you know in most cases I feel like they're probably going to  reaffirm what Facebook has done or maybe go back on some things that some people at Facebook wish  that they could do but yeah complete punt it was it was one of those things where you wait for this  decision and they hype it up as this big thing and it's like nope we're just going to continue  to kick this down and say well no this was okay but now you need to to come up with is this  indefinite or is this permanent or is this only for a certain period of time I don't know yeah

Transcript:  is that is that fair is that fair Christina here's my thing about this it reads if you go back to the  oversight board you can just go to oversight board.com great url and take a look for yourself  a list of criticisms about the company including things like uh it demands that Facebook undertake  a comprehensive review of its potential contribution to the narrative of electoral  fraud and the exacerbated tensions that culminated in the violence in the u.s on January 6th so to me  this is the board punting but directly back into Facebook's face like they didn't punt it oh who's  going to take care of it they literally just threw it back really hard at their nose and said you  guys need to have some freaking policies you need to do some gosh darn self-criticism here and dig  into how you run the company you can't just fob this off to us and so to me that that's good

Start time: 2098.94
End time: 2133.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that's that's better than no you're right yeah you're not wrong but I guess my my underlying  point is and yeah you're right they were critical of the company I think that's really important and  you see that but it's it's to me it's sort of similar to an ombudsman you know the newspaper  you know and public editors who I think do a great service when they are employed but what  what power do you really have like what what power does the oversight board really have this is my  point it's like they can throw this back at Facebook and say Facebook you need to do all these things  but that doesn't actually force Facebook to do anything Facebook is still run by their  board of directors is still run by Mark Zuckerberg well that's so that is the flaw in this whole

Start time: 2133.64
End time: 2139.26

Transcript:  it are go ahead oh so our reporter is issy lapowski uh actually interviewed Thomas Hughes who is the  director of the board uh he oversees the administration so he's he's kind of in charge  of the the oversight board's operations yeah and he made some really interesting points which is  that Facebook fundamentally asked the board to do something that was not in its charter oh  oh and that's why we see what looked might look like a punt it's really I think Alex  Alex is right it's a reverse punt it's saying hey Facebook you tried to punt this to us you

End time: 2201.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  interesting and I think that I think that was a really powerful statement actually of independence  by the oversight board that like they're not just going to cater to Facebook and like give them a  big leave when they want it and you know the hard decisions still have to be made by Facebook but  they have to be done well and responsibly that's what people said about the oversight board is

Start time: 2202.34
End time: 2217.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's it's merely uh window dressing that it's a way of Facebook giving having plausible deniability  well we gave we have a oversight board so the oversight board said we're not having any of this  you you better resolve this not we're not going to take it off your hands I think that was the

Start time: 2217.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  yeah that makes sense actually yeah also just throw one more thing in on this like you know  we talk about who runs the company one person runs the company it's mark it's his company  yeah yeah so like nothing else matters so like whenever we think about Facebook and oh was it  Cheryl or was it the oversight board or was it the board of directors was it Peter Thiel it's mark  it's mark's company he has decided to keep voting control in his hands ergo he's responsible for all  of it hands down in the story close the books you know so if you don't want that responsibility  then let other people have more votes per share you know jack you're see who runs twitter has been

Start time: 2286.60
End time: 2305.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is so adamant that when a account was created that was basically to repost what trump has decided to  do he kind of played with the idea of a social network he's doing a blog and and so they created  an account on twitter that would say a new blog post twitter took that down too they don't even

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  do you think he writes it i i think that this is what i my personal theory is i think that they paid  um and i would love to be able to see how much because it was the campaign that paid for this or  whatever paid for someone to design an app a mobile app that is basically like a mobile version of  twitter or wordpress that just lets him write in a text box and hit publish and then publishes

Transcript:  private companies shouldn't be able to put their thumbs on the scale of a of an election right or  of a political campaign that if somebody gets a nomination and is running he should be treated  like everybody else and so that is going to raise some very thorny ethical issues i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  go for it sorry i was just going to say but on the flip side like i i think that then you're equating  twitter and facebook to public you know funded like like you know like network media which which  goes back to like the the ftc and in the 30s in radio and then television right like there's a  reason why we're the fcc sorry where you had those provisions in the fcc and that's why you had to  have you know equal time clauses which don't exist anymore but why those networks have to broadcast  simulcast you know debates and things like that i i don't think that we're at the at the point where  we can say i mean maybe on a cultural level twitter and facebook have that influence and i  i would argue that they do but i don't know in terms of a funding perspective and and you know  oversight and the fact that they were not created by the government they weren't funded by those  things that they don't use you know airwaves in that in that way i guess they technically use  the internet which goes back to arpanet but that's slightly different i don't know if you can make  that same claim that like you are owed as a candidate the right to be on facebook or twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  right so our our free speech principles have been designed around kind of like the idea of  you're in boston and you can go down to the commons and you can shout whatever you want  right anyone who happens to be there but what if what if someone put up a a toll gate in front of  the commons and said we're going to decide if you can you know you can enter the commons or not and  like hey once you get past us you have completely free speech but um you know we're we're just gonna  you know but um you know crossing crossing this border this barrier that's up to us because this  is a private toll gate right here which happens to be in front of the commons just coincidentally  i think we're going to have to start thinking about you know the idea of free speech and the  public square in a little more nuanced way because social media is the way they are gatekeepers yeah  it's the way people engage with each other that's a good point um yeah you know that that said i  think the idea of of the government compelling speech is incredibly dangerous and when you talk  about essentially forcing a company to let someone on you're compelling that company to speak in a  certain way and i don't have a good way to thread those needles but i think you know i think we're  gonna have to spend a lot more time thinking about that in in a really nuanced way what about

Transcript:  do one more thing about this though like so owen and leo are very good on the the compelled speech  point i think it's an important part of the conversation but one other thing we don't think  about enough when we talk about this element is you know putting your thumb on the scale is a very  very broad thing and every one of these companies that provides an algorithmic feed by definition  is putting their thumb on the scale of content one way or the other that's true so what do you  do do you ban algorithmic feed some people are talking about that but that would be pretty bad  i think for facebook and twitter's models so you know not to mention tick tock well tick tock's

Transcript:  you know stuff gets through though uh in fact another uh revelation which is very kind of  depressing uh you you might remember that about 2015 there was a malicious xcode discovered that  was offered especially to chinese developers saying it'll be faster to download this xcode  ghost which is xcode but we're getting it from chinese servers it'll be faster for you than  trying to get it from apple's servers apparently a lot of developers used it of course it was  malware and it allowed any program that was written with xcode ghost had a payload that would allow  remote access plus gathering information from the phone turns out more than 4 000 apps  used this xcode ghost they were downloaded 203 million times by 128 million users mostly in  china only about 18 million users in the united states but here's the unfortunate exchange of  emails from apple executives at the time who considered notifying all 128 million  affected users and then decided yeah maybe not  impressive they they they decided you know we're going to pull the apps  that's all we're going to do 128 million by the way many different languages it might have been  a challenge but is it apple's response you think alex that they they absolutely should have done

Transcript:  that yeah i went up to it i mean come on if you have a mistake of this magnitude if so many apps  are written with a malicious um ide i suppose and you end up helping to compromise this many accounts  you should be honest about it speak about it i mean like christina's answer if if microsoft did  this i would say the same things and think about alphabet or whatever well and and in fairness like

Transcript:  facebook has done something really insidious too and they're lobbying around this issue and the  advertising yeah small businesses it's all about small businesses i think facebook and google have  done a fantastic thing for small businesses and that's to make advertising easy to buy but  conflating the ease of use the fact that you can just put a credit card down and very simply buy  ads with targeting i think that is so you know so insidious the the truth is that the targeting that  you know the the micro targeting that facebook allows for most advertisers that's kind of useless  because you just want to you know vaguely target it to a large group of people you don't want to  you know if you're an e-commerce company you don't want to micro target it because you want a lot of  people to buy it you might want to get your ads in front of like relevant people and not waste your  ads but you know the the idea that you need like a lot of detailed information about people  is has been proven wrong in the marketplace everybody on this panel everybody listens our

Start time: 3989.04
End time: 4086.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  shows knows what that means but i would say of the 96 people percent of people saying no don't track  me more than half don't really know what they're saying no to they just don't like the word track  you know and so i agree i don't i'm not on facebook i don't have anything to do facebook  i saw the other day on reddit i don't know if this is real or not that somebody you know facebook  from time to time will say we want to make sure it's really you send us a picture of your driver's  license that kind of thing i've seen that somebody said that the other day that facebook said we want  to make sure this is really you so we're going to now do face recognition on you hold your camera up  turn your face left and right so that we can check to make sure this is really you  and by the way we'll throw out the data afterwards stop logging into facebook.ru everybody that's not  the place you want to go so i think facebook unfortunately is given tracking a bad name  but there is i mean it's completely i don't i don't i think maybe we're over  overreacting to that thanks to facebook interesting because i think you know advertisers want to know  that when they buy an ad that it's going to go to somebody who's interested in their product right  they don't want to sell they don't want to buy an ad for for alex if he's not interested in men's  hair care products so so they they want to make sure that they advertise to people who are  interested in buying i don't think that for an advertiser that's a you know that's not an evil

Transcript:  thing although there have been studies that have shown and i haven't read them um you know super  recently but there have been it's been interesting to look at how well targeted advertising works  versus untargeted and in terms of like how successful those campaigns are and the delta  is smaller than you would think yeah i'm not surprised i'm not at all surprised you know  because a lot of times things are awareness campaigns and a lot of times you know i think  it can to to owen's point get really insidious when you're able to micro target to certain  degrees where i'm not really comfortable having that micro targeting capabilities to be honest  even if advertisers think it would be really helpful to have them do that and i'm in favor  of advertisers existing and us supporting you know like i've worked you know my previous career  was funded by advertisers you know journalism and and so i'm very sympathetic to understanding  why having that data is useful but i think sometimes it's insidious in the way that it's  used or in ways that should not be relevant to them but more interestingly when you look at the  data the delta between the super targeted stuff versus the more broad things the super targeted  stuff often isn't that much more successful and so i sometimes question like what are we giving up  as humans right do we really need it and and and even for advertisers like how much better off are  they versus just making a big you know a mass ad buy to go after a certain demographic if that's  what they can well they're pretty convinced or anybody who might be watching or viewing stuff

Start time: 4165.42
End time: 4205.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah i agree with you and there's been some really excellent research on that but advertisers seem  convinced that they need that information and of course of course they want it you know and i  understand that for us for instance uh and podcasting where we can't really do that  because it's an rss feed advertisers we we are losing advertisers to companies like spotify  that can that totally know exactly what you listen to when you listen to it who you are  and and they're really um offering advertisers something they want so i mean alex you may hate  tracking but your company relies on it right well actually it's interesting um so tech sales

Transcript:  right we do but we have a direct ad sales team and we have our own kind of internal system to  some degree and people come to buy ads on tech which because they care about our audience which  is a form of tracking to be clear but that's what the same thing for twit you know you know

Transcript:  so i i have a i have a theory here uh and you know this is not to uh excuse facebook's  misdeeds but i suspect signal was trying to drill down in a way that facebook's uh you know kind of  protection mechanisms uh decided was someone trying to like ferret out information or like  you know discover all the categories you know basically it probably looked like a like a  competitor trying to drive information from the system directly with facebook messenger that's  exactly what the point of the ads was right yeah but i think you know i i think the you know the  thing is there's probably like one person like that ad right and facebook system is not designed

End time: 4440.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know under brad we looked at the advice that politic political campaigns i think actually the  trump campaign made and they were all sub hundred dollars so that means they're buying a handful of  ads highly targeted and they're making thousands of buys it's automated and and by the way let's  not forget facebook had a person embedded in the trump campaign in 2016 to help them master that  system because this is the whole point of facebook's advertising system so i will agree with you that  anybody who's paying any attention at all understands that there is absolutely ugly  things being done with tracking particularly by facebook but that but that question in ios 14.5  is just you know i mean who's going to say yes i'm surprised even four percent said yes

Transcript:  general go after them boys go after them but the interesting thing about the way google is doing  this i think is smart because they are adding the ability to watch and log in with the youtube tv  account but not to create a youtube tv account so the way that they updated it i think is actually  really clever because you can't sign up for youtube tv within that roku app and within the  regular youtube account you can just sign in if you're an existing subscriber which i i don't know  if that's going to be enough would be enough to convince congress that they're not doing anything  wrong but it is a little bit different to say you know we're not wanting to um quibble over who gets  more money over signups and this and that which i think is what some of this comes down to i think  a lot of it really comes down to how content is displayed on the home screen and probably user data  and some other insidious stuff that both companies are doing which would make its users very unhappy  if they knew all the dirty details but the the the workaround which is that they just basically  stuffed in the youtube tv app into the old youtube app only works if you have already have an account  so it's similar to the you know apple policy of you can't sign up for an account  but you can use it as a viewer and right i don't know i whether whoever's right or wrong it's a  really clever solution i have to give them credit for that and it's pretty much unbeatable because

certifications are critical not only to get that first job it's a proof to future employers that  you have the skills and knowledge for the job but because tech is always evolving certs only  last so long if you're already in it it's important you stay on top of re-certification  you got to be aware of updates so you don't have to take the latest exam if you fail to re-certify  in time certifications are one of the reasons why it pro tv can be vital to your career it pro tv  can get you both certified and re-certified with all the certs comp tia cisco isc squared axelos  microsoft and more they'll tell you how long a cert will last they'll give you the tools to complete  it and they'll remind you it's time to renew it pro tv gives you a well-rounded educational experience  you get everything not just the best videos but virtual labs so you can set up a windows server  and windows clients in a html5 browser practice tests you can take the exam before you take the  exam and the teachers are great not only experts in the field but very fun very entertaining they  like to call them edutainers you'll never be bored and you'll have fun but you'll know your stuff and  that's what really matters one reviewer said it pro tv is hands down the best lms sites i've used  i've ascertained four certs using it pro tv the edutainers are the best in my experience the  wonderful reviews for it pro tv go on and on read them on the website i think you'll be impressed  and i've been there i've been to their seven studios in gainesville it is amazing they are  working monday through friday all day to produce new content for you 5,800 hours of on-demand content  now in their library it's engaging it's up to date they're always keeping it up to date very important  because

web browser on chromecast on yes on roku on apple tv of course they've got ios and  android apps too this month may is cloud month there are some of the edutainers there they're  great people at it pro tv may is cloud month at it pro tv they have training on all three major  cloud providers aws azure and gcp the google cloud platform if you're looking to get certified or  to get that first job or to stay certified in your existing job or to get new skills  so you can get a better job you're going to love it pro tv and check out it pro tv if you've got an  it team that you want to keep up to date they have a great team platform as well go to it pro tv  slash twit the offer code twit 30 30 off all consumer subscriptions as long as you stay active  so that could be years and i think you'll want to stay active because who wants to stop it pro tv  slash twit the offer code is twit 30 for an additional 30 off the lifetime if you're active  subscription it pro tv build or expand your it career enjoy the journey we love it we love them  it pro tv it pro tv slash twit use the offer code twit 30 you know actually we're talking  about tracking so many people contacted us and said i don't want to be tracked i don't want to  have you know and we do we don't track but we have a lot we'd log your ip address when you download  it we have a system i think it works very well to keep you private but also helps advertisers  know how much traction they're getting on their advertising we have a third party there's actually  a couple of them chart beat and pod sites that they take our logs our ip addresses they put a  bug on the i on the website of the advertiser and then they compare they never reveal the ip  addresses to the advertiser but they'll say 40 something like 46 percent of the people who  visited that site saw the your ad on twit and that's the kind of thing i think in a way that's  fairly safe but even then some people don't like it you block origin blocks chartable and pod sites  so we always are having to tell people you know you got a white list twit and chartable and pod  sites and and mega fun which we use for ad insertion so we decided you know what we're going to  there are people who don't want to be tracked we're going to do a tracking free version of twit and  that's when we created the club twit which is ad free versions of all our shows because there's  no ads there's no tracking you can turn your turn your your your filtering back on your ublock origin  back on seven bucks a month gets you ad free versions of all the shows audio and video  but we also have and it's turned out to be the big for me the big attraction of this  we have a special twit plus feed with bonus content but the big thing i love is our discord  which is really fun we set up stages we've been doing some offhand shows that we couldn't do  otherwise like a linux show we did an insight twit podcast lisa and i would make those available on  the twit plus feed the discord is so much so much fun so if you're interested i just wanted to give  a little plug for club twit go to twit.tv slash club twit it supports us makes us less dependent  on advertising which these days is probably a good thing there's no tracking you don't have to worry  about that your privacy is protected and i think there's some good benefits as well and i love  the discord i really do i think it's so much fun actually it's a bit of a problem leo because

Transcript:  what i've discovered on this particular episode of twit this is my first time being on the discord  while we're talking is that it's actually sufficiently funny as to be distracting oh it's

Start time: 5749.96
End time: 5844.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  totally distracting yeah it's a couple times i've been like huh yeah yeah so we also do so  so you know we have an irc that's always going to be free that's continuing to be free we have a  forums and we have a mastodon and so forth but the discord is for the club twit members  and they're trying to distract you now alex and so it's a lot of fun and then we also are we set  up a stage so this is basically their version of clubhouse in fact down to the point where you can  raise your hand and you can instead of leave quietly exit quietly but it's very much clubhouse  and so if anybody i'll open it up now if anybody has a comment or suggestion about tracking or  anything else just raise your hand we'll take some people up on the stage and give you a chance to  join the show and for not forever but briefly and and and talk about whatever we're talking about  google by the way is going to turn on two-factor authentication for everybody automatically  i've mixed feelings about this i tell everybody turn on two-factor you absolutely need it but  uh i think some people are going to be confused thursday the company announced it will prompt  pretty much all users to turn on two-factor if you're already enrolled it'll ask you to confirm  you are who you say you are and soon google plans to automatically have all users turn on two-factor  automatically it's a good thing right it's it's a security issue what's the downside i mean to me

Start time: 5845.16
End time: 5854.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  like two-factor authentication and password managers are like the the the bread and butter  of reasonable security so to me i mean like my first read layer was like great why you're

Transcript:  hesitant yeah yeah well i mean banks do it right most financial institutions will text you it's  not the best way but at least you know it is a second factor of authentication you know when

Start time: 5866.88
End time: 5937.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you sign up for a google account they usually ask for a secondary email and a phone number  and if those things have changed and you are automatically opting people into two-factor  authentication you could potentially put people in a situation where their second factor is a  device they no longer have access to and so that would be the only thing that would concern me is  that if you're opting people into it you need to make sure that whatever information they've  already given you that could be for that second factor is still something they have access to  because like i got my gmail account in like 2004 or whatever year it started right and my phone  number ironically is still the same but most people would not still have the same cell phone  number that they had in 2004 and so if if you had a situation like that my fear is that when you  opt people into these things i think it's a good thing is i would be more in favor if every new  account auto opted in i think with the existing accounts you need to be really careful that people  still have access to those things otherwise you know you get people lose access to their accounts  and as we all have read many horror stories if you can't get access to a google account you're  basically sol because you can't reach somebody at google you know customer service to to give you

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  access this is very my only concern they seem to enforce i mean it's because of them that we  don't have extended certificates that last more than a year it's because of them that https is  ubiquitous because they said well you're not going to be ranked as well if you don't do it  they have been very quick to kind of strong arm people into doing what we might agree is the right  thing but it it grates a little bit that they're just kind of doing it you know apple's done this

Transcript:  though quite a lot you know they talk about removing things they drop the headphone jack  they they're going wireless they're willing to just make product movements i think that we then  later on kind of cheer on and so i'm just going to go ahead and say if google hasn't thought through  the obvious issues that we've just raised with this two two factor authentication push shame on  them but as a general push i'm in favor of it i just it's definitely the right thing to do i just

Transcript:  biggest ding on two dings on twitter one is that they didn't think about this which suggests to me  that they didn't even test it internally adequately yeah to to notice that um and it's it's kind of  more of a paypal issue paypal was designed around like hey i pay you money right you send me  something person to person and to send you to send you the goods you bought i need your address  right so um you know twitter twitter probably should have worked with paypal to make sure that  everything was set to person to person uh payments which don't reveal the address  um but you know like it's just inadequate testing also i think twitter was trying to avoid um  you know twitter was trying to avoid like direct responsibility or involvement in the transaction  so they just used a bunch of third-party services and when you you know outsource everything like  that you can't control like little little nuances of the user interface or like data leakage right

Transcript:  scroll leo i think you're dead on but yeah i know is a little bit more interesting than that because  when we think about substack i mean owens comments aside about kind of what types of  writers attracting i mean it's kind of mono feature but what twitter is building with spaces  which is their kind of like clubhousey type thing with review a way to write longer from content on  the site and scroll a way to pay for content they're building a set of tools for writers  where writers already live and have their key social that's a good point they're already using

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  seen you know a lot of discussion about this maybe it's happened but but i haven't seen a lot of  discussion maybe they will do what they've done many times in the past both with twitter and  facebook have done this in the past but you know substack um has a direct twitter integration  where you can when you sign up for a substack account you subscribe to someone's account  you know and it's not even so much you creating the sub stack but like you're going to read content  you can find people that you follow on twitter who also have sub stacks and automatically  subscribe to their sub stacks i have a sub stack that i haven't used my my domain is christina.substack.com  i also have one i've never used yep but but because of that feature i get you know dozens of  i get dozens of subscribers a week from the twitter integration the interesting thing there  is that if i were to use if i and i've been toying around with wanting to do a newsletter for a long  time the appeal of sub stack would be the the network right and the platform effect  but obviously twitter is where i have a lot of followers and where it would be useful to maybe  think about using someone to review it would be interesting to think about if twitter really does  take this seriously like do they cut off sub stacks access you know the way that they did with  meerkat back in the day you know when they had the periscope like do they cut off that access for  people to be able to discover you know people they want to follow they could so anti-competitive  but it's well but they've done it legal right yeah no they did they did well first instagram did it  with twitter because you used to be able to find and auto follow people on instagram who if you had  a twitter connection and then facebook cut that off and then twitter did it with them with meerkat  when when meerkat and periscope launched because you could again discover people to follow on  meerkats through twitter connections and twitter cut that off so there's there's precedent there  for them to do it i hope they wouldn't but they certainly could and to alex's point since this is  where writers live if you're talking about having the mechanism to tip having the mechanism to  charge using scroll having the ability to do newsletters you know you you conceivably having  spaces where you could maybe even possibly have that in some particular way you know siloed if  they wanted to to say only people you know of a certain thing can be in this group they don't  have that featured yet but there's something to say that they couldn't productize that like that  could be a really compelling offering that is that is different um and it's kind of a combination  like not different but it's a combination of what a lot of other things do and that could go a long

Transcript:  way yeah we're talking about platform risk i mean this entire show has been about platform risk i  mean like the roku youtube thing is about platforms uh the apple epic thing is about platforms this  twitter discussion is about platforms and kind of who owns and controls them and uh you know going  back to owen's earlier point about trying to thread the needle between uh realizing that the world has  changed in our old views and free speech probably don't perfectly fit the modern reality and also  not compelling corporate speech through various things i mean gosh darn i mean we could really  use a smart person out there helping put this all together but i feel like we don't have a good  discourse around this because people are still kind of not waking up i hate that for various but  coming to grips with uh with the power of platforms in the modern internet era and uh and what they  mean i don't have the solutions to these problems but um if twitter does deprecate other companies  neat products integrations in favor of their own i'll be peeved you know yeah but i can't go  anywhere i'm not going to lose my twitter followers well that's exactly the point right they they can

Transcript:  get away with it there's a whole history here and uh sorry the alex and i have this joke this this is  hitting the owen history button but um facebook actually pulled this on twitter very early on  twitter tried to develop a a system where you could find your facebook friends who had twitter  accounts um and facebook shut that down so fast forward a few years instagram uh had a tight  integration that's right with twitter twitter that's what i said yeah right which is why and  they shut that off yeah um yep and then you know and then there was vine you know which  also got kneecapped um yeah kneecap by facebook as soon as as soon as twitter bought it um is that

Transcript:  no that was right i mean um you you also had a yeah um and and yeah so you had that instance  i'm trying to think there's another one oh this was a one um remember ping apple's uh ping music  service yeah so it launched for like two days and it had facebook integration and you could follow  people that were your facebook friends you could connect it with ping and follow people and then  steve jobs and mark zuckerberg had a fight and all of a sudden ping lost facebook support

Start time: 6807.56
End time: 6869.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  reasons one of the many reasons why ping died honestly was that how are you going to discover  and find anybody when you have no social graph interactions so those things to alex's point are  really powerful and to owen's point yeah we've mentioned this this has happened many times in  the past but it is one of those those interesting things like i think you have to be careful if  you're a company and you become too reliant on someone else now to be clear i don't think  substack is like i don't think sub sack is is going to be hurting if people don't have the ability to  follow um like sub stack themselves i don't think would be hurting if they lost the twitter  integration that said i do think sub sack writers would be hurt if people wouldn't be able to do  that and and to be even more clear i don't think sub sack cares about that like i don't think that  sub sack's concern but sub sack writers who have a big twitter platform that could be the sort of  thing that for me i'd be like well if that feature goes away and my biggest audience is on twitter  i might as well use the twitter newsletter service yeah i mean sub sack has said that

Start time: 6869.52
End time: 6880.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  one of the factors they use to decide whether to pay a writer in advance to start writing on  on sub sack is the size of their social media following oh of course it is of course it is but

Start time: 6881.20
End time: 6904.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but i just mean in terms of like having that integration there like i don't think sub sack  would worry if people couldn't follow directly from or subscribe directly from the service when  they sign up for a reader account right so because if you've got a big enough of a brand like like  if leo wanted to start a newsletter whether or not there was any integration there he's got his mass  following um regardless of how easy it is to sign up in their app well now you got me intrigued so
