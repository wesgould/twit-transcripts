Just was Jeff was saying, you know, a lot of people guessing, especially today, you know, after the talk of, you know, your chapter, I think everybody, everybody kind of guessed that you were likely in there. Right. I think and certainly requested.  But the last one, I doubt anyone will guess the last. The last one is one of someone that everybody will, I think, be blown away by and no one will guess. So that's that's pretty big.  Does everyone know who this person is? No one knows who it is. No, no, no, I don't mean that. I mean, when they see the name, they'll say, oh, I know who that is. No, most people won't. But after they read it, you're kind of well, obscure in the circles that most of the people here are in. But once they read, but very widely known in some other circles, but dovetails perfectly with kind of where we're going in terms of the future, because it's a lot about

Transcript:  You know, I agree. The thing that was amazing to me was when he did that battery unveiling.  And like, how interesting can you make a battery?  Right.  I mean, let's be honest.  But he kept he kept it to 20, like 20 to 25 minutes, if I remember correctly.  And at the end, I was like, oh, my God, like, this was amazing.  Like, how did he make how did he make a battery interesting?  And I thought this is this is pretty significant, actually, because in the past,  I've seen a lot of the times he's spoken in hasn't always been, you know, riveting.  But that battery, he made it about the fact that, you know, look, we've got to save the world.  It was about saving the world. Exactly.  And somehow he convinced, I think pretty convincingly made us believe that  buying this battery would help save the world, at least in some small way.

End time: 535.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's kind of convinced me, I have to say.  I've resisted buying the Tesla.  But after the event, I finally put in a reservation.  Just a reservation for the new model, for the Model X, because it has doors that go like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, one of the reasons actually Jason  Calacanis, who was on the new screensavers yesterday, is as was an early Tesla  adopter has all of them, in fact, I think was the first guy on the reservation list  for the Model S. He he told me there's a supercharger in Petaluma.  So these are the free refill, free refill, electrical refill stations  that charge really fast, like a hundred miles range in half an hour.

Start time: 568.68
End time: 599.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I was thinking about it.  So he promised that in 2017, I think it is he'll get up to 600 miles.  Six twenty. Yeah.  So to me, this is that's it.  That's it. As long as as far as you can drive in a day without complete butt rot.  Yeah, that's it.  That's the metric.  The butt rock metric. Yeah.  Five hundred, six hundred miles that all the objections I have to it are gone.  Jason, let me just ask you this.  Your your Mondo killer, wonderful, amazing, super duper Audi  isn't diesel, is it? No.

Start time: 601.04
End time: 688.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, I would feel so guilty and I feel so bad for the people who bought diesel  Volkswagen's and Audi A4's after in the in the aftermath of the revelation  that these cars had software that would trick the testers  to appear to be ecologically suitable.  But then as soon as they got off the dynamometer, 40 times the nitrogen.  Oh, it's making me cough just to think about it.  I mean, the massive polluters.  And I would feel so I feel so bad for people who drove that car  thinking they were driving an eco friendly car.  In fact, one of the worst cars on the road that's terrifying, terrible.  So but this, you know, an electrical, you know, as we know, electric  vehicles aren't necessarily non polluting.  The electricity has to be generated somewhere.  I thought this was interesting, the car filter.  That has a bio weapon mode.  This is where it goes.  So this is the largest car filter, air filter in any car.  And remember, you don't need an air filter because there's no gas engine.  So the air filter is just for the passengers.  And he showed it off, as you can see, he's showing it off here.  And in fact, showed the buttons and he's and can you can you  can you hear the audio on this? I don't know if you.  What I like about Elon is he's he's off script.  There's no script. He's just doing it.  He's talking from his heart.  And his brain, which is his brain.

Start time: 690.78
End time: 699.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the the quality of the filter is greater.  So that translates to a several hundred fold  improvements in the filtration capability.

Start time: 700.42
End time: 706.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, my Audi lease runs out in October and of next year.  So this is that's about when this would be available.  It just seemed like the right thing to do.  I don't know.  I like I love the idea that I could charge it for free.  Well, you know, look at that.  The doors and this I'll never have one of them fancy cars with the doors.  But this will the doors like that.  That's awesome.  Somebody pointed out, actually, that interestingly enough,  they focused on some interesting things, for instance, these doors  that you could just get in.  He said that eventually they will have it that you can drive into the charger  and the charger will come out and automatically attach.  You don't have to get out of the car.

Start time: 816.24
End time: 818.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Especially if you're in bio defense mode, you don't want to get out.

Start time: 818.44
End time: 833.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And when the new seats, the new seats, he really emphasized  how much room there was under the seats to stow stuff,  even though the thing is an SUV has plenty of room in the back.  Somebody said this is all evidence that he intends for this to be  the first autonomous taxi cab was an interesting piece.

Start time: 833.40
End time: 841.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, because because because you can you can approach the car.  It'll open for you.  You can put things in.  You still it's not really your car.  You stow things. Yeah.

Start time: 841.38
End time: 846.96

Transcript:  Is it like geo fencing?  It's it's doing some kind of geo fencing off of like your father,  your own or something, presumably more securely than the current

Start time: 857.42
End time: 906.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one touch fobs work.  But I think and Elon himself said this is as close to autonomous  as you could get today.  Does so many things automatically.  And it's just there it goes driving off all by itself.  It's it's just this close.  And I feel like this could it be we're getting closer  and closer to autonomous vehicles.  Matt Honan on BuzzFeed wrote a very interesting article in which he said  there are inevitability.  And how many thousands of tens of thousands of people die in the US  every year from auto accidents?  That would be eliminated if we had autonomous vehicles are presumably  be eliminated. So I figure I'll get this car  and eventually I won't have to drive anymore.  It'll just drive me.  Actually, what the article presupposed was that people would still own the car.  But then when they're not using it, they would let others rent.

Start time: 906.28
End time: 917.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. Well, or but it's obvious you could also start a company that does this.  So I mean, this is the this is the ultimate attack on labor, of course.  So it's Uber without drivers. Yeah.

Start time: 917.84
End time: 940.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which Uber would love, I'm sure. Oh, yeah.  It's interesting. Uber buys a lot of ads.  Almost all of them are not ads for riders.  Their rights for drivers. Really?  I was talking to a radio executive in Los Angeles this week.  And he said, you know, we sell a ton of ads to Uber.  They're just for drivers. They're all for drivers.  They need more.  They need drivers much more than any riders, apparently.

Start time: 940.84
End time: 943.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like listening to serious. It's nothing but truck driver ads.

Start time: 943.78
End time: 958.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  So it's a good business to get into.  I think there's so much to talk about.  I guess we could.  Andrew, did you go to the Google event or did you or did the Ron Amadio go?

Start time: 958.32
End time: 980.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who went to Ron? Ron Amadio was there.  I was helping like remotely with his coverage of it.  But he he was the one who was actually on the ground.  Now, I watched the live stream and everything.  And we're just talking about what?  Yeah, we were just talking about what a good presenter Elon Musk is.  And I've got to say, I kind of wish somebody at Google  was as good on stage as he is yet.

Start time: 980.30
End time: 1015.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to say, Sundar Pichai, the CEO of Google.  And now, by the way, as of Friday, this is all official.  Alphabet's real. He's the official CEO of Google.  He got on stage and was there for a minute.  And then every this presentation after presentation.  What the impression I got is Google is a large, diverse company full of smart people.  I'm sure that was the intent.  Unlike an Apple event where Tim Cook really runs the game or Steve Jobs ran the show.  Sundar got out of the way and they just handed it off.  And I thought that was you're right.  I mean, it wasn't these aren't showbiz folks.  I think they were competent.

Start time: 1017.44
End time: 1034.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Were you bored? It was just all a little stilted.  And they're making these jokes that were supposed to sound like they were off the cuff.  But they've obviously been made like five or six times before.  Nothing against any of the products that were that were introduced.  It's just there weren't any there weren't any showpeople among the presenters on stage.  I don't think no.

Start time: 1035.68
End time: 1076.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They announced two new phones, the five X, the X is for Nexus, the five P.  The P is for premium premium.  I believe that's right. That's what they said.  Five point two inches for the Nexus five X five point seven inches for the Nexus five P.  It looked beautiful.  Solid body aluminum phone.  Both have very good quality cameras with the largest, to my knowledge,  the largest pixel size on any sensor, a camera phone sensor.  One point five five microns is is sounds small.  And I guess technically it is small, but it's it's big for a camera phone.  I think these are going to be pretty killer devices.

Start time: 1076.52
End time: 1078.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can't wait. I can't wait for my new run.

Start time: 1079.16
End time: 1083.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's not and the price is unlike the Nexus six.  The price is very aggressive. Yes.

Start time: 1084.42
End time: 1101.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, not quite down to where the Nexus four and the original  Nexus five were a couple of years ago, which is too bad.  But yeah, much better than it was last year, especially for the five X,  which is the one that I think I'm the most interested in.  I think the five the Nexus five is the best Nexus phone that they've ever done.  So yeah, a lot of people would agree with you on that.

Start time: 1102.18
End time: 1117.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the five X is doesn't seem much compromised.  I mean, it's it's it's, you know, pretty high spec device,  just a smaller screen, a plastic body, not a aluminum body.  It's an eight oh eight instead of an eight ten Snapdragon,

Start time: 1117.94
End time: 1121.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a little bit smaller, which might be might be a good thing, depending on.  It might be depending on your perspective.

Start time: 1121.84
End time: 1182.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It might be battery life might be bad.  I've never seen anybody say, hey, my phone is so slow.  That is not that is not really the issue.  Battery life is the issue.  So maybe a little slower processor, a little lower res screen.  You might get better battery life on this thing.  I'm glad they're doing the type C connector. I'm a believer.  And they're giving away a 50, which is very aggressive,  a $50 credit to the Play Store when you buy it, which Lord knows I'll use.  Well, I would guess trying to woo away Apple.  iPhone users, right?  Say, well, you'll be able to get enough money because that's  that's one of the sticking points is you've invested in apps.  You don't want to have to buy all new apps.  Well, here's 50 bucks. So you don't have to.  And three months in Google Play Music, which, of course, Apple's doing  with Apple Music.  They've also announced an Apple like  Nexus Protect program that gives you an extra year of warranty,  even from accidental damage.  Although there's a 75 deductible and you can use it twice in the in the two years

Start time: 1182.88
End time: 1210.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  span. Yeah, the way the way they market these in advertising is always kind of  interesting because they're straddling this line where they're they started  life kind of as developer phones.  And that's still but those are still that's still one of the audiences  they appeal the most to because they get the fast updates and there's no  bloatware or anything.  But then you have things like Nexus Protect and the Google Play credit  and the Google Play Music stuff that are obviously like more for consumers.  Yeah. So I'm never, never quite sure who the intended audience for these things.

Start time: 1210.78
End time: 1219.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I also think that they have to answer the genius bar is that you could have  someplace you can take your phone and wine and they'll do something.  And Google has to be able to match that.

Start time: 1220.32
End time: 1227.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Especially, I think, with the Huawei phone, because I don't think they have  an entrenched like US support system.

Start time: 1227.88
End time: 1278.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Really good point.  Yeah. But the sixty four gig five or six P, I should say, at five hundred  fifty bucks is a couple hundred bucks less than a completely equipped iPhone.  I mean, it's an aggressive price.  It spec wise seems similar.  I mean, you know, it's got a fingerprint reader.  It's on the back instead of on the front.  Better screen. Yeah, better.  Well, we'll see. Of course, all this, you know, is on paper.  You got to see it first.  But an AMOLED display, five point seven inches.  A smaller phone because they don't have the large bezels of the iPhone.  I think that's impressive, but I don't think it's the most  exciting announcement they made.  And I think the jury's out on whether it's the Chromecast audio,  which I'm really excited about for reasons probably only I understand  or the Pixel C tablet.

Start time: 1278.74
End time: 1298.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's that we talked about that on this week in Google.  And the more I've thought about it since our conversation,  the more excited I am about that.  So I haul around my Chromebook Pixel with me.  I have an old one. I can leave one in my office, keep one here.  And then if I travel with that, I no longer have to carry the Nexus seven.  And I just carry that as a as an on the road laptop.  That's pretty exciting.

Start time: 1299.28
End time: 1302.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1303.06
End time: 1315.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I signed up for an alert email alert.  They have. Yeah.  If you and if you go to I think it's a Pixel.  There's a Google dot com slash URL.  Yeah, which is just the same.  Yeah, doesn't even mention the the Chromebook.

Transcript:  Jason Howell is host all about Android.  He has a little bit to say about this.

Start time: 1335.52
End time: 1393.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, just the thing that that worries me about the sea  is that Android as a platform isn't an amazing platform for multitasking slash  just getting a lot of things done in the same way that Chrome OS  actually does succeed in or Windows, you know, environment succeeds in.  And that's probably why the Surface tablet is so popular because  they've they've built it with that in mind.  I don't get that feeling with Android.  And I worry about this like I'm I'm interested in it as a product  because I'm always interested when Google does something different like this  based on what they've done in the past.  And I want to play around with it.  I've tried to use Android devices that have a keyboard  attachment and live my life in that to see how it goes.  I find it to be way more inconvenient than an OS that is built  for that environment in mind.  So I fear I don't know that this is going to solve many problems in that regard.  I just think it's going to be another option.

Start time: 1395.56
End time: 1427.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, because in one of the really early Android and betas,  there was like an experimental, like highly, highly experimental  multi window, right?  They got they got removed in later betas, I think.  So I'm wondering if we're going to see like an Android six point one  or like seven point oh down the line or something that will reintroduce  that feature kind of like Samsung has got it kind of like iOS just  introduced in iOS nine.  If we're going to see with this particular device, if we're going to see some of those  new built in features that are meant to kind of alleviate that  and make multitasking a little bit easier.

Start time: 1428.62
End time: 1458.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're right. Remember when Android came out, it was not for tablets  and was clued on a tablets and Google didn't endorse that and didn't work very well.  So maybe this my fear is I mean, I agree with you, Jason.  There are some who think this is the death of Chrome OS, but at the same time,  Chrome OS brags that will have more devices in schools than all other  devices combined.  And I think for for corporate use, I think Chrome OS is going to stick around.  You think so? I hope so.  Oh, I don't think it's going anywhere.

Start time: 1458.60
End time: 1478.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't think it's going anywhere.  And if it did, that would be a big, big oversight because I primarily for that.  Right. Like Chrome OS is amazing in the in the educational space. Right.  It's super, super convenient.  You know, way easier for students to just remember their login credentials  on whatever machine they happen to be on and have it all thrown onto the  onto the system and everything.

Start time: 1478.74
End time: 1488.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it'll push into enterprise, too.  I think salespeople and stuff.  I think I think there's a few improvements to make to Chrome  that will make it work as an office machine.  So who's buying tablets then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, what we're seeing is at least in business, you know,  because on Tech Republic, that's what we do a lot of. Right.  And we talk to a lot of companies and talk about what they're using and CIOs  and that kind of thing.  And, you know, a lot of what they're using tablets for for,  you know, when they go to iPads are typically like one apps, you know,  there's one app that they're trying to access or maybe two or three,  but they only ever do one at a time.  Similar to like what Jason is saying with with Android, because, you know,  their purpose, Bill, it's a purpose built operating system  for doing one thing at a time.  And that's its strength and its weakness.  But where we're seeing  where we're seeing the, you know, windows  and some traction, we're seeing windows have traction, especially surface  is when they when people want to do multiple things  and they need to run multiple apps and they need to, you know,  work back and forth between things and they have things that, you know,  they have to integrate those in those cases.  That's where surface is making a lot of traction.  And there's no doubt that that's why Apple, you know, knowing this as well,  put out the iPad Pro and is focusing so much on this sort of side by side  window thing and all of that.  And so it'll be interesting to see where the pixel kind of fits in with that.  Jason's frozen.

Transcript:  Where you know, where I think it'll be is to see what the pixel see is.  Where does it play?  Does it, you know, does it try to take Android and turn it  into a multitasking operating system?  Because as Jason Howell was saying, you know, surprisingly,  what people may not realize is you can you can multitask pretty well on  on a Chromebook, you know, now the Chromebook pixel,  you know, like these guys are talking about.  You can you can multitask on an iPad, you can multitask.

Start time: 1606.06

Transcript:  I don't really is Android do such a bad job of multitasking.  I mean, you just think it's more about full screen, full screen, full screen,  I guess. Right. Yeah.  It's more about having more than one thing on screen at once, because I will say,

Start time: 1617.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you know, since I've been on the iPad, I've been on the iPad,  because I will say, you know, since iOS nine  and since all my apps, so like Word and Slack and Tweetbot  are all updated to support all the split view screen stuff now,  I am using it a lot more to do work.  If maybe at this point, it's only just to see if I can use it for work.  But but it's a lot more possible than it was like six months ago even.

Transcript:  I'll tell you one issue, which is the tabs in the Chrome browser  on Android are a pain in the butt.  They don't display. Yeah. Right.  And you have to go to them and try and they'll add up to be a hundred of them.  And it's it's it's a pain.  It's easy. Yeah. These things are easily fixed.

Transcript:  I've been saying a lot, though, on the radio show that we have to get out  of the mindset of, oh, you need a computer.  You need a general purpose machine like a Windows or a Mac machine.  Because to give it to make it a general purpose machine,  you have to make it so much more complex, which makes it more security,  more of a security risk.  It makes it more difficult to use.  It makes things break more easily.  And more and more, I think people the way people really use  technology, a computer's general purpose computer is the wrong thing.  I'm not sure a tablet's the right thing.  I think you're right.

That's the way it used to be.  And we just we just haven't gotten out of the habit yet.  Although I have to say, I really wonder what the future of the tablet is.  I just don't feel like the tablet's for much except watching movies.

Transcript:  Which one I want airplanes, it is good for playing games or.  On the way back from Medellin, my tablet, my I think I've been  I walked around all the city with my Nexus seven in my bag  and I think I got smashed or something and didn't work.  So I'm going to panic.  I've got eight hours of travel.  All I do is I'm in I'm in horrible hotel Wi-Fi.  I'm downloading movies and shows onto my phone and try to get on to my laptop.  Oh, figuring out my battery power.  I got there. I got enough on.  And and it so happened I had I feared the Nexus seven was going to be discontinued.  So I bought one in 2014.  Oh, you had an extra.  I had an extra sitting there.  Unused. That's just that's how neurotic I am.  And a boy did it take about 20  reloads. Yeah.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  But anyway, on the trip back.  Yeah, I mean, I was at a bank, but that's what I really use it for.  A lot is watching movies and it's by seven inches.  Perfect. The right size. I love it.  But is it worth carrying around?  That's why I'm thinking the Pixel C.  If I use that as my briefcase machine when I'm out at meetings  or that kind of stuff or I'm on a plane.  OK, the question is, if I'm going to be gone for a week,  I probably can't take that. I've got to take a bigger machine.  But if I'm gone for a day.

Start time: 1831.46
End time: 1853.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I also I also think that convertibles like the Pixel C or the Surface  are more of a, I don't know, hybrid  that from a company that's just not reluctant to throw all of its eggs  in any one basket.  And they are not quite. I don't know.  I don't I just can't bring myself to use a device where the keyboard falls off.  I just feel like it should be.  It should be attached.

Transcript:  I mean, I think my laptop's getting smaller.  My phone's getting bigger, right?  Like, I'd rather watch on this.  Yeah. Or that.  Nexus 6. Yeah. Right.  iPhone 6s.  It's the Moto X Pure.  So, you know, with those things, I agree, like a lot of it is for watching  movies and, you know, entertainment or, you know, one app kind of things.  I mean, I think to get to your point, though,  layer or Leo is that the the funny the thing is people use the the,  you know, most people use a small number of apps, three to five.  I think is the average. Right.  And so if you only use three to five apps, then then tablets do have  tablets are kind of almost there for you to be able to do a lot of what you're  doing or a Chromebook. Same thing.  You know, you can do a lot of what you do if you're only doing sort of,  you know, you spend most of your time on three to five different things.  But but more and more as you sort of the phones get bigger, have gotten bigger.  All of a sudden, we realize, you know, it's good enough to sort of do  most of the stuff on that.  And it's always with you and you're, you know, you're logged in and you,  you know, you have it, you know, relatively convenient.  Battery life being one of the challenges, of course.  And that's why another reason why phablets have suddenly got a lot of momentum  is because they have a lot bigger battery in one of those suckers.  So I do think that tablets are getting squeezed where where where they are,  where we are seeing a lot of use is again, they're becoming more appliances.  Tablets are that sort of one app to app appliance where you go into a business  and you hand it to someone at a doctor's office to fill out their their sign in  information where somebody can go into, you know, a restaurant and they can fill  out and they can join your mailing list where they can sign in and get there,  do their reward stuff, you know, with just that one app that runs all the time.  You can do all that on a phone.

Unified School District very famously  raised a bond to buy more than 40,000 iPads  at a cost of seven hundred sixty eight dollars each.  And the program, as you know, huge flop.  They were suing Pearson, the education software company  that was creating the curriculum.  School systems said teachers never use it. We don't use it.  They were suing Apple saying we should have never bought it.  They were suing Lenovo.  Also, who had charged the company, the district for Pearson curriculum.  They've settled. And this is a very weak settlement.  If you felt like you wasted your money on the billions of dollars,  billion plus dollars on the iPads, they're going to get six point four  million dollars in a settlement from Pearson.  Apple has agreed to pay four point two million dollars in a settlement.

And this is a specialized field, the crypto, the security.  We know.  I mean, you don't want to be the next company on the headlines.  Company X breached.  You want to do it with somebody that knows what they're doing.  And that's Braintree. Braintree.  It's on Uber. That's how Uber pays its payments.  GitHub uses Braintree, Airbnb, StubHub.  It's everybody uses Braintree because it works.  It's simple. It's secure. Payouts are fast.  They've got the best support.  They'll even do the integration for you.  It's simple, though. Ten lines of code.  And suddenly you could take credit cards.  You could take Venmo, PayPal.  You could take Apple Pay. You could take Android Pay.  You could take even even take Bitcoin.  And it's all handled for you.  It's just so slick.  You'll see fewer abandoned carts, more sales with Braintree's best in class  mobile checkout experience.  The one touch SDK means that it's you used it.  You use it with Uber when you took an Uber and you got out of the car  and you didn't pay anything. Boom. That's that's one touch.  If you use Pinterest, they're used.  They're doing it on Pinterest now with the buyable pins.  Have you seen the buyable pins on Pinterest? That's Braintree.  Braintree is kind of slick. It's sweet.

I guess it would be remiss of me not to mention and pass along condolences  to the people, the students and teachers who were killed in Oregon  over the week.  The tech angle on this is a little touchy, and I'm going to bring this up  and I'm going to let you guys talk me off the ledge.  Reason being, I just read a couple of weeks before this,  a study, let me see if I can find this, from the American Psychological  Association of the Impact of Violent Media  over the Doc. It's at the very bottom there.  Yeah. The impact of violent media.  There we go. Time has the article, but it comes from the American  Psychological Association.  It was a review of research going way back.  They published this in August 2013.  It was a task force.  They reviewed a hundred studies on violent video games  published between 2005 and 2015.  They concluded playing violent video games can increase aggressive  behavior and thoughts.  We've always said there's no study that proves this, and yet  over a hundred studies show that lessening empathy and sensitivity  towards aggression.  Nobody's saying it turns you into a violent criminal.  If it did, I would be a violent criminal and you would be a violent  criminal and you and you and you would be.  Not me. I don't play them.

And I wonder if this is something we as a technology community should  consider.  Or is it censorship?  I'll let you start, Jeff, because I'm sure you're a First Amendment guy.

The problem is giving these crackpots 14 guns, legal access to 14 guns.  If he didn't have legal access to 14 guns, could he have taken a knife  to somebody, could have taken his car to somebody?  Yeah.  But 14 guns this bozo had.  14 legally acquired guns.  That's far more of the problem.  There are sickos, nut jobs, hate-filled idiots in the world.  And the more we give them weapons, the worse that is.  Video games don't make them into sicko.  I feel like they may be training vehicles.

Transcript:  But before that it was television.  Before that it was movies.  If you watch...  Oh, give me a violent movie.  What's his name?  Who's the crazy guy who did...  Tarantino.  Thank you, Tarantino.  So should we ban Tarantino?  Should we outlaw Tarantino?  He has the right to make those.  Of course he does.  And does that turn people...  Even if it inspires one person, supposedly inspires, even if there are similarities,  even if the sicko admired that movie, it is absolutely a case of correlation, not causation.  There's absolutely no real scientific proof that says this is going to make someone do what they do.  These people are sick beyond sick, violent beyond violent, murderers as murderers,  and no TV show, no book, no movie, no video game.  None of that is going to make them do what they do.  And I refuse to get caught in the trap where we start saying this goes back to Kipper Gore and music.  Music was going to make you do horrible things.  Music was going to make you kill the cops.  Every single media that comes out, somebody wants to control it.  And that is, thank God, why we have a First Amendment.  And at the end of the day, if you think that people are such incredible sheeple  that they can be changed by these things, then you're right, Leo.  You already would have killed 100 people.  Yeah, I don't think it makes you a killer.

It happened with music, and now it's happening with video games.  And I don't think it's ever been shown that media have this real impact.  And you can say that it makes us empathetic.  But again, is that correlation to causation?  Who is drawn to video games by people who have no life?  Sorry, just a joke, guys, just a joke.  I like video games.  Right?  So who's to say?

And on Wednesday, we're going to this big Hollywood fundraiser from this guy that makes  all these violent movies.  And the one person on the staff was saying, this is ridiculous.  How can we be talking about violence?  And then the next day, we're taking money from this person, this glorifying violence.  And they didn't really come to a conclusion.  But it's the same.  They were having exactly the same arguments.  The point is, it wasn't just video games.  It was also media.

Transcript:  But let me do a Devil's Advocate anyway.  OK.  I would argue that if we become too controlling and too protecting,  we take people away from the judgments they have to make,  understanding fact from fiction, understanding fantasy from not.  There's a woman named Lenore Skanezy in New York,  I used to work with her at the Daily News,  who wrote a book called Free Range Children, Free Range Kids.  She got into all kinds of crap because she let her eight-year-old ride the New York subway.  Same kid, go out and learn the world.  It's OK.  People just went crazy.  And the overprotection that I think we do of our children and of society,  the nurturing and nannying, I would argue in the long run is more harmful because  you will encounter bad people.  You will encounter violent urges.  You will encounter anger.  You will encounter these things.  And you need to be equipped to know how to control those things  and to know what is just play or what is just release and what is reality.  Now, the sick F's who've done what they've done,  obviously do not have that ability, but they didn't have that ability anyway.  This certainly wasn't going to push them.  And a normal person learns those things.  And it's not a bad influence, I think, to have these ranges of life and good and bad in front  of you.  If you try to control everything too much, you probably hurt the mature decision-making  of society in the long run.

There's no place on earth where you have so many different people,  so many different kinds of people put together, living next to each other,  having to coexist and that have, you know, lots of differences that really are only bound together,  not by ethnicity, not by geography, but by this idea, right, of the country where that's based on  sort of a certain amount of freedoms.  And you have all these different kinds of people.  You have all these different kinds of backgrounds and they're living next to one another and they  have all these freedoms.  And so in some sense, we should we should not be surprised that it's the most violent  society on earth, which essentially it is, you know, going if you look at gun deaths,  whereas these other places like Sweden, you know, like other places, they are very homogenous  societies.  Right.  Most nations in the world are very homogenous societies or they have two or three different  types of groups.  And often those two or three different types of groups, you know, are creating are committing,  you know, often sadly crimes against one another and having to deal with, you know,  centuries old debates.  You know, here this is still America is even though it's 300 years old, you know, that's  just a blip on the radar.  Right.  This is still an experiment in trying to understand how can you bring so many different types of  people together and figure out how to live together and build a good society and deal  with all these kinds of things, have freedoms, but also have security, also have safety,  you know, and these are part of the growing pains of building this kind of society.  We still haven't figured it out.  Right.  There's still a lot of things we have to figure out.  And this is one of the biggest ones.  And there aren't any there aren't any easy answers.

But I think we've become, you know, nanny state.  I come to agree with now and I think, well, in our space is right.  I think our children became too protected, so they didn't have as much ability to judge.  You know, we scheduled every minute we, we, we put a cocoon around them.

For much the same reason, by the way,  the music was detrimental to both the health and morals of our youth and community.  The band was issued following a raid on a dance hall at the local civic center  where officers claimed teenagers were engaged in, quote, obscene,  abandoned and highly suggestive dancing to the provocative rhythms of an all Negro band.  This thing can only lead to juvenile delinquency and degeneracy.  It will not be tolerated in the city of Santa Cruz.  Now I went to Santa Cruz high 15 years later and things had changed quite a bit.  But in 1956, we have a problem with rock and roll in children.  Could you imagine if you could have airdropped them?

You can decide what is good and bad as a produce,  as a publisher, you don't necessarily publish, you don't publish everything that comes to you.  Um, and everyone along the chain can make their own responsible decisions. And that discussion is  important and I agree with that. Yeah.

Let's get serious. Let's get serious. Something more important, but first  let me tell you how to use your time more effectively with stamps.com. Stamps.com just  crossed a big milestone. $1.5 billion in postage printed by stamps.com customers. And I think a  lot of times we do this ad and that people think, oh, I'm not a big enough business. It's not for me.  You know, even a small business is going to benefit from stamps.com. You, you don't want to  go to the post office. If you're, if you're a sole proprietor, you can't take time to wait in line at  the post office and here come the holidays and it's going to be more time, more time spent looking  for parking. What, when you can do it all at your desk with stamps.com and you don't need a postage  meter. And sometimes people think, oh, you mean like Pitney? No, this is not a postage meter.  This is so much less. Did you know that I just found that postage meter, ink costs 1000 times  more than ink jet ink, which costs more than anything I know. You don't need a postage meter.  Your computer and printer are all you need and stamps.com. You'll save at least 50% compared to  a postage meter. You won't have to waste time going to the post office. You'll even get discounts you  cannot get at the post office. And you can get discounted package insurance in just one click.  No more handwritten forms. You print it out, certified mail, return receipt, international  customs forms, all automatically filled out by the software. This makes your business,  big or small, look more professional. And that's what you want. And it's not just for letters,  it's for any size package. It's for anything that you're sending. And you don't even have to go to  the post office because the mail carrier will come to you, pick it up, take it to the post office for  you. Stamps.com. If you do any kind of mailing in your business, however big or small, you really  ought to look at this. It's just the best. Sign up right now. We have a special promo code. If you  click the microphone in the upper right hand corner, you'll get a four week trial and a $110  bonus offer when you use the offer code TWIT. You'll get $55 in postage coupons, a free digital scale,  $5 supply kit. You pay postage and handling on a scale for about five bucks. And a month of  stamps.com. It's awesome. We use it here at the office. All our mailings look pro. Yours can too.  Stamps.com. Click the microphone in the upper right hand corner and use the promo code TWIT.

We don't need more  silos. We don't need this. Man, it's so bad for consumers. You don't want to have to have  two or three devices just to get this mix of content that you already have.  So it's just a bad sign for the future of internet TV. That's what bummed me out the most about it.  It was like, oh great, now we're into this real three-way platform war. Whereas Amazon really had  the best chance of being the one player who played across all these platforms which could  have really helped them I think. Which could have ultimately sold more devices for them in the long  run. But yeah, it was just a dumb move on their part. Yeah, I mean that's the reason that I use

So I don't understand what  the technical barrier is. I mean I think this is pretty obviously a scapegoat reason and they just  don't want to sell these things that that are competing with their own devices. One of the

Showtime's on  it now. HBO's on it. Netflix of course. Hulu Plus. If they would just add Chromecast to the Amazon  video app I'd be so happy. And apparently that's never going to happen now.  And it's like Beta Max versus VHS. The consumer's going to be stuck between two

Start time: 3926.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  unmovable objects. This is one of those moves that could deepen the line.  The lines were already starting to be drawn right and this could sort of deepen some of those lines.  I don't know. Like Jeff said, Google has maintained openness here and hopefully they'll  continue to. Apple of course is on the other end of the spectrum. Completely closed. Probably  it's not out of the realm of conceivability that they're sort of blocking an Android app or  whatever. Or would potentially. But like what we've talked about on the show before, even if  Amazon did do it, it would be, it would probably be less, it would be less fully featured. And  Amazon's not going to want to give Apple a percentage of its content like Apple makes you do.  Give you 30% of sales. So even if there was an app, it was likely to be one of those things where  you have to buy your content outside of the app and then you're not going to be able to do it.  So maybe this was academic. Maybe this was one of those things that was destined to happen. But  Amazon just had the chance to be that one platform content provider that was going to play across  different ecosystems. So that's why I think this matters. And it does matter because  Internet TV is coming on strong and it's going to be big, big business. I understand why people  did it because this platform thing as a content provider is a multi, multi-billion dollar  opportunity. And they essentially are choosing that multi-billion dollar opportunity ahead of  being the one that just makes the sort of nickels and dimes off of pieces of content that they're  selling everywhere. You know who really benefits is not Amazon. But they're not going to be  selling. It's just, yeah. Wow. Well, okay. So the only thing that you can't do on any of these

I feel like Roku is now the most complete offering and all Amazon's doing is  throwing business to Roku. By the way, of course you could still buy Google stuff from Google and  Apple stuff from Apple and other retailers as well. It's not like it's somehow going to prevent  people from buying it. It just feels a little petty and weird. But once you're in there,

Transcript:  you know, you're just locked in more than ever, right? It means you start buying, you know,  your stuff from Google or Apple or Amazon. Now, you're more than likely stuck there because,  if you move to one of the other ones, you're not going to be able to get your stuff. Now,  you could move from, you know, Fire TV potentially to Roku or to Chromecast,  but not to Apple TV. But, you know, with the lines being drawn between these platforms,  I don't know. I do think to get to the Roku question, I do think that I have a Roku-

I just- I have the mall. Their voice activation  is really good. They've done some good work with the voice. You can just click that microphone  button and, you know, talk to it and it works remarkably well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  best when it comes out, I'm guessing. I think you're all hitting the really important part,  which is a change in the ecology of distribution. We're seeing this on the text side.  Instant Articles allows you to go to where the readers are. Google this week, according to  Recode- I can't say anything more, but I'll be there when they announce whatever that- Recode  said they're going to announce is going to enable easier distribution of kind of news content and  other web content. You got to go to where the readers are. You got to go where the viewers are.  You have to go where the people are rather than always making them come to you. What's missing,  though, in all of these structures is- and I think I talked about a company called Repost before-  where if you make content embeddable, the benefit is, oh, free content. You can embed free content.  But what we don't do is we don't value the creation of the audience. We don't share revenue at that  level, too. And if we did, if we had a marketplace both for the creation of content and for the  creation of audience, then it can find its own water level. Then you can do deals and say,  okay, so if you bring us enough audience, says Amazon, great. I'd love to have your app there.  And but Amazon still controls too much about saying, well, because we own the content,  that's where the value is. No, there's a lot of other people who will be happy to distribute  the Amazon content. And there's a deal to be done. So is Amazon short-sighted doing this? Are they  not? I think so. I mean, Bezos sees it because obviously he had to authorize the fact that  Washington Post and the paper he owns is going to put all of its content onto Facebook. Right.  And there's a benefit there, but he's going to make money on it because there's going to be ads  there. There's new distribution there. There's new value there. And I don't know what else was  done to get that super deal done between Washington Post and Facebook. But yeah, we're still trying to  keep an old siloed media world where you had to go to the theater, you had control over things.  And as it shifts, and I think it shifts pretty radically, and I'll be able to talk about this  more on Wednesday on Twig, we'll see a lot more unusual deals about audience, I think.

Transcript:  Speaking of the Washington Post, I think they got a little  suckered. That's probably a good word. By people. We're still not sure about this. This is the Yelp  for People. The idea is it's an app they say will come out next month. Julia Cordray,  one of the apps founders, says people do so much research when they buy a car, make these kinds of  decisions. Why not do the same kind of research on other aspects of your life? It's a Yelp for  people in which you can take somebody, as long as you know their cell phone number, and rate them  online. Her co-founder, Nicole McCullough, says as a mother of two in an era when people don't  always know their neighbors, she wanted something to help her decide whom to trust with her kids.  A horrified article by Caitlin Dewey in the Washington Post in the Intersect column.  Shocking. She even said, oh, people won't be able to remove their names. There'll be no right to be  forgotten. Of course, it doesn't take much to imagine a horrific outcome to P-E-E-P-L-E, except  a number of people think this isn't even an app, that there never was an intent to make an app.  And that Julia Cordray and her co-founder are just making this up for attention. Nicole McCullough.  Snopes even tried to get to the bottom of this. Snopes.com, where they debunk rumors, couldn't  prove that it was a hoax, but they kind of feel like there's a lot of evidence, including the  date April 1st on its Twitter page, which has since been removed, that this was a joke.  They didn't mention the platform. They didn't say, is it Android? Is it iOS? Where it's going to come out?  Fine, let's go build it.  What do you think? Maybe they want somebody to do this and they're trying to get somebody to do it.  Anyway, if you read the Snopes article, I have to say, it feels like the Washington Post maybe was  hornswoggled, sucker punched, fooled by these two. Let's take a break. We have more coming up,  lots more to talk about. Andrew Cunningham from R's Technica is here. We'll talk about El Capitan,

Our show today brought to you  by audible.com. Audiobooks. You know, when the world gets to be too much, I just escape into my  book. On audible, you can find 180,000 soon to be your books. And as wonderful as reading is,  it's even more immersive to listen. And you're listening to the same content, the same words  that are in the printed book, but you're listening while you're doing other things. Things you  couldn't hold a book while you're doing. Things like walking the dog, commuting in the car,  washing the dishes, working out. Audible is so great for my workouts. Sometimes I'll even go  a little farther because I'm listening to something I don't want to stop. I'm just now  starting a new book. I've mentioned a couple of times a science fiction book  that is by a Chinese science fiction author unknown in the West until now, that people are  raving about called The Three Body Problem. If you like science fiction, this is great. I'll tell  you what, I'm going to get you two books for free. You can get the first two volumes of this  trilogy for free, but there's so much more. There's mysteries, there's nonfiction. I listened to a lot  of nonfiction. Just finished Season of the Witch, David Talbott's story of the history of San  Francisco in the 60s and 70s. You were there at that time, Jeff Jarvis. I think you would  enjoy this book. And I'm sure you know David Talbott, founder of Slate. It's really a good  book, really well written.

While maneuvering the  twists and turns of the icy road, she loses control of her car. I don't know why I'm doing  this in a Scottish accent. I don't know why you are either.  And crashes into the rocky hillside when a rugged Scotsman pulls her to safety. Mackenzie is sure  she must be hallucinating. There's nothing more romantic than a guy in a skirt, in a plaid skirt.  He's a Highlander from 18th century Scotland, and he kisses like a madman.

It better be a short book. It is. It's only like five hours.  So, but I just saw this guy. There's a, there's this great event last week called Idea Festival,  which is kind of like a far less expensive version of Ted. I like that.  Joe gave a talk there and it's here in Louisville. It's an international event. Lots of people we  know that you know that have been on the show have talked there before, like Bear Tunde Thurston and  Molly Wood. But it's a lot of like, it's people from NASA. It's all kinds of, you know, innovators  and artists and great, great, great folks. ideafestival.com. You can learn more about that.  But Joe was there and gave a talk and it was one of the, it was one of the best talks I've ever  heard at any of these events. If I listen to this, the whole network falls apart.

And he  talks about the fact there's this great stat where he talks about the fact that the human brain  can process about 750 words a minute, I guess it is, but we can only say about 150.  A lot of times your mind wandering. It's why people speed up podcasts, speed up audiobooks,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's more about finding ways you have a very small, if you don't make a point quickly,  people's mind wanders and they fill up those extra, that extra gap, which is other stuff.  And so he talks about ways to make an impact by saying less. And he talks about speaking in  headlines, talks about, you know, email, the ways you send email, the ways that you speak to people,  the ways to prepare to make your words matter more. And it's funny at this event, almost everybody's  written a book that speaks, right? And afterwards they're out there signing their books and they're  selling their books and stuff. After his, his was the only one that sold out in like 10 minutes.  Everybody ran from the audience afterwards and went to buy it because it resonated so much with  trying to make a point, not just in speaking like he was, but in communicating in everyday life.

I think we've done ad blockers to death. No need to talk about it anymore. Although Jeff, you  did write a good article on saying that really the onus is on advertisers and advertising to

Start time: 5114.90
End time: 5117.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fix this problem. And also media to fix advertising, but that's pretty much the

Start time: 5118.28

I'd forgotten about this by Robert Downey senior.  Yeah. Who's also forgotten. Yes. The son has eclipped the father. Anyway, recommend the  article as usual. Jeff writing on medium and you can see I've had a number of underlinings from  people I follow on medium and a lot of comments too. I really like this feature of medium. This  ability to have a conversation around your words. It makes comments much better. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because they're right there. Yeah. I put the same post up as a note on Facebook using the new  proof note structure. Yeah. It doesn't have quite the functionality that medium has yet,  but it's a lot more elegant. It gives you more control than just a post. Yeah. A little more  permanence. So it's interesting to see where this goes. I love it that Ev Williams underlined this

Start time: 5180.50

Start time: 5187.94
End time: 5270.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of when I actually went with this whole conversation lately? Cause obviously we've been thinking about  it too. Oh yeah. I'm sure this impacts your bottom line. Yeah. Absolutely. Is I do a lot of research,  historical either. I've always got some kind of project, not just writing a book, but sometimes  other sort of history kind of project is being a history lover. And a lot of times that ends up  being one of two things that are both fun reading dead people's mail or looking up old newspapers.  Is that legal? Yeah. Right. That's what archives are full of. Archives are full of dead people's  mail, right? Letters, old letters. But the newspapers are the interesting part and what's  useful in this case is when you go back and you read old newspapers and you look at the advertisements,  they're actually as interesting, especially from a historical perspective as the copy. I love them.  Right? I love them. You learn so much about what was going on at the time and what people's priorities  were and what they were interested in and what sold and maybe what didn't sell. And as you do  about anything. And also, if you look at the ads, a lot of times they're much more personal.  They're more akin to something like one of the ad reads that you do, Leo, than they are to this

Start time: 5270.38
End time: 5275.88

Start time: 5276.70
End time: 5318.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they're folksy. Yeah. They are. And so there's an audience. They know that they are delivering  a message to an audience and they're interacting with them in a more personal way in a sense.  And so that's one of the elements that's missing, especially in online ads, which are much more,  you can tell obviously about a numbers game. It's about volume. And that's where we kind of lost  course and where advertising has lost its way, especially on the internet, is that they're not  about addressing an audience. They're not about providing information. They're not about engagement.

Start time: 5319.86
End time: 5324.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're more about volume and numbers. Where do you read the old stuff? I'm looking at the Google

Start time: 5325.38
End time: 5385.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  newspaper archive, which is really fun. It is. Also, the Library of Congress has an amazing  archive of old newspapers. And those are a lot of times not the big ones, but they're the more  smaller community kind of papers as well, going back to the 1800s, early 1800s.  And yeah, you can read them on Google now. Obviously I still go to libraries and look up  microfilms. There are some that haven't been digitized yet. I'm very thankful to the college  students who spend their whole summers digitizing these things. It's a very boring job, but extremely  important. And so thank you if you're an intern out there that spent this past summer digitizing  newspapers. We appreciate it. So yeah, it's super useful. And I do think it's instructive to kind of  where we're at, that advertising has to change. It has to become more useful, again, more purposeful.

Speaking of  Ev Williams, Twitter, everybody's saying now looks like they're going to have a CEO and it's going to  be what Jack Dorsey? That seems a little odd. Jack's of course, one of the inventors of Twitter and  in fact, he's been twice fired as CEO of Twitter.  Third time's a charm. Third time's a charm. Also runs Square and has said many times,  I won't be CEO of Twitter unless I can be a CEO. I'm not leaving Square. The Twitter boards,  of course, said many times, but we want a full-time CEO. Well, the latest, and this is from  Kara Schwisher, of course, who knows everything. Everything. And Kurt Wagner writing for Recode  that Jack Dorsey is expected to be named the permanent Twitter CEO. It feels like Twitter is  just an amusement at this point. It's just so much fun to watch this.

Transcript:  As its biggest problem as a public company, Twitter is that it's not Facebook. And, you know,  Facebook is, you know, is a money machine the way Google AdSense was a money machine and AdWords  were a money machine a decade ago, right? And Twitter is not that. Twitter is something different.  It is social media, but it's a different kinds of social media. And it's not necessarily something  that is as easy to understand right away still as what Facebook has done. I think Twitter's done a  lot of good things. I think product wise, I think they've had some misses, but Facebook has misses  all the time, too. I think that they've done some good things to try to make it easier to use,  to try to surface more content, to try to surface older content. And they're doing lots of good  things. But I think it does have certain limits in terms of audience. It's still a huge audience.  It's going to be, it's going to continue to be really important, I think, for a long time.  But it's not a money machine. It's not a money machine the way Google and Facebook were. And  I don't know if it ever will be. The ad click rates, you know, click through rates on ads on  Twitter are significantly less than Facebook. It's still not a fantastic ad platform.  And maybe it's part of the same discussion of how does advertising work in the modern digital  world? And Facebook hasn't, Facebook has kind of cracked it much more holistically than Twitter  has. Twitter is still trying to figure it out. They really haven't figured out the formula yet.  And that's their problem. Once they figure that out, and I think they probably will,  they'll make more money. They'll make a lot more money. I don't think it'll ever be Facebook,

Transcript:  though. It's so amazing because there's an article by Farhad Manju in the New York Times this week  who is talking about Twitter in effect saving television. I mean, who would have thought that  a few years ago? Yeah, because of live, live madness. They're talking about scandal.  Every Thursday since the show's premiere, most of the scandal cast and crew have used Twitter  to add live commentary that runs during the broadcast. And this has inspired hundreds of  thousands of tweets from viewers every broadcast. It has been credited with not only deepening the  program's relationship with its audience, but I think probably the ratings. When I was down in

And so this journalistic site decided to do a  fact-based version of what was going on. They used Twitter as the show was going on and say,  this is what really happened. This is what really happened. Huge, huge success brought tremendous  attention. Twitter is an amazing tool, but it's still not the world. That's the issue.

Transcript:  Yeah. He talks about Joshua Molina, who I followed on Twitter for a long time. I really liked him  in the West Wing going way back, but Molina himself says, I'm not a star. I'm a working actor.  Nobody knows my name. People kind of know my face, but I don't have fans. But he says,  25 plus years into my career, and it's only now because of scandal and Twitter that people know  my name and I have fans. But he is, he's very smart. He's been using Twitter for years.  He's on Vine. He's on Periscope. He is an example of an actor who's been working for 25 years,  who's worked a lot, but who has now finally been able to use social media to actually crack into  the top tier. I think that's interesting. It's not just networks and shows that benefit. It's talent,

Transcript:  too. Yeah. I do think Twitter needs a full-time CEO. I'll be honest. I think Twitter has some big  challenges. No matter how good Jack Dorsey is and if he is the right person for the job,  there's a reason why the board wants him to be full-time CEO. They have a lot of problems. They  need a leader who's going to really be there and lead. That doesn't mean that Jack Dorsey can't be  the figurehead of the company. Can't be executive chairman. Does he have the vision? The guy's been

Start time: 5789.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I think they need somebody. Twitter's challenges, I think, are more  blocking and tackling. It needs to get product right. It needs to nail that. It needs to get  figured out advertising. I don't think it needs necessarily a huge product visionary  to push it forward. It's good doing what it's doing. It needs to do business a little better.  It needs to run its operations better. It needs a lot of attention to do that. Jack Dorsey's a  great leader. He's a great figurehead. I think he's amazing as the face of Twitter. I think he's  amazing talking about what Twitter is and why it's great, but he can do that as executive chairman.  I think if they do have the kind of brain drain, like we're talking about at the top, and they  kind of already have had some, then that ultimately could, especially with him becoming CEO, that could  ultimately hurt them. Maybe the best case scenario is him coming in, being full-time CEO for  a year or two, and then bumping back up to executive chairman and whoever, the COO,  maybe that person, they're grooming the person for CEO to sort of take over full-time. Maybe that  would give Wall Street some more confidence in Twitter. I think you're right when you said it

I don't think anybody's  against Jack necessarily, but how can you not be distracted with two companies? I would imagine  more of his, he has a much larger stake in Square than he has in Twitter. I feel like Twitter is a

Transcript:  companies. Wall Street is people. Wall Street is investors. Wall Street is people that believe,  that invest in things based on what they think the future is. People look at the future of Twitter  right now and they're not real sure. For good reason. I think when you look at the future of  a company like Facebook or Google, you're pretty certain they're going to be around in five or  ten years and probably making a lot more money than they are now. Twitter, it's hard to see.  I think that's why Wall Street isn't sure what to think about them.  We all agree it's going to be around, but I think even we're not sure how will it change,  how will it make more money? I think Dorsey, if you're the CEO of two companies, it's hard  to do it equally. When Job was the head of Apple and Pixar, he was dedicating most of his time to  Apple. He had people at Pixar that were already, by the time he was doing that, he had people that  were running Pixar. He was making executive decisions and his job was to go in and punch  people in the nose in Hollywood and make sure that they got a good deal. He was really great  at it. Other than that, he didn't really run the company. Other people ran the company.

Transcript:  It's curated.  Yeah, it's curated.  It's not what people want from Twitter, is it?  Twitter people do their own thing.  What the board says is, well, or what the market says is, you're not big enough Twitter,  so clearly you're not giving people what they want. So what do they want? Figure it out and  give it to them. So now they flail around trying to figure out what that thing could be. Is it  longer tweets? Is it curated people? Is it curated content? The rumors of what's coming out this week  from Google that have been published on Recode, I think could make a huge difference in the way  you experience content through links in a place like Twitter. I think a lot could change around  Twitter, but the problem is that you see it as a success, but the market doesn't.

Transcript:  I brought a bunch of German editors and publishers into places like Fox and  Quartz and other places like that. And every time I brought them in, one of the people  of those companies would say, I know you're all on Twitter, but they point out the window,  they're all on Facebook. Yeah.  She's not where I want her to be.  That's what you're paying attention to. And Facebook has so much more data about you.  It knows more about you. It can target amazingly. Now you have Google adding the new function that  enables marketers to give them their email address list so that even through Google,  you're going to be able to target directly. I've argued that the real industry these folks are in  is signals and it's a war of signals. And Facebook has a tremendous war chest of signals, that is to  say data about people. Google has tremendous mechanisms like Android to gather signals about  you. Amazon has tons of signals about you. Apple less so, and Apple also is not really in the ad  business so they don't really need it as much. But those three companies, Facebook, Google, and  to an extent Amazon, in the advertising world, they have the wealth of signals. We in media have  been stupid. We don't have relationships with people so we don't have those signals. And Twitter,  it has some signals but Gina Trapani knows as much more about you than Twitter does.

Transcript:  No, we were just talking, we were talking about Facebook and Google earlier and I think the  interesting thing about those two companies is that they've proven that they can change and grow  and get into new things successfully over the last decade, decade and a half. Whereas Twitter,  they've got that one core product and even when they try to change anything about it,  if they change the stars to hearts or if they increase the number of characters in a DM,  people go, the established users of that service go kind of crazy about it in a bad way. And so  that's another thing they've got to fight too as they look to grow is how do they do that without  alienating the people who are already there. Yeah. They're talking about increasing the

There's no business model there, Fred. And indeed it is profitable. And Dick Costolo  did grow the revenue and grow the company impressively with a hard hand and it needed it.  But it's still, I mean, you know, the problem is you just can't count on what Twitter is going to  be. I go back to, I still am nervous about them based on the way they treated developers back in  the day. They grew on the backs of developers. Then they kicked the developers in said backs.

Your stream can be so nice, so pleasant.  Let us take a break, come back with more kind of the back of the book, the silly stories,  Japanese autonomous cabs, things like that. First, though, let's talk about disaster.  You never know when disaster will strike at work or at home. Storm, fire, flood or  Joey in the stock room accidentally deleting the entire hard drive could put you out of business.  You got to back up. It drives me crazy on the radio show, especially I'm on the front lines of  this. Guy called today, said I have some legal documents on a USB thumb drive and I can't read  it. I said, didn't you have a backup? He said, yeah, I had a backup, but I can't read that.  He said, you need carbonite for crying out loud. How many times do I have to tell you carbonite  backup for business and home? A million and a half folks have finally heard the word maybe you should  too. Back it up. You install carbonite once, you could forget about it. Any time you're online,  it's automatically backing up. It's encrypted on the way to the server, encrypted in place on the  server, but your data is there. It's safe. It's not, I think of it as like a data vacation.  It's in there in the carbonite climate controlled network operations center where  breezes blow across it and it gets to relax and enjoy. Probably you have even a little  tropical drink in its hand, but when you need it back, when you've got to get it, you just press  the restore button, there's your stuff back to work. You don't miss a beat. Use our offer code  tweet. You'll get two free months when you buy. You've heard me talk about this. I know you have  and you've put it off. You've said, oh yeah, one of these days. Don't be the person. I know people  who back up all the time who use carbonite because they lost data. Don't wait till disaster strikes.  It's like fire insurance. You can't buy it after the fire. Get it now. Carbonite.com. Two free  bonus months if you use the offer code tweet. We're talking high tech. We're saving everybody. Can  we save Evernote? Apparently I didn't know this. According to Business Insider. Now there is some  debate over this. Not everybody agrees. Business Insider says that Evernote is falling apart. Of  course they did replace Phil Libbon, their CEO in July. I like Phil a lot. I thought this was maybe  Phil's idea, but now I'm getting the impression that it was the board who was a little bit worried  about Evernote. 30 million registered users, 270 million in funding, but they did have to lay off  18% of its workforce over the last nine months. They're going to shut down three of its 10 global  offices. I was kind of stunned. Their actual revenue of Evernote is not huge. What was the

Start time: 6491.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  number? It was like $30 million. Everybody thought this was the ideal model that a small proportion  of your audience wants to pay for you. Everybody else uses it free. They've figured out. They invented  freemium for crying out loud. Everybody thought they'd figured it out. Yeah. Phil would tell me,

I think the lesson from Evernote and for all those people who are out there building freemium  services. Freemium, the model still works. I don't think this is an indictment on freemium,  although there are some movements toward freemium. There's some movements.

Transcript:  That's my face. I used to love Evernote. In fact, Phil once told me, we had to fill on  the triangulation. He once told me that something like three or 4% of Evernote subscribers are  subscribed because they said they heard it about it from me. I've been plugging it for years  and I use it all the time because it's cross platform and stuff. And I pay for it, but I guess  a lot of people don't pay for it. They say they have 150 million registered users,  but I guess a small percentage of those are paying for it. And that's hard to run a business on that.  Anyway, good luck. We wish you well.

That's obviously wrong. Crazy.  But that harkens back to a Google of an earlier time when there weren't so many employees. I don't  know. Maybe they'll have cats now. But that's- So Alphabet officially became the entity-  But no ferrets. No, no ferrets. That's something we can all agree on.  Yeah. Yeah. They're pretty cuddly. You know it's illegal to have a hedgehog in California?  It's illegal to have a ferret in New York City. Well, it should be illegal to have a  ferret in New York City. Well, no, it wasn't. What's wrong with a hedgehog? I don't know.  More stage fright bugs. Oh man. This is- Poor Google. I like Android. I really do.  But this is pushing people towards iOS. More than a billion Android users are vulnerable.  Stage fright is the media player in all versions of Android. And the security  reachers Imperium Labs that discovered the original stage fright blog has found a new one,  two new ones, that can allow hackers to break into your phone by tricking you to either download  or visit a website containing a malicious MP3 or MP4. The stage fright playback engine will play it  and you will be pwned. This affects almost every Android device since the first version of the  operating system in 2008, even Android 5.0 and later. At least 950 million Android users. There  is no fix, although Google, which knew about- was warned about this problem before it became public,  is apparently working on a fix and will put that patch out in a couple of- tomorrow, I guess,  to Nexus phone users. And they shared the patch to partners a few weeks ago so that they can get  those out. But that's a problem because there's different manufacturers, different carriers. It's  always difficult to get the bugs pushed out. Stage fright took a couple of months to fix  and now there's the new stage fright. So be very careful, I guess, about- if you're on an Android  device, none of them have been patched yet about playing MP3s or MP4s from unknown sites.

Again, unfortunately, the problem is less with any one bug and more that there's no reliable,  guaranteed way to get this update out to everybody who's got an Android phone right now.

Transcript:  wish. And now a malware tool that has your back. Symantec's researchers have discovered a new  malware tool called Linux Y-Fatch that compromises home routers and other internet connected consumer  devices and patches them. Symantec says the malware has infected tens of thousands of routers and  other IoT systems around the world. They've seen it for the last two months. It seems, in fact,  to be designed to harden devices. For instance, on some devices, it turns off Telnet, which is an  insecure communications module. It tries to prevent other attackers from using other known  vulnerabilities in. So it's a good malware? It's a good malware. It's still, Symantec says-  Steve Gibson made malware. Yeah. Yeah. It's bizarre. The code is  unobfuscated and then the clear as if the author wanted people to know what they were up to.  But as Symantec points out, it's still a piece of code that infects your device without your consent.  It does have general purpose back doors that look to be for updates to add other  features, anti-malware features, but could be used to add bad stuff. It's just bizarre.  Mostly because people who use routers never patch them, never think about it.  I'm guessing some benign hacker made this thing and spread it around.  I've said a couple of sad stories speaking of hacks. Patreon was hacked. Unfortunately,  kind of a nasty, Dan Gooden writing in Ars Technica about this is kind of a nasty story because  apparently they had left a debugger running on a public facing part of their website.  And the debugger allowed arbitrary code to be run. Worse, they were told about it five days before  they got hacked. Patreon, Jack Conte's really, really wonderful site that enables creators to  get paid by their users. Kind of a patronage system. I know a lot of podcasters who use it.  That's sad.

Transcript:  So El Capitan is out. I'm already hearing from anytime you get a big operating system  upgrade, I'm hearing from people whose favorite utilities stopped working.  Now I noticed a lot of menu bar utilities stopped working. Apple probably disabled the  back door that these companies were using. But on the whole, I know you've written a lot of  words about it, Andrew. A good upgrade, a worthwhile upgrade, should people do it?

Start time: 7247.52
End time: 7339.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Especially if you're already running Yosemite, yeah, most people are going to have no problem  with it. The thing that I think a lot of people are noticing with some of those utilities, and  I ran into it myself with the tethered shooting app for my Sony camera, is that this new system  integrity protection tool that stops third party apps from writing to certain protected system  directories. When you upgrade from Yosemite to El Capitan, it's going to move any files in there  that don't belong somewhere else. So yeah, it's going to break some things, especially if you  have third party drivers installed, if you use any third party toolbars, things like that,  you might run into some problems. But I've been using it since the pretty early days of the beta  and basic stuff like Office and Chrome and Firefox and the other apps and things. I've not had any  trouble on my laptop, especially. I really like the split screen feature for full screen. I've  seen some people making fun of the fact that we went from windowed operating systems to one app  on a screen operating systems, and now we're going back to Windows. But when you use the  multitouch trackpad gestures in OS X, you can kind of swipe between these full screen apps  really easily. And so I like to have like all my I am apps in one window. I have a couple. I have  like a Chrome tab and a Word app next to each other in another window. It's been really great,  especially for my laptop. On my multi-screen desktop setup, not so much, but can't take that

Apple's to be commended because this is a hard thing to do.  We're hearing so many problems with Windows 10. Microsoft seems to have rushed it out and despite  a long public beta period, lots of stuff's not working. One thing that Microsoft does that's not  working on here on El Capitan is Microsoft Office 2016. Do we know why that's not working?  Oh, have you had problems?  Yeah, lots of people saying problems.

They'll be used in  a very small area to take older people to grocery stores. But I think this is great,  a robot autonomous vehicle. Initially, I think they'll have drivers in the cars,  but I think ultimately the idea is this will be an unmanned service. It starts next year.  It'll be available for 50 people in the Kanagawa Prefecture, south of Tokyo.  But I think it's a start. We're getting there. You're in a Johnny cab. Someday. Someday.

Transcript:  I spent some time with Honda earlier this year.  Yeah, you saw the Asamo, didn't you?  Yeah, and some of their researchers that are working on  robots and that kind of thing. I think they're getting to the point where they've done really  good with the mechanics, I think, of robots. What we're really at now is where we need the AI  to catch up. That's why so many companies like Google and IBM and others, that's where they're  putting all of their research. They're really changing their thinking about the idea of what  a robot looks like. They're really changing their thinking about the idea of what a robot looks like.  Some are humanoid robots like Asamo that I did some coverage of earlier this year.  But I think people are also starting to think of robots in terms of special, more specialty  functions. The AI attached to, there's the one that's like an arm that can make dinner.  It's just an arm and it makes dinner or it can do the dishes, that kind of thing. But it needs a  lot of AI. It's more about the AI than the function. This is the same thing with the  cars and self-driving cars or self-driving vehicles and this kind of thing. It's the AI

Transcript:  Yeah. I just watched the X Machina. I liked that movie. Yeah. That was well done. Yeah.  Encapsulates a lot of the 50 years or 100 years even of thinking about once we get to the point  where the AI works, what does that mean? It's going to go horribly wrong. That's why.  That's why. There's a professor at the Idea Festival, the event I mentioned that we covered  last week. And he talked a lot and we talked to him a lot. He's a cybersecurity. He runs a  cybersecurity lab at the University of Louisville. He's one of the preeminent researchers in  cybersecurity. His name is Roman. Gosh, I got to remember his last name. I can't pronounce it  correctly if I did. But anyway, he was saying that all of these things are we're on the cusp  of it. You'd be amazed at what we can do and what AI can do. And he said, where we're at now is we  need to start thinking at this point of putting the guidelines in place the same way. He said,  we need to think about the same way we do about chemical weapons and about nuclear arsenals  and things like that, because we need to put the guidelines and the frameworks in place  for doing this research before it becomes dangerous. So he was a real advocate of that.  Yes. He was a real optimist in terms of how far AI is coming and how fast, how quickly. But his  real thrust was like, we've got to set guidelines and expectations and frameworks for this kind of
