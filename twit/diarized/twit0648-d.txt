Transcript:  It's time for Twit this week in tech. What a great show. I mean, I mean, what a great show to kick off the new year with.  Micah Sargent is here. He's senior editor at Mobile Nations. Amy Webb, our futurist from amyweb.io.  And Mike Elgin, our gastronomad. He's decided to light in our neck of the woods to talk about the week's tech news.  Of course, we're going to talk about Meltdown, Inspector, and come up with a really good, I think, long-term solution for this whole thing.  We do have to recap the iPhone battery crisis. And somehow we got distracted during that conversation by smart sex dolls and CES and a whole lot of stuff.  It's a fun twit. Stay tuned. It's next.

The goal, besides just kind of, you know, schmoozing and having fun and drinking wine and coffee, is to really understand better these stories.  Mike Elgin is here as always, a really deep thinker on these subjects.  Although I think you've retreated from tech journalism.

Yeah, and this is a book basically, I've been living on and off as a digital nomad for about 10 years.  And lots of people, lots of people, I know a huge number of people in your audience, Leo, because I know that you inspire a lot of people to travel as well.  We're all dying to do this, yeah.  They go read the digital nomad literature and just fall flat and say, well, I guess I can't really figure out how to do it.  Right.  So I'm here to show you exactly how to do it.  How you can actually travel anywhere from a little bit more to constantly for the rest of your life and also why to travel that much.  Yeah.  It's about the food, Leo, basically.  And it's a long story short is that life is really short and the world is really large.  I'm going to be in Barcelona in September.

Transcript:  Micah, you're way too young to have written a book when you've got plenty of time.  Nobody should write a book in their 20s.  You would regret it deeply in your 30s.  Let's put it that way.  Well, that's good advice.  I appreciate that.  Wait, wait a year or two.  Well, I guess we should talk about the big story, which is the worst security flaw in the history of all mankind.  At least it would be if you watched mainstream media.  Yes.

Start time: 446.54
End time: 506.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And, you know, I've been trying to and I've listened to Steve Gibson's explanation for this several times.  Over and over.  And I think I understand how well I don't understand this.  But it's a very complicated thing.  But the way that I would characterize this is that chips for the last.  Since 1995.  13 years now, they guess what is going to happen to speed things up.  And we've now discovered that that information that they're guessing can be piqued at.  Leaked.  Leaked, harvested, whatever.  Theoretically, it's all theoretical.  So we'll start with the good news or the sunny perspective.  That's why I'm here, Leo, is to provide the sunny, happy perspective.  Mr. Optimist.  Yes.  Which is that which is that, first of all, we don't know of any actual exploit that's taken place from this.  And number two, it's going to be fixed and it's all going to be fine.  That's the best possible scenario.

Start time: 507.73
End time: 880.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it may actually not be true.  But we'll delve into that a little bit.  These are the two flaws which were interestingly discovered simultaneously meltdown and specter.  Specter affects Intel chips meltdown effects.  Not just Intel chips, but AMD chips and some ARM chips, including Qualcomm chips.  And that's what is really the issue here.  And one of the reasons I say it is probably the most serious security flaw we've seen is because it pretty much affects any modern computer, including an iPhone, including an iPad.  And so that means it's widespread.  What it isn't is easy.  Right.  And there's a Bruce Schneier talks a little bit about the synchronicity of two in completely independent teams discovering this.  And apparently this is not unusual.  Well, Bruce is very literate, so he compares Leibniz and Newton discovering calculus at the same time.  I don't think it's like that.  But I think what it is is researchers tend to look in the same alleyways.  And this is a category of flaws called timing flaws that have been lately very fruitful.  Rowhammer is an example where where people were able to kind of look into memory based on a kind of a weird race condition.  So we will we will.  So, in other words, it's interesting that these are discovered by independent teams.  Schneier says that's one reason we should worry about this, because if these two teams discovered it at roughly the same time independently, who else discovered it and who might have discovered it even a year ago or two years ago or 10 years ago or 10 years ago, including the NSA.  So this is and I think was it Mike has suggested this XKCD comic strip.  Randall is is great at explaining this stuff.  The melt. This is XKCD number 1938.  The meltdown inspector exploits use speculative execution.  What's that? Well, you know, the trolley problem.  Well, for a while now, geeks know the trolley problem because it's talked about a lot in self-driving cars.  Well, for a while now, CPUs have basically been sending trolleys down both paths quantum style while awaiting your choice.  So it's speculative execution.  Intel started doing it in 1995 because it really did speed up processors.  They would guess what you will do next.  Start that execution.  And when if they guess correctly, it would be massive improvements.  If they guess wrong, you'd be you'd have to back up a little bit.  But it turned out the massive improvement outweighed the slowdown.  So every processor, modern processor uses speculative execution, except for maybe some of the dumbest arm processors.  Raspberry Pi, for instance, says we don't do that.  So we don't have to worry.  So you know the trolley problem.  Well, for a while now, both CPUs have basically been sending trolleys down both paths quantum style while awaiting your choice.  Then the unneeded phantom trolley disappears.  They say, well, you didn't do that.  But the phantom trolley isn't supposed to touch anyone.  But it turns out you can still use it to do stuff and it can drive through walls.  What she's saying here and what's happening with Meltdown Inspector is because another technique used by processors to speed up execution, very fast, level one cache right next to the processor in the speculative branch, it will load that cache with data for the next process.  And it turns out the current process can peak at that data.  This is why it isn't the most useful flaw ever, because that data, you don't really get to choose what's in that cache.  But it might contain passwords, logins, credit card numbers.  If you could do it a lot, like for over a long period of time, it might be really valuable.  That's where, by the way, the biggest risk is to people running on processors, shared processors, like in virtual machines or servers.  So often when you have a web server, you're running on the same machine as a hundred other websites.  If one of those websites were a bad actor, he could run software that would then peek into all the other websites' cache activities and perhaps over a period of time, get stuff.  So that's the biggest risk. And by the way, that's why Amazon Web Services, Google Services, Microsoft Azure, they've all been down lately.  Even Epic Gaming went down.  In fact, they said if you're playing Fortnite on our servers, you may notice some slowness.  We're trying to patch them as fast as we can.  So this is a big problem on shared processors because then you wouldn't have to ever have malware on your system.  It could just be somebody else acting badly.  But if you had malware or even, and Apple discovered that this is a scary one, I think it was Meltdown, can be achieved by a browser running a JavaScript program.  So you could theoretically go to a bad website and the JavaScript hidden on that website could actually try to read your memory contents.  It would only get what was in the cache. It would be really hit or miss.  It's a much better tool for targeted. That's why the NSA would love this.  Because if you know, if I'm going after Mike Elgin, pardon this long explanation, but it's complicated.  I think it's important.  Even the cartoon has to be explained. So that sounds bad.  Honestly, I've been assuming we were doomed ever since I learned about Rowhammer.  That was the other timing flaw that did.  What's Rowhammer? If you toggle a row of memory cells on and off really fast, you can use electrical interference to flip nearby bits.  And do we just suck at computers? Yep. Especially shared ones.  So you're saying the cloud is full of Phantom trolleys armed with hammers. Yes, that's exactly right.  OK, I'll just install updates.  Updates? Good idea. That's the bottom line.  Update! Because everybody, Microsoft, Apple, Qualcomm, even Intel and AMD say we're going to put out patches.  Those would be the better patches, the patch that microcode level.  But if you're running Windows, it's been patched. If you're running a recent version of Macintosh, it's been patched.  And those patches will continue to come out. For instance, the Safari patch, I don't think is out yet, but will come in.

Start time: 881.08
End time: 888.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And there will probably be future patches that will be more elegant.  But now they're just putting band-aids on it and making sure that it doesn't, you know, it can't be exploited.

Start time: 889.00
End time: 903.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one issue here, of course. And the Register, when it first reported this on Tuesday, said everybody's hair on fire because they said you're going to see 5 to 30 percent performance degradation.  But that's not that. Because the at least initial patch is turn off speculative execution. Exactly. You just turn that off.

Start time: 904.02
End time: 923.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speculative execution, by the way, is the official name of Saudi Arabia's death penalty laws. That's an entirely different issue.  Yeah, that's if you just turn that off. And what they're going to do is over time, and Steve Gibson explained this beautifully,  but they're going to get it back to the performance where there's no difference in performance eventually. I don't know, six months, whatever it is.

Start time: 924.48
End time: 1024.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Apple, for instance, in its benchmark said the patch on Safari is going to give you a 1 to 2 percent performance degradation. That's not noticeable.  Anything below 5 percent, you wouldn't notice. Nobody will notice it.  So bottom line is you should patch as soon as a patch is available. There are some complications, however. For instance, this is very annoying.  If you are running a third party antivirus on Windows, you're it may be blocking the Microsoft patch because any and this is one of the reasons I tell people don't use third party antivirus is  antivirus is use unsupported calls to make kernel memory calls. This would be blocked by the patch and it would result in a blue screen of death.  So a lot of people I've heard from a number of people said, well, I installed Microsoft's out of bandwidth patch.  It was like it was late last week and I got a blue screen of death immediately. That's because of your third party antivirus.  And there's a list of third party antivirus is this is from ZD net. Although the list is being maintained by Kevin Beaumont, a security researcher.  He's got a public spreadsheet that would be more up to date. This goes back to January 5th.  A lot of antiviruses are either have not been fixed or haven't done what Microsoft asked was asked, which is to change a registry key to signal to Windows update.  OK, it's OK to install now. So you you stay may still not be getting it.  It's kind of a mess. But I think and correct me if I'm wrong. I don't think it's anything anybody should freak out about.

Start time: 1024.06
End time: 1071.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's very hard to use this if you do want to freak out about it. Here's here's one reason why you might want to do that.  So up until this point, whether anybody has exploited is anyone's guess.  And like you've said, it could be a state actor or whatever. Who knows what's going on? Could be the NSA.  But now that it's been announced, there's a there's a scramble, no doubt among hackers to figure out if and how and when they can exploit this.  So it's a challenge. And so the industry is quickly patching it and trying to fix it and fix the leaks.  But as you pointed out, some Windows users aren't getting it. There's going to be different rollouts.  And so there's a new urgency in the in the hacker, malicious actor industrial complex to exploit this.

Start time: 1072.36
End time: 1076.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. They know now it's there. Exactly. Timing flaws are notoriously difficult.

Start time: 1076.28
End time: 1123.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Amy, I would say to go ahead and freak out about it. Thanks for calming everything down.  But but but here's why. If it was the case that and this is particularly complicated because it's a hardware issue.  And and on top of it, it's not a bug that appeared overnight because, you know, somebody was trying to sort of make an update in the process of making the update.  They broke something. This was a hardware flaw that that has been inherent in the system that people knew about.  You know, I could I could say the same of Sony, which has, you know, which is no stranger to problems with hackers and has a very, very long history of ignoring all of the weak signals.

Start time: 1124.44
End time: 1132.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And Sony would learn something's wrong. So I just their their attack was a targeted attack that would be particularly vulnerable to this kind of vulnerability.

Start time: 1133.00
End time: 1200.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the point that I'm making is that the part that people should be freaking out about is that I, you know, are as technology becomes more complicated, it's going to start breaking in in sort of strange ways, which means that companies need to be ever more vigilant about forecasting out in advance and pressure testing systems for things like timing flaws, which somebody somewhere in the organization I have to have thought raise.  They had to have raised that issue at some point. It's not like this was a this could not have come as a giant surprise.  And I might even argue that it was an intentional and the consequences wound up being worse than than maybe the risk management people might have thought in advance.  So the reason to sort of freak out is because we think that once we purchase technology, it's ours and we have agency and domain over it.  This is yet another example that that's not the case. And I know that these these glitches and these hacks are getting more and more complicated for the average person to understand.  However, it's incumbent upon us to keep states focused and and to ask for some serious answers.

Transcript:  Intel, there are several, of course, class action lawsuits. That's not really probative.  But there is some speculation that maybe this is a janky way to do it.  And Intel should be faulted for choosing this way to speed up their processors.  This was like, I don't know. I'm not educated enough to say.

Start time: 1221.55
End time: 1240.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I'm not a, you know, I'm not a hardware person.  You'd have to be a chip designer to really understand if this is not like this was a brand new design and they were trying to do something totally radically different over the last design cycle.  And this is going back. Actually, you're right.

Start time: 1241.58
End time: 1295.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ninety five. This was a problem. But remember, a little bit later, Intel's lunch was starting to get eaten by AMD.  Intel went down a bad road with the titanium. They suddenly realized you can't get faster than four gigahertz.  They're just becomes unreliable. They were up against maybe not by 1995, but but quickly thereafter up against a wall of performance.  And there was huge demand for more performance.  And as I remember it, I remember Intel happened to have this skunkworks project in Israel that they when I titanium failed, they went to that were doing things like branch prediction and speculative execution to get more performance out of the X eighty six platform.  They were they wanted to move away from it and they chose to go with X eighty six.  Perhaps could fault fault them for making a poor design decision.  But on the other hand, it's been twenty two years before we found the problem.

Start time: 1297.01
End time: 1325.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. And so again, I come back to I hear from a lot of people.  This has been around for twenty two years. It's impossible that it's just now somebody figured this out.  I wouldn't worry about it. Right. If something horrible hasn't happened yet, you know, what's the what's the probability?  And again, to me, this is yet another example of organizations making sacrifices for whatever gain that put consumers in harm's way.

Start time: 1327.64
End time: 1405.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, this is a really good example of something so technical that even we as people who cover tech have a hard time wrapping our head around it.  Steve Gibson, we talked about this on Tuesday and even on Tuesday, Steve Gibson was, you know, and nobody hears this other problem might cause a slowdown.  Nobody really understood the impact of this for a while.  And it took a lot of minds thinking about it. How do you then explain this to regular people and CEOs and other people?  I mean, how do you this is a this is the world we're living in.  In fact, I remember Jerry, the late Jerry Purnell writing, I think it was in Lucifer's hammer.  And this was many years ago. He said we were already in a world where most of the technology people use, they don't understand.  They don't know how it's made. You could know how an internal combustion engine worked.  Good luck explaining how a computer works.  And if a catastrophic event were to happen, like an asteroid hitting the earth as it does in the book, we wouldn't be able to recreate it.  Nobody would know how it how it was made in the first place.  We're using stuff that is effectively magical.  And now we're asking the wizards who created the magic.  Hey, guys, don't screw up.  But we have no way to test that.

Transcript:  Just wait until the AI is creating the AI.  Well, that's just a matter of how do we control.

Start time: 1412.62
End time: 1482.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's already so but that's kind of my point, right?  Because we're already so I will preface this by saying there's a lot of misplaced optimism and fear when it comes to writing the book.  You're writing the book about that. Yes.  So but we can't submit ourselves every time we butt up against a rough problem and sort of just say, well, this is like a black box.  If I had a nickel for every time I've heard somebody describe a complicated technology as a black box that we just can't understand, we shouldn't be in a position where we're creating technology that we can't understand, let alone can't explain.  Right.  You know, and there's a lot of, you know, there's a lot of that.  So that either tells me that humans have just gotten lazy and we we don't want to take the time to understand.  I mean, obviously, technology has gotten a lot more complicated.  But, you know, we should not be in a situation where we are entirely reliant on tools and services and code and devices that that, you know, we can't in any meaningful way understand how it works.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  From a journalistic standpoint, hard.  Yeah, exactly.  This is all rocket science.  From a journalistic standpoint, I think that this is another one of those challenges on multiple levels.  One, because, yes, you know, we're talking about trying to explain this to I go back to normal people who people who aren't steeped in technology like we are.  And when when we try to explain this, a lot of times it's like people maybe necessarily who aren't interested in hearing about it and are just like, you know, they'll they'll figure it out.  So it does sort of go back to that apathy, I think, about these magical boxes that we don't understand how they work.  And so we're apathetic to the problems because maybe we've never experienced them before ourselves.  And so there are two things that become an issue.  One is just explaining it in general.  But two is like keeping control of the of the message or or making sure that the right message gets out there because inevitably how these things play out is it gets to the people that know more about this stuff.  And they write their articles, they write their explanations, they put up their blog posts, they make comics, what have you.  And then it trickles down to more mainstream.  It's like secondary.  And then the main mainstream, it gets on local news outlets and things like that.  And by the time it gets there, it's been bastardized so much and and sort of translated so much that oftentimes there's so much inaccuracy because of the vagueness of it.  And so by the time it gets to a family member of mine who is not as steeped in technology as I am, they're hearing a whole different story.  And it's the worst possible thing.  Then you add on top of that, the fact that all of these news outlets are scrambling for views are scrambling for clicks are scrambling for for page views and things like that.  And you have headlines that tell incorrect stories or don't tell the whole story.  And a lot of times we know, like we can tell from all of these different things that track our our usage and our our activity on pages that people oftentimes don't go through and read the article.  They read headlines. They read Twitter sized bits of information.  And so what we're doing is spreading misinformation.  And it's so hard to get caught up with that.  And even if we do sort of come back and say, OK, you know, you've heard this, but it's not exactly this.  You try to explain what it is. Those articles get far less views than any of the articles that originally went out there and said, this is the end of the world.  Everything's melting down. So it's it's it's a problem.

You want to the only way to get the links is to be sensational and fast.  And that's the worst situation.  But I think both Amy and Mike are saying what I would completely agree with what is ultimately this is the job of of journalism is to find is to is to do the work to understand the tough stuff.  And whether it's tech or government or whatever, and explain it so that we can have an informed populace.  Right. That's the job.

Start time: 1688.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're journalists, they're reporters, and then there are editorialists like myself.  And so one of the things that I would say is it's it's probably less important.  I mean, the public is never going to understand this stuff. Right.  The public can't locate Australia on a map. Yeah. Right.  So the public is never going to understand this kind of security.  And it's far more important that they have a sort of a behavioral operating system for coping with this stuff.  And here's why. Every time we learn about these things, it's already been out there forever.  I mean, this this one's been out there for two decades.  So it's like it doesn't matter what you know now.  It matters what you've been doing for two decades.  So we need to figure out how to instruct the public so that they can protect their data.  Because we're always shocked and surprised by all the different creative ways that our information can be stolen from us.  Every year, there's two or three major stories that is like, I never even thought that was a way that people could harvest all my passwords.  Third party cloud services are routinely hacked and all this stuff downloaded and so on.  And so we there needs to be a much greater emphasis on providing the public with an all purpose set of behaviors and tools that will allow them to keep their data safe.  Is that possible? It's possible. It's possible to do the best we can with that.  So right now there's certainly update, update, backup, backup in the cloud password.

Transcript:  Yeah, so a couple of things. We already have the tools to protect ourselves in a reasonable way against threats and hacks.  You know, I if I I mean, I would I would walk I would walk out in the street right now and just ask random people when the last time was that they updated their OS, right?  Updated the router settings. I mean, like updated everything. People just don't do it for any number of different reasons.  You know, I I don't know. And I I would also just I mean, it's plausible to give people the tool set, but it's improbable that that, you know,  the everyday person is going to see the urgency and keeping themselves constantly safe.  I mean, it's it's replicate. This is this is why companies don't a lot of companies don't participate in strategic foresight and they don't do the work of a futurist.  Because until something happens, they don't see the value in it.

Transcript:  So, you know, for Sony to have for Sony to have completely changed what it was doing, the net the many, many, many times that it got hacked would have been an investment  for everyday people, for everyday people to do the type of safeguarding that we're talking about, which isn't just running patches and updates, but also paying attention to the news.

Transcript:  So we're talking about an investment in time and money that companies which have a financial stake in all of this aren't willing to make.  You know, I just don't see everyday people being willing to do that either.  Now, I will say that this, you know, I'm a quantitative futurist and this has been my job for 15 years, but I had a first career.  I was a journalist. I was a correspondent and I worked at the Wall Street Journal and at Newsweek.  That's why I lived in Japan and China. And I went to the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism.  So, you know, the the comments about journalists exploiting tech news for traffic gain, I think is some of that may be true.  And we certainly live in a digital economy where attention is currency, unfortunately.  But just because you produce like just because, you know, Randall Monroe creates a really great XKCD that explains this very complicated problem doesn't mean that my dad, you know, is reading it.  And it doesn't mean that my dad will read it even if I send it to him. Right.  So part of the problem is, again, we're quick to blame institutions and we're, you know, we're quick to blame journalists lately.  We are we are reluctant to blame ourselves and being complicit in some of this.

I don't run automatic updates because sometimes, you know, the update isn't the right one to run at that time.  But I have, you know, I have a very methodical way of constantly updating all my stuff, you know, and I have secondary and tertiary checks running on different things.  The average person is not going to do that.  But like my dad can't wait for me to come home to visit him.  That's your job.  And at that point, do all the tech support.

Going forward, we all have to develop a different kind of digital street smarts that is, you know, unlike, I think, in the past, we're just surrounded by more and more complicated technologies.  And so this is the kind of thing we're not going to pick up on our own.

And to some extent, you know, I love my father, but my dad, like jacking around and not updating his iPad for whatever reason, ultimately, in some way impacts me.  Because when we have a network of devices that are vulnerable in some way, it makes it easier for people to find the big payoffs, the big zero days.  Right. Like the big zero days that everybody that everybody's looking for.  You know, well, anyhow, just makes it.

Transcript:  I don't see an easy answer. I mean, again, I would go back to the job of journalism is so important these days.  It is a shame that it's being dragged through the mud.  But this is an example of I would I would say, Amy, that if your dad doesn't even understand it, but if your dad were writing for the Wall Street Journal, it would behoove him to talk to experts,  find out as much as he can and do the best job he can explaining it to people who need to know this information.

Start time: 2187.04
End time: 2235.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, the easiest way to do here's this. I think we just I think the four of us actually just came up with a solution.  And the solution is we need some kind of no, no, no, no.  Here's the solution, because I think we need like a CDC for I love it.  There we go. You're right. We need we need a you know, the Centers for Disease Control.  If you stop and think about sort of their mandate and what they do and where they are and how they're funded,  a lot of what they do is try to predict and manage epidemics to manage the overall health of people living in our country.  I think that we're probably due for some kind of CDC that does exactly what we were talking about moments ago, you know, which is like there kind of is there kind of is.

Start time: 2237.30
End time: 2248.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not saying it does a good job, but there's the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team, which is part of the Department of Homeland Security.  That's kind of what it's supposed to be. Yeah.

Start time: 2249.18
End time: 2289.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I because I've looked at their work before and I just it's not it's it's not the same.  So Mike made a very, very good point, which was that we need to position ourselves so that everyday people have tools.  And and on that website, if you show it again, there you can follow it.  And on the site, they do every now and then list. Right.  So the current activity and they've got that alerts and tips. Yeah.  They do have like PDFs and things that you can download.  But, you know, it doesn't we need a CDC level kind of sort of institution that has the the press savvy.  You know, that can that can help educate the public.

Start time: 2290.06
End time: 2294.00

Start time: 2294.66
End time: 2308.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  I mean, you know, I was just think this is a little off topic, but I was just thinking about this the other day.  There are so many apps these days where one of the first things that asks you is, hey, if you want to get in touch with all of your friends, go ahead and click this button and we'll make sure that if your friends are on this app, then you can use it, too.  And then you upload your entire database of contact information to their database, your entire library of contact information.  And it's just it's a small thing, but it's essentially sort of breaking the trust of everybody who trusted you with their information, who trusted you with their phone number, their email, their address, whatever ends up getting updated to those cloud servers.  And we all do it.

Start time: 2355.10
End time: 2379.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, to me, the most outrageous and underappreciated example of that is Google Photos, which I love.  Absolutely love Google Photos.  But Google Photos, I can take pictures of all kinds of people, strangers, anybody, and it uploads to Google Photos.  Identifies them.  And then it asks me to say who they are.  So I'm basically saying, oh, that's Leo.  I didn't ask your permission.  They didn't ask your permission.  But Facebook's even worse.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 2380.58
End time: 2416.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And part of the problem is Facebook, for example, leaks information in ways that the user doesn't know.  So there's a friend to friend problem on Facebook, which is if you take a Facebook quiz, which isn't really a quiz.  I know you really want to know which Game of Thrones character you are.  But really, really what's happening is you're giving a lot of information to a third party like, let's say, Cambridge Analytica.  But worse than that, as soon as you agree to that, they get access not to your information, but your friends information.  So you're leaking.  And I don't think people know that.  And you're leaking your friends information.  You probably, if you knew that, might not even do it.  But nobody knows this.

Start time: 2417.40
End time: 2432.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So again, so now let's just take that entire story, Leo, that you just told.  And instead of photos and instead of a face of Game of Thrones and a game, let's say that because you're describing a communicable disease.  Yes.  Right. So.  So.

Start time: 2440.35
End time: 2471.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If this was the CDC and if we use the same vocabulary.  Yeah.  Because part of the problem is currently, like, everyday people lack the analogies to understand the impact of these systems and tools.  So you could describe what exactly what you just said and replace Facebook with smallpox and people would immediately understand that, you know, this is something that they should be paying attention to.  We don't have a shared vocabulary and I'm not comparing.  I'm not saying that Facebook is smallpox.  I am.  I am.

Transcript:  Actually, if you look at what CERT does.  That's going to be the name for the show this week, right?  If you look at what CERT does, I'm looking at the CERT alert for Meltdown Inspector and it's actually quite good.  And they put it out on January 3rd.  They updated January 4th.  They updated again on Friday.  Apparently they went home for the weekend.  That's too bad.  So they're underfunded.  But it's pretty good with links to vendors and vendor mitigations.  Lots of additional information, including the original research.  They refer to the United Kingdom, which has a nice national cybersecurity center.  So they are working with other governmental, similar governmental agencies.  This is right.  But what they what they lack is the one thing I think you're right that they need to do, which is a better public facing presence.  Yes.

Start time: 2523.00
End time: 2561.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's not written.  US CERT is, you know, if you have some of the language and you're a little bit more technically inclined, it's a great site to be on.  But for sysadmins and IT pros.  Yeah, that's right.  That's right.  And to be fair, the CDC has plenty of very top level public health and medical vocabulary and language and everything else.  But the everyday person can and journalists can also go onto that website and still make sense of what's there.  So that's you know, we need and we have people from the CDC who go out and speak.  We've had movies made about the CDC.  CDC is part of NCIS.  Make it sexy.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, I like that.

I think we've done with Meltdown Inspector, but I do encourage everybody.  I mean, the bottom line, you're watching this.  You understand it.  But tell your friends and family, make sure you update those systems.  Make sure you do those patches.  It isn't, you know, perhaps as easy as just doing the operating system patches.  There will be microcode patches for the processors.  And I have to say I've read reports, good reports from security experts who say in some cases new hardware will be required.  That's a big problem because nobody I just bought an iMac Pro.  Do I have to buy another one in a year?  Throw it away.  I'm going to throw it away.  It's it's got the Meltdown Spectre.

Thank you for bringing me a copy.  Our show today brought to you by, I'll tell you where I'm reading this, Lying Safe and  Sound and Great Comfort on My Casper Mattress.  Sweet.  I love my Casper.  Casper, you know the name, not the friendly ghost.  We're talking the mattress company that continues to revolutionize the mattress industry.  Providing you with affordable, comfortable, long lasting mattresses that are 10 times  better than the mattress you get at the mattress store.  You know, this, what they noticed, what they observed is that there is a real, this is  this is what I love about modern entrepreneurship.  They're looking for businesses where there's a real disconnect, where the customer isn't  well served in mattress stores.  Man, those guys, not only a hundred percent markup, but it is a terrible way to choose  a mattress.  They're the, it's a hard sell experience.  It's a hard mattress experience.  They said we could do it better by selling direct, but they had to solve a problem.  They had to solve a problem.  We're going to make a great mattress, but who's going to buy a mattress without lying  on it?  Well, here's the solution they came up with and I love it.  A hundred day trial.  Casper offers free delivery and painless returns within a hundred days.  You don't have to lie down in the showroom.  Just get that Casper mattress.  Put it on your bed, sleep on it, not for one night or one month, but for a hundred days,  more than three months.  Anytime you say, yeah, it's not right for me.  They'll come and get it.  They'll refund you every penny.  Free shipping and returns in the U.S.  and Canada and now the UK too.  But I, I, I can tell you one of the reasons they can do this because very few people say  no.  I mean, that's, that's the economics of it.  Once you lie in a Casper, you'll say, what have I been missing my whole life?  It combines multiple supportive memory phones for a sleep surface that does the impossible.  It gives you just the right sink.  So your hard bits sink in.  It's soft, but you don't want a soft squishy mattress.  You want a firm mattress to give you back support.  It gives you just the right bounce and the right sink.  And by the way, very important, even in the winter, it's breathable design lets you sleep cool.  You can regulate your temperature through the night.  We know a good night's sleep can change your life.  I am not kidding.  A Casper mattress provides long lasting comfort, long lasting support.  You can buy it easily online.  It's completely risk free.  And by the way, they now have two.  They just introduced the new Casper Wave mattress.  I've been lying on that.  It has a, they call it the natural geometry support system and a new top layer.  And it is even nicer than the original Casper.  So you choose.  You can say $50 towards either by going to casper.com slash twit.  Do use the promo code twit at checkout to save 50 bucks.  Casper.com slash twit with the promo code twit.

They have sponsored some shows that I've done in the past, but I, yeah, I know that  we're just doing like the Casper hour, but seriously, you've got the bed frame, the box  frame, the mattress.  Wait a minute, you even have a Casper bed frame?  I didn't know they made them.  I did, and then I went online and I was like, oh, guess I got to have that too.

Transcript:  While we were gone for the holiday break, right, the day I left, and I feel like it's  old news now, but we haven't talked about it because we've been gone.  The Apple iPhone battery kerfuffle.  Yep.  And I still don't know who's right in this one.  So some Redditor, maybe Micah, you've done, some Redditors pointed out that as soon as  they took their older iPhone, their iPhone 6, their 6S, their 5S or their iPhone SE, as  soon as they put iOS 11 on it, the thing got slow.

Start time: 3021.75
End time: 3025.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it sounds like an urban legend, right?  It sounds like, oh, it's getting slower because they want me to buy a new one.

Start time: 3025.20
End time: 3099.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I've heard this so many times and I've always pooh-poohed it.  Even Steve Gibson said this.  I said, no, Steve, it's not slower.  Yes, it is.  It turns out it is.  Apple finally copped to it, said, well, here's why we do this.  And actually, I'm inclined to believe him.  The problem is that as the battery, it's not the phone that's old, it's the battery that's  old.  And as the battery gets old, it can't reach the peaks of performance it needs to.  In fact, the phone might crash if the battery is taxed.  So what Apple did in the new operating system is it checks the state of the battery.  And if it's an older battery, and by the way, we don't know what that means, checks the  state.  It could just check the date or it could see what capacity.  We don't know.  Apple's not saying.  But for whatever reason, it decides that's an older battery, it limits performance peaks.  It doesn't let the processor demand as much power because Apple's position, if you buy  all this is, well, we'd rather you have a phone that works than a phone that crashes.  Now, it gets complicated because Samsung, Motorola, HTC, and LG, who make very nice  Android phones, all said, well, we don't do that.  Micah, do you think that those phones crash more because of it?

Start time: 3101.08
End time: 3120.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there's been some interesting stories lately, too, with other companies where they  are apparently or at least it was said that they are limiting different apps performance  except for their own key apps.  And so in a way, they're also sort of of Samsung because they would check if a benchmark was

Start time: 3128.56
End time: 3142.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is such a complicated thing on many levels.  And I have to go back to a little bit of what we were talking about before with the job  of us as sort of tech know how people in our families and among our friendships.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 3149.00
End time: 3174.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was one of those things where I like in the stand in for for Apple among my family.  Sometimes something goes wrong.  They always are mad at me about it.  But like this was so frustrating because this was a situation where so many people got to  say, I told you so.  And as right.  Exactly.  And I'd like you don't you know, you want to be bigger than that.  But frankly, I'm not.  And so hearing I told you so kind of stinks.  And yeah, I told you so.

Start time: 3175.00

Transcript:  Also, here's the thing.  We have been so you have probably all have have a washing machine.  Right.  And if the washing machine breaks after five years, actually, Mike goes down to the river

Transcript:  But the rest of us who live in civilization.  Right.  So, you know, after a certain number of years, any mechanical device that any of us owns  will break and we will be told, oh, well, you know, that's how it is.  Seven years.  That's about how long they last.  And to be fair, there are real practical reasons for that.  Bands wear out.  You know, the different pieces, the mechanics wear out.

Start time: 3213.28
End time: 3217.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  However, when we the difference between buying a washing machine and buying it in the year  2018 and buying a mobile device is that, you know, we've got we've got crazy malware.  We have we have Spectre out there.  Right.  We have meltdown.  So we are now being told that we must update.  Otherwise, we face problems.  However, you know, once we update, we may see that there are challenges on the other  end.  When we purchase a phone, we are consumers or under the the misnomer that we own the device.  Right.  And all we've really done is purchased the ability to use the device.  But we don't have full agency over that device as we do the other things in our lives.

Start time: 3263.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the world was not always that way.  It has been that way traditionally with the beginning of telephones.  Right. Because in the early days of phones, you didn't own the phone from Dell.  You know, you you you didn't buy it the way that you do now.  But we should probably be asking ourselves where consumers are monetized in all these  different ways.  And, you know, we're basically paying for access with our mobile devices and then being  forced to turn them in and buy new ones, even though they work pretty well.  And we're still being monetized as part of the process because our information is being  used and parsed and, you know, used in different ways.  So I I don't know. I should.

Start time: 3314.10
End time: 3330.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, I mean, one. So, a, the question is, is Apple's explanation credible or are they doing  it as everybody has always suspected just to force you to buy a new phone?  That would be question one. Where do you come down on that?

Start time: 3330.30
End time: 3350.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's actually not that black and white.  It's a fine line between between we want you to.  I mean, clearly, Apple wants you to upgrade.  I mean, Apple is the kind of company where they want you to buy Apple accessories.  They want you to buy a laptop every two years.  They want you to buy an iPhone every year.  They want you to frankly, they make it very attractive to just automatically get the new

Start time: 3351.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  iPhone every year by paying them 30 bucks a month or whatever.

Start time: 3355.72
End time: 3366.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. So to know if you're if you're guzzling the Kool-Aid inside Apple, which they all are,  the idea that you would go two years or three years without upgrading your phone, you must be not.  That's the salient point. They don't even understand the issue.

Start time: 3368.00
End time: 3373.98

Transcript:  What Mike just said, because this is we are starting to finally see the sales of smartphones, smartphones plateau.  Right. For the first time, they're not saturation.  That's right. And by my modeling, so my job again is to use data to figure out what's coming.  I would say that 2018 is the beginning of the end of smartphones.

Start time: 3400.89

Transcript:  I mean, wearables. So the next.  So wearables. You know, if you think of where we started this for a while, Mike.  So where we started was a landline that became a series of devices, a PDA, a pager.  Right. And then finally, you know, over many, many, many years, many of these devices converged and we're all now carrying a smartphone rather than, you know, a cell phone and a digital camera and MP3 player and all those other things.  So the funnel is now going in the other direction as we adopt all of these new, more advanced technologies.  And eventually, many years from now, decade from now, we'll see a second area of convergence, which will probably be some kind of thing that we wear over our eyes combined with a hearable device and probably a ring or a wristlet for the time being.

Start time: 3506.30
End time: 3517.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3529.72
End time: 3585.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And so whether or not this is commercially successful, a la the original iPhone, we still don't know.  But what we do know is that I would argue OEMs and the company, you know, I think that our smartphone makers are probably concerned.  And if they're not yet concerned, they should be because they're going to have to, you know, transform, you know, 10 years from now are smart.  These stupid iPhones that we're all talking about and, you know, Samsung and everything else are going to look a lot like this flip phones of today.  People will see a few people will still have them, but everybody else will have moved on to something else.  Wow. Apple's filed a ton of patents for wearable various different wearable devices.  You know, so it's possible that what's happening, I think with the updates and the batteries, part of it may be a hardware flaw, but part of it may just be, you know, monetizing as quickly as possible before we enter this next phase.

Start time: 3587.10
End time: 3636.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This, by the way, this this I probably should have made this a higher up story.  This Magic Leap One creator edition is open.  It's a huge deal because, well, frankly, many of us, including myself, speculated they had nothing or that they weren't able to do what they had thought they were going to be able to do.  And who knows what compromises this creators additional have.  And if it's anything like HoloLens or the early Oculus versions, they'll, you know, it will not be ready for prime time.  That's probably why it's a creators edition.  Of course, that's a great look.  And you look like an idiot.  But I think Amy, you will say, well, you probably, you know, you look like an idiot now.  You just used to it.  I'm used to looking like an idiot.  You are a Google.  You are you are a glass hole in the early days.

Start time: 3636.02

Transcript:  The strangest thing we're going to see in five years is people are going to be sitting at their desks with stuff like that, like obtrusive, goofy looking things.  And they have amazing things happening on their desk.  It's going to be a beautiful experience.  They're going to look like idiots, but it's going to be an amazing experience.  The other thing is happening.  Are we going to call them Leap Holes?  I hope so.

Start time: 3708.44
End time: 3710.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am uncomfortable just hearing that.

Start time: 3713.50
End time: 3758.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the other thing that's happening is that there are all kinds of there's all kinds of technology being developed for the lenses that will enable pretty ordinary looking glasses like Amy's glasses.  Those glasses look like Amy's glasses in three, four, five, six years that provide a light version of that sort of mixed reality.  So this isn't what you look like.  You look like Amy.  And this is the thing.  It's a card.  I know that it's hard for people to to grasp what Amy was saying, which is that which is that the iPhone 10 will seem so dated and old fashioned and dull.  And the thing that will make it seem so dull is once you have things floating in front of you, information flying in and out, staring at this tiny little screen is going to be awful.  It's going to be awful.  Now, let me take this one step further.

Start time: 3759.29
End time: 3849.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK.  So, again, so like my my job is to figure out what all this means.  So it's likely that we will be some some of it will be glasses.  There's retinal projection.  So it looks like I like that better.  It it has problems.  But now here's the rub.  The rub is that humans have not evolved biologically as quickly as all of the technology in our lives.  And we've come a long way.  But our eyes were never designed to see close biologically and neurologically.  Our eyes were designed to look far away.  So the challenge is the technology will work and we'll be able to see magical things out of the technology.  But our eyes are not going to be willing to cooperate, which tells us that we're probably going to have more and more ocular problems going forward.  So kind of like the interesting, weird piece of this is that isn't near sightedness a relatively recent phenomenon because of reading so much.  That's right. And so this actually presents a potential challenge for Warby Parker.  So in a weird way, the advent like the death of the smartphone and the advent of smart glasses poses a problem for Warby Parker because Warby Parker's business model is predicated on the idea that you go to an optometrist or an ophthalmologist.  You get your prescription and then send it to them.  Our prescriptions and just the lens makeup are probably going to look totally, they're going to need to be totally different in a relatively short amount of time.

Start time: 3850.82
End time: 3860.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you want to hear something really interesting? Warby Parker has announced a new iOS app that will do your prescription at home.

Start time: 3861.79
End time: 3864.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's terrible. Let me just put a plug in. My husband is my doctor.

Start time: 3864.48
End time: 3867.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So he probably hates this idea.

Start time: 3867.22
End time: 3897.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yes, but here's the bigger issue.  There's a whole host of eye related problems that we now that that younger people especially have because the amount of time we spend in front of our screens.  So the refraction that Warby Parker, you know, that an app does only tells you what the lens strengths should be.  What it doesn't tell you is, do you have early macular degeneration?  Do you have a swollen optic nerve?  Like there are all these other issues that you can only find out about if you have somebody looking into your eye.  Anyhow, tension.

Start time: 3899.20
End time: 3954.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, of course.  And Warby says this is only good for distance.  It won't work for reading glasses.  It won't work for progressive lenses.  This is not it.  This is an app that came out within the fall that measures your face so the glasses will fit using the iPhone 10 face camera.  But there's a new app and I learned about it actually on the app store on Apple.  I don't have a website so I can't show you.  But basically the new app you do this where you get the app on your phone.  You you need your computer.  You put you put the QR code on the computer to the phone.  Then you walk back 12 feet and the computer will tell you when to stop.  And then it does an eye test.  And then it prescribes for forty dollars glasses that you then buy from Warby Parker and they send them to you.  And I'm sure it's driving your husband nuts because you're right.  It's not doing a glaucoma test.  It's not working for a stigmatism.  It's all sorts of medical.  Yeah.

Start time: 3955.08
End time: 3989.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I mean, but again, this is another my point is my concern is that as more of these interesting whiz bang things come online,  what they are essentially doing is training us that we need to be less plugged in.  And if you stop and think for a minute, you know, you can't not go to your eye.  You can't not go to a dentist.  You can't not go to an eye doctor.  You can't.  There's an app for that.  There's an app for that.  I can't wait for the home dentistry kit.  The thing that broke me at CS last year was an AI powered toothbrush.  Oh, Lord.

The dentist is looking to see if early mouth cancer is a lot of stuff going on.  So it's nice that machines can make some decisions for us, but we have to continue to stay plugged in.  And, you know, we humans can't take ourselves out of the out of the loop because there's a cool new app with a QR code.  I, you know, I know.

Start time: 4016.84
End time: 4049.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then to get back to your earlier point, which is we saw this, by the way, with virtual reality.  It's one of the things I think it's holding virtual reality back is the human biology is not adapted to even virtual reality, let alone augmented reality.  And there's a different like a VR.  You've got a problem because you've got a convergence distance and a focal distance and they don't match.  And your body thinks you ate bad mushrooms and you throw up.  And that's I think it's kind of a lasting problem for VR.  It's one of the things is I don't think VR is going to take off partly because of this, just physiologically.

Start time: 4050.16
End time: 4058.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There are a lot of people who are still affected by it, regardless of like even even as it gets more and more precise and more accurate and higher quality.  It will never get good enough.

Start time: 4059.10
End time: 4103.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  Even though Oculus was always saying, oh, no, we just got to get the frame rate up or no, we just got to get better screens or whatever.  No, it's a it's a physical.  I don't know, Amy, what your husband thinks about this, but it's a physiological problem because you have two methods of focusing.  And if they don't match because your eyes are converging on something that's inches from your face, but your head is telling you you're focusing on something 10 feet away.  If those don't match, your body says, no, no, no, I'm hallucinating.  This is not good.  And part of the Air Force, 11 percent of the population because they've been doing have will suffer from simulation sickness.  The Air Force's recommendation is after you use a simulator for an hour, you shouldn't drive for 24 because you'll be completely disoriented if you're one of these people.  That seems to me a game showstopper.

Start time: 4107.10
End time: 4130.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And so, again, just because the technology has advanced doesn't mean that our bodies have advanced along with it.  And so one of the big problems, and this is not true of Magic Leap, but it's true of a lot of other companies that are working on curable and wearable devices.  They may have a doctor who's part of the team sort of in name, but they're not really thinking through the implications of what they're developing now.

Start time: 4130.14

Transcript:  That's right. So, you know, but once we are all wearing I wear I've had glasses since I was four years old.  So, you know, once you're wearing progressives, which I do, you know, for me, when I had Google Glass, I had a hard time making that adjustment.  And my husband was one of the first people in the country to write prescriptions for Google Glass.  How many now ask me how many people came in asking for them?  How many? Zero. Yeah. Not a single person.  Once we have our overlays and retinal projections and some of these other things, you know, again, it's going to be cool, but it's going to wind up.  We're going to wind up with more eye problems.

Blind, no, but we are already dealing with eye strain.  Most people already deal with eye strain and we've just sort of learned to live with it because I have terrible eyes and that's from reading too much.  That's right.

If you've got glasses that are built in with all the augmented reality stuff, they're also blue light filtering.  They're also providing a little bit of magnification.

Transcript:  So the convergence that we're heading towards in the death of smartphones, birth of whatever's next, right, is devices that we wear.  And again, we always put the technology ahead of the intersection of that technology and our biology.  So the fact that the glass, the AR glasses or the retinal projection works, we cannot disaggregate from how does it work with our biology?  And I would say the same question applies to hearables, right?  So there are all these different Bluetooth earphones coming to market that do more than play music and that also double as virtual assistants.  So the question is, how does that augment and change our hearing?  In the case of hearing, that may actually mean that there are no more hearing aids.  Like the primary companies that create hearing aids, which is a very lucrative market and there's an entire medical field that may go away.

Transcript:  But I was really disappointed, frankly, when I bought hearing aids, because I thought it would make music sound better and they don't.  They're not. They're optimized for voice.  Music sounds crappy.  And so if I got a pair of AirPods that, by the way, amplified voice, but also gave me full frequency hearing across the spectrum, that would be far better.

Start time: 4545.30

Well, you I don't I think the choice is pretty binary.  Either you have an assistant that listens to you and responds to you and privacy be damned or you don't.  I mean, what's the what's the interval?  I also think that to a very large extent that these are just solvable problems in terms of this privacy implications of things that are listening.

Yeah, you can you can solve that problem if there's will in the public.  If the public insists that their privacy, which they may not, then then the industry can can make that happen.  But I wanted to raise a really fun issue that Amy brought up this idea that the digital world is a place where people can have a lot of fun.  And our biology or IDNA doesn't advance along with it.  And so it's always being confronted by these biologically incompatible technologies.  But there's also the psychological incompatibility.  So I wrote a column some time ago just exploring the theme that the psychological impact of mixed reality is going to be pretty much the same as the psychological impact of mixed reality.  I wrote a column some time ago just exploring the theme that the psychological impact of mixed reality is going to be kind of kind of crazy because since the beginning of time, human beings have always thought that the believe in volcano gods and their ghosts inhabiting everything and spirits and angels and all this kind of stuff.  We always believe this stuff and lots and lots of people still believe in those kinds of things.  Many of us don't.  But when we're wearing augmented reality glasses all the time, we'll be able to essentially subscribe to different services or get access to all kinds of stuff.  And there will be geo located virtual objects in our environment everywhere.  So, for example, there'll be children like 10, 15 years.  I predict there'll be children's versions of augmented reality glasses where kids go walk around and Mickey Mouse is walking down the street.  And they're having this fairyland.  How long from now?  That'll be next year.

But basically, right now, if somebody dies in a car accident, for example, the family or loved ones will build a little shrine, flowers and stuff at the roadside to commemorate that person.  I believe that in the future, the companies and virtual shrines, virtual shrines.  So the hologram of the person will be so you'll come to the studio and I'll be floating there.  Well, I wish you a great health for many decades to come.  But there's actually a Japanese company that already does this.  They put it at the grave site of hologram of the deceased.  And in what way is that not a ghost?  In what way is that?  That's a ghost.  Psychologically, it's a ghost.  And so I don't think we're psychologically ready for augmented reality either.

They can forecast the future of whatever they want.  I had a group that forecast the future of dating using VR and mixed reality.  And part of the job was to figure out the technology over the next 10 years, which was totally plausible.  But Mike, you're on to something because we started cycling through all of these scenarios in which it totally makes sense to go out on your first date in a virtual reality, virtual environment.  Saves time.  It broadens your dating pool from your local community to the world.  Right.  But then they described all of these, I think, plausible scenarios in which it becomes easy, more convenient, better to to make sense of the world.  Better to date in a virtual environment.

But but that also changes our expectations of how we interact with other people.  If essentially we are not the general public isn't going to buy and use one of these things.

So there was there was a lot that they were the world leaders in.  And to be fair, they're probably I wouldn't say that they are the world leaders when it comes to  mobile technology, but they are rolling out 5G.

There's not a lot of foreigners who live there.  I was an anomaly at that time.  You know, so and there are some, you know, the work ethic is very, very, very strong.  So it's not unusual for people, you know, now to be not married.  They don't really have the social structures set up for, you know, Tinder and J-Date.  And I'll also note that the word privacy in Japan didn't exist until the Internet age and they had to import it.  And it's a loan word, Puraibashi.  Like, that's the word in Japanese privacy.  So it's a very, very interesting place.  But the sex robots, you know, part of that is definitely coming out of Japan.  What a world we live in.

Transcript:  Meanwhile, I should do a bunch of ads because we're way behind.  Let me talk about Rocket Mortgage very quickly.  This episode brought to you by those good folks at Quicken Loans.  We're actually, we're talking.  What is the relationship of Intuit's Quicken to Quicken Loans?  And what I found out was in 1999, Intuit, makers of Quicken, bought a company, I think  it was called Rock, that they renamed Quicken Loans.  And then three years later, Dan Gilbert, who is still the CEO of Quicken Loans, bought  it back.  So, they were only, in 2002, so they were only related to Quicken, but they have the  name and the name is a good name.  So, just so you understand, but really it's the genius of Dan Gilbert, who was an amazing  fellow.  They're in Detroit.  They're revitalizing downtown Detroit.  This guy is a technologist.  They have become very rapidly, one of the top lenders.  I think they're the number two lender right after that big bank with the stagecoach in  America, $92 billion in home loans.  They are number one in customer satisfaction.  Look at this, eight consecutive years, number one from JD Power.  And that's in mortgage origination, number one for four consecutive years.  They just got it in 2017 for both categories.  Number one for four consecutive years in mortgage servicing.  So, they're a great lender.  And Dan is so technically sophisticated.  I love it because he said, you know what?  We need a technological revolution in the loan business.  And they created Rocket Mortgage.  And the reason they buy ads on this show is because they know you people would love to  know, I don't know what Bigfoot's doing on their website, but you people who listen to  this show do not want to go to a bank, put on a suit and tie, go to a bank, fill out  forms, watch a guy with a calculator and a sheaf of loan information, pick a loan for  him, and then go home and go through the attic and find bank statements and pay.  We don't want to do that.  We just, we got a computer.  What do I need that for?  So, they created Rocket Mortgage.  You could do it on your phone.  You can do it.  You could literally be at an open house and say, out of nowhere, I want to buy this house.  Go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit2.  That's the URL.  So, they know you heard it here.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twit2.  And in a minute or two, you can tell them some basic information that's already in your  head.  You don't have to go find anything.  They have trusted relationships with all the financial institutions.  So, they get the other information they need.  They crunch the numbers while you're there holding the phone right in front of you.  And based on income assets and credits, then they say, okay, here's the loans you qualify  for.  You choose the rate.  You choose the term.  You choose the down payment.  You get the loan.  I mean, three minutes later, you're done.  And you get a big button, which I love, which you could show the realtor, I'm approved.  By the way, we want this house.  And that is a huge advantage.  If you're buying a home, take it from me.  If you go there pre-approved for the loan, you're front of the line.  The only person who's going to beat you is somebody who's paying cash.  And you can't beat that, sorry.  But most of the time, that's not a problem.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twit2.  And by the way, good time to refinance.  And they'll do that as well.  Interest rates are only going to go up.  Go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit2.  Apply simply, understand fully, and then mortgage confidently at Rocket Mortgage.  Equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states.  NMLS consumer access dot org number 3030.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twit2.  We thank them so much for their support.  A tip of the hat to Dan, who is one of the smartest guys.

Transcript:  All right.  CES.  Who's going?  Show of hands.  Nobody.  You know, I feel bad saying this because those of us who go and you started, as I did, with  Comdex, by the way, we can thank Comdex for Trump.  What?  Okay, follow this.  I want to hear this.  So Comdex was owned by a guy named Sheldon Adelson.  Right.  Shelley.  In fact, the Comdex awards were called Shelley's.  Remember that?  Yep.  Yep.  Shelley was smart.  He, I think it was 1999, right before the computer bust, said, I'm going to sell Comdex  and sold it.  And of course, it disappeared a couple of years later because it really was the end  of the line for that.  And took the money and invested in casinos in Macau, which made him one of the richest  men in the world.  And he is a big donor, was a big donor to Trump.  And he's a big, one of the reasons that the, in fact, I should have said, thanks to Comdex,  the U.S. Embassy is now in Jerusalem, because that was his, that would really be the direct  connection.  That was his idea.  Anyway, Comdex ended.  Why did it end?  I have no idea.  It was gray.  It was boring.  And there was this thing that went on twice a year called the Consumer Electronics Show  that was kind of sexier.  It was fun.  It was fun.  Yeah.  And I think that's the thing about Comdex, it's not, what did Dell do this year?  And Bill Gates used to give these great keynotes at Comdex, the most boring thing.  But he knew he was boring.  So Bill would always make great videos.  So much fun.  If we could get those videos, you can't because they didn't secure rights for public.  But remember the one with him and Steve Ballmer driving a Volkswagen?  Yes.  Da da da da.  They're driving around and then they see a sun microsystem computer on the curb because  it's a parody of an ad where some college kids see a sofa on the curb and they put it  in the backseat and they're driving around and it smells bad.  They throw it back on the curb.  Da da da da.  It was weird.  But it was a crazy time.  It was a crazy time, man.  It was wild, wild.  Then CES took over.  CES, even bigger, I think, than Comdex.  180,000 I think last year, maybe a quarter of a million soon.  Miles of aisles, thousands of booths.  The big computer guys, Apple's not there, Microsoft stopped going.  Intel, I think, still is there.  Microsoft is there, I think.  They go but they don't have a booth.  So they have people.  They linger.  They linger.

Start time: 5776.48
End time: 5801.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you look around, you can see people.  The other thing that was interesting, Comdex was in multiple halls and the main hall got  less and less interesting and the fun stuff was in the sands.  It had like swarmed across town.  That's right.  All the way across town.  And all the gadgets and things like that and it's weird companies you've never heard of.  It would take you all days to go through the sands alone.  And really, CES is just the stuff of the sands times five.

Transcript:  I would say everybody loves to hate on CES and everybody loves to hate on South By.  And they've gotten big and unwieldy.  But I'm not going this year.  Last year I was there.  You spoke.  And I do.  I spoke.  Here's what I would say.  I didn't see anything individually like the AI toothbrush.  I didn't see anything individually that really wowed me.  However, if you go and you're able to sort of, as you're walking through, force yourself  to make connections.  Well, I've seen this, I've seen this and I've seen this.  That's where the signals are.  That's right.  And I think if you on the ground force yourself to take a bird's eye view, you can actually  glean some pretty decent information out.  And there's always a prototype pavilion that's in a different spot.  But again, if you sort of you'll start to see patterns just forcing yourself to walk  around.

Start time: 5857.76
End time: 5865.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But here's the problem.  That was always the agenda, at least for me and I'm sure for you when you go there is  to say, what's the trend?  What's the story?  Is there an overarching story?

Start time: 5865.68
End time: 5880.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the story is going to be like, oh, bigger TVs or OLED or whatever.  That's actually not the, yes, that's fine.  But what you should try to force yourself to do is what does this imply?  Right.  Right.

Start time: 5880.90
End time: 5890.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Whereas when you don't go, you can use, there's a great site called google.com and you just  search all the news.  How's that spelled?  It's one or two.  Look at this picture.  Look at this picture.

End time: 5938.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Part of the problem just sort of instead of lobby conning, like, you know, google.com  conning if that's such a thing, is you're now relying on everybody else to tell you  what the story was and everybody else is kind of like telling the same story.

I guess what I'm saying is like you should be excited.  You're at CES.  It's exciting.  You'll see, you know, all kinds of cool technology.  You will see a bunch of stuff you've already seen.  You know, Ford will probably have some ridiculously huge mobility booth.

We were in the Sands area and there was this little machine that you could put your because  right now, like on Instagram, you can type in the word nail art and you're going to see  a bunch of stuff, a bunch of videos, a bunch of photos.  I know. And so I thought it would be funny because my colleague I was with, she heard  a nail printer.  Yeah, she bit her nails.  And so she didn't have like longer nails and I don't bite my nails.  So I walked up and I was like, hey, we want to shoot a video of this.  Would it be OK if I try it out?  And there was like a five minute pause while I tried to explain to the woman who was running  the machine that, yes, I am a guy, but I still want to do this because I want to get video  of it.

You know, it's kind of come down now to LCDs, whether they're LED backlit or not.  LCDs and there's the quantum dot LCDs or as OLED, which I like a lot.  OLED. But apparently there's something new.  That's neither of the other one.  Another one. And we've if you go to these every year,  it's been a couple of years since we've had a new one.  But there's there's for a long time, there were these technologies  they'd announce and they couldn't make.  Yeah, so we don't know.  That's just fun. We'll we'll cover it.  Father Roberts down there.  Scott Wilkinson is down there.  Dick Bartolo, the gives was down there.  He always goes to the back alleys and looks for the stuff, the junkie stuff.  We'll have some coverage.  In fact, I think Father Robert is cohosting the new screensavers  with me next Saturday.  So we'll have his his report.

And it's set in the year 2030.  I can probably see.  Will we be able to roll the show up?  Well, so what are the so I'm working on all of the like everyday life stuff.  It's it's Bo Willimon's new show.  Oh, my God. He's the House of Cards guy.  That's right. So he's an amazing.  I like I cannot.  This show is so amazing.  It's called the first and it's going to launch.  It's on Hulu. It is so f***ing good.  But it takes place in the year 30, 20, 30.  And so we were trying to design all the different technologies  that people would be using.  Sean Penn is going to be in it.  Yeah. Yeah. Now, it's it's so, so, so, so good.  The script is the shows are so you like the technology consultant for it.  I am the futurist.  So it's the jet propulsion, the NASA JPL.  And me. So cool.  That's really cool.  Yeah. That roll up technology.  I think one of the directions that we're likely headed in is that,  you know, the sort of big the tablets that we have now  will still have a desire for because we're not going to be able to read newspapers  or the equivalent of a newspaper long form stuff on these glasses.  So probably instead have a smart pen.  Not this, but, you know, pen that rolls  has the ability to roll in and out and becomes more less flexible, right,  to give us the ability to do that kind of reading.  And then make it portable.  So anyhow. I can't.

I don't know about you, Michael, that Apple's explanation covered it  and that maybe they really did want people to upgrade.  But to their credit, they backpedaled quickly.

The total revenue is twenty six and a half billion that went to developers.  Eleven billion to Apple.  It's a lot of money. That's just from the App Store.  It's incredible.  They also knew thanks to the new tax bill,  they're thinking about repatriating their hunt.  They have more than 200 billion overseas.  The new tax rate will get them back into the country for 15 percent.  Apple's thinking about it, which would give them a huge cash windfall.

No, it's in the United States controlled by foreign companies.  Oh, interesting. Owned by Apple.  So the money itself is not overseas.

Yeah, there are deaths, death threats, and he's decided not to go  and blame that as the reason it might be convenient for him.  I would want to show my face in public right now if I were him.  And and yeah, there are always going to be death threats.  It's like, you know, Twitter trolls, you know,  somebody like that is going to get a death threat every five seconds.  On average, it's like I don't think that you necessarily have to.  You have to have security at these events, right?  Prevent maniacs from carrying weapons or whatever.  He's safe there. Yeah.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah. No, actually, Vegas was probably safe.  But you should keep his eye out for this guy.  If anybody anybody, by the way, this is the hacker uniform, a hoodie and a hat.  And he's wearing earbuds.  I don't know who this guy is, but according to  Krebs, Brian Krebs on security 25, he's 25 year old Tyler Raj Beres.  He was arrested on Friday in Los Angeles  because he, according to the police, is being accused of making the SWAT  call. That got a man killed in Kansas.  Oh, geez.  The story is his handle on Twitter was SWATistic.  He admits, in fact, that he's a serial swatter.  He was convicted in 2016 for calling it a bomb threat to an ABC affiliate  in Los Angeles.  The AP said he was sentenced to two years in prison for that,  released in January of last year.  Apparently didn't learn anything.  He's claimed credit for bomb threats against a Dallas Convention Center,  a high school in Florida.  But this one's really beyond the pale.  If he is SWATistic, somebody with the Twitter handle SWATistic  got in a online Twitter battle  over, I guess, gaming and said, you know,  the guy he was he was battling with said, well, he said, I'm going to SWAT you.  He said, OK, sure. Here's my address.  Except it wasn't his address.  It was the random address in Kansas, in Wichita, Kansas.  The police were called.  They were told that it was a domestic violence situation.  One person had already been killed.  The perpetrator was armed in the house.  Police responded.  Now, of course, the police have some culpability here, too.  We don't know exactly what happened.  But apparently an officer walked up to the door and just shot the guy, killed him.  He was not a gamer.  His brother said he never played video games.  He was not the guy. He was just a random victim.  SWATistic says, I didn't do it.  I didn't pull the trigger.  Well, he's in custody now.

Start time: 7472.92
End time: 7484.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Start time: 7501.86
End time: 7519.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know, but Amy, I will say in defense, just let me answer this.  The Internet gets blamed for everything, too.  And it's just that's the way it is.  The the Internet is the world.  The world is a messed up place.  Twitter is to some degree really a reflection of the world we live in.  I don't know what Twitter's supposed to do.

Start time: 7520.56
End time: 7529.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it a reflection of the world that we live in or is it part of a world?  That is it the cause of the current world that we live in?  Does that make sense? No.

Start time: 7530.20
End time: 7533.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, it's both cause and effect.  You're right. I mean, it's both.

Start time: 7533.66
End time: 7589.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To me, the biggest thing about our world that this story exposes  is the militarization of police.  Domestic violence cases, calls like that.  These happen every day across the nation.  And if somebody is completely unarmed, completely innocent,  has nothing to do with the apparent call,  they shouldn't be shot to death in their own house by some mistake or whatever.  So so so the police, I'm sure they'll have a review.  I'm sure police departments all over the country should be thinking about this.  So so that's one issue.  The police will have to deal with that.  The other one is this douchebag with the hat and the earbuds.  They should throw him back in the slammer.  The other but the thing that I want to know is picture again,  in case you run into a street in case you think I'm being unfair.  So the person who gave the wrong address, I think he's got some reckoning.  He's got some capability. Absolutely.

Start time: 7589.66
End time: 7603.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's in jail. That's and I also want to know.  No, he's not in jail. He's the so they were playing call of duty.  And this guy who gave the wrong address was taunted,  swatistic and said, come and swap me, baby.  Let's just do it gave a wrong.  So he's got some capabilities.

Start time: 7603.96
End time: 7613.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. So let's say somebody who I believe is an actual killer,  says they're going to come and kill me and I give my neighbor's address.  Yeah. Like you're not be arrested for.

Start time: 7614.78
End time: 7632.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the question is, should swatistic still have his Twitter account?  Is what he's not even bands.  Well, he was able to tweet the whole thing and his Twitter.  He changed his Twitter address.  He changed it to at swatting account.  So he's not exactly hiding.

Start time: 7633.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What in the world?  It's in Twitter.  Listen, it is in it is in Twitter's and Facebook's best interest  to address this now and to come up with some reasonable way forward,  because if they don't, the government is going to do that for them.  And as much as I don't like what I'm seeing right now on on the socials,  I don't think it makes sense for the government to come in  and regulate what can and can't be done in the United States.  We're already seeing that happen in Europe, in Germany,  and like all around the rest of the world.  And we're we're heading very, very quickly into a splintered Internet,  a series of splinter nets where your geographic boundaries and your ISP  dictate what you can and can't see.  And that to me is more terrifying than being swatted.  We've been swatted.

Start time: 7681.58
End time: 7728.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody swatted our studio.  That's where you call years ago. Right.  Yeah. Call the police and you say there's a murder.  In this case, he said, I just he said, I'm the guy who just shot  my father in the head and I've got four family members hostage.  But it's a little OK.  It's a little shady because according to Krebs reporting,  he called City Hall and then gave his number.  And then City Hall called 911 and the guy one one called the number  to talk to the guy.  And Krebs says that's a little suspicious because, of course,  if he was really local, he would have just called 911. Right. But.  Anyway, it's the same thing happened with us when we were swatted.  It wasn't a 911 call.  It was a call to the police number and then they could spoof the number.  Yeah. You can't call 911 in your region and spoof the number.

Start time: 7733.24
End time: 7806.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the great thing about Petaluma is they didn't come in a giant  armored vehicle with automatic weapons.  They just came and they said, is everything OK?  And we said, yeah.  They said, do you mind if we check for bombs?  And we said, no, they brought a dog.  Actually, they didn't have a dog.  So they they rented a dog.  They called like San Rafael and they brought a dog up.  And they and they and they were there all day.  And they kind of say, yeah, there's no bombs.  And they gave us the recording. That's how it should work.  It was very calm. In this case, at Wichita, the SWAT squad was sent.  The guy who was killed is very sad, has been identified as a 28 year old  father to Andrew Finch and our deep condolences to his family.  Very sad. This is just he was a random victim.  The officer who fired the fatal shot, according to the Wichita Eagle,  is a seven year veteran.  He's on administrative leave.  There will be an internal investigation.  Swatting is dangerous.  And militarized police make it even more dangerous.  Poorly trained police make it even more dangerous.  Nevertheless, you've got to also feel for a cop who's got to go in a situation  where to the best of his knowledge, there's a guy with a gun  has already killed somebody who could very well just shoot him.  So it's a but I think that there probably are ways  to resolve a situation like that. I don't know.  Yeah. So the. You go to Mars.

Each incident costs first responders about ten thousand dollars.  It is a felony.  It is illegal, but it's hard to catch these guys because of numbers.

It's like, oh, this is this is coming out of the dark and ugly world of video  gaming. Well, that's just ridiculous.  Ninety nine point nine nine nine percent of video gamers have nothing to do  with this kind of stuff. They're just playing games.  And so the idea that this is this is a typical example of the type of person  who plays video games is just is just absurd.  And any media that reports this is just but there but there are.

Or maybe it does have a defense.  Maybe it is up to Twitter to do something.  By the way, I forgot to mention it wasn't just death threats.  Ajit Pai received John Kahnstein, who writes for TechCrunch, suggested on Twitter.  You see, Twitter is the problem.  Some tech billionaire, please buy out the local ISP  where FCC chairman Ajit Pai lives and give him 14 for dial up speeds.  That's funny. Look who responded.  Matthew Prince, the CEO of CloudFlare, said, hmm.  You know, John or Josh, I could do this in a different but equally effective way.  Josh says, please go on.  Matthew said, I just sent a note to our general counsel to see  we could do this without breaking any laws.

Transcript:  So, OK, so in the early days of the of broadband, right, we didn't yet have  you could have people looking at this could have built the scenarios  and told you this was coming.  But we didn't yet have mobile devices that that were going to be  ubiquitously connected and we didn't have Twitch.  We didn't have games that that pulled a lot of bandwidth.  And we didn't have this, you know, unbelievable amount of video.  And we didn't have we didn't have 20.  You're right. It's my fault.  And at the very beginning, if everybody remembers, you know,  a lot of people were pretty stoked to have DSR, ADSL. Right.  And, you know, and so there wasn't this rush into broadband.  Well, all of a sudden we have all of these different sources.  The components and the prices have gone down.  So we've got more devices that are connecting and AT&T  and all of the ISPs should have said, we see where this is going.  This is actually an opportunity for us to make more revenue.  We can model out scenarios for how the cable bundling,  which has been subsidizing a lot of this, is probably not going to work  10 years from now.  So let's, you know, build this out in a different way.  And they didn't do that.  And it's because because we have this system set up in the United States  where only certain ISPs and cable providers, you know,  get to dictate the rules for different parts of the country.  And that's fine.  And I'm not begrudging anybody the ability to make a profit.  But we are in a situation.  So the the the rollback of of the net neutrality  regulations does not help the future.  It's only addressing a problem with the status quo.  And the status quo is a moving target.  So we're going to have a different problem.

There were net neutrality rules.  But Verizon sued and said the FCC doesn't have standing to make these rules.  The judge agreed and said, told the FCC in 2015,  now what you really got to do, you would have standing  if you use the Telecommunications Act and invoked Title two and said that ISPs  are carriers, not information services, and that they can be regulated like carriers.  So the so Tom Wheeler, remember, he took a lot of comments.  We got very involved. There were millions of comments.  He was going back and forth and he said, no, you know, you're right.  Title two regulation.  And that's when that regulation was put into place in 2015 and took a while.

So we I am so sick and I'm on a thing now,  but I'm so sick and tired of the people making decisions for our future,  looking only in the rearview mirror, because you know what?

Transcript:  Let's take a break.  One last break, then we'll because this is I.  This is the show that should be an eight hour show.  I don't want to stop. Let's do it.  We could make the longest Twitter just because you guys are so great.  Mike Elgin, Amy Webb, Micah Sargent, fantastic panel.  And as always, Amy, you bring you bring the thunder.  I really seriously, I really appreciate that point of view is of well,  we should not be planning for it. We should not be reactive.  We need to be proactive. That's what you're saying, right?  You have to think about the future. What's going to happen?  All right. Before we do that, there is a solution to your bad Wi-Fi  and that is Eero. And I have to say it is a great solution.  I know because I have Eero at home and I got the new Eero system.  I had originally, I bought the early 2016 Eero 1.  And over time they learned from hundreds of thousands of systems.  And so the Eero got smarter and faster.  Then they released the second generation Eero and the Eero beacon,  tri-band, five to five G's and a 2.4 gigahertz. The beacon's great.  You plug it into the wall and it just extends your Wi-Fi throughout the house.  But I love it because I gave my old Eero to my mom.  So she's got great Wi-Fi now. The new Eero's are,  don't listen to this mom, the new Eero's elegant,  even more elegant, better range, twice the speed,  because they have the third radio.  And now they have a thread radio in the new Eero's, which is the low power.  I think that's a Google technology, right?  Low power radio for locks, doorbells, other sensors.  So it's got IOT compatibility and it's easy.  Every Eero unit is about 1500 square feet,  but as you grow or you find more problems like upstairs, downstairs, backyard,  you can expand your coverage, just plug in another Eero beacon and boom,  another 1500 square feet. You can have as many as you want.  And I should show you the Eero interface because what's great is because mom's  using Eero and I'm using Eero. I can look at my network and it says,  everything looks good. 37 connected devices.  I know. And I see my bandwidth 119 down, 24 up.  But, and by the way, one of the best things is the family profiles.  So I've assigned to each member of our household, the devices,  including our 15 year old, I can turn on safe filters for him.  So safe search, content filtering, that kind of thing.  Safe search is turned on throughout the house to keep viruses and malware at bay.  But also look at this pause button.  I can pause Michael's internet anytime. I can even say to my Echo,  I can say Echo pause Michael's internet and it goes off and I hear the scream.  There's a lot of power. And notice I have a schedule.  So every evening at 10 PM,  internet goes down as it should. Michael goes to bed.  And in the morning it starts back up at 7 AM.  I let him do it go a little later on weekends. That's all the Eero software.  It's all built in. That's Eero plus, but let's go to, let's switch networks.  Let's go to mom's network. I can go to mom's network now and I can see if she says,  Hey, I'm having trouble. I can see the devices.  She's got five cause we put her out in the backyard too.  She's only got eight connected devices though. It's a little bit less.  I could put her in the bag. No, she's got a studio.  That was the problem we solved with the Eero. I just love these.  Free overnight shipping to the US or Canada with our offer code,  twit at E E R O dot com.  Select overnight shipping and enter twit to make it free as the offer code.  It's E E R O dot com offer code twit.  I had a call on the radio show guy had a kind of old traditional very good router.  Uh, but he said, but I, I,  I can't get my Wemos working because there's congestion. And I said, well,  you have two choices. You can download insider.  You can analyze what's using what channels you can manually assign channels.  The Wemo won't let you do that. So you can say, well, Wemo, you own it.  And we're going to move you.  You can do all this and maybe it'll work cause I've done all this many,  many times or you could just go get an Eero solves all of those problems.  E E R O dot com. Don't forget the offer code.  Twit and we thank not only thank Eero for their support,  but thank him for making wifi work in my house.  Yeah. Tied to let mom in from the backyard. All right.  Did we miss any big stories? We look forward to a CES.  We'll have lots of CES news next week. Uh, the week following or no,  I guess two weeks later, there's a mobile world Congress in Barcelona.  Your favorite city in the whole wide world.  Go for the harmonic. Barakos stay for the galaxy. S nine. That's where,  that's probably the tagline. That's the whole show. Yeah.  That's probably where Samsung will announce, uh, interesting leaks. They,  they, they, they, they, they're tagline camera, the camera reimagined.  So really the battle lines on these smart phones, at least for now,  is all about the cameras, isn't it? Yeah.  And I have to say using the pixel to Excel best hands down the best camera,  even with one lens. Um,  but I'll be very interested because Samsung does amazing, uh, stuff. Uh,  Oh, here's, I gotta mention this cause I kind of got it wrong yesterday on the  radio show. I said, Oh, don't worry.  Border searches of devices are going down. No, they're not going way up.  They're going way up.  Let me sign into the wall street journal so that I can read this cause it's  behind a paywall. Thank you. Oh, I can't cause my, nevermind. I can, I can,  but wall street. I can remember. I think the story cause I read it.  They say that, um,  the government in the year 20 search 13 fiscal year, which ended September 30th.  That's why we have the numbers so soon. Search 30,000 devices,  mostly as they were going out of the country, not going in, which is weird.  Uh, the vast majority leaving the country.  Why does customers and border patrol search devices going out?  In case you're smuggling bits.  I've never been stopped by them going out. The TSA stops you.  This was 30,000 is up from the year before 19,000. So big jump,  but they say that only 20% belong to the U S citizens.  That by my, my, my calculation means 6,000 devices were searched.  Is that something that could be concerned if you're a U S citizen?  80% were foreigners or foreign nationals.

Start time: 8691.24
End time: 8716.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they're allowed to do that. The ACLU says they're allowed to do that,  but they're not, uh,  they're not allowed to access your device to say what's your password.  And customs and border patrol did announce a new policy.  They won't look at your cloud information.  They can look at what's on your device, which the ACLU disputes.

So somebody called the radio show yesterday and said, well,  what should I do? And I said, well, the odds are you won't be  inspected. I've gone to another country. You have too many times.  It's never been, never been stopped. Never anything. In fact, mostly it's just like,  hi, come on, welcome in. Right. Uh, cause we're not Brown.

ACLU says, no,  say no, and then call us and we'll send a lawyer down. But wait,  we know they'll do is they'll say, until you let us, you're not leaving.  You're an airport jail. Right. Good luck. Have fun. Uh,  so you might, if you want to go home or get on your flight, you might say, well,  okay. But if they, but then this is what the guy asks. Okay.  So they take my phone and they take it to another room.  What do I do when I get it back? And I said, well, really to be prudent,  you throw the phone away. That's a thousand dollar iPhone out the door.  Yeah.  So do you never take your, uh, expensive phones and computers with you?  You take it with you, right? I do. I take, I take all my expensive stuff with me.

Transcript:  And, um, you know, you just have to, um, uh,  decide in advance if you're really concerned about this, you have to think,  okay, what's on my device? What can I take off the device before I travel?  Here's the problem. Another device I could carry instead. Here's the problem.

Start time: 8847.08
End time: 8866.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like one password has a flight, you know, flight setting, right?  Where it erases anything that you don't think is absolutely necessary.  And then when you get home, you re-sync. So your passwords aren't on your device,  but that's not the problem. The problem is if they take the phone, yes,  they can get everything that's on the phone,  but they can also put a Trojan horse on your phone.  They could put something on your phone or your computer and there's no way to  really know.

Start time: 8868.56
End time: 8928.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean that's, that's the, that's a potential risk, but I think the,  the larger issue is the constitutional question,  which really hasn't been fully resolved.  Two other things about this before we get into that though,  is that they say that one of the reasons is to combat this.  They give three reasons why they're searching it. Combat terrorism. Okay,  fine. Child pornography and visa fraud.  The child pornography thing always, it always comes up. Yeah, right.  Cause if you ever want to do something that sounds unpopular,  nobody wants to defend child pornography.  Exactly. Are they concerned that child pornography is being smuggled on phones  and laptops? I mean it's, it's, it's going over the, whatever,  the dark web or whatever. Right. Who knows?  The other thing is that they said that the main reason for the wild increase,  and I thought this was surprising, is that people are carrying more devices.  So individual passengers on average have a larger number of devices and that's  why they're searching more.

Start time: 8928.42
End time: 8931.26

Start time: 8940.90
End time: 8957.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But the number from the government is the government searched the devices of  30,200 people. They didn't say how many devices they said,  30,000 people, which is up from 19,000 people.  So they can say more devices. That's just pay no attention.

Start time: 8958.16
End time: 8961.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I guess they're not telling us how many actual devices. The EFF,

Start time: 8962.00
End time: 9013.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just so you know, EFF and the ACLU and last fall sued on behalf of 11 travelers  challenging the department of Homeland security on these,  what they claim are unlawful searches.  The plaintiffs include 10 US citizens and one lawful permanent resident,  including a military veteran, journalists, students,  an artist, a NASA engineer and a business owner.  Several are Muslims or people of color.  All were reentering the country from business or personal travel.  When border officers searched their devices,  they were not accused of any wrongdoing afterwards.  Officers also confiscated and kept the devices of several plaintiffs for weeks  or months. And this was filed in September.  The DHS has held one plaintiff's device again, not accused of wrongdoing afterwards.  They've held it since January. They had it for nine months.

Transcript:  Here's, listen, the, the,  there is always going to be a tension between law enforcement, which wants,  and to their, it makes perfect sense, right? They want,  they want as much access as they can possibly get for all,  you know, plausible and reasonably good reasons.  And as individuals, we, we don't want that access to happen,  but here's the problem. The problem is how are you going to scale this? Right.  So unless we just don't allow people to come into the United States anymore,  we're going to have more gadgets over the next 10 years, not less.  So just pulling everybody aside and forcing everybody, you know,  as we enter the world of hearables and wearables and all these different  devices, this search and seizures is totally impractical.  And you know, there are lots of countries,  the planet that have worse problems than we do.

And if we want to get serious about,  you know, if we,  if we actually want to implement what a lot of these rules were set up to do,  then just, you know,  stopping people of color and demanding to see their devices is,  is actually not the best way.

One, one thing you can do though, if you have,  if you don't want to unlock your phone,  just turn it off and then the first time you boot your phone,  at least for an iPhone, you have to get in a passcode,  which is a constitutionally protected speech.
