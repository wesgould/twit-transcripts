Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You went everywhere.  I hardly went any everywhere, but I did go to, to visit a cork forest.  Well, in Spain, no Portugal, where the real, where the good courts come from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good courts.  You know, I had the nouveau Beaujolais for Thanksgiving this year for the first  time ever.  It came in a plastic bottle, like a water bottle, not just a twist cap, but a  water bottle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounds like the closer to the real deal.  Really?  Well, I mean, originally when nouveau Beaujolais, the first time I ever had.  It's the soda pop of wine.  Yeah.  It's basically just, you know, for right out of the fermenter and bottle and it's  supposed to be, you know, just a thing you can drink for a few months and then,  you know, people make it in a lot of different styles, but generally  speaking, it's a, it's a soda pop style wine and it could be in a can, but I  mean, it used to be like a buck 50 for a bottle of the stuff and it was, you know,  it's cheap.  Quaff.  That was called a quaffer.  And nowadays, you know, they've gotten, so it's, it's, but you can get a good  bottle of Bordeaux for less money than you pay for this stuff.  It's just very, it became very trendy and kind of ridiculous.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also here, Andrew Horowitz, the disciplined investor.  He has, he's disciplined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good.  Cause I need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does that mean you have stripes?  I'll give you some.  I'll give you some.  And the lady who needs discipline, ladies and gentlemen in studio with us.  So glad to have her back.  Ms. Sarah Lane.  From sarahlane.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we are here to gather together today to talk about the latest tech news from  all around the world.  The shuttle just landed successfully.  The Endeavor pleased.  Do you like space flight?  Sarah, you're the youngest one here.  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now here's the deal.  I get asked a lot.  For some reason, you know, it's a really popular question.  If you had the chance to go up into a space shuttle, would you?  Would you?  My answer is no.  You're not the kind.  The reason my answer is no is because, um, I know that as soon as I started to see  earth fade into the distance, I'd be like, oh, I gotta go.  I would do it in a minute.  I'm the only one.  I'm probably the only one.  I turned down the blue angels though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't go up in the blue angels.  Remember that?  And Patrick went up and passed out.  I didn't want to do that.  You know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm afraid they just try to make those guys, they'd go out of their way to make  us sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're macho and I didn't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to make them sign a document saying, look, you guys aren't going to try  to make me, I just want to ride.  I don't want to get sick.  They won't sign the document.  They think it's so hilarious.  Oh, look, it is another room.  We made him sick and made him throw up into his mask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We had video.  I'd love to find that video of Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember passing out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If Patrick's passed now, I am not going up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John C.  DeVorek, would you go in the shuttle?  Would you be a space tourist?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you what.  I mean, I would like, I think it's a cool idea.  Something I'd like to do except for the one thing.  When we were at ZDTV, they had a, they did a bunch of promotions with that spacesuit  that they let us get into.  Yeah.  I just was so, I just hated it.  I mean, I was so claustrophobic in that spacesuit that I don't think, I mean, it  was unbelievable and I'm not claustrophobic person, but that thing was freaky.  I just hated being in the thing and it was like you're locked in and it's blowing air  into your face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the most fun promotion we ever did.  Do you remember that?  We were, we were supposed to be in space in the suits and we were going like that.  And then they were blue screen behind us space.  It was, it didn't come out as well as it seemed like it was going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's because it was produced by boneheads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, but it was fun doing it.  And I didn't feel claustrophobic.  How about you, Andrew Horowitz?  Are you, would you like to go on the vomit comet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I, it hasn't been something that I've really thought about saying, you know, this  is just something I have to do.  But I suppose that for a quick day or so, I'd be, I'd welcome the opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The reason I raise this, besides the fact that the Endeavor came down safely, I'm  excited about space and I'm a little disappointed.  The transition team is asking the space agency to quantify how much money could be  saved by canceling the Ares-1 rocket and scaling back the Orion crew exploration  vehicle next year.  He, Obama pledged to spend $2 billion on NASA as part of his campaign.  Boy, I, I really would be disappointed if he scaled back NASA.  I know we're in tough times and it's not expensive.  $2 billion is nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what's $2 billion these days?  $2 billion?  And I mean, what?  That's a day's worth of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not even enough to bail out Citibank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Yeah, $2 billion.  Spend the money.  It's, you know, somebody once told me the cost of NASA is less than the amount we  spend on pizza in this country every year.  Now that may have changed, but which is more important?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know if that's, is that, is that going to be politically correct with  people having trouble staying at home?  I guess that's why they're doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that, but it's such a small amount of money.  Relatively.  And this is what keeps people, keeps their, it keeps them aiming for the stars  figuratively and literally.  It keeps you, you know, it gives you, it gives it's the spirit of America.  Gosh, darn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that these, I hate to point the finger at anybody, but I think that a lot  of these celebrity joy writers who are making a mockery of the whole space  program at all, well him and there's also, you know, our friends of Charles up  in that Microsoft, up twice and I was going to go up twice.  I don't know if he's been up a second time or not, but this kind of thing.  You know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dyson is on the training team.  She hasn't yet been approved.  She's in, she's in, uh, what do they call the, uh, the Russian, they have a great  name for it, the Russian space center.  She's getting trained right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The point is, is that I think it sends the wrong message.  It's not, it's, it trivializes and marginalizes and maybe you're right.  The whole thing, because it looks like it's just a bunch of rich clowns, you  know, they're just, you know, taking joy rides, star city, star city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's it.  Don't you love that name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am going to star city going to be a cosmonaut.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I cannot wait.  Yeah.  This is a Cosmodrome.  Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cosmodrome.  It's star city.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In beautiful Kazakhstan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh, all right.  Well, anyway, I just, something to be aware of.  I think people who listen to this show probably love space and we should all  gather together and point out the 2 billion ain't nothing compared to, uh,  well, yeah, one bailout.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One bailout, one bailout for what?  That's about a, a, a, a, a hundredth of a bailout these days.  That's lunch for the Lehman executives.  Yeah, that's, that's, that's, you know, that's just getting started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Explain to me this, Mr.  Andrew Horowitz, MIG money, finance year type.  Why is Carl Icahn buying more Yahoo shares?  He bought 7 million more shares, something like $9 92 cents.  He's now got to five and a half percent of the company.  Is this the right time to buy Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The news is fascinating tonight.  I don't know if you've been watching it.  First of all, you know, you got to wonder with, with, with a guy like Icahn  doubling down, which has always been the worst thing possibly to do.  And the timing of it, you have to look at being kind of questionable, even  though the stock is down in price.  But what's interesting is we've seen this string of people buying stocks in a  company that looks like it's about to just go, you know, continue going down.  And all of a sudden, suddenly something magical happening.  I think the days of insider trading have been kind of put aside and, you know,  there's kind of a no holes barred attitude right now, because last week we saw,  uh, help me with the pronunciation pronunciation.  It's a Prince Alawada Weeda.  Alawada Weeda.  He bought all that Citibank, uh, Citigroup last week.  And we saw, um, you know, just, just days before, you know, people buying into  Citi and, and just buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, doesn't that say that the fundamentals of the American economy are strong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, anyway, so, but what's interesting is the news all over the place tonight.  The news was all about that Microsoft was back in the seat, spending $5 billion  at, uh, going after the Yahoo.  You see this going after the Yahoo search and replacing their board.  I predicted that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I predicted it, that they would disassemble Yahoo, tear it into little pieces.  And that the one thing Microsoft really wanted, well, actually I didn't think  search, I thought they would want the ad business, but maybe those two  belong together anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's happening?  The, uh, the Reuters has this from, uh, the, uh, it was actually a report in  the Sunday Times, uh, in, uh, in London that said that Yahoo's in the talks with,  uh, Microsoft for a $20 billion deal.  That's going to start off with a $5 billion infusion of money to support the  board, move the board around and all this.  And then,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a minute, bomber said under no way, unequivocally, are we interested in Yahoo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I hear you, but this is all over the news.  And I wonder why all of a sudden tonight, all over the news is his whole back and  forth about that there's going to be this deal, all things digital had something on  the wall street journal saying it's total fiction.  I mean, there's a lot of things.  They said it wasn't true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's interesting though, but who starts the fiction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carl Icahn would, I'm not saying he did, but it's kind of interesting.  The timing of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would be in his interest.  Would it not?  Would, uh, maybe, or maybe he knew, maybe he had a hunch.  Maybe he listens to the show and he had a hunch.  Is Yahoo more valuable sold in pieces?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, you know, you know, right before you go on, you know, they want to  buy a Yahoo for the search.  You know, the fact of the matter is Microsoft's put a lot of effort into  their search engine and it's better than the Yahoo search.  I don't know what they want it for.  So this is like Mercedes Ben buying Yugo, you know, for its car technology.  They bought Chrysler.  So there's, well, they bought the, they bought it for the obvious reason,  for the market.  And I think there must be, they must be, she's want those Yahoo numbers,  but I think those Yahoo numbers are gonna, they're going to find that  most of them are crossover numbers of people that they already have in  their coffers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It makes sense to me.  I don't, yeah, I agree.  It doesn't make sense.  They'd want the search.  It makes more sense.  They'd want the online ads ad business.  Cause that's really what Microsoft can't get off the ground.  Not that Yahoo particularly could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, but yeah, I was doing billions of dollars in online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they're doing better than Microsoft.  So that would make sense that that might be worth something.  What, but maybe they need the search to go with it.  Cause aren't, aren't all of these online, you know, the Google style  online ads, they're really powered by search, right?  Isn't that a fundamental technology that parts make all their money from that.  Right.  So if you bought the search, you really, what do you want is not just the search.  You want the search and the ad business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you want the whole company.  Let's face it.  But then the, then you have your, you don't want Flickr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't want, there's a lot of Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Crough.  That's going to go over really well.  That's going to really benefit that.  They're going to buy everything and then cut Flickr loose.  That's going to be real endearing to the flickers and money loser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Flickr costs a lot of money in bandwidth and makes no money.  Nobody buys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's not the point.  You, you, you do this here.  Flickr is going along on its very merry way and it's doing a public  service by being in existence.  Yahoo buys them and assures everybody that it's going to stay in business for all time.  And then they try to figure out to make some money.  They can't do it.  So then they cut it loose and say, well, screw you all you thousands and  thousands, millions of people that use Flickr.  You think this is going to endear these companies to these customers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just Microsoft saying, hold on.  We want this.  I'm sure somebody wonderful will buy Flickr, but we're just not interested.  We have our own photo thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's going to be another cloud product that disappears.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I mean, they're off the hook.  Nobody's going to blame Microsoft because they didn't pick up Flickr.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm blaming them right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sarah Lane, you want to buy Flickr?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would if I could.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just because you like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a, I'm a big Flickr fan.  You know, I'm part of the community.  I think the Flickr community is one of the best.  It's a powerful community.  How do you monetize it?  It's really good question.  I mean, the only, the only things I've ever bought, you know, via Flickr are some,  you know, like print out, print, like people don't even do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the interesting thing.  You know, I, uh, somebody told me, I won't name names, but they, they were  talking to the Flickr guys.  Flickr guys say we sell a few, a few hundred a week photos and books and it's  not, it's a minor business and we spend millions on the bandwidth every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think they better stay in business because I just uploaded my entire library.  Folder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this story has popped it over to, to, uh, you know, to the, um, delicious, but  this new story is pretty detailed in terms of the talking about a $2 billion,  an, excuse me, a $5 billion, um, proposed, uh, facility or, or a loan to, uh, Miller  and Levinson, the management team.  And they're going to be raising another $5 billion.  They'd use to buy convertible preferred shares and warrants.  And I mean, just look at this unbelievable amount of detail here to be made up.  Kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the Times of London is pretty reliable.  I mean, it's not, uh, we're not talking Rupert Murdoch here.  Or are we actually?  It was kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Times of London is Rupert Murdoch.  Oh, well, nevermind.  You caught yourself in the middle of that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, uh, but I mean, no, they're pretty, they're pretty reliable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alien baby up for Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at, Icon's not a fool.  Icon bought a big chunk of Yahoo, doubled down as you say.  And now we get this news.  Something's afoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now there's some weird things.  Bill Gates put another, I don't know, multi-billions of dollars into  AutoNation last week again.  What's AutoNation?  AutoNation is the car dealerships that are the around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why doesn't Bill Gates put $2 billion in NASA and just buy the thing?  The Bill Gates Aeronautics and Space Administration.  Yeah.  Big Gassa.  I'm surprised he doesn't.  I think he should buy it.  BG, Big Gassa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's more, uh, Big Gassa.  It's, uh, more of a long the lines of something Paul Allen would think of doing.  But then of course he'd shutter it for some unknown reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, it was fun, but all the life's gone out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  After he within just in a moment of notice, he would loved it, loved it, loved it.  Uh, we're closing it down.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The talks with Yahoo involve Microsoft obtaining a 10 year operating agreement  worth about 2 billion a year to manage the search business, manage the search  business, man, wait a minute, manage.  Why would you man?  What?  Uh, I don't understand that.  It would also receive a two year call option to buy the search bill, buy the  search business for 20 billion.  So they manage it for a little while.  Yahoo continues to run email messaging and content services.  Oh, isn't that great?  All the good stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, we get to keep the email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh good.  What?  Uh, nor anything about online ads, which I gotta think we need an expert on Yahoo's  structure here.  I don't think even Jerry Yang knows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is, this is really, this really is an incredible article.  I mean, really it is.  This is the kind of thing that's going on though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I blame you.  We, every time we have Andrew Horowitz on Yahoo goes up for sale.  Yeah.  Hold on a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't post that story yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every time it's like, it's like you're a crow.  Yeah.  All right.  The Tesla roadster.  We talked to Jason a couple of weeks ago is bad about his brand new roadster and  he loves it and all that stuff.  And now Tesla struggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The company's looking, does he actually have one?  Because he said the only pictures I've seen of his is it seems to be on a show  room floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He has it.  He's been in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you driven, been in for a ride?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but he wouldn't lie.  He talked about driving.  He wouldn't lie.  Oh, okay.  Oh, you guys really don't like each other.  God damn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, he's a liar.  No, I said that you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wouldn't lie.  He drove the darn thing.  Of course he has his Tesla.  The real question is, can the company survive?  They're asking for federal loans as part of the $25 billion auto industry loan  package.  This is from last year.  He's requesting $400 million in low interest federal loans.  Actually, you know what?  If you're going to bail out anybody, bail out somebody forward looking like electric  cars, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, we don't need more SUVs.  Oh, wait, let's back up a second here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What we, yeah, bail out somebody who makes your cars that cost over a hundred  thousand dollars and are only available to the people who have a lot of money.  Let's bail them out so those guys can go 200 miles an hour in their fancy little  electric car.  That's a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You see the list of names of people that are on the board.  Sergey Bram, Larry Page, Jeff.  So they've got no money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe it's an altruistic thing because they want to foster the development of  electric cars.  It's very expensive.  Only the very rich will be able to afford them initially as true with any technology.  But as we, as you well know, with technology, the first editions are expensive.  You know, look at solid state drives.  But as people buy them, the prices go down.  I think they get bang for their buck.  They get to have the bragging rights, the fastest car, cool car, and they're  jumpstarting the electric car industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's bail out Ferrari.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's a good idea.  And then, you know, this, they go down electric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should only bail out stuff that's being sold to the rich.  Well, that's all people have to forbid that people are losing their houses.  We have to bail out, you know, Tesla.  So so so your friend, what's his name, can brag about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, first of all, you know, they're also they're also bailing out the caviar  industry, by the way, on the champagne.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A group of men. It is, isn't it rare?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You listen to yourself, though.  You're honestly you're you're talking about so just matter of fact,  talking about a bailout of and how it would be.  Isn't that what the government's for?  No, they're not for bailouts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's what the government. No, no, that's their job.  I'm pretty sure I saw that in the Constitution.  It's it's unbelievable. It really is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's unbelievable.  Where what we've gotten to that twenty five, twenty five billion  only maybe six months ago would have been considered a lot of money.  Is the Citigroup deal a crime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolute. I agree.  Thievery. Thievery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody should go to jail. I agree.  Oh, worse. Hey, look at this way.  Martha Stewart went to jail for what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, is is Mark Cuban going to jail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he's being set up. Really? By who?  The SEC. He's got this theory about it.  Oh, Adam Curry's got a lot of theories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it the worldwide Jewish conspiracy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no. He's got some theory.  Apparently, Cuban, whether it's because of HD, Ned or whatever,  he's been paying for an investigation of some of these bailout deals.  And the next thing you know, he's got his tit in the ring.  How does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's I think that's kind of what Mark's position is on his blog.  He kind of implied Mark Cuban, the guy who's, of course,  sold broadcast dot com to Yahoo for a billion plus dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Three billion. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  One of the great Yahoo acquisitions, one of the great acquisitions of all time.  And of course, ever since he's been having fun as a billionaire  playboy, Mark Cuban, and I guess he got caught with.  Well, it was accused of by the SEC of insider trading  because he knew that some search engine that he was.  Mama mama.  Yeah, mama.  His name is searching.  Your mama was going to sell its stock or something, and he got out early.  What are you laughing at?  That's a great name for a search engine.  Your mama.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just I just got a note from Adam.  Oh, no.  Who says, what are you calling him an anti-Semite?  No, no, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's not an anti. He says some conspiracy.  It's a conspiracy of somebody.  I don't know if it's who it is.  He's not. I'm sorry, Adam. I apologize.  There we go.  Sometimes there's a special sidecar addition of this week in tech.  Adam Curry, what's wrong with the world?  Well, you do that on Take Five, don't you?  Or no agenda, no agenda.  That's what you do. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We do stuff like they should listen to the show once in a while.  It's actually quite good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love you, Adam. I really do.  In fact, Adam, if you want to come on and defend yourself,  please come right on the show.  It's OK. He's the pod father.  He still has the little priest picture that he did for Apple.  Yeah, he's got to get rid of that.  He's got to. I mean, that's adding to the fuel to the, you know, the fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's because it's so it's so dated.  I only use my high school picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not dated.  You know, you're every bit as good looking as you were in high school, John.  Oh, that's yeah, that's a good one.  That's one of the things people tell me all the time. Yeah.  The guy was ugly in high school, too.  So Midway Games going to get delisted from the New York stock exchange.  They received notification  from the New York Stock Exchange has fallen below the standard  for continued listing of its common stock standard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  New York Stock Exchange. There's an oxymoron for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

You know, they'll open it up to a secondary offering and they'll bring the money  if they really want to stay on, you know, on.  But, you know, they're probably going to head on over to the Nasdaq,  the pink sheets. Doesn't matter.  It's just that, you know, the game is the game.  The pinks, the worst pinks, the pinkies.  I don't know what that is.  But Sarah, so, you know, just as I really haven't asked you  because I don't know you, what's your how do you think about this whole bailout?  You know, fiasco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Huge bummer. I mean, you know, I  I'm really not the biggest financial expert, but, you know, in a very general sense,  if companies can't run their companies effectively and they screw up  and, you know, a lot of it, at least in my opinion, seems to be,  you know, based on corruptive practices.  Andrew, you said they don't deserve to be saved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can I ask a quick question?  Yeah. Did you actually say huge bummer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was. Yeah, I did.  That's what the kids are saying now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  She grew up in Sebastopol, the land of the hippie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Very green. Isn't it Sebastopol?  So that's well, yeah, on paper, Sebastopol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But people from Sebastopol say Sebastopol for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They say it's it's like P.U.H.L.  Sebastopol, fastball, special.  Actually, we say Seb town.  Seb town.  Yeah. Your friends have asked, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're the one, Andrew Horowitz, who said

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Call them that for now.  Andrew Horowitz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we let's get Adam on that because I feeling a little  it's a semantic kind of commentary there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am not. I am not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm an honorary Jew. I am.  I swear to God.  I do Passover.  We do the whole thing.  I'm circumcised the whole thing. I'll show you.  So you're the one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Avert your gaze.  Avert your gaze.  You're the one.  She can't averted far enough, to be honest with you.  She's she's trying to run out of the room here.  She says, I can't believe what am I doing here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm also circumcised, so it's fine.  Oh, all right. Enough.  What? I'm speechless.  It almost sounded like it came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm speechless.  So Andrew Horowitz, you, you, my friend of the one that said  we will know we're at bottom when Google starts the layoffs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, Lou, we saw that the Google layoffs.  Google, Google. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google layoffs appear to be large.  This is from a story in all headline news,  which is kind of like all of MP3.  I don't know what they are, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Whatever happened to the naked news?  They're still there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got invited for they're actually big fans.  I got invited when I was up in Toronto to a tour.  I declined.  I learned my I've learned my lesson.  Never do anything around video cameras that you would not like to be seeing on.  It would not like your son to be Googling on YouTube in years to come.  He and his friend gets his friends get in the car and say, hey,  we saw that YouTube thing where you and it's like, oh, please, I'm so sorry.  I was young. I needed the money.  Anyway, A.H.N. says Google's layoffs appear to be larger than previous reports.  The original reports were just some double click duplication.  According to Web Guild, since August, hundreds of Google staff have been laid  off and the number of jobs on the chopping block could rise up to 10,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, what's the number on, you know, Google's?  This can't be like 30,000.  They have 20,000 employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They cannot fire half of them.  What do they do? That doesn't sound right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, one thing is, first of all, they laid off last week  all of their part time and contract labor.  That was the first thing they did.  That's about 10,000 right there, isn't it?  That's a no, no, it was it was a small number than that.  It was it was the number, but I know it wasn't very it wasn't really that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because they they like Microsoft and a lot of companies  do that little contract employee thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is smart.  I mean, that's smart just for this kind of circumstance, right?  Yeah. But they do have a total of, I'm saying, 20,000 employees with about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it says, according to this story, an extra 10,000 hidden as temporary workers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. And that's the one that they said they're going to just just take out.  That's the one that's going to, you know, reduce down by.  And of course, listen, everybody, I think we get carried away with the Google.  I mean, Google is an advertising company.  That's it. And I got to tell you something.  I know some people at a variety of different companies, as you do.  And they're nervous.  I mean, the people that are that are expecting the,  you know, to run their companies by advertising dollars.  Don't forget, the financial industry is one of the biggest spenders of money  when it comes to online advertising.  Now, they're not to I don't know if you notice this,  but they're not doing so well right now. Yeah.  And, you know, the fact is that, you know, you have this situation  where all of a sudden they say, wait a minute, what if this company goes out?  What are we going to do about our revenue?  We have no other revenue stream.  Where else does for the most part, where else does  where else does Google get their their money from?  Of course, they get it from their their search.  But, you know, that's being cut down as well.  And and really, the whole thing is all about the advertising.  There's no secondary opportunities for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If they gave me everything else, if these layoffs are true,  is this as you as you implied, you know, the bottom is this is is bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got to tell you something.  I don't know if this is a bottom here.  Yeah, I don't think it's exactly, you know, usually a big layoff is treated  with, you know, adulation by the the stock, the stock industry and investors.  But I got to tell you something, a lot of the things that we saw  even last week, we saw horrible news on the on unemployment,  on durable goods, and the list goes on and on.  We saw earnings being cut all over the place and retail looking horrible.  And the stock market went up.  And I think that was an interesting sign of, you know, obviously  the continuation of the spare market.  But I must tell you, though, that I don't see a catalyst,  a significant catalyst, you know, aside from an infrastructure play  by the Obama team with 700 billion dollars saving two point five million jobs.  I don't see a significant catalyst right now that's going to cause  this dramatic upswing in the stock market or stocks.  Consumers are freaking out.  People are absolutely, you know, turtling, if you will.  They're just, you know, kind of going inside their shell,  not spending a lot of money.  And we see that the only reason why the Black Friday was so good, as they say,  with 70 percent cuts and 50 percent cuts in pricing.  Was Black Friday good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Do we have the numbers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hold on. Let's talk about Black Friday in a second.  I want to take a break and we will talk about Black Friday.  I'm very interested in talking about it, but it's time to talk about somebody  very important, near and dear to my heart, our sponsors.  And we want to thank the folks at audible.com for making the show possible.  You know, audible.com.  I don't care what's happening out there.  You need to listen to audio books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are going to know.  No, because it's you know, it's it's there are certain industries  and tough times that do well.  And one of them is entered is audio entertainment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to recommend the pagan stone.  You might you might have heard the story.  I mean, it's a it's a fabulous story.  Three friends perform a blood ritual that awakens a demon,  forces him to fight for their lives.  But instead, no, I'm not.  You could make that one of you, too.  I got to recommend something a little bit more serious in these tough times.  The disciplined investor essential, essential strategies for success.  Oh, that's that's that's something that's written by a nice little nice kid  from Florida. He's he's going places.  His name, Andrew Horowitz.  And you I got to tell you, you know, you narrated this and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I narrated that it was something to behold that narration for eight hours.  I think it's five and a half hours, I guess.  Final product. It's five and a half hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but it took you many more, of course, to record.  I'm sure. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Maybe they should also plan to monitor their portfolio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were you in high school when you recorded this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know what I got? I got the big bottom oral.  You got the big bottom on.

Transcript:  What did you compare relative performance?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More likely than not, mutual funds will prove to you know, it's great about that.  And in all seriousness, we're giving you a hard time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sitting here. I didn't go anywhere.  I heard a crash as you tiptoed out.  Oh, I've got the other machine burning some CD roms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, OK. That was burning some CD roms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty happy, isn't it? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a happy young man. He'll burn the CD roms.  He will never burn. I know, John, he will never burn a roast.  CD roms, one thing, not a roast.  You got the Jay-Z in there?

Transcript:  I don't know.  Just told him I got to I got to smoke more cigarettes and drink more.  I can sing the blues. That poor woman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What? Oh, you're talking about Amy? Yeah.  Oh, yeah. What's the latest with her?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think she's in the hospital. She's in rehab.  They keep saying, oh, she's having a medical reaction.  I think her septum is gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She has no nose.  Well, that'd be just standing. What's going on?  Well, no, I believe that's part of the problem, but I don't want to be accused of.  Sure. I've already been accused of anti-Semitism.  I don't want to be accused of anti-Britishism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there's nothing wrong with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, did anybody get a storm, a Blackberry storm?  Anybody show of hands? Anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody. Well, I was excited till I heard it sucked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  David Pogue hated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Pogue is such an apologist for Apple that I can't take him seriously  with whatever he reviews.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Mossberg, apologist for Apple.  He liked he liked it.  Yeah, kind of liked it, sort of liked it.  It was right.  It wasn't a rave like he usually gives Apple products,  but it was definitely a strong recommendation, which surprised me  because usually Pogan and Walter kind of an agreement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're a lockstep because they get the same exact memo from.  Oh, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't from Steve from the jobs man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, did you hear that now?  There's grumblings again about a Microsoft product  beginning the first of the year.  Microsoft phone. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The zoom, zoom phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think going to do that, that would alienate all the people  that are running Windows mobile for.  Why would they do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you have to have Windows mobile on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would. And I'll tell you what's going on.  They're looking at Apple and the profit margins.  They're getting out of the iPhone.  And they're going, if you really want to succeed in the phone business,  you got to build your own handset.  You can't let these other guys build the handsets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's always been the problem.  You know, the fact is that Microsoft, the reason they have so many problems  because they have to be all things to all devices.  And unfortunately, the reason why Apple obviously pulled ahead  is because if one device, one OS, it just works.  They control the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, this is Apple.  You disagree, John? A little bit.  Isn't that the secret?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead with what you have to say, and then I'll chime in with my.  Shut me down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me get out on the limb and get the saw out and I'll be out there in a minute.  In my opinion, Apple's success is because they control both the hardware  and the software platform.  They they buy that not just the phone, but the Mac as well.  And the iPod, too. And that's the key.  They control, in fact, more than that, the whole chain.  They control the user experience, buying the music, buying the videos,  buying the applications from all the way through.  And that's key.  In fact, if Apple could have done it without AT&T,  that's the one weakness in the whole thing.  If they could have done it without AT&T, it would be even better.  OK, I'm done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe they should buy AT&T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's cheap enough. Is it?  Oh, it's cheap.  It's cheap.  And what's interesting about that is if you think about you would you would  I mean, I think you would just if you didn't know anything,  think that AT&T should be doing, you know, OK,  considering that they have the number one phone out there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Iconic in our chat room says my storm broke the first day.  Apparently the click screen is not covered in the warranty.  Took me three hours to get a refund.  Piece of crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  AT&T has the worst customer service of any company.  I've ever dealt with.  No, AT&T is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's right. AT&T is in a league by itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I find T-Mobile downright comforting when I call them.  They're all very nice.  I've never had, you know, it's pretty bad.  Maybe I've never actually dealt with them.  But AT&T really bad.  I mean, it's like it's like they're trying to make you go insane  or crazy. Go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or go away. Well, they are.  You know, that is in fact why those phone trees are so elaborate  that you when you call tech support or customer service,  because they want you to give up.  They really do want you to give up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they like I think the key to success here is, first of all,  if you're going to do one of these trees, you've got to lead people to believe  that if you follow path A, it's going to take you where your destination is.  And then you can you so you drive them down the Primrose path  because you know, because of the logic of the of the suggestions  that you're going to be allowed to get to that point  where you have to change your phone number.  Let's say that's the selection you're looking for.  And when you finally get to the end, it's not there.  It takes you to all kinds of other drugs.  You can't find what you're looking for.  And then if you try to back off or try and you get stuck,  they won't they don't let you reverse out of the tree.  Right. That's horrible.  So you can't hit that operator O button and it tells you it's a bad.  You know, no. And then maybe starts you over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please listen carefully as our options have changed since last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we should put together one of these nightmarish  optional things and just let people call and see what they get out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, you know what?  You know what? There is a website called GetHuman.com.  Have you seen that where the idea is here's the 800 number  and here's what you press to get a human.  And in some cases, it'll be like 1471933144.  And you just go boop boop boop boop boop right through it and you'll get a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huh? You know, you know what?  AT&T does invariably.  We have the family package and so we have five phones on it.  And if you make one change or even sometimes just call  all of a sudden, one of the phones in this in our family, just, you know,  you don't have texting anymore.  You don't know it till, you know, till it's two or you don't have internet  or something like that.  So you also can get a bill next month with this unbelievable fees  because they took off the unlimited internet, unlimited texting and all.  I mean, it's unbelievable.  Every single time we call AT&T,  they do something really screwy with one of the phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm telling you, AT&T is the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with her. Wow.  All right. Let me see if I can find the AT&T.  Get a human at AT&T.  Let's see if they have that.  You know, there's so bad.  I don't think there's any humans that work.  They're so bad there. You can't in fact get it.  You cannot in fact get a human.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think there's a human work.  There's not an actual human working at AT&T.  These people are either zombies or they're there.  Some sort of aliens, because I don't think there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  an actual human. I'm looking at it.  There's they have Altel, Cellular One, Singular,  Metro PCS, Motorola, Sprint, T-Mobile, Verizon, but no AT&T.  Now, if it were still singular wireless, you'd press zero at each prompt.  By the way, that works with most of these.  Just keep hitting zero.  Just hit zero again and again.  That always works for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doesn't work on AT&T, I can assure you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Belkin, you press, I don't like Belkin.  You press two, two, six, three.  And then you press one at every prompt thereafter.  And eventually a human will answer the phone.  Yeah, a human in Bombay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like voodoo. Yeah, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I talk to a guy in Bangalore earlier today to verify.  I actually bit the bullet and ordered the Canon 5D Mark II.  It's my birthday present to myself.  You know, this is that new 1080p amazing Canon SLR.  And I had to call somebody to verify, you know,  because they don't want to send it to you because they don't trust you.  And he says, hello, my name is Marcus.  No, it's not.  No, it's not. It is not Marcus.  But I as in a way, just to kind of assert myself,  I called him Marcus at every opportunity.  Thanks, Marcus.  Marcus, my number is Marcus.  Here's my and I just did every time.  And I just I hope it bugged him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I think he was probably thrilled.  Oh, I fooled you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, my name is Marcus and I'm in Des Moines.  Ha ha.  So Black Friday, what are the stats?  The only thing I've seen it's too early to know how well Black Friday,  the biggest shopping day of the week, the day after the year, I should say.  They have to Thanksgiving.  Traditionally, you know, all the merchants put everything on sale,  trying to get people in the store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the first two people were killed, by the way, horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The second person, the Toys R Us, there was a shootout,  but they think it was unrelated.  Real gun or real guns.  And one of the one of the police officers in the investigation said,  well, come on, why would anybody bring guns to Toys R Us?  They must have intended to shoot.  It's been a tickle me Elmo thing or something.  But the but the terrible one was in the Long Island, Wal-Mart, where

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't want and they didn't understand why they couldn't actually go in and shop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. OK, so so here's the deal.  I'll tell the story.  So, you know, the store at Wal-Mart, as many stores has, you know,  they put these big loss leaders on the in the ads and the newspaper ads.  And then they open it like four or five a.m.  So there are people lined up, thousands of people lined up  at this Long Island, Wal-Mart, you know, all night long.  They start to bang on the doors and shake the doors before it opens.  So the employees, this is where their mistake, they link arms.  They try to keep people out.  They have big mistake.  They link arms in front of the door.  You know, Wal-Mart pays you eight dollars an hour with no health.  Let them in. So they link the store from being shopped.  This is this is how this is how devoted Wal-Mart employees are.  They link arms.  The people start shouting, break the door down, break the door down  like there's something magic inside. Break the door.  Finally, they do. They break the door down.  It comes down on top of one of the employees and they walk over him.  Rushing to the deals, other employees climbing up on the soda machines  to get out of the way of the sea of humanity.  Then, of course, they find out this guy's been killed. Horrible.  They tell the store, they say, I'm sorry, we're going to have to close.  There's been a death.  And people say, no, I was in line all night.  I'm buying. And they won't leave. Just move them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just move them. Get them out of here.  We don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this only in Long Island that this could happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, this is I think they should they should equip  these Wal-Mart stores with deadly gas. Horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they should. Yeah, they should have plastic bullets.  They should have, you know, they should really equip them  with the whole riot gear, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's unacceptable anyway,  no matter what was on the other side of the door.  Yeah. But the fact that we're talking like retail, right?  Yeah. What are you getting?  With some like maybe percentage.  What are you getting? An alarm clock for twelve dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I got to kill somebody for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're going to save money, but you're still going to spend money.  That is no reason to transform. It's pretty horrible.  Those people should be ashamed of themselves.  Everyone is understatement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry Brace in our chat room says coming up next week on the PS3  Call of Duty Black Friday edition.  You get the weapons.  We'll point you to the Wal-Mart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's the interesting thing about Black Friday.  So we saw a three percent increase.  That's what the surveys are saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Three percent over this time last year.  Which is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the problem is going to be that with 50 and 70 percent discounts,  these retailers are still in big trouble because now the margins  were totally squeezed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They needed they needed to say, wait a minute, are you saying  they weren't making any money so they needed to sell more?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that exactly, exactly.  Now they're going to have the margins so tight now at 50 and 60 and 70 percent  reductions for that day that they're not going to make any money anyway.  Well, that's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's beside the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does it mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's beside the point.  I don't think the idea was to make money.  It was to make sure that people keep shopping.  And I think numbers were down like some people predicted 20 percent,  you know, were less shoppers.  What I whether it was the other or not, I think is immaterial.  I think the main thing is the sheer numbers.  It was up. I mean, that's good news.  That's what I'm saying. It's good news.  That's what was intended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I have to say, if you went to a Best Buy at three in the morning  or any of these stores, there were lines out front.  It's as if people, Main Street really didn't feel the pain of Wall Street.  I like that. I'm going to use that in the next debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, out and about in San Francisco on Friday, it was, I mean,  it sure didn't look like any sort of recession.  It was busy, wasn't it? It was crazy.  Yeah, it was crazy busy.  Everybody was out. Everybody was out shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know why people shop on Black Friday.  Were you shopping? Black Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why did you shop on Black Friday? Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I was not. I'm I participated in Buy Nothing Today.  Were you and I just channeling chickens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe we were. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was at home. Did you?  Yeah, no, I I deliberately don't buy anything.  I never think any of the sales are worth it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never buy anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I looked at Apple.  You know, Apple supposedly on Black Friday was going to be very aggressive.  They weren't. They were pretty typical where they  the best was like 100 bucks off a $2,000 computer.  What's the big deal? Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but people are really mad about that.  They wanted more. There's a lot.  Yeah, they said, you know what, with what's going on, the economy, you know, listen,  can Apple could at least do us a favor?  Yeah, I'm mad about that.  A little cheer here. Give me a 500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if anybody has margins still, it ain't Dell.  It ain't ACES. It ain't ACER. It's Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yep. That's what I'm saying.  On top of everything, people are there was a really that was I think  there was a big misstep.  Now, they shouldn't give away the farm and all that.  But at least on some products, they should have done a little bit of something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could have cut the iPod by by 100 bucks.  They could have cut it in half and still made money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just a little spirit of what's, you know, in the spirit of what's going on,  you know, do something a little bit more than just, you know, because you can  and because you're Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're saying Apple help a brother out.  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or a sister or a sister.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You go on with this.  And then meanwhile, two seconds ago, you're complaining about the 70, 50  percent discounts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. Well, the Apple has margin.  That's the difference, John.  Apple has margin, not Walmart. Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not suggesting that it's necessarily I'm totally I'm just saying what  what is being kind of scubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Listen to this new egg dot com.  Acer Aspire One, that's one of that really nice netbooks.  I think netbooks are going to be big.  This this is the this is the year the netbook because they're under 500 bucks.  They're selling the eight point nine inch netbook for two hundred fifty dollars.  Wow. Is that usable?  I mean, does it have enough?  Eight gigs, solid state drive, five, twelve megs of memory.  It's the Linux version. You don't pay the Microsoft tax.  That's why it's cheap. Yeah, that's very usable.  That's actually a very nice little netbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The interesting thing, the interesting number was the e-commerce spending.  And PayPal had a real big jump.  And you had there was a one percent increase.  But but the numbers were pretty good compared to it was a six percent  increase, I guess, of online over 2007.  Black Friday saw five hundred thirty five million dollars  and online spending, according to Comscore,  who doesn't always keep their numbers right. But that's what they said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, that's good.  That's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I glazed over on the numbers.  I don't know why the numbers.  I just like my head went somewhere.  My heart is with you, but my head is lost.  I'm with you.  So what are we saying?  We're saying that this may be a good shop.  Yeah, here's my feeling is that the other shoe hasn't dropped on this financial  thing, that we're not feeling Main Street's not feeling the pain yet.  Is that the case?  People are getting laid off.  Unemployment's gone up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The job numbers are going to be atrocious moving forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're getting worse and worse.  How about credit?  Are people are their credit card limits getting reduced?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are they I mean, that would be interesting, wouldn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because I mean, yeah, you could still use a credit card, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you could use credit card.  As a matter of fact, the bailout last week, which, you know, one of them  pick your poison, which one it was.  But the bailout last week really reset the whole credit card industry  in a way that allowed for a tremendous amount of debt to be added to the system,  which is kind of actually unbelievable, because that's the whole problem  with all of what went on to begin with.  And they're just flushing us with more credit availability.  So it's you know, there was, I think, a drop in consumer credit last month.  You know, there wasn't a lot of spending.  And but now you're going to start seeing those capital one  and those MasterCard applications coming in the mail pretty quickly.  Are you? I'm getting a lot of catalogs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate those things.  They're one of the catalogs.  The I like catalogs, although I throw them all out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you getting it like a like seven or eight a day now?  I'm going to have a ton. Yeah.  Yeah, easy. It's ridiculous.  I feel so bad about all.  How about you, Sarah?  You get a lot of catalogs in the mail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So many. And I mean, I haven't even really forwarded my mail in the past few years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it could be worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could be so much.  Somebody else is getting your.  Well, you know who's getting it?  The girl used to live there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, just it's such a waste.  It just might like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a waste for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, we moved into a house  a few years ago that had was occupied by some older people.  And they get 40.  No, I'm what?  I'm 52, like 80s.  And they get a different kind of catalog.  We got a lot of support hose  orthopedic devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you just come in.  The only reason you're bringing out this anecdote is just to ridicule the oldsters.  First, it was the Jews and that's the old people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, geez, I got to.  This is it.  You know, it's the Kevin Rose thing.  I've got the Kevin Rose syndrome.  Did you see what he what do you think about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is the Kevin Rose syndrome?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That you know, did you see what he did on the dig?  No. Oh, he got a little bit of a heat for it.  In fact, I'm thinking that he's in stealth mode now because I sent him an invitation  to be to join me on stage at Macworld and he gave it to the the dig PR people to respond to me.  Not he didn't respond directly.  I got a message from the PR person.  He's in stealth mode.  Well, you saw what happened.  It was on Dignation.  He said something pretty sexy.  I don't work at.  What do you say?  Let's get to the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't see Dignation.  Hey, OK, they're talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's right at the beginning.  It's like the first four minutes of Dignation.  We talked a little bit about that at night.  He and I should get Kevin on to respond, but I think I get the PR.  I'm chatting with him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He won't come on anymore.  He's too big for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was on last time.  Sarah was here.  He just called in.  Kevin is saying over IM that dig PR said yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, he said yes.  But why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But why did I have to go through dig PR?  I was a little strange.  There was nothing wrong with it.  He's a big star.  I didn't used to have to.  Yeah, you know, it's got handlers.  I used to know him.  Well, now I don't know him.  I know his.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will you get to the story?  So he's going to.  OK, so the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, wait a minute.  So the thing is, OK, so they start off Dignation.  This is the one with the multicam thing.  So you can actually it's kind of interesting because you can see the reaction in the in the  the studio as he says this.  He says the only time it's OK to hit a woman is if she kicks you in the groin.  Then it's OK to punch her in the teeth.  OK, you know, OK, I'm a joke.  It's a joke.  I'm not uncomfortable at that point.  OK, then he says, or you could cut her with scissors.  Oh, that's when it went over the top.  And I think now he did he did issue an apology afterwards.  Where does that come from?  Well, that's it's a little weird.  So anyway, that's what I'm thinking is maybe now I'm channeling Kevin.  And so that's what's coming out of my mouth.  Do you think this is sort of like I was drunk and I spoke at a turn?  He wasn't drunk yet.  It was four minutes into the show.  Well, he couldn't Leo Scissorhands.  Anyway, I didn't want to bring it up.  And I'm sorry, Kevin, I apologize.  Neither here nor there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I cut her with scissors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that was a little creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I didn't want to make it like joke about cutting my hair with scissors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it wasn't.  I got it.  Well, maybe that's what he meant.  Call me cut her hair off with scissors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Colleen's coming in here with scissors.  Colleen, get out of here.  We're trying to do a show here.  Let's see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a question.  Yes, I may.  So it seems like we're in a we've been for the last, I don't know, maybe a year or so.  Maybe look in a kind of a vat.  There hasn't been a lot of innovation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've been with a little too long now.  Oh, really?  Yeah, we're in a vat.  All of us.  Oh, really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, in a vac like a vacuum?  Yeah, no, no, kind of a time when there's not a lot of innovation going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you're talking about there's no slow news days.  What are you trying to say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I was talking about the bigger picture, actually, of what happens to innovation if  there's no money to be passed around.  You know, there's no money to go to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll tell you what the problem is.  Let's get this.  Let's just clear the table.  All right.  Let me just say it real simple.  Say it all.  Nobody wants to admit to it.  This would solve all the problems that we've had.  This would start Baines Oxley.  Kill Sox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kill Sox.  Actually, you're not alone.  I just read somebody else.  Oh, it was a Wall Street Journal said that in the opinion page.  They said he's been about it several times.  Now, and John, you've said this before that the these are the accounting accountability  controls that were put in place by Congress after the Enron disaster.  And the problem is nobody wants to do an IPO.  Nobody wants to go public because of all the overhead draconian reporting requirements.  Right.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In fact, I was just talking to Tim Draper of Draper Fisher,  the big venture capital firm when I was at a trip recently.  Jervitsen.  Jervitsen.  Sorry, Steve.  Anyway, he said that he says you can't.  So you wouldn't even think of bringing a company public unless they're already at 400 million in sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's very few.  But it's more than that.  It's more than that, John.  Think about this.  Aren't we lucky?  Aren't we lucky we didn't have the IPO fever that we've had in the last bust?  What if all these companies been public?  They'd be gone.  Twitter would be gone if it were public now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter probably wouldn't be public, but it might.  No, the thing is these people need.  They need working capital.  And the reason you go public is to get it.  And if you don't have working capital, you do go broke.  And the fact of the matter is Twitter is hardly what I'd call a booming business that's making money.  The fact these companies need to find ways of getting large amounts of working capital  so that they can be successful in the future.  I mean, that's why Yahoo is in business.  That's why Google's in business.  That's why Microsoft's in business.  All these companies, if they were remain private companies, they would not be what they are today.  And we'd all be poorer for it.  But now nobody can do this.  And yes, when you do IPOs with the public involved, a lot of these companies fail  and the public loses a lot of money.  But the public also makes a lot of money on some of these companies.  I mean, look at Microsoft, for example, when you made thousands of folds  or whatever your investment was if you were early in.  Fact of the matter is there's no mechanism for doing this now.  So everything is dead in the water and it's not going to get any better with Sarbanes Oxley in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're saying that the venture funding that they have been getting is insufficient  to take them to the next level.  They need to go public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's what.  Yeah, because they get 10 X or 100 X what venture money they get becomes when they when you  if you take a look at these offers, Google went public, Yahoo went public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are cheaper.  It's cheaper than I mean, you don't have to give up as much as you do to a VC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, let's get rid of socks.  We've been, you know, that's what everyone talks about.  But nobody seems to want to step up to the plate and actually say anything bad about socks.  It seems as though if you're in a public company or have anything to do with the  investment community, actually criticizing socks puts you, you know,  puts you in a bad state with whatever the regulations are.  It's just a catch 22 in some funny way.  The whole thing is a complete disaster.  And of course, the public doesn't realize what what it or, you know,  they go because of Enron, you know, this would be socks.  If you look at socks, it would have done nothing.  And Ron, it would have done nothing about MCI.  It would have done nothing about any of these companies that folded.  And since socks has been in place, look what's happened.  The entire financial community is in the toilet.  We're going to spend eight trillion dollars to bail them out.  And socks was in play the whole time.  I'm not seeing it being any good to anybody.  It seems to be a detriment in every single way.  It needs to be repealed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, I don't think it stopped any of the any any of the the horrible  actions by the executives and the I mean, look what's gone on at Goldman  and all these financial companies.  That's a good point.  It didn't didn't do anything for them.  It's ridiculous.  It is.  And what is who has it helped?  I mean, is there is there any application of it that you can see, John,  that may be even beneficial to anybody?  None.  Zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  I want to talk about the the there's two there's two court cases.  The school teacher who kind of got off but will never work as a teacher again  after a porn storm in her classroom.  And the MySpace mom who managed to get a 13 year old to kill herself is convicted  but of a lesser crime.  We're going to talk about both of those in just a bit.  But before we do that, I want to mention our friends at GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting.  GoToMeeting is the great service from Citrix.  These folks do such a good job of there he goes.  He's off to baste his beef again.

We'll show it in the after show.  In the after show.  But he kind of it's kind of fun.  Was Prager up there with him?  Did he go up with him?  I think so.  Or maybe he was on the ground watching.  I turned him down.  They asked me to go.  Yeah, I've turned him down several times.  I just I'm afraid.  I would go with space, but I wouldn't go to the Blue Angels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot more, you know, flips and.  Yeah.  You know.  Scarier.  Yeah.  It's like a roller coaster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look, they're going upside down.  It's crazy.  All right.  So let's talk about these two.  We had we talked very when this happened,  it seems like it's more than a year ago about the poor school teacher.  I feel so sorry for her.  So she's a substitute teacher.  She is in the break room before the class.  She's doing a little surfing.  And she goes to some sites, not bad sites.  One is like a hairstyle site.  And and then brings the computer into the classroom.  Somehow pop ups have gotten on there.  And all of a sudden, she's in a porn storm.  Have you ever been in a porn storm?  It doesn't happen as much anymore because we all have pop up blockers.  But just you can't click, you click, you can't get rid of it.  This happened four years ago when this was much more common.  Common.  Yep.  She this was a middle school teacher.  She didn't she had been told it's dangerous to unplug the computer.  You can't shut it off.  She'd been instructed by the school's tech guy.  Don't shut the computer off.  So she didn't know what to do.  I think she ran out of the room to call in the principal.  She didn't know that she could just turn off the monitor.  She didn't know enough.  She was she was an average user.  Now, originally, they brought in a police detective from Norwich, Connecticut, where this happened.  And and he saw these images in the cache and he said, look, I could prove she did this.  I could prove it later.  Genius.  Genius.  Got her in the cash, huh?  They got her in the cash.  But later they had an actual intelligent computer forensic person look at it.  You can read his conclusions on the Internet.  He said, no, it's going to happen to anybody.  She got JavaScripted with his porn storm.  She didn't go to any bad sites.  It's because she went to one site and there was a bad link there.  It was inadvertent.  The machine was running an out of date antivirus.  It had been discontinued six months earlier.  The clock on the machine was set incorrectly, so they couldn't really tell what happened when.  The whole thing was a mess.  Poor woman.  Now, finally, four years later has been cleared.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this like happened last week or four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's been going through this October 2004.  Parents complained she lost her license.  She will never be able to teach again.  She was cleared, but she can never teach again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But why?  She's clear.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sad story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So are those still going on?  Those those porn or pop ups like that?  I haven't seen those in a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think that I think because we all have pop up blockers now and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Imagine in a classroom, you know how out of date some of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's it.  This was a Windows 95 machine that had just been upgraded in 98.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Paying enough attention to keep it clean.  And yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the really sad thing is I don't know if she had a bad defense attorney  or that the court I think the court threw out some of the expert testimony.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But there were she was railroaded.  She was railroaded.  She needs to sue him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, she's lost her license.  That's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now I would sue to get my license back.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just seems wrong.  I mean, she's she was convicted, appealed, got, you know, got got thrown out on appeal,  but she still lost her license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, she can teach me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There you go.  Yeah.  Come on, Julie.  Come on.  A classroom for you and we'll set up a little.  Go to go to meetings.  She could do it with a meeting.  You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't go to the meeting.  Yeah, that'd be great.  And now she may not be she may not be really looking forward to teaching on a computer again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She might say I'm just as well.  I prefer not to.  Yeah.  Those chalkboard is fine.  Middle school kids.  Bad news.  So this is a more recent story.  I'm sure you heard it.  The woman adult, 49 year old adult, Laurie drew a phallan, O'Fallon, the Missouri,  accused of setting up a phony MySpace account, proposing as a 16 year old boy who lured in her  neighbor, the 13 year old girl.  Apparently, Laurie was upset because the 13 year old girl had hurt her own daughter's feelings.  So she said, I'm going to get her, created this account on MySpace, basically seduced the girl.  You know, I really like you.  You're really great.  OK.  And then at the drop of hat, breaks up with her, sends her a message saying the world would be a  better place without you.  Goodbye.  Sad thing.  The 13 year old kills herself.  The mother prosecuted.  The mother prosecuted.  She was accused of felony.  And the maximum penalty for the felony was 20 years in prison.  They threw out three of the charges, downgraded them to a misdemeanor.  One of them they couldn't come to a conclusion on.  So she's now convicted of a felony.  I'm sorry, misdemeanor of accessing computers without authorization.  And while she faces as much as three years in prison,  it's expected that the judge will probably just dismiss charges against her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can kind of look at this story two ways.  One, it's just despicable that this woman would be stooping to this level.  It's pretty creepy.  It's really creepy.  And it's just, you know, I mean, really, I don't know.  I'm glad she's not my mom.  Let's just say that.  Second, things like that are said to people on the internet all the time.  You know, and so it's, you know, there's this 13 year old girl who committed suicide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't fully blame them, the adult.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, she's obviously in a state of mind that, you know, I mean, I'm sure someone in,  you know, when I was 13, said something like that to me.  I might've cried for five minutes or so, you know, I mean, there's just,  it all depends on the person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does this complicate it?  If I tell you that the adult knew that the 13 year old was depressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, well, kind of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And had emotional difficulties anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  I think that if the mother knew that this 13 year old girl had, you know,  clinical depression and or emotional problems, then she should have said,  hey, she hurt my daughter's feelings.  Give her a break.  She's got her own problems.  Let me stay out of it.  That's what she should have done.  Yeah.  Because it's childish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is a different story than the one where there was a video chatty going on and  there was a suicide done and they were egging them on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's another story.  That actually, yeah, that's a completely different story, although I guess kind of related.  That's the Justin.TV, you know, and I decided last week not to cover that story particularly  because, you know, these things happen all the time.  People commit suicide in public and I don't want to cover it only because  I don't want to give people any more reason to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  If we cover it.  The only thing about that one that I saw as really nasty was the, not so much the suicide part of  it, which was obviously unfortunate and really horrible situation, but the people were,  whether they were serious or not, they were egging him on and saying, just do it, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you've seen that when people, I see it in movies.  I presume it happens in real life.  People get out on a ledge.  There's always somebody below saying, jump, jump, jump, right?  I've never seen this happen.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I never seen anybody yelling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's only in Superman movies, so maybe it's not true.  And then Superman flies and he catches them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Justin TV suicide.  They were egging him on.  You should do it.  But I don't think anyone said that thinking that it would really happen.  This is just, I think this is this whole anonymous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think it's the same thing with that woman and her daughter.  I think, I don't think, I mean, she may have known she was depressed and the depressive or  whatever, but I don't think she ever intended for the girl to kill herself.  She just wanted to give her feelings really bad.  Yeah.  I mean, cause you know, she apparently was in this case.  Here's what I didn't work out for her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Here's what I'd heard about the kid who killed himself was that he had said he was going to  do this several times.  And I think that one thing that does happen, I see this in our chat, people get fed up.  They go, yeah, okay, dude, just whatever, do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Crying wolf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that that's probably what happened.  But then I guess this happened in England last month.  The reason to bring this up is to remind people that sometimes, in fact, always a  threat to kill yourself should be treated as a real threat.  And it, you know, immediately, you know, contact suicide prevention, get the person help.  Right.  Regardless of what you think, oh, crying wolf, he's done it before.  It should always be taken seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because even if they're not going to do it, you know, normally people don't go around  telling other people that they're going to kill themselves.  Yeah.  So there's probably some sort of an issue at heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, did you guys, did you guys, did you guys, what, how did you follow the terror attacks  in Bombay and Mumbai?  Did you, how many of you followed it on Twitter?  Anybody?  I was, I was, I was doing some term searches, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  What was that whole, you know, they were saying don't Twitter about it because maybe the  terrorists are on Twitter and are finding things out.  I wasn't quite sure why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And there was some concern about inaccuracy on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I heard a lot of discussion about the Blackberry messaging, not the, not the, you  know, there's that separate Blackberry messenger that there is.  Right.  That was a big help actually that one of the hostages was directing and giving information  from one place on the Blackberry messenger and it helped to, you know, save the situation.  I mean, I watched it on Bloomberg and New York Times on my iPhone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I listened to CNN audio using an iPhone radio because I was driving for most of that time  and driving down for Thanksgiving and it, you know, I love internet radio, man.  You can listen in your phone and your car to anything.  And I was getting much better coverage than I was getting on the local news stations by  doing that.  But I did not, I didn't follow it particularly on Twitter.  I think I, I did do that.  Sir, I use Twitter search to kind of see what was, what was going on and people were tagging  it with the hashtag Mumbai so you could easily find it.  What's interesting is that we can really hear from people who are right there now, not from  through the filter of the news, but directly through things like Twitter, Facebook, MySpace.  And that's an interesting corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's what I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's new and weird.  And, and I don't know, you know, some people CNN calls it their citizen journal.  Yeah.  Some people call it the first draft of history or first draft of the news, unfiltered.  I think in some, some respects that's inaccurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you could lead to some real problems there.  We saw what happened with the CNN situation where there was the story about Steve Jobs again.  Yeah.  You know, the user story and, you know, I think that I don't know if it's a combination  of laziness on the part of journalists these days and, you know, just, just wanting, you know,  when I get called, it used to be, there was a lot of questions.  No, I have to prepare stories now.  You know, I don't know what the John, do you know, you see that?  What's it seems like that, you know, the journalists are relying on the,  the quote unquote experts for everything now and they'll just chop it up and  put it under their name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oftentimes that's been going on for a long time.  That's actually was forced on the community long, long ago by the, the J schools who decided that  journalists have to maintain a completely objective and detached approach to the, to their  discussion of a new story.  And that means you have to give and you were required to always get three people to comment  on the story.  Somebody that was on one side of the issue and somebody that was on the middle.  How old fashioned is that?  I'm just telling you.  And it's somebody that was on the opposite side and that is still in play in most newspapers.  And so what is it really?  Yeah.  And for the finally, that's, you start to, if you break down a news story in the New York  Times or any place else, you'll see there'll be, there'll be at least three people quoted  and they have these three different opinions.  And then you, you kind of, you know, the, if the journalist has to, wants to push you  in a certain direction, so far as what he wants you to think, they have to kind of cheat  by having, you know, somebody, you know, the way you normally would do it.  If you wanted to cheat, you'd have somebody's, you have a position you want, you want to push.  So you find somebody who's extremely reasonable and you get their quotes and then you find  somebody who's kind of neutral, but kind of leaning in that direction.  You get a complete insane maniac who's obviously just completely, he's a psychopath.  And then you have him take the opposite side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And in some ways that's worse because you've given the appearance of objectivity.  You know, you've kind of implied that, well, look, we gave you, you know, we gave all three  parties the right to speak. And this is what you see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've always had problems with the, with the model because, you know, I always say, well,  what about Hitler? What would you have like a guy was pro-Hitler.  How do you balance that? Yeah.  How do you balance the story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm okay about the Fuhrer. He's not so great, but he's, you know, he had some good ideas,  but then some bad ones. Oh geez. Now I'm really in trouble. Can we?  You know, I cannot believe you're going down this road again.  This is not so good. This is so bad. I'm trying to make, I'm trying to make Hitler, I mean,  Kevin Rose feel better. I'm just really, I'm sorry. I had too much coffee. It's all my fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the media, just to get back to, you know, I think I was talking to you about this last night.  You know, the media I was on last two weeks ago, I guess was a Fox business.  And I was asked to come down to the quick satellite uplink on the unions and on the  auto industry. And I'm in the, I'm in the chair waiting, waiting for the, the, the time to come  where I'm going to be interviewed by Stuart Varney, the English fellow on, on, on Fox business.  And he says, and when we get back from the top of the hour, we're going to have an advisor,  an expert who believes that the unions are entirely to blame 100% failure in Detroit.  And I'm thinking to myself, who's that idiot? Who'd say something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You Andrew, you. Exactly. Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they painted you into a corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeez. And I said, no, I said size 10. If you're wondering about the size for the cement shoes,  you know, Mr. Hoffa, I'm here. It was unbelievable. He was badgering me

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and he was taking this one side for unions. You see it on TV news. And that's why I'm  surprised to hear you say, John, that there still is in print. There still is this attempt  to do this balance thing. In fact, as soon as Obama was elected, I started to see among all  the right-wing talk show hosts and on some television news. Oh no, does this mean the  fairness doctrine is back? Television news has really become very partisan, whether it's MSNBC  on the left, Fox on the right, even CNN really is starting to look partisan with people like Lou

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dobbs on. Well, they, you know, that's how you get ratings. Exactly. The ratings really make  make you what you are. And if you can't get your ratings out, no matter how objective you are,  I mean, you can still watch the the, you know, the news hour. Maybe you should be McNeil there.  Even that's not, you know. Yeah, I know. That's a little left too. But I mean, it's hard. I  wouldn't call it objective. I think some people, but they, at least it's, you know, at least it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  plays the game. They make an effort. And I guess that's the question. Is the,  is the appearance of objectivity just the appearance? Is there really any way to be truly balanced?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I'll talk about the financial side of things. I mean, these guys are not balanced. You  know, every, every time a report comes out that doesn't look good, we start hearing about silver

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  linings. CNBC is fun to watch because it's really interesting to watch CNBC. What would you say the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  bias is at CNBC? It's definitely a bullish bias. No question. Invest. Yeah, absolutely. Because if

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you get out of the market, you're going to stop watching. Years and years ago, they, in the 90s,  during the dot com era, I talked to a couple of these analysts types that got onto CNBC  and they were essentially, if they had any bullish perspective whatsoever, they would never get  invited back. I'm sorry, bearish. If they had any bearish negative perspective whatsoever on anything,  they would never get invited back. Now I recently visited CNBC and chatted with some of the  producers over there because I go on CNBC once in a while and mentioned this story and say,  yeah, they all admit that this was the case, but now they claim, and I think to some, I think there's  a little truth to it that they're a little less, you know, just, you know, kind of bull crazy because  they're having as much fun and they probably have realized what is happening, what they've realized  at MarketWatch because I talked to my editor there and he said that he said this and I think it  applies across the board. He says when things are really crappy like they are now, people flock to  these sites. He says their numbers are through the roof and CNBC has got to have the same thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  going on. Yeah. I mean, my website, the, when it's fascinating, my book and my website spike  in the worst of days in the market. It makes sense. Yeah, it's unbelievable. Well, people are looking

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  for answers. They're looking to go, what's going on? One more story. I just want to mention that,  the Twitter story, apparently true, according to all things D, the bastion of expertise in the  digital world, Wall Street Journal, Facebook was in talks to buy Twitter for as much as half a  billion dollars. Now, I'm not sure who said no. I've read stories that said Twitter said no and

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've read stories that Facebook said no. Now what, now Twitter, oh, how great it is. By the way,  I'm up to 1500. I'm rocking. I'm almost catching you, Leo. John, I'm on your, I'm on Sarah. How

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  many do you have? How many, how many Twitter? I have as of right now, 10,942. Whoa, dude. I'm such  a loser. 10,000. Well, you have what, like 90 million? I see why people are so preoccupied

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with these numbers. I really don't think you should be that way. They obviously says the real

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  DeVore. I'm trying to figure out how much this whole thing is worth. Is it possible that somebody's  going to buy a non-revenue producing, I mean, what's so great about Twitter? I mean, can't anybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  copy what Twitter is doing? Well, they have, many have. John, what you used to have a number for  audience, converting an audience into dollars. What is, what is a website worth based on the  number of subscribers it has? $20 a head. $20, really? Yeah. And, and conservatively,  how many active users does Twitter have? Maybe 100,000? Oh, I think there's got to be a heck of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a lot more than that. Really? Active users, more than that? A million? I think a quarter of a million

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  would probably be a good number. Okay. So then they're really only worth. 50% of the whole audience,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you guys. Wow. That's impressive. So, well, I mean, if they go by the subscribers, you know,  that $20 number and then active is a different number. Oh, it is. My understanding is just that  if you're, if you got, if you got a million subscribers, your company should be worth,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you know, $20 million or something like that. So let's be, let's be optimistic. Let's say they

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  got a million. By the way, that's a low number there. I've seen the thing fluctuate to a hundred

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dollars a head. Well, look at it. Look at the Facebook valuation. I don't know what that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that was something like a hundred or something. It was, I had all these, I did a  column and I broke all these numbers down. I can't remember them all off the top of my head, but

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's a whole bunch of formulas out there. So I'm, so I'm looking one on 500 million is crazy  then. Cause 20, 20 million is would be more realistic or 50 or 50 maybe. But wasn't the whole

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  thing because of Facebook stock valuation not being what it was, it would have ended up being  somewhere around like maybe one 20 and Twitter said, no way that's way too low. Twitter didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  want Facebook stock. Right. If you'd give them cash, they'd say, okay. But I mean, even with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what they figured out, you know, the number would have actually been, they felt that it was an  insultingly low. 120, 120, not good enough. I won't take it. You know, 20 million, definitely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not good enough. Yeah. This is for a company with one server. Yeah, I'm like, feels like that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter pretty, that says over capacity. They have a special fail well server just to, just to serve  the fail well message. I don't know. I don't know. If I, you know, I would take anything that they  offered me at this point of our Twitter, to be honest with you still haven't figured out how to  monetize the darn thing. It's very popular. It's probably at its peak now. Don't you think  Shaquille O'Neal? Well, who was it that we said, oh, we always said when Paris Hilton gets a Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  account. That was always my comment. Well, but that will be the end. That will be Twitter jumping

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the shark. I have to know. But Brittany is on Twitter and it didn't do nothing. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that's her. That's the point. It's totally not her. I agree with John in this particular situation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes it's her. Sometimes it's her people. It's no, I don't believe it's ever her. Okay.  Shaquille O'Neal is the real Shaquille O'Neal. How do we know that? Because if it's his people,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they should really get a dictionary. I would like to think that it's Shaq. I've got nothing  against him. I think he's a cool dude. The underscore real underscore Shaq. Yes. He has a  lot of followers. I think it's definitely him. 14,440 followers. He beat me? Well, screw that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's got to be Shaq. I think maybe when some of the tweets become a little bit more  informational and not so much, I'm going to the bathroom right now or I'm sitting down having

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  tea and crumpets. I don't think you care if it's really the real Britney Spears or the real Shaquille.  I do. I do. Does it have to be informational? It could just be like what you're up to. I even  care that it's not the real Barack Obama. No, no, no. I know you care, but I'm saying it doesn't  matter what the content is. If it's really the real Shaq, that's cool. It's very cool. You don't  care what he's saying. If you say I'm in the toilet, that's fine. You say personal, sometimes stupid things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't understand that at all. But you're not a fan of the real Shaquille O'Neal. I don't think

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anybody wants to know. I think the whole idea of even visualizing Shaquille O'Neal in the toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh my God. He's got a special throne. I guarantee you. It's the you're one of us thing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that can be for a lot of things, but Twitter particularly, I think. But how many times over  the real Shaq is going to at reply to me. I'm going to, you know, I don't know, feel kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  proud of myself or something. I don't know what the big deal of it is. I don't know. Everybody puts  their pants on the same way. You say that because your numbers are so horrible. I thought we weren't  counting numbers a moment ago. Which way are we going? Which way are we going? It's bouncing.  Andrew Horowitz, Twitter. Let's bring it up to 2000. Are we doing this? Yeah. You're Sarah Lane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, Sarah Lane. John's the real Dvorak with no underscores. There's where Shaq went wrong.  Oh, he did. He didn't just go the real Shaq. He went the real Shaq with underscores. But  the real Shaq. There's plenty of Shaqs, but he's the real Shaq with underscores. You're the real

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dvorak with no underscores. And I'm Leo Laporte. And I still can't log in on this computer for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  some unknown reason. To Twitter? Yeah. When it says wrong username password combo, if that's what  you're getting, just keep going. It does that to me every single time. Really? Every single time  it says, oh, wrong one. And then I just go in and then it goes through. It's a bug. It's been there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  since day one. Clear your cookies would be my advice. By the way, Leo, I cleared the cookies.  We already went through this. We did it all live. This happens on every computer I'm on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Didn't happen. It is a Twitter bug. You heard it here. All right. They're not even worth 20 million

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in that case. John Cleese only has 12,957 followers and he says funny things. Who's the number one?  Since when? Oh, he's funny. I think he's kind of funny. I like the Cleese. Stephen Fry. The number  one is Barack Obama, but he hasn't posted since the election. I don't think, I think that's,  I think they took his BlackBerry. I don't think we're going to see more of Barack on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, or if we do, we know it's really not him. And I'm just, I'm hoping that he makes Kevin

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rose secretary of, you know, commerce. And then I, and then- I would like to be Barack's community  manager. That's okay. Kevin won't show up. Doesn't matter. They'll take away his Twitter and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll be number one. That's all I care about. Let's see. It was, I just, I just, I don't know. I,  I find it very annoying getting, you know, things about someone just constantly. I'm walking through

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the park. I am now finished. I'm kind of over Twitter. I'm kind of over Twitter. You know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the problem is, is that because of the no, you know, ability to silence people and because I know  that, so I'm friends with certain people, right? Well, I'm friends with a lot of people, but  there's people that, you know, we're mutually following each other because we're friends in  real life and they're the worst Twitterers in the world. I mean, everything they say, I just

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  want to chew my arm off. But you can't not follow them because they're your riffs. That's just what I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  have unfollowed and I feel bad about it, but there are other people where I feel like I just have to  take it. And that is- So you're saying there's coyote ugly Twittering? Oh, the worst, the stupidest  things. I mean, you really just, you know, it's like, I don't know. I wish I had the- Now can I

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just read your bio on Twitter? I am a small treacherous ball of steel. Well, I am. Okay.  I am. I am. A ball of steel? She's a small treacherous ball of steel. Yeah. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I said that once a long time ago and it stuck. I kind of like it. Thank you. I kind of like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. It's kind of hot. Well, if you like small treacherous balls of steel. Steel.  And a cold and- I admit- Oh, steel. I thought you said seal. No, steel. Like metal. I admit to also

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  saying, having dumb tweets, but people can unfollow me. No problem. I just hate the, you know,  the feeling that you've got to read this stuff. And so you're thinking about this person all the  time because you're seeing these stupid things that they're saying. It's maddening. This show

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  jumped the shark about an hour ago, but that's okay. I was going to say the same thing, but I  was going to do it in the timeframe of months. No need. I get that message every single show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Somebody goes into the forum. Every single show. I post a thread that said, this was when Twit

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  jumped the shark. I had somebody, you know, I was looking at some, I was doing some vanity searching  on something or other for some reason. And I ran into somebody, I wrote another column somewhere  and somebody said, Dvorak jumps the shark again. You can only jump at once. How can he jump the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  shark again? You can only jump at once. Can I ask a technology question? Yes, please.  Do you have one? So, you know, I think I told you a while back that I did,  what do you call it, jailbreak my iPhone. Yeah. Did you do it by the way? Did you finally do it?  I don't feel the need. There's some cool things on there. There's some cool stuff, but there's also,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I feel like it's slowed down and like, and you can't put the new 2.2 on and so it just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  screwed up. Just go back here and I'd go back. I don't think there's enough coolness in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  broken version anymore. There used to be when you couldn't put applications on it. There really was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was like one or two things that I really liked, like the untethered, you know, for my  computer. We can have the wireless if you will, a modem, but that's about it. Yeah, it's not that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  much. It's not that much. Hey, we as usual should end the show by mocking people. And here's a  statistic from the Leichtman Research Group, their sixth annual survey on whether people can tell  standard deaf from high-deaf. 18% of people who own HDTV cannot tell if they're looking at high-deaf  content or not. In fact, many of these owners don't even have high-deaf content. Well, that's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they think they're watching it. Well, that's, yeah. I mean, I would assume that's pretty common.  Well, I have an HDTV. This is HD, isn't it? That's it. What do you mean, signal? In June,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  in June, like a few months ago, half of HDTV owners didn't even know what Blu-ray was

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because that bizarre what it must be there must be a lot of people are buying the TVs  just because it's, you know, either digital or it's what's on market and I don't know what's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  coming. I blame the media. I think it's the media's fault. Yeah, I like that voice. I need that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If they only would ask somebody on the left, somebody on the right, somebody in the middle,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  we'd understand this stuff better. I can say honestly that 90% of my friends have never even  heard the term Blu-ray. That's weird. We live in a bubble, don't we? Well, I mean, it's kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  important to realize that. We are not. It's a good bubble. We are not your average. I enjoy the bubble.  Yeah, I prefer the bubble. I don't even want to talk to anybody out of the bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't like them. Like, Leo's the new boy in the plastic bubble. I am. I'm the boy in the bubble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Please don't infect me with your ignorance. I should have mentioned this earlier in the show.  I got to put a message out there to our listeners. Please do. I got a package the other day of some,  a bunch of very specialized steaks frozen with a bunch of dry ice from a packing company in  Pennsylvania. They had a tenderloin and some other pieces of meat. How do you get on that mailing list?  Somebody's sending me meat. But the problem is I get the sneaking suspicion that it was supposed  to be sent with like a note or something. So if you send John some meat. Don't eat the meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, did I get it to the right address? The dry ice, like did like, was it like the fog

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  seeping out of the box? Yeah, the dry ice is cool. It was still in there. I mean, it shipped all the  way down and there was still a chunk of dry ice, which I immediately threw into a bucket of water  and watched it bubble away with all that water vapor. As these $400 worth of steaks melt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what Omaha used to come that way. Alright, so it's, as long as we're talking about  Gimmies, it's a Mono Chocolate time. Remember we were talking about that great chocolate  that somebody sent us. And of course, they listened to the show, the folks at Mono Chocolate,  they sent us more. I'll be up there next week. Oh yeah, John loves this stuff. Well, actually,  there's only one of them that I like. Well, this is a whole new tasting batch. So we have Madagascar.  What do we got here? Sarah's actually going to leap over the counter. I might. We have Gimbrana,  or we have Acumare. Or you can have a Brownie. No, no, have the chocolate. Have the chocolate.  Well, okay. Tell me which one you want because I can read to all the different. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they're all handcrafted dark chocolate. That's well, how do you know the difference?  You have to face it. They're all distinctively different. They're extremely different from

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  one to the other. You got a box of these, right, John? Yeah. I'm trying to find the guy's name. I'm  so sorry. Well, you got to give the poor guy credit. Chocolate is just the best thing in the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  world. This is the best chocolate you ever had. I mean, just looking at it, I'm already excited.  It's like an addict. Well, I tried that other one. The Silicon Valley guy, one of these guys

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  did a chocolate company and they're bringing out. That's another one. Yeah. Generic. Those aren't  very good. I think this is a little better. Yeah, I think so too. I'm going with the Acumare. All

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right. Let me just read to you a little bit before you taste it. From the Valley of Venezuela.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the central coast of Venezuela, it's a remote valley known as Acumare de la Cuota.  This region of the world has been known for its superior criolla cacao since the early 1700s.  We carefully roast the hand selected beans with bring from this valley. I think that's a typo.  With bring from this valley. I don't know what bring is. Our aim to develop the many unique  notes and tones. It's like a Wonka bar. Deep inside within. I got a golden ticket. When you  taste the award winning chocolate flavor we make from these beans, you will find fruity and floral  notes that pair well with its rich chocolate flavor. Whoa. You might taste. Yeah, you could be  like a professional voiceover guy one day. Cordoba, the fine Corinthian chocolate. You might taste a  raisin note in it. You might also pick up a slight smoky and woody notes. Raisin. It's starting to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sound like a Cuban. Thank you. This is our flagship bar. No raisins. You picked the right one. This  is long. That is the good one. I think that is the good one. I really just picked it. I don't know why.  There's Madagascar. On the net. There's Collagua. Yeah, it's AMANO. AMANOchocolate.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow. Is that good? They should be sponsoring the show. I don't care. If they send me chocolate,  that's good enough. Well, you know, if Howard Stern said that to the Snapple people, I don't  think he'd be in the same situation. That's a good point. Half a billion dollars. Wow. That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that good? It's not made up. We're not making this up. No. Have you all ever, I'm sorry to  interrupt the chocolate tasting. Have you ever tried these Martin Pretzels from Pennsylvania?  I know this is kind of an off. No. Are they a special kind of pretzel? Oh, they're so good.  I was in New York and I was in Union Square Park and they had these pretzels. They're,  they're, they're, you know, the big fat like beer pretzels kind of thing. Soft pretzels.  Food show. Soft pretzels. Well, we had those. The best pretzel I ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Best pretzel I ever had. Philadelphia. They have the market, you know, in Philadelphia, downtown  there. The ladies, the Amish ladies with the little lace hats, they make them. They're beautiful.  They're soft dough. They dip them in melted butter and then they salt them. The best thing I ever had  in my life. And they'd kill you if you ate them every day. Geez. I know. Okay. Well, jumping the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  shark was the theme a little while ago. So, uh, technology pretzels. No reason to stop now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to close this show with a, uh, should we sing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, let's do it. I think we need, we gotta close the show with some plugs here. Come on.

And obviously, Annap Curry and I talk about, uh,  he's actually got an interesting theory about, uh, the, um, one of the recent news stories that  he believes he doesn't believe in. Yeah, I know he's a little bit over the top,  but he's got some real good thoughts on the Mumbai thing. He thinks the whole thing is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  something, something, something he doesn't think 9-1-1 really happened.  He thinks that was a government plot. Adam Curry? Yeah. What do you mean 9-1-1 didn't happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How's that possible? He says the government did it. There's all sorts of, you know, you've seen

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  these websites. He says he's a truther. He has a, uh, but I don't think he's all the way on that  one. Uh, but that's beside the point. This, this stuff on Mumbai is quite good anyway. And I've got  a column coming out for that. I just did with a market watch, uh, that I'll probably run on Monday,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which says that the computer revolution is dead. Thank God we could, we could finally do that food  show. I've been dying to do all this time. What do you mean the computer revolution is dead? Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  once PC magazine went to all digital. Yeah, you weren't here last week. We talked a little  bit about that. That's really sad, isn't it? Well, it's not, I mean, they needed to do it and they're  still in business and doing fine online, but the print thing, they couldn't make, you know, that  you cannot, I was over at the PC world offices recently and they also have computer world in  there around the corner from Mevio as a matter of fact. And have you seen a computer world,  what they look like? No, it looks like a pamphlet. Yeah, it's sad. Well, it's because there's nothing  interesting going on. No, it's because. And I blame Sarbanes Oxley. It's not that it's because

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  everybody's gone to the net because nobody wants to wait a week to find out what the news was.  Oh, wait a minute. That's not going to work. Adam Curry at Mevio. I was over at Mevio recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How are they over there? Well, they seemed very nice and then they never called me back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't had that experience before. I'm still waiting for a call maybe a year later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Andrew Horowitz, ladies and gentlemen, you can reach him by going to thedisciplinedinvestor.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mm hmm. And might I suggest also the MSN Strategy Lab, if you follow me there, I'm up 18%.  Are you really? Are you number one now? I am number one by a very wide margin,  up 18% since August 1st, which is, you know, the market hasn't been doing well since then.  What's your strategy? It's a disciplined strategy. I think that I twisted your arm at one time and  told you about the market, right? Yeah, then I got back in. I didn't, I left an explicit message for  you not to do that. I know you did. My strategy is a few things. Actually, I write about it all the  time on MSN, but also, you know, because each time I do a transaction, I have to write the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  reasons and rationale. Yeah. It's a contest. It's a contest. Yeah. No, I didn't say why. I said you  have to explain why. I know why. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And then on thedisciplinedinvestor.com, I, you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  know, write about the different things that we're doing and, you know, exactly what's happening in  the markets. And needless to say, I wasn't and haven't been too excited about some of this,  but there is some great opportunities on both the long and the short side, but particularly  in some China and all that. So long story short is thedisciplinedinvestor.com is kind of the place

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that you can go to find all the other things. This is like the last hour of the Howard Stern show  where there's actually nothing going on except people plugging crap. What else is there to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it wasn't for Sarbanes Oxley, we wouldn't be doing this. It's all Sox's fault. We wouldn't have  to plug Sox Sox Sox Sox. Catch. I'm sorry. But by the way, right now as we speak,  the sun is setting exactly between the two spires of the Golden Gate Bridge right in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't forget tomorrow, by the way, you're going to see a once in many decade  conjunction of the moon, Venus and Mars. And they'll be as bright in the in the sky as they ever are.  It's quite a quite a sight if you've never seen it. I remember seeing it when I was three years  old and I've been waiting ever since for it to come back. Oh, yeah. Is Venus the North Star?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Venus is a planet. I know what people thought was the North Star. Well, people sometimes do

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  mistake Venus and Mars are the brightest. It's actually not Mars. I'm sorry. It's Venus and  Jupiter. You if you look just above Sagittarius, you'll see the moon, Jupiter and Venus  getting closer together. And Monday evening, December 1st, a slender crescent move,  15 percent illuminated will appear in very close proximity to the two brightest planets in our sky,  Jupiter and Venus. And let's start with you know what that means, right? Well, no, it means it's  going to be foggy. Yeah, pretty much guaranteed. But you could go out and look at it tonight  because it's you know, it's almost as close as it's going to be. It's pretty cool.  Sarah Lane is available online at sarahlane.com with an H.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, Sarah Lane, actually, I just I just moved over to Squarespace. So that's been sort of  exciting getting away from type had not joining their journalist blogging revolution.  Out of work journalist blogs. So weird. Yeah. I know I really like Squarespace so far. Still,  you know how when you put together a new blog design, you think it's going to be like a couple  days of work and it's like a month and things are wrong. And now my header apparently is blocked by

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know it's something. It's just it's always something. But it's been a good experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It looks nice. I'm liking how it looks. Yeah, I don't know if it's too girly and pink. I  just haven't figured it out yet. But anyway, it's been you know, fun. DNS issues aside,  a fun little experiment. So that's good. Of course, Twitter, Flickr and she'll get a job soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll get a job soon. Until then. Come on down to Florida. Are there jobs aplenty in Florida?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but come on down anyway. No jobs, no jobs. I mean, unless we could,  you know, we can take this podcast to the next level.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's podcasting thing is going to be huge. It's going to be someday podcasting will be just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  like radio. I tell you that I have seen more email coming in and more commentary and more  general discussion about how to this whole financial issue that the podcast and the blogs  have hit it pretty square on compared to the media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we're rapidly becoming the media. I don't think there's that much distinction  anymore. But we're fast, footloose and fancy free kind of media. And we have chocolate.  A reminder, you can catch all of our shows, not just Twit, but all of the Twit productions  for free at the iTunes store. Just search for Twit. And let's see, is there anything else I  need to say besides another Twit is in the can.  I don't know what I'm gonna do.
