And of course, the post CES show is always a mixed  bag made up of people who are exhausted and have nothing more to say about CES and people who didn't  go and were still bread-eyed and bushy-tailed. That's Serenity Caldwell in this case. You didn't  go right? I did not this year. I managed somehow to get it off. And I was I just got off a boat. So  I'm I'm rested but completely confused. And I'm still going like this. But look who's back from  CES Jason Heiner. He's a little. Hello. Hello, Editor-in-Chief Tech Republic. Welcome home.

Transcript:  sort of adjusting to the Eastern time zone. And we got to wrap this up because the Golden Globes  is on tonight. And I can't wait to see what a hash Ricky Gervais makes of it. He's already tweeted,  by the way. I can't show his tweet on the air because it's not it's highly impolite.  But I can show his picture. This is minutes ago, Ricky Gervais, who will once again host the Golden  Globes. And he says, time to get up, get dressed and perform for a bunch of humorless. And then he  says a very bad word indeed. Set in the stage for what should be a very good Golden Globes tonight.  At least he has a sense of humor. Yeah, no, but the awards themselves are kind of ridiculous  because it's the Hollywood Foreign Press Association. But it's the only award show  where people are drinking during before, during and after. So anything goes.  I bet Serenity, you seem like a Golden Globes enjoyer.

Transcript:  So CES, which stands for nothing in more ways than one. It used to be the consumer electronic  show. And then for reasons no one will understand the CEA, which also is renamed, I think renamed  itself, decided it doesn't stand for anything. It's just CTA. The CTA. No, CTA. Consumer  Technologies. Are they trying to confuse people? What is it? They don't like the word consumer

Start time: 301.14
End time: 322.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  electronics. Well, I think that it's been more consumer electronics. Sounds like, you know,  your VCR from the 1980s. You know, it's like, I think they're trying to embrace the fact that  everybody's that comes there and the vendors that come there are much broader. It's like really  dominated by the car companies this year, by the way, which is interesting because the Detroit

Start time: 322.54
End time: 334.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Auto Show is this week, which would be the natural place for car companies to go, except that they're  trying to pretend that they're not cars, but they're some electronics devices. They're computers on

Start time: 335.66
End time: 383.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  wheels. Exactly. Yeah. I think that was the major sentiment this year was that, you know,  the Detroit Auto Show would be a great launching pad for all the new like 2017 models and sports  cars from American brands. But the more interesting stuff is what's happening in the cabins and in the  motors of these vehicles. So for instance, the BMW i8, the Ford GT, some of these futuristic cars  were rolled out into the CES showroom. And yeah, I mean, I think, you know, people like me who aren't  or who are generally like not that interested in cars were actually attracted to these really  well-designed computers on wheels. As he said, it's a weird time to be looking at automotives.

Start time: 383.80
End time: 405.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the best of CES, and I'm sure at least according to Engadget, was in fact the Chevy Bolt, not Volt.  Bolt, which is the Bolt EV, yeah, electric vehicle with a 200 mile range, which is a lot for an  electric vehicle. So close to being what I want. And a $30,000 price tag. What's missing? Yeah.

Start time: 405.96
End time: 423.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  About 100 miles on the range. Yeah. I would say a nice design would be on my list. But I mean,  obviously it's great, you know, these electric vehicles that can drive a long distance are awesome,  but I don't understand why they can't just look like normal cars. I mean, this thing is closer to

Start time: 423.36
End time: 427.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a minivan than anything else. They do kind of all have to have swoopy doopy lines. Like they're trying to make them look a

Start time: 427.84
End time: 474.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  little futuristic, don't they? They're trying to make it. I mean, they're copying the Honda Fit,  they're copying in some ways the Prius C, although I think my Prius C looks heads and tails  better than that one. I mean, some of it is just, you know, design. It's Chevy trying to follow the  trend instead of set the trend, which is, eh, whatever. But, and also, you know, you have to have  something that's easily manufacturable on a grand scale. Because if they're trying, if they're  selling this as, this is our consumer electronics, our consumer EV car, like this is the car that  everyone, that's affordable for everyone, not just affordable for people who want to give EV a spin or  people who have enough money to pay for Teslas. They need it to be very, very cheap to manufacture  the chassis and the interiors because chances are they're still spending a buttload on battery and

Start time: 474.94
End time: 487.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  all of that nonsense. This is like a Tesla, the battery's all in the bottom, so, which gives it  good stability both for handling and just tippability. Yeah. And it was big. I mean, I think

Start time: 488.00
End time: 492.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it was clearly the biggest thing of the, of the show. Bigger than the Samsung refrigerator with the

Start time: 492.64
End time: 516.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  camera inside? Bigger than that? That got a lot of attention. It was. For reasons I don't understand.  I mean, it's not the first CES Samsung has introduced a computer refrigerator. It's probably the tenth.  Yeah. But this one has a touch screen. Oh, and you close the door and the light stays on because

Start time: 516.22
End time: 553.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  you got a camera. Well, you know, you can blame some of that to some of the inexperienced writers  and editors that were there, but I mean, I wouldn't consider that one of the best things that I saw.  If you're first CES, then maybe, but yeah, right. Yeah. I mean, yeah. Smart refrigerators. I think  people are generally interested to see like how quickly this stuff is going to be put into our  homes. And so, you know, it's nice to take a look at what's going on in those things and to pay  attention to how computers are being embedded in everyday objects. But like, you know, there would  be very few people that would actually tell you that was one of the biggest pieces of news. I think  it was all about virtual reality this year and, you know, self-driving cars and some of these new

Start time: 553.18
End time: 599.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  car features, like you were saying. Yeah. Yeah. The cool thing about the, you know, the car thing  was the biggest leap forward. I thought for the past few years, they've, and I wrote a story about  this, you know, called Self-Driving Cars Won the Week at CES 2016. You know, in the past years,  they've talked a little bit about these things, but, you know, a lot happened this year in this  space, both with kind of EVs and autonomous. I mean, Google in 2015, in the past year, Google  said they're going to have one ready for consumers by 2020, or that they think that there will be  consumer, you know, autonomous vehicles by 2020. Tesla had their big download, $2,500 download that  turned your Tesla Model S into a self-driving vehicle, or at least sort of the data version of one.

Start time: 599.34
End time: 606.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this weekend, Elon Musk said by 2018, your S will come to you automatically. Yes. He said,

Start time: 606.34
End time: 649.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  you know, he upgraded his prediction in, you know, this fall. He said, we're going to have the  technology ready in two years. And he said it'll take longer with regulations and those kinds of  things before they're in the hands of consumers. But he said the technology will be ready in two  years. And then there was also the rumor, of course, not just rumor, it was based on the Guardian  found these these documents, these public documents that showed that Apple was working on an  electronic vehicle that was also autonomous. And so, you know, I think the automakers felt a lot  of pressure because of that. And you saw it in spades. Every single one of them was demoing or  talking about their path to an autonomous autonomous vehicle. MN7 in our chat room says,

But I'm not now I'm thinking I'm looking at  this bolt. It's about a third the price. It's got almost the same range. It has CarPlay or Android  Auto, which the Tesla does not. And I think that's pretty important for me. And it has a rear view

Start time: 704.36
End time: 709.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  do you really want to be seen driving something that looks like that? Like the Chevy Bolt? Well,

Start time: 709.98

Start time: 716.26
End time: 726.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Really? Yeah. Yeah. This thing looks I don't I don't like the bolt. I don't. I don't like  the design. I mean, I don't understand why they couldn't shape it like a Toyota Camry or something.

Transcript:  Make it a sedan. This is a crossover, I think is the technical term. Yeah,  does have a lot of luggage space. What do they say? 500 cubic feet. That can't be right.  That's the size of a cruise ship. What? I must have that wrong.

Start time: 742.88
End time: 795.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One vehicle that sort of got overlooked was the that looks decent and is autonomous and an EV is  the Kia Soul EV. This is a I put a picture of it in the top of my article on self-driving cars.  But the Kia Soul EV Autonomous is actually being tested on public roads in Nevada this year. So  it's a it's an EV. It's autonomous. It's got a decent design because it's based on a real design  that's out there. And it's going to be you think this is good looking. Well, I don't think I think  it's better looking than the than the than the looks like a shoe. Yeah. Looks like the. Oh,  I hate the box. I hate it so much. The boxy is really in right now, right?  Yeah, it is. I know. The scion and the yeah. Totally. It's not my style.  So yeah, people love it or hate it in terms of the box.

Start time: 796.62
End time: 828.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ultimately, for EV, my like my big things are not necessarily style. I love looking at stylish cars.  But when it comes to actually buying a day to day vehicle, what I care about is reliability.  And I would love I mean, I've been driving a Prius for the last year and a half and I  I've become spoiled by gas mileage and I will never go back to an old gas car,  however pretty it looks. But when it comes to like I would love for my next car to be straight  EV, but it needs I need at least 250 mile range. Electric engines are more reliable,

Start time: 830.30
End time: 834.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but the batteries are still a little bit of an unknown. They're expensive to repair, too.

Start time: 835.46
End time: 914.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is this is kind of exactly what I said in my article, though, Serenity. This is what  you're getting at was actually I think the future. So cars have always been about style  and they're still about style to a degree. Obviously, we've been talking about, you know,  it in terms of what Leo wants to buy next. Yes, please. Let's talk about me.  The future of cars. I wrote in years. What I wrote was that the future cars are going to be  deformed defined more by soft software and algorithms than by steel and rubber. Right.  It's going to be these cars in the future are going to be shells for a lot of big data  and algorithms, deep learning, all kinds of, of course, the infotainment systems as well.  Cloud. It's going to really take until we get to, you know, we're not really going to get that  EV and that autonomous vehicle. Even the really great ones until there's probably 5G,  until there's, you know, the processing power is a little stronger. But it sets up really well for  all these chip companies because these cars are going to need an incredible amount of code,  an incredible amount of processing power. I mean, they already have a lot. Ford said this week that  the F-150 has one hundred and fifty thousand lines of code in it. And I said, well, how much does  that one have? They had the next. This was in their booth where they had their their self-driving  testing vehicle. And they said a lot more than that. They didn't even know.

Start time: 914.60
End time: 956.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One hundred fifty thousand is not that much, really. That's true. One hundred fifty thousand.  Windows is what? Fifty million or one hundred fifty million. So it's a huge amount. So  there's two things here. There's, of course, electric vehicles, which are that's being  furthered by federal regulation and new emissions rules. I mean, that's really being pushed. But  then there's also autonomy. And in some ways, it's interesting you mentioned Nevada, Jason,  because in some ways state governments are really mixed a mixed bag on this. Nevada is kind of very  autonomous friendly. California just made a rule that said that autonomous vehicles not only have  to have a steering wheel, a gas pedal and a brake pedal, but a driver in the car who's licensed to  drive an autonomous vehicle. They've made it very difficult. Yeah. There's a lot more people in

Start time: 956.50
End time: 961.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  California, too, right? Nevada is a lot. Yes. So big deal. Nevada is self-driving cars. Big deal.

Start time: 962.42
End time: 1030.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What you really want is urban air. My opinion is urban areas. We talked yesterday about this on the  new screensavers with Sam Abouma-Samid, who's a longtime automotive watcher. He writes about  automotive technology for Navigant. He's an analyst. And he was the opinion, and I thought  I'm interested in what you guys think of this, that the way that autonomous vehicles are going  to happen, but they're going to happen in an interesting and unique way that urban areas,  he said, you know, in London, you already have a kind of a no drive zone where you have to pay  extra to drive in this area. He said, what's going to happen? Singapore, too, what's going to happen  in these very dense urban areas is you're going to have an autonomous vehicle zone. Because the real  problem with autonomous vehicles is not the cars, the software, it's the humans driving the other  cars. So he said, what's going to happen is you're going to have autonomous only areas. You'll arrive  at the edge of this area, get out of your car, and an Uber or a Lyft or something will arrive to pick  you up. And you'll and that's what you'll use to navigate these urban areas. That makes a lot of  sense to me. It totally agree with that. Go ahead, Serenity. Yeah, no, it's it's heightened public

Start time: 1030.78
End time: 1079.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  transit in a way, except we're all going to be paying for it. It's essentially like taking a bus  or taking a train, except for the fact that now it may either be your car that's autonomous,  or you may be restricted to again, a park and ride. But instead of you, you know, you're parking  your car instead of getting on a train, you're getting into an Uber or you're getting into a  Lyft or you're getting into an Apple car or a Google car. I can absolutely see that happening.  And I'm actually not opposed to regulation. Like I'm not opposed to California's regulations  at present time. Because when we think about what what autonomous vehicles look like at the present  day, including stuff like that, what Tesla is testing with the Model S, we're not in a position  where I think anybody feels comfortable having completely autonomous vehicles on the road that  don't have gas pedals that can't be taken over by. It's going to be a challenge for me to get in a

Start time: 1079.82
End time: 1093.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  living room on wheels and let it drive me somewhere. It's going to be a scary moment that first time.  Not so scary in a congested urban area where it's not going very fast and everything else is  autonomous. That's almost like you like getting in a train or getting in a monorail or something.

Start time: 1093.80
End time: 1110.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's not that's not as scary. Yeah, I mean, that's really easy to imagine. I mean, I feel like  Uber's presence in New York is I mean, it's everywhere. Everyone is using Uber. Everyone  I know is using Uber several times a week. There's some, by the way, there's some argument that all

Start time: 1110.58
End time: 1113.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  these extra cars on the road is one of the reasons why New York congestion has gotten worse, not

Start time: 1114.10
End time: 1142.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  better. Oh, yeah. Yeah, of course. Like when you consider the implications of big data, if you have  a lot of autonomous vehicles cooperating with each other, traffic will definitely decrease.  And yeah, I mean, right now, Uber is basically door to door service, right? So if I wanted to  get to my office to get ready for this podcast, taking an Uber from my door at my apartment to  to my door at the office and and you know, in the future,

Start time: 1142.76
End time: 1147.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  already, by the way, it's probably cheaper for you to do that than to own a car. Right. Oh,

Start time: 1147.90
End time: 1152.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and in the city. Absolutely. Yeah, of course. Yeah. Car ownership is very expensive in New

Start time: 1152.56
End time: 1157.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  York City because you have to park you have to insurance. Yeah. And insurance is higher

Start time: 1157.94
End time: 1200.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  than anywhere in the world in the county and so in the state, I mean, but but yeah, so so I think for  a lot of people that are already working in the city using Uber regularly, it's obvious because  they're you know, companies are already tracking this traffic information and they're using it in  services like Google Maps and in Uber and other other software. And so, you know, I guess my  version of the future is exactly that or sort of what I see is exactly that but just without the  driver, you know, instead of having these small talk conversations with people that are have been  driving for years or are already using Uber. No driver, please. You know, in the future, I'll be

Start time: 1206.60
End time: 1278.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  might feel safer in a driverless vehicle. Really? Yeah. I mean, there is some a real advantage to  being picked up at say, you know, 11 or 12 at night and not having to get into a car with a strange  guy. Yeah, the point. Yeah. Well, when I when I'm in San Francisco, you know, Uber is pretty much a  necessity if you're if you're getting around and you're a guest in San Francisco or a taxi.  But lately, I've actually requested like the black cars as opposed to Uber X's just because it, you  know, they're usually licensed, licensed delivery companies. So it's a little bit. It's a little bit  more for us of a safety thing. But Uber is interesting to me. You know, I heard a fact,  I wish I knew the origin of this and I can't. So it's I don't have the data on it. But I was  in a conversation with a friend who told me that Uber makes a map of the city every time it drives  around in seven seconds at the beginning of 2015. And they were trying to get that down to four,  which is really like when you think about how fast like how fast being able to map a city when you  have that many cars on the road and what that might mean for autonomy and working with working  with roads, it's just it's incredible. Exactly. And it's the private data that are gathering all

Start time: 1278.68
End time: 1316.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  of this information. You don't forget, you know, Waze is another big company that has a lot of  traffic information. And all of this is going into the hands of private companies that have  business interest in lowering traffic and getting people to their point of destination faster. So I  think that, you know, the infrastructure, it's just an infrastructure issue. I think the technology on  the technology side, like it's all there. Our GPUs are fast enough to process this information.  There have been live demonstrations of autonomous vehicles for several years now, and they're only  going to get better. So I think, you know, the price has to come down for the average consumer.  And obviously, they have to start making these things for everyone to buy. But

Start time: 1317.76
End time: 1327.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well, but that's what's interesting. I think it may also be the end of personal car ownership,  ultimately. Right. Yeah. It'll be a luxury. It's a luxury. Yeah. It'll be a huge luxury. I mean,

Start time: 1328.34
End time: 1344.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  when I talked to the automakers, they said actually what we started this conversation with,  which is that the first place you're going to see these is in fleets, that they're going to be  really expensive. They're not going to be meant for average consumers to start with unless you're,

I think that that's, by kind of underlining that though, and what Michael  said is, and every time I've talked to autonomous experts, including a few years ago, a Google guy,  they've told me, the technology's there. That's not the problem. It's psychological, it's governmental.  You know, there are other issues, but we've got the technology to do this. Yeah. Honda was talking

Transcript:  about when I met with them last year, they were talking about this vision that they had for this  in commuter areas, these super fast lanes with autonomous vehicles that sense each other.  They could go 100 to 120 miles an hour. And they would they own but only autonomous vehicles could  go in there humans, the reaction time is not fast enough, right? But, but that people would be able  to commute. They felt like, you know, up to 150 to 200 miles a day. If we if we could have, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is going to be here without a doubt in five years, I think what's going to dictate what happens in  cities and what happens in rural areas is largely based on how they can how they can show regulators  that the tech is a safe, be can make the moral decisions of like, let's say I'm coming around  a cliff. Don't get the moral. Oh, no, no, no. That's the that's the scary part, right? You're  going on a cliff, a kid walks in front of you. Do you save the tiny human and go off the cliff and  die? Or do you kill the tiny human and save yourself? Like, that's it. That's a that's a  moral dilemma that unfortunately, it's really hard for a car to. Yeah, exactly. Exactly. And those  kinds of things. Granted, that's an that's an obscure case. And we're talking about a rural  situation here. But that's still those are the kinds of things that regulators have to think  about when they're when they're saying, yes, we will allow autonomous cars everywhere,  because everywhere means, you know, does the random remote rural areas.

And did see,  okay, this might be politically charged for you. Did CNET give up the best of CES to  Engadget this year? I think they did. That was last year. Last year. Yeah.  Because AOL spends a lot of money on CES. And of course, Engadget's AOL. Big lobby studio.

These big trade shows don't  have long for this world. And yet, CES seems to buck that trend. I don't know. Yeah, it does.

Transcript:  I would say it's busier this year than it was last year. I, you know, there are a lot of haters.  Out there and that's AES is irrelevant. But I would say it's the best place to find just  demonstrations of the most cutting edge technology. So you might not get your new iPhone,  but you are going to see things like gesture controls and cars and virtual reality headsets  and a lot of different augmented reality headsets. And so if you're able to see all of that,  you should be able to make determinations about when to expect all of this stuff to hit consumers.  And so for me, it's hugely helpful. Okay, fair enough. I still find it useful. There's a lot

Start time: 1718.90

Transcript:  don't really mean anything. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. The cool thing about CES to me is it always feels a  little bit Walt Disney-ish. It always feels like World of Tomorrow, you know, let's go to the Expo  World's Fair. There aren't, you know, World's Fairs don't exist anymore. They're kind of an old world  thing. But CES very much feels like a World's Fair to me, where all of the best and brightest, you  know, the best and brightest of technology from big giant companies to little bitty places in Shenzhen  all come together and they're like, here, here's what we have. Here's what we've been playing with.  And of course, there are companies that don't go to the shows anymore, but they have their own events  that it's very, it's very easy to find out, you know, what Apple's doing next, because Apple will  let you know when it's ready to announce something. Right. You don't need to go to CES for Apple.  No. But if you want to, you know, if you want a wide swath of like what's going, what are the trends  in home automation? What are the trends in cars this year? What are the trends in television? It's  a really good show to get trends and just see goofy stuff. Like there's a lot last year when  I was there, there were so many robots, so many adorable robots that I was just like, you know,  I may never have any of these in my house, but I'm so glad that I get to walk them, walk among rows  of rows of like really ridiculous robots and like see a see a R2D2 that can also be a beer fridge.

Please, those of you just returning from CES, do not listen to  this next commercial. It might put you to sleep. The rest of you, I want to tell you about my mattress.  Casper mattress. Not only did I sleep on a Casper mattress, I slept on Casper pillows last night.  They sent me some pillows as a, I guess a Christmas gift. I don't know. Man, I'm in heaven.  So jealous. Oh, they're nice. Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses made in the USA,  and because they don't have showrooms, it's a fraction of the cost. They actually come to you  in a box, really surprisingly small box. You open it up and you got a mattress. Combining latex and  memory foam. Now, I almost don't want to say that because I think sometimes people have preconceived  notions from experiences with other mattresses. The way they've done it is amazing. It's cool.  It's not, it breathes. It's not too shmushy, but it's not too firm. It's really, you got to try it.  And the nice thing is you can for a hundred days, risk free. You could buy it online.  They'll send it to you in that nice box. You open it up, you put it on your bed. If you feel nervous,  keep your old mattress around. And anytime in that first hundred days, you call them. If you  don't like it, you call them and say, take it back. A courier comes, they take it back. They  actually donate it to a local charity and you're back to where you were at no cost to you. They  refund every penny, but that's just, I think, to reassure people because you're not going to do  that. You're going to love this thing. This is so much better than trying a bed in a showroom.  Sleep on it. Casper mattresses, $500 for a twin. Their biggest mattress, the king size, 950 bucks.  Compare that to a premium mattress at the mattress store down the street. You'll see this is a very  good deal. And it's even less if you use the offer code twit at casper.com slash twit will take 50  bucks off any mattress. Some terms and conditions do apply. Find out more casper. C-A-S-P-E-R.com  slash terms. I don't know what they're putting in those pillows, but they are phenomenal.  I need to try them. Really? You want to? I can get you, I can send you a pillow.

I have the crazy story about the mattress where we came back from vacation and the cat had  gotten locked in our bedroom and peed all over our old mattress. We had guests coming. So I actually  was like, well, we were looking at Casper anyway. Hey Casper, is there any way that I can get this  in like 40 hours because I have a guest coming and I would like her not to sleep on things.  Awesome. They express shipped me a thing and now we have a Casper mattress. Aren't they the greatest?

Transcript:  Nice service, nice people. I got a cat story for you. We went on, as you know, we were gone  for a week on a cruise and day one of the cruise, we get a call from Lisa's nephew who's watching  the house. The cats disappeared and we spent the whole cruise worried about the cat. They never  found the cat. They would put up posters everywhere. We got back, no cat. Lisa was going, Lisa is a  dedicated cat owner, my wife. She went out every night, every day looking kitty, kiki.  So like Wednesday she hears some meowing. The cat is on the neighbor's roof. She's been on the  neighbor's roof for 10 days. Couldn't figure out how to get down. The neighbor said, yeah,  we heard meowing. We couldn't. She survived though, even though pouring torrential rains.  I don't know, cats are kind of interesting critters. So I know that's, I sympathize with  your stories or anything. They can get everywhere. She's now an indoor cat. I might have. Not going  out. Lisa's decided, oh, she's a dumb cat. Some cats will not go places they can't get back from  this one though. It's not her first time. She got locked in the neighbor's garage earlier.  All right. Moving on CES. Open now, open panel. What else did you see at CES? Let me start with  you, Michael, since you're our virgin. What else did you see that was worth noting at CES this week?

Start time: 2085.08
End time: 2135.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wow. Big question. I would say by far and away, my favorite part of CES was trying out the new  virtual reality headsets. So there are three major ones, obviously Oculus, one from Sony that  connects to the PlayStation and then HTC is making one with the gaming company Val.  Called the Vive, correct. And so it was great to try all of those out and see how they  compared against each other basically. And to see where some excelled and where others didn't. And  all three will be released later this year, which is exciting. And I think it's going to be a pretty  big deal among gamers. Maybe not for the average consumer, but anyone that's playing first person  shooters on an Xbox one or a PlayStation is going to want to try gaming at the next level, which is

Start time: 2136.76
End time: 2145.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in virtual reality. I was a little disappointed because a couple of things happened. First of all,  I saw that announcement, the Oculus Rift was available. I think a little more than we expected.

Start time: 2146.48
End time: 2151.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 2153.55
End time: 2224.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $350 last year. Little expensive. And then they also mentioned that the touch, which I think is  fairly important and people who've used it say it is, not till the end of the year. That's delayed now.  And I tried all my Windows PCs. None of them are smart or powerful enough for the Oculus Rift. So  now I not only have a $599 Rift, but I got to, I'm going to, we're going to build a,  you got to get a PC. We're going to build a PC for at least a grand, at least a grand. We're going  to actually make us kind of top, we're going to make the ultimate VR gaming machine or a Vruger.  Nice. Because we used to do Uggums, remember on the, on the screensaver. So we're going to build that.  And then after all that, I found out I could have gotten a free one. I am getting a free one because  I kickstarted it way back when, and actually pray a little, a little pat on the back to Oculus for  doing this. Yeah. 20,000 or whatever early adopters who kicked in money at, on Kickstarter before  Facebook bought them. And, and I was one of them. We'll all be getting a free Oculus Rift. So that's  nice. So now I have two. If you want to use it twice. Well, there's social VR too. Don't forget,

And the worst was  Samsung had this big theater with, with full of it. I have a photo of it. Yes. On Instagram.  And it was like, when I posted it, I was like, this will never make you put on a VR headset.

Start time: 2252.34

Transcript:  wearing those stupid red and green glasses. It's even worse too, but because you see people like  they're looking around and they're looking up and then they're like, Oh, it's like,  I mean, you just look ridiculous. When you're, when you're wearing one of these things and you  see people like taking videos and they're playing the games and everything. I mean, it, it's just  socially, they are not meant to be used in company. I think only online company, virtual company,  unless they make one. I also tweeted this like on the last day of CES. One thing that was clear to  me was like, these things are not meant to be used in company unless they make one that looks like

Start time: 2314.72
End time: 2393.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So I've been following these pretty closely over the past year. And I would say the new HTC  Vive pre the second generation of their developer kit was the most impressive. They added this front  facing camera to the VR headset. So there's an element of mixed reality. Basically, if you  were playing in your living room and there was a coffee table in front of you or a chair or anything  else that you wouldn't want to bump into the VR headset would, would show you virtually. I like that  that you're getting near it. Yeah. So it makes it a lot more accessible to people. And also because  of the, that headset also has spatial recognition. So you mount these little,  these little IR blasters basically, and it's tracking your movement within the room. So you  can walk around, you can grab things in the virtual world, and you don't have to worry about bumping  into furniture or anything that you wouldn't want to knock over. And obviously their partnership  with Valve makes it really attractive to a guy like me because Valve makes some of the best video  games in the world and they're one of the best gaming distribution platforms in the world. And  I think that partnership matter a lot going forward, especially once people start sinking  like $1,200 into their VR machines and are going to want the most powerful and most immersive

Start time: 2393.46
End time: 2471.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  experience. So that was my conclusion. You like the Vive the best too. Yeah. Yeah. Our, our actually  we have a, a writer and editor, Aaron Carson, who's been writing about VR for all year has  tested all of them recently was at HTC at their headquarters up in Seattle and tested the recent  one and then tested the new one. They released at CES has tested all of them. And her conclusion is  the same is that technically in terms of the technology, the Vive is the best one. It also  frame rate and hand controllers. I don't think it's frame rate. I think it's, it's content.  I think it's also controllers on their controller. They have the controllers like the, the ones that  like the touch controllers, the, the, the, the Oculus ones, but they already have them. They're  going to come out when the, when the device comes out in the first half of the year. And she said  they're easier to use. She's, you know, tested the, the half moon controllers, the ones that you're  talking about, the touch controllers. And she said they're much more complicated to use. There's  a lot more buttons. There's a lot more going on there. And also, you know, this is kind of what  we care about obviously is, is not to just the uses for gaming, but the uses for all kinds of

Start time: 2471.80
End time: 2488.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  other things, training and presentations. Yeah. But isn't it gaming that's going to just propel  this forward? I mean, really the gamers are the ones that are going to spend 500, 600 bucks on  this as an accessory. Isn't that really where- Enterprise will too. I mean, right. Enterprise

Start time: 2488.62
End time: 2553.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  will too. If it's getting you into, you actually saw this at CES, there was a, there was a couple  of these smart home companies that it was really hard, especially like at showstoppers and the  little shows, the shows outside the shows to show off their whole product, but they gave you a VR  headset and then that showed their product and it was actually quite effective. And so for uses  like that, I think you're going to see also healthcare is all over this education is all  over this. There's a lot of potential uses for these things and HTC is, is playing that game  better. They're off to a better start than Oculus. They're really looking at, they're taking that,  I think more seriously than what Oculus, Oculus is, which they're really focused on gaming, which is  what, you know, Palmer, Lucky and those guys have been focused on at the beginning. It's really the  hardcore gamer. So from that same point, I think HTC has a lot of potential too. Obviously HTC as  a company has some troubles and it's not as good of a patron for this, for the Vive as Facebook is  for Oculus. So you have to keep that in mind as well. Vive was the best gaming project, a product

Start time: 2560.74
End time: 2699.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  is what I described as the feature that prevents you from bumping into things in your living room.  So a chaperone sort of comes into the game. It doesn't fully remove you from your virtual world.  I like that, but watch the table. Yeah. Watch out for the table. Yeah. I mean, it's a serious,  it's a serious problem when you're asking people to set aside room for, you know, most people don't  have a room that they can dedicate to virtual reality. So they're going to be playing them in  their living rooms and to accommodate for that is a smart move. And just back to this gaming  versus enterprise thing, I mean, I think there will be, of course, enterprise use cases for a lot of VR  headsets, but for the most part, I think you're going to see augmented reality and mixed reality  making use of, I'm sorry, used in a lot of enterprise settings and for productivity,  I think virtual reality, because it's so immersive and because it removes you from the room, I think  in a lot of cases, you're going to see them use for entertainment. So whether it's watching a movie  and feeling like you're the only guy in the theater or, you know, in a war zone in a first  person shooter or even just, you know, light drawing, you know, which is a really fun thing  to do in the vibe because you can walk around your drawing and see it in 3D. And that type of stuff  is really exciting. But again, you know, those are all entertain, those are all forms of entertainment.  They haven't really demonstrated how you might use this to practice surgery or something. And of course,  that will be available. But I think what I have seen is like a lot of big companies are more  interested in translucent displays that allow you to merge digital information with real world  information. So, you know, if you're performing surgery, let's say you might have digital  information overlaid on your practice dummy or on a human or, you know, as you're watching someone  do surgery. Whereas VR, it's just because of the controllers and because of some of the limitations  with how you use your hands and how you interact with the virtual environments. I think for the  most case, there's a limitation there. You just won't see a lot of productivity uses for  these VR headsets and certainly social VR.  Training.

Transcript:  No, look, I said this while I was giving some tours at CES. And of course, that's the thing  everybody wants to ask about because that's what you think about when you think of CES.  And I said, look, if you're in the market for a TV, do not buy a 4K. Don't even buy a 4K right now.  Not now. There's no content and no standards.  Exactly. There's no content. There's no standards. It's going to be two years before it's really  a thing. Who wants to watch House of Cards in 4K anyway? It's like it's not a great... That's  one of the only really great shows in 4K and it's not something that's well suited to it.  So yeah, I think the TVs were cool. Like HDR, 4K, they look as good. They look incrementally  better than they did last year, but it's kind of hard to get excited about it because it's  just going nowhere for a little while still. So no, I wasn't really excited about the TVs.  I thought one of the things, and obviously this is a hazard because of the stuff that I focus on,  but I really did think that more and more the stuff behind the scenes that's powering these  is amazing. The things like the data and the AI and the stuff, deep learning,  that's powering all of these experiences. CES, it's finally kind of caught up with this,  is that it's more about experiences and it's more about what you can do with the technology  and what the technology does for me or does for my community or does for society.  Because it's not just about... CES is still a gadget show, it's still a hardware show,  and there's cool stuff you see. But more and more, I think the great example was Intel.  You go to Intel's booth, you'd be hard pressed to even find a PC there.  Isn't that interesting? Wow.  Yeah, you couldn't even find a PC in that booth.

Transcript:  I will say this about TVs. I was talking with Scott Wilkinson, our home theater guy,  who of course is horse and foot sore from 25 miles this week at CES and mostly looking at TVs.  The good news is the UHD Alliance did release a standard called Ultra HD Premium that encompasses  the broader color gamut, encompasses HDR, at least provides a standard that you should be looking  for. The Blu-ray Alliance has announced a UHD Premium Blu-ray player. 500 bucks, not bad.  And movie companies have said there'll be 100 titles in 2016 available for this UHD Premium.  So we're making some progress. And at least-  It's true. We all want it.  I want it. I love 4K. I've been for 10 years. I saw the first 4K TV at CES 10 years ago.  And from then on, I said, this is what I want. I forget 3D. I want 4K.  It looks more 3D than 3D, right? It's like a really good 4K looks more 3D than 3D.

Transcript:  But there's no content. So somebody in the chat room said, well, if my TV died today,  wouldn't I want to buy a 4K TV?  Even today. Get a cheap HD TV.

End time: 3005.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can get an amazing TV.  Two grand. You can get a brilliant 75-inch TV.  Exactly. And then in two years, these 4K TVs are going to be obsolete,  especially with the stuff that we saw at CES this year with HDR and other things.  These ones here are going to look like puppies in a couple years.  So that's exactly what I told people. If you're in the market, you got to get a TV now.  Get a really great 1080p TV for between $500 and $1,000.  You get amazing screen because everybody's pushing 4K.

Transcript:  So that was cool.  The things that I liked was the rollable screen from LG.  That's wild.  Also the glass. There were two. I saw one from Panasonic and one from LG where it was just glass.  LG did this thing where the whole screen was just a glass as thick as four credit cards  and clear glass. And then all of the electronics and the speaker was in the base of the thing.  And if you hang it on your wall, that base kind of folds under a little bit.  That was beautiful, I thought, and very cool.  And then Panasonic had one where it was just on a bookshelf. I posted a video of this,  I think, on Instagram, where it was just a bookshelf.  And over part of the bookshelf was this piece of glass.  And it was a screen over top of it.  And at times it was opaque and at times it was clear where you could see what was behind it.  It was super cool.  I enjoyed that a lot. I thought that was a neat thing that was really impressive.  The 4K, as much as I like 4K, as much as you all like 4K, most people I know,  regular humans, can barely tell the difference between SD and HD.  They're still watching SD channels and you're like, turn that thing to the HD.

Transcript:  A lot of people are actually vastly underestimating how quickly  4K will become available to people. So there might not be a lot of 4K content right now.  But don't forget, GoPros are shooting in 4K, YouTube is accepting it and trying to create  more 4K content. Netflix will be creating all traditional series in 4K.  So I think that maybe right at the second there's not a lot of content, but I don't think it will  take very long for that content to come out. And sure, House of Cards is a little dated and  not all of that exciting anymore, but there will be a new Netflix show that you're going to  want to watch in 4K. But really, will streaming 4K be anything great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  DJI, I think, is way ahead of the trends in a lot of these drone innovations. They released a new  drone-ready 4K camera, I think. And some of the controlling apparatuses are a little easier and  better. But for the most part, you're seeing the same approach to a lot of these drones. They're  all quadcopters and they may or may not have a camera. And at this point, a lot of it's about  control, whether it's partially autonomous or fully autonomous and how the camera connects to the drone  and whether it's on a gimbal that can be fitted with a Nikon or a Canon or just DJI special camera.  DJI is ahead of everyone because it's a modular design. They make it pretty easy to swap those  things in and out. But yeah, a lot of the drones have four propellers and can fly relatively high.

Transcript:  You covered a little bit the wearables scene. Of course, you'd expect wearables, including this,  which is wild, the HTC Under Armour Health Box.

Start time: 3259.90
End time: 3262.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, this one was pretty interesting. Not a lot of new technology there.

Start time: 3267.48
End time: 3272.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a scale, activity tracker, and a heart rate monitor all in a box.

Start time: 3273.74
End time: 3348.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Exactly right. Yeah. So I think up until this point, a lot of people associated Fitbit with  the health tracker, Polar with the heart rate monitor, and then I think Withings might have  a smart scale. Under Armour's gotten very aggressive in this. Yeah, I think they have to be.  They want to compete against the top American sports brands, Adidas and Nike. And this is  definitely one way to do it. So there are three different companies that worked on this  particular package. It's being marketed under Under Armour, but HTC designed all of the hardware.  And then actually they worked with a consulting group. I believe it's called Wolfgang Müller  to identify this as something that people would want. And I think they're correct to do so.  As I said, these products exist with other companies, but they're not all within the same  ecosystem. And so for the really fitness crazy, very active type of person that wants the full  spectrum of health information at their fingertips, I think Under Armour and HTC have done a pretty  good job of at least packaging it well. I wouldn't say this is a technological breakthrough by any  means. All of this stuff has existed for several years. But the data on the back end is because

Start time: 3349.10
End time: 3388.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's actually powered by IBM Watson. You weren't joking when you said Watson, Serenity. You meant  it. It's powered by Watson on the back end. I'm sorry, Dave, you're dead. It gives you this advanced  analytics on your... So it tells you sort of how you're doing. And it has this essential  virtual coach and virtual trainer. Don't eat that hot dog, Dave.  It's showing you. It's triangulating all your data sources. And then it gives you... So that  UA Record, I think is the name of the app. You can use that now even without their health box.  And that will power. So you can use it with your other...

Transcript:  Under Armour has been on an acquisition spree on apps, health and tracker apps. They really,  I think, want to be the place for all of this. They bought my fitness pal. It's interesting.  It's going to be them and Runtastic probably will be the two big software companies. How about Fitbit?  I thought this Fitbit Blaze effect. I pre-ordered it immediately. $200 smartwatch  with Fitbit technology in it. Serenity, I know, of course, you're an Apple Watch fan, but  this intrigue you at all. It does do notifications. So it did intrigue me up to the point where some

I don't know if they've acquired or if they're a partnership.  No, I think they acquired them. They might have. Yeah. But I mean, Fitstar does some great stuff  and Fitbit does great stuff. But right now it's too bulky. It looks gigantic on a dude's wrist.  When you put it on a lady wrist, it looks like you're wearing a giant cuff. I mean, you can look at

Transcript:  It's almost identical. Okay. I'll cancel my order. Yeah, definitely cancel it. I mean,  the thing that the other problem with this is the best thing it has going for it is 200 bucks,  right? It's basically like an Apple Watch for 200 bucks. So good for them. That's good. But the  design, one, it looks too much like the Apple Watch and the Apple Watch is not all that much  of a looker by itself. And I wear one. I wore Fitbits for a long time. So I've been a fan of  both. But the problem with it, like the design is not good. And these things are still fitness,  you know, has to be these things have to have some kind of style component if you're going to  wear it around all the time. So I think this was an epic fail. And you saw it when the stock dropped  13% the same day and like, I think 18% within 48 hours after the wisdom of the crowds.

Transcript:  On the other hand, Samsung released their smartwatch that actually has 3G in it,  which I thought was interesting. You don't have to pair it with a device. And so that's it. You can  pair it. But I was talking to somebody from Samsung and I was like, well, what about battery,  right? Everybody is that everybody's going to ask. And he said, well, this was this was probably  seven o'clock at night. And he showed me where he was wearing one. And he said, I've been up  since 6am. You know, and I'm at about 40% battery life. So he said, people were saying they get two  days out. He said, I don't get two days. But yeah, there it is. Gear, gear, s2 classic. But, but he  was easily getting an awful day out of it. And he said, he's, you know, uses it a good deal. He

Transcript:  It looks more classic watch. Now, the 3G version is thicker because it has that radio in it. So,  but it is small. Like, like Serenity was saying that some of these watches, they're just, you could  not imagine, you know, a woman wanting to wear one of these things. They're so large. This one  actually is smaller. It's smaller than the, than the previous gear watches. It's also smaller than  the Moto 360, which is a nice looking. Do you have to have a Samsung phone to use this or can you  don't have to have a Samsung Samsung? No, you don't. You can. But you, but it can do, I think  you might have to set it up with Android. I should qualify that. I think you might have to have Android

Start time: 3657.18
End time: 3668.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to set it up. That's not a problem. But the pre some of the previous Samsung watches required you  owning a Samsung phone. Oh, specifically a Samsung phone. I don't believe so. I have a few Samsung

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  phones lying around. I'm not sure about that, but I think it runs on special Samsung software. It's  Tizen, right? Android Wear. No, I'm sure it's Tizen. Yeah, it's Tizen. It's not Android Wear.

Start time: 3680.60
End time: 3759.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yep. It's customized. You know, I like, I like what Samsung's been doing with the watches.  I think that it's a, it's a different direction in some ways than what the Apple watch is going. And  then very similar in others. I still think it's a little too big. But, but they have at least been  making strides. I remember trying on, I tried on the LG Urbane earlier this year as well as the,  yeah, well the Urbane with the Moto 360 with the first Samsung gear and all of them, I was wearing  them up here to make them even look remotely like they belonged on my arm. And even so I was just  kind of like, it's hard, right? Because you want to be able to put a certain amount of information  on the watch. And I'm, you know, I won't deny 38 millimeter, like I'm wearing the 38 millimeter  watch. That's the little Apple watch. Yeah, this is the little Apple watch and it fits my wrist well,  but there are definitely times where, where the space crunch gets to my ability to actually  interact with the watch. It's a little harder to tap on than the 42 millimeter and some of the  gear watches I've used, but I still like, I got it. There's gotta be some way to, for smaller  wristed folks, ladies and dudes to be able to enjoy these without feeling like they have to wear it  boyfriend style. Where it's just, and that doesn't even work for health sensors. Cause if you're  going to wear it that big, the health sensors can't actually tap into, to your wrist data. So

And they say that they were aiming  these specifically at women that they were trying to make it smaller and they were trying to make  it more, have more style options available. I still thought they were pretty big. I still thought  they were about the same size as the Samsung, even though they had said that. And so, but I  thought it was, it was interesting of them to say that they were aiming these specifically at women  when they made the announcement at their, at their big press conference there. And it is decent  looking. It's very similar looking to that, to the galaxy gear S2 that we were talking about just a  bit ago. But, but it, but it is also, I think kudos to both of them for, I think some steps  forward in style for both of those two watches anyway. Yeah. I think one thing that I noticed

Transcript:  at CES was just the level of redundancy with a lot of these wearables. So, you know, every,  there was a lot of excitement surrounding wearables prior to the Apple watch unveiling.  And I think that has sort of calmed down quite a bit in the, in the technology community.  They had a lot of these wearables featured in the Sands, which is sort of this secondary  a part of the, of the entire conveyor. Whoever makes it to the Sands. I mean, that's ridiculous.

Transcript:  it's fine. The fourth thing was really interesting. Again, it's like data and,  you know, natural language processing, which is also in this like deep learning and that kind of  thing. I saw this in so many products everywhere this year. And I really, I was glad to see it  that it's so much about experiences and, and rather than just sort of raw hardware kind of  thing, as much as even we've been talking about the raw hardware and style and all that, which is  great, but design and experiences are, are what define CES as well as every other bit of the  technology world now. And, you know, a lot of this is powered by other sort of backend systems.  And that's why I, you know, I asked this of the car makers, cause I was like, if that thing,  if that car is a shell for a lot of cloud and data and services and that, then, you know,  you guys have some catching up to do. That's why Ford and not Ford, Google and Tesla, you know,  that's part of their DNA already. And you guys don't have that as part of your DNA. And so you  have some work to do. And several of them kind of acknowledged that. And, and clearly with all the  stuff they were doing with autonomous, they were trying to show that they can, you know, that they

Michael Nunez from Popular Science.  And I think we've done CES. We'll move on to other topics, including peach,  because that's all I did this weekend. But first a word about shaving. I did shave,  of course, because I have a nice Harry's razor with that great Harry shave cream. I feel  pretty darn spiffy. Guys, 2016 is here. It's a new year. It's a fresh start.  Maybe time to stop overpaying for a great shave. Harry's was started by two guys passionate  about creating a better shaving experience by delivering great blades and shaving cream  directly to your door. They also are nice guys. They give 1% of their sales and 1% of their time  back to the communities that they serve. So the way Harry's decided to do this is classic startup.  They said they did it, they investigated. How do we make better blades?  How do we make it lower cost? Well, by the factory in Germany. This is a factory that's been creating  the best shaving blades in the world for more than 100 years. Harry's owns it. And so they're  selling direct to you from the factory. They design these blades for performance, for  for beautiful design and engineering and sharpness. Over a million guys now made the  switch to Harry's. And it's easy. You go to the website, it'll take you less than 30 seconds to  place in order. You'll have a great customer service experience. Start with a Harry's kit.  I use the Winston set and I love it. Oh, they're still selling the Winter Winston. I'm glad. That's  a beautiful copper handle. There's also the Truman, which is less expensive and a great way to start.  Every kit comes with a handle, three blades, the travel cover and of course your choice of Harry's  great foaming shave gel or Harry's cream. And all of this is going to cost you about half as much  as Razor as the big brands in the drugstore. Well, look at the Truman set, $15. $15. And in fact,  I'll get you $5 off your forced order when you use the offer code TWIT5 at Harry's, H-A-R-R-Y-S,  harrys.com. Get started with Harry's. Hey, for 10 bucks, you can get a real, and by the way,  this is not a sample size of the foaming shave gel or the cream. It's a full size tube or the full  size bottle. Harry's.com. Use the offer code TWIT5 and save five bucks off your Harry's purchase.  I saw you Serenity on Peach. Aren't you on Peach? I am. Yes. I joined pretty quickly

Transcript:  realized pretty quickly you get, I mean, you have this nice little list of people where you have  your own thing. And then you also have this list of individually, you have to tap on people to look  at them. There's no timeline on this, which is kind of interesting. It's just kind of, it's kind  of people and they're out of order too. It's not like the newest thing. It's chronological. Oh no,  isn't this the- It was, I thought it was chronological, but then I've occasionally found  people that were like 23 hours ago. So I'm not really entirely sure how it's organized.  Mine is so chronological, but who knows? You're right. Yeah. There are so many, see those like  two days and now it goes, jumps back up to one day. I don't know. It's odd. It's a fun little  distraction. I will say that. Christina Warren, bless her soul, told me about it on Friday and  I'm like, okay, what is this nonsense? And it feels a little bit like a Twitter Tumblr timeline.  With a little Instagram thrown in. Yeah, it's fun. I enjoy the fact that you can draw with it and  it's very cheery. I don't know if I like not being able to talk directly to someone other than through  Facebook like pokes. That's a little strange, but I do really, like I love drawing with it. I love  sending ridiculous photos and gifs. The gif engine is pretty fun. So what's really interesting about

Transcript:  this, it was created by Dom Hoffman, who was the Vine guy, right? He sold Vine to Twitter. Co-founder  of Vine. What's interesting, I mean, first of all, there's a million messaging platforms, but this  isn't exactly messaging. It's not exactly Twitter. It's kind of its own thing. And I think it bucks  the trend in the sense that it came, first of all, it came the Friday at the end of CES. So that's  perfect timing for the tech elite to try it and get involved in it. And then I thought really  interestingly, it has a lot of hidden nooks and crannies. Like it's got unusual features that you  don't immediately find. For instance, if you're in the message section, you could type certain  keywords. I'll type GIF and then you can search for an animated gif and I'll say, I don't know,  what should I say? Cakes. I don't know. I don't know what I'm going to get. And it'll search  a lot of messaging platforms, including Facebook's Messenger will do this kind of thing  where you can, and I'm just going to put that in my timeline because wow, that's awesome.  And so it's full of stuff like that. But you know, it's also people can, you can write stuff  and people can comment on it. And so there's threaded commenting as well. It's got, you could  post your battery life, your ratings, the date, the time. It's got a very interesting and kind of  almost eclectic set of features. Maybe it's just a flash in the pan. But on the other hand,  what it really reminded me of is how anxious I am. And I think I'm not, I'm not alone to get  rid of Twitter. Find something better than Twitter. I don't want to get rid of Twitter.

I think there's something really,  really unique about it in the context of all of our other very multimedia heavy  social networks. But there's the question of what does Twitter want to be? And I,

Transcript:  I want somebody to buy Twitter and give it back to the community. Like give it like,  it does not going to happen, obviously, but you know, like give the API back to the developer.  Wouldn't that be nice? That would be amazing. Like if somebody wants to put, you know,  their whatever, $20 billion, I can't remember how much it would take. But I have actually thought  about this. Like, you know, like that, that like maybe Bill Gates, right? No, he has more  important stuff he's working on. Somebody, somebody buy it. Exactly. Curing malaria and  fixing schools. So somebody buy it and there's all kinds of billionaires that waste their money on  all kinds of really dumb, irrelevant things. Buy Twitter and give it back to the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, they're growing. Yeah. Over Twitter. I think I sort of have a love-hate relationship  with it. It's obviously- Everybody does. You're not alone.  You don't have to just, yeah. And there are, you know, there are definitely important things  that it provides. Certainly anonymity being one of those things. I think you don't have to be a  verified user, whereas I think Facebook will move more and more in the direction of making  everyone verified. And so I think there's like this, there's a part of me that likes the hacking  aspect and sort of the shady aspects of Twitter, I guess. But I just don't think that they're  commercially viable. Those aren't the types of things that make you a lot of money. And  I think that Twitter as a company will see that in the long run. You know, people, I mean, there  are other use cases that are important too. You know, shared screen experiences or dual screen  experiences, watching live TV. I'm sure the Golden Globes right now are trending.  Oh yeah. I'll be watching the Golden Globes on Twitter. Absolutely.  Yeah. Yeah. Live snarking is the best part.  Live snarking. Yeah.  Live snarking. Yeah.  Live snarking. Yeah. But what's preventing Facebook from doing something like that? I mean,  in reality, Facebook can update in real time. You can actually share more meaningful information  because there's no character limit. And so I just don't think that, you know, Twitter reminds me of  a Groupon in a lot of ways. It's like it was unique at the time, but now a lot of people are doing  what that company is doing. It's just not, it doesn't have any unique proprietary  software or coding behind it. I think it's just sort of, it feels redundant to me. It feels like.

Transcript:  It is live and you feel it. And what I really love about Twitter and what I've loved since pretty  much day one, I was reflecting on this the other day where when I'm not doing tech related stuff,  I do a geeky podcast with Jason Snell of six colors and we do a podcast called the incomparable  and we did one on, on star Wars, the force awakens, which, you know, that's just a recurring thing.  But a couple hours after we posted it, we ended up being able to interact with people from Lucasfilm  who are like, Oh yeah, we've, we saw your, we listened to your podcast. We really like it.  We wanted to compliment you on this. And like, that's the, that's the kind of experience that  you're not going to get on Facebook because of the, because of the way that the friending works.  You might get like a comment or a thumbs up like from a, from a page owner, but you don't necessarily  know if that page owner is actually that person. It doesn't, I don't know. I feel like spontaneous  conversations is what I, what I love about Twitter, that two people who have never met or don't know  anything about each other can have a human conversation face, like virtually face to face.  And of course there are some downsides to that. There's still a major harassment issue that,  that Twitter has, but on the whole it's a, it's a really great platform for that,  for real time messaging, for real time interaction, for interacting with your,  with your readers and for musicians and actors with their fans in a way that's not so,  there's not so much of a-

Start time: 4652.88
End time: 4707.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's very informal. I mean, I would say that. And, and, and, and yeah, I think you're right about  sparking up random conversations, but you know, outside of the media, I think that most people  aren't looking to have those types of conversations. Like if you work for a company and you're, and,  and you're using Twitter as part of your, as part of your job, whether it's as a journalist or as a  PR person, I think that makes complete sense. But I just don't think there's a lot of value  in having people tweet at, you know, their favorite sports athlete or, or what, you know,  any, any type of celebrity. I think that more meaningful interactions will be available in  the near future. We already have Periscope, we already have Facebook live. And I think  interactions like that will be more meaningful than like 140 character acknowledgement of someone's  fandom or, or like, you know, just tweeting at Kobe Bryant and saying like nice slam dunk or

Start time: 4707.68
End time: 4741.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  something like that. I see. I agree with you on some respects, because I think that most actors  and most, most folks, folks in sports are not necessarily using Twitter the way that a journalist  might use Twitter. But I've also seen it in two very different communities. You know, before I  was in tech, I was in the web comics community, and that's a community that's, that's continued  to thrive. And pretty much any internet based, internet based community loves Twitter and thrives  on Twitter, because that's, that's one of the major ways that you reach your fans and that you

Start time: 4741.56

Transcript:  to know. Yeah. And actually, a great example is, I don't know if you guys have heard of the musical  Hamilton. It's kind of the hottest thing on Broadway right now. But it's, it's maybe ever.  Yeah. The creator of Hamilton, Lin-Manuel Miranda, basically spends probably a third of his day when  he's not working on his future projects or on stage interacting with people, not just, not just like,  thanks for, thanks for the show. Glad you liked it. But just sharing interesting behind the scenes  tidbits about the show, answering questions from fans, his musical director and arranger,  Alex Lackmore answers questions from people almost constantly. And it's a, it's a very  interesting dialogue. Like I don't follow many celebrities, true celebrities on Twitter, because  as you said, it's a very one way experience. And if you want the one way experience, you can go to  Periscope, you can go to Facebook. But then there are people like Miranda or Amanda Palmer, Neil  Gaiman is another examples of like people who actually take time to interact with people,  not just a like, glad you liked my book, but actually, oh, I'll answer your question or,  oh, you made a funny point. I will, you know, expound upon that meaningful conversations,

Transcript:  not just like, you're okay. Yeah. Right. Right. My Lin-Manuel Miranda, I'm holding up my water  baller, my, my, uh, did you go? Have you gone? No, no, no. Well, I tried to when I couldn't get to  the show, but he has the water bottle. I do. I've got the water bottle. I stood in line,  you know, they have the lottery. I stood in line for the lottery. Yeah. So, uh, it was,  there were, there were probably that night, 1500 people in line for 21 tickets, you know,  for the lottery and the theater itself only seats 1300, you know, so there were more people in line  for the ham for ham, um, those 21 tickets than the could have fit in the whole theater, which is  that tells you how hot that show is. And it is also amazing. I mean, you can listen to the,  the cast album and the music is, uh, is just phenomenal. It's really changing, um, Broadway  and it's changing. I know this is not a Broadway show, but, but it is, uh, the way that they're  using, um, technology, uh, has been significant in the way they're using social media is particularly,  I should say. Um, they've tried to make that they actually had a technology snafu. They tried to  make ham for ham, the ticket lottery, um, digital. Yeah. And it crashed. Yeah.  And so they had to go back to man.

Start time: 4894.50
End time: 4921.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  50,000 people applied for the lottery. And this is just one day's lottery. Mind you, this is,  and the only people who can apply are people who live basically within city limits, who can get to  the theater within an hour of the lottery drawn 50,000 people. And it crashed the Broadway system  because they'd never seen that happen before. And immediately, uh, Miranda and Al are kind of like,  well, so we're going to go back to the other system while we fix this, but eventually we'll  like to go digital for the winter because it's cold outside. Yeah. Cause they do a little,

Start time: 4921.42
End time: 4941.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  they know that people can't all come to see it. So they do a little five minute, um,  performance for you. And they, they know that most people won't get to see the show.  And so, uh, they come out and they do a little, and then somebody YouTube's it every time. And  then Lynn, man, more Miranda, um, retweets it, uh, whoever, you know, a good, the best sort of

Howard Sherman works across the street, um, from the Richard Rogers comes out of  his office building and his friends with Miranda and he comes down and videotapes it pretty much  every night. I, those are crazy. And those, those originated on social, like those wouldn't exist  except for the fact that Miranda tweeted before the very first night of previews. Hey, oh my God,  there's so many people here. We're just going to do a little, like a little thing because, hey,  there are like 300 of you here and not all of you are going to be able to get out to the show.  They're so cool.

Start time: 4983.84
End time: 5036.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  and look at where they're posting these things to, you know, Instagram, they're uploading  the video onto YouTube or Instagram and then retweeting on Twitter. So I just don't think it's  like ultimately that great of a broadcast network. And I think even for things like live tweeting  events, um, there will be better versions available in the near future when our TVs get smarter and  when our homes are more connected. I just, I don't see, I just don't think the user interface is that  great. And so, you know, do like informal discussion, but I guess I don't think that Twitter  has figured out how to present the most meaningful information at the right times. And, um, and part  of that has to do with their commitment to reverse chronological, um, the waterfall of information.  But, um, but yeah, anyways, I'm a little bit skeptical about Twitter's future. I just don't  think that they're doing enough to stay relevant and certainly not doing enough to make, to make

I totally love your idea, Jason,  of let's just buy it back and open it up and bring back the API, because that's how Twitter got there.  And Jack Dorsey, come on, that's all you have to do. And I understand it's tough when you're a  publicly held company because the shareholders are going to get peeved. But that does, I think  that's a, that is the only solution that makes any sense is let, let its users determine its future.

Start time: 5067.52
End time: 5106.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's so fundamental. It's like the dial. I love the metaphor. It's like the dial tone of  the internet, right? It is the live internet. And, um, it's not that it shouldn't have some  product behind it, but it like, if anything was meant to be open source, it's almost like  this thing, I think, could just thrive and do the kind of things that, um, uh, you know,  that we're talking about. It does need to change and it doesn't need to adapt and it does need to  get better. And as you know, other interfaces and mobile and things, you know, uh, be become a more,  more part of the user experience that that needs to be part of it too. So I think the community  could do it better than one company. Absolutely. Well, the funny thing to me always about Twitter

Start time: 5107.04
End time: 5153.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is I don't understand why they're not doing more with their potential analytics in terms of they  have access to all of this public information. You know, it's Facebook, you have privacy settings  and you have a vast number of privacy settings because you share a lot of information on Facebook  Twitter. I think there's a, there's a gold mine of information on that service that I know that  Twitter does sell some of their firehose to various services, but I don't understand why they're,  they are not the 21st century Nielsen where they're like, they have so much,  they have so much data on television, on movies, on, on musicals, on shows. The fact that they  haven't figured out, they haven't gotten some really, really smart numbers. People be like,  let's build a program that essentially can sell all of this data. This pre essentially previs data

Start time: 5153.86
End time: 5173.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for some people. This is an example of why it privately held or even a publicly held company,  actually, especially a publicly held company, maybe isn't the best steward for something like  this. This should be a public service because if you had an API and you gave the firehose to  anybody who wanted it, somebody would build that. Lots of people would probably build it. Lots of

Start time: 5173.52
End time: 5182.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  people. There'd be all kinds of different things, you know, sentiment analysis. I mean, people are  doing some of it now, but the kind of sentiment analysis. Let's nationalize Twitter. Let's just

End time: 5209.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  nationalize it. Just take it over. There's your title. Let's not turn it political. Well, but  you know what? That's this. I think that's the solution. You can't. And I don't see another  company buying it as a solution. I think it should be a public. I think it's a utility. It's a public  utility. It's like the dial tone. What would be, what would that's, that's such an obvious correct  thing to do. Like what would it take? What would it take? I wouldn't pull out Jack Dorsey opening up

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the API, honestly, because there have been talks about it in the last year or so. Rumors mostly,  but I wouldn't. Twitter has taken a very big about face in terms of its route, the way that  it interacts with developers in the last year. I'm kind of hoping that that eventually means

Start time: 5225.76
End time: 5235.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they're going to have to really step out though, because developers have been so burned by it that  they've really got to convince them that this is a genuine move. That would be so gangster. If he

Start time: 5235.32
End time: 5255.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  did that though, if he just said, you know what, we're going to open this thing up and we're going  to make it, we're going to become a platform again, and we're going to build stuff on top of it.  We're going to invite everybody else to build stuff, to build their own sentiment analysis,  to build their own applications. Doesn't that make it more valuable for the shareholders?  Infinitely more valuable, infinitely more valuable. Well, you would think so. Yeah. I mean,

Start time: 5256.36
End time: 5327.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's definitely a big assumption to say that like it will for sure make the company more money,  but I don't think it's a far reach to see it say that Jack Dorsey would potentially open these  things up. I mean, he's been a big advocate for the programmers and developers in the past.  Certainly that's where his background is. It was Dick Costolo who shut it down, shut down  the third parties, right? Yeah, exactly. And getting the founders of that company to even agree  on a single idea, I think has been, at least from my understanding, a huge pain over the course of  Twitter's lifetime. And so, you know, it's no shock to me that Twitter's having an identity crisis at  this moment in time. And I mean, you know, Jason, you've made a great point. The more open that  Twitter has been in the past, the more successful and at least more, the more that I've been able  to get out of it. And I think that that would make it way more attractive to me. And I think  to more people. But yeah, you really just never know with these publicly traded companies. I mean,  you know, consider MySpace and some of the discussions that probably happened around that  after it went public. I mean, that thing tanked pretty fast. And, you know, I would say that  Twitter doesn't seem to be all that much different. It's an interesting, politically,

Start time: 5328.00
End time: 5351.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  though, it is very interesting, because increasingly social networks are more than a private company.  They're really about, they're the social common ground, the commons. And they really should be  treated as the commons, because no one entity, one business entity should control them. Remember,

And the government went to them,  said, don't, it's went to them and said, Please do not. They're like, you know, you cannot do this.  This is one of the few ways that people and activists inside have to communicate with the  outside world because so much of communications being shut down.

What you were looking for is a wide open API and a fire hose that's available. Now,  understand the problem with having the fire hose available. That's the full stream is that's  expensive. But I'm sure you could get, you know, support to making that totally available or just  charge people for access, charge them a reasonable fee for access, because there's so much value in

Start time: 5411.16

Transcript:  pipe is how you get innovation because then it's a platform and open platform on top of it.  Ah, now what about Facebook? Let's talk about it. You know, the all the growth and okay, so I'm by  the way now deleting peach because that's not going to go anywhere. But but but peach is trying  to do is kind of conflate Twitter and messaging. And it's very clear that messaging is a very  important platform. But I feel like Facebook is going to own this. There's not much we can do  about it at this point. Am I wrong? Man, I'd love to see so many of the users, you know, they're  just they kind of well, and that's critical with messaging, right? You don't want to I use this  analogy a couple of weeks ago, you don't want to buy a phone that can only call 10% of the populace.  You want the messaging platform that speaks to everybody if possible. There isn't such a

Transcript:  it doesn't irritate me as much as the normal person. I actually openly embrace Facebook.  I mean, it's not going anywhere anytime soon. Sure, they know a lot of information about me,  but like so does Google. Yeah, who cares about that? I'm not worried about that.  Yeah. I mean, I feel like Facebook provides a greater utility for me than any piece of software  that I use on a daily basis. I mean, Facebook to some extent is more meaningful than my Gmail  account. I think sure, I get a lot of work done via email, but Facebook is showing me  the perspective of a lot of thousands of people from around the world I've met over the course  of my lifetime and allows me to interact with those people immediately, instantaneously about  any subject. And so yeah, I think they're the clear winner in this case. And they're still  growing financially and also on a user from a user perspective. And the fact that they bought  WhatsApp and Instagram in the past few years and those two services are still growing makes it  hugely attractive to me. And also to further this point, I think that Zuckerberg has done a really  great job of clearing his name. I think for a long time people considered him a really awkward,  nerdy sort of an opportunist, even to a certain extent after the social network, the movie was  released. But in the past year, maybe year and a half, I think Zuckerberg has done a great job  of sharing more of his personal life with people on Facebook and introducing them to things like  the moment he vaccinated his daughter within the past week or just taking his trip to North Korea  and 360 degree video. I mean, he is one of the smartest people in the world at this moment in  time. He's certainly one of the richest and I'm excited to see how he matures as an individual.  I think he is the Bill Gates of our time. He has made humanitarian issues a really big part of his  life and I think he's building a service that people need to use. And the people that refuse  to use it are ultimately going to fall behind. I think that it's a disservice to them and I think  it says more about their either self-confidence or their ability to embrace these things more so  than it does about what it's doing to society. Facebook is connecting more people than ever  before and I don't see how that could possibly be a bad thing. I think when you talk about  sharing ideas quickly and that sort of thing, yeah, sure, a lot of that happens on Twitter  because it's informal and people use anonymous names and that thing, but I think slowly we'll  all make our way over to Facebook. It seems really obvious to me everything that Facebook is doing.  Does that not worry you? No, not at all. I mean, I think it's something that they declared years  ago. You're trying to get rid of email by having everyone move over to messages and I think to a  certain extent they're right to pursue that. I don't see anything wrong with it. In layman's  terms it's sort of like the phone book I guess of the modern era, but with more capabilities. You can  send videos and gifts and photos and any type of media that you can imagine and it's all in one  place and to me that's hugely important. I mean, I'm not going there for creative inspiration  necessarily, but I am going there for meaningful interactions with my family and friends from  around the world and I would personally pay a huge premium for that and I think people have shown  that they will in the past too. So yeah, I think Facebook is uniquely positioned because they're  gathering so much information about different people. They've certainly invested in a lot of  interesting categories over the past couple of years and I think they're doing a great job of  making people fear Facebook less, making people fear the security issues and sign-in.

Transcript:  I don't love Facebook. I do think it's difficult to use, especially to try to,  especially to try to, you know, their settings are just so convoluted. I think that's terrible.  I don't think it's a great user experience, but I think I do agree. So many people are there that  that's the only thing it really has. I think that's what it's got going for it the most.  I do think that the biggest thing they've done over the last couple of years is they went mobile.  I thought they were dead. They were dead if they hadn't gone mobile, but they in the most impressive  thing they ever did to most impressive things they ever did in my mind. One was their shift to mobile.  You know, recently they did it in a very short period of time to where most people I know now  use it on mobile. And but the first thing they did and what made Facebook Facebook is it was  always up, you know, social networks in the late 2000s, mid to late 2000s, as you guys remember,  they were just a pain. They were slow. You know, Twitter especially was down all the time.  It didn't work. I think what Facebook what made Facebook Facebook was that they had an amazing  engineering culture that created a product that was always up. You could always go there and you  could get your stuff posted. You get your photos uploaded because it was primarily a photo for the  longest time. It was just a photo sharing and gaming site and still primarily that's what it is.  But, you know, that's why Facebook I think is what it is. And that does bode well for their future.  And that technologically, they also the reason why they're successful now as a public company is they  understand data much, much better than Twitter does. And they understand how to monetize data.  And they are a better platform. They've it's kind of dirty that they've made small businesses and  brands pretty much disappear from the feed unless you pay to to do it. But when you pay,  it actually works and they show you great analytics on a better experience. So I don't

Transcript:  why don't they let you decide that, you know, I guess what bothers me is that, you know, I hear  about a lot of different people championing big data and the importance of artificial  intelligence and a number of these things. And Facebook is the company that's doing that at  the best. It's between Facebook. Oh, yeah, I'm a great Google's predictive search is obviously  super helpful and a lot of the things that they're doing with Google dot com and bringing that  information to you much more quickly. But I would say close behind is Facebook. And actually,  they know quite a bit about everyone that they know more about you and your friends than  probably you do. And so, you know, the fact that they killed reverse chronological order and now  the newsfeed just promotes what they think you would want to see. I think that's a huge step  toward toward where we need to be. And that actually is advantageous over Twitter, which is

Start time: 5975.00
End time: 6008.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  frankly hard to sort through. Agreed. That's why they're winning as a public company,  because they understand the value of that data and they're using it very well. And they're making  you know, a lot of money because of that. They're printing money. They're printing money  because of that in the same way that Google was printing money when it first started AdSense.  And that's why they are becoming that's why they are making so much money and why they are able  to buy all of these companies. And so, you know, they are they are forced to be reckoned with

Transcript:  for doing that, by the way. So that'll be available to everyone in our March and April issue. It's a  double issue. And on the cover will be someone that everyone knows. He's a great leader. I don't  think that I can mention him by name at this point, but we're all very excited about this cover.  And yeah. And then in terms of just what I'm working on at POP Sci. So we're getting that  issue ready. We've just come back from CES and I'll actually be joining Gizmodo next week. So  this is breaking news, I guess, in that sense. But I'll be the new technology editor of Gizmodo.  Oh, you got a new job. Yeah, yeah, I did. What the hell? Yeah, I haven't really announced that.  Congratulations. That's awesome. Yeah, it's cool. It's really exciting. Going to work for the AOL.  No, no, not for AOL. No, they're Gawker. They're Gawker. Yeah, correct. Yeah, they're owned by  Gawker. Yeah, so it's really cool. Yeah, we'll be just doing a lot of new stuff over there. And so,  I still have a lot of friends at Popular Science and I'm still working on some things over the  course of the next week. But yeah, that transition has basically begun and CES was sort of where  some of that started. So yeah, all really exciting things. No wonder you like CES. I went to CES and  I got a new job. Well, yeah, I mean, some of those arrangements were sorted out before the  conference. But yeah, it's just been a blast. And this time of year, it's been really, really

Start time: 6697.80
End time: 6702.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 6702.44
End time: 6744.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  good too. Yeah, yeah. And hopefully, you know, hopefully a lot more people will see just what  we're working on on a day to day basis. You know, I've been fortunate enough to do a lot of TV in  the past year. And I think we're hoping to continue a lot of those relationships. So I would say that  the mission statement is like pretty closely aligned with Popular Science. You know, we're  really excited about the future. We focus on drones, robots, cars and gadgets. And, and you  know, I think there's just a healthy amount of skepticism at Gizmodo. And there are a few  different types of stories that we can write there that I'm just unable to write at Popular Science.  So yeah, there'll be a little more freedom. And yeah, it'll be cool. I'm excited. Serenity just

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wrote an interesting article on iMore. Of course, one of the big stories in the Apple world is  rumor that is growing stronger and stronger that Apple is going to abandon a headphone  phone port in the next iPhone. They just won't be there. Is that because they want you to use  the lightning port or they expect all headphones to be wireless going forward? No, I think it's a

Start time: 6765.26
End time: 6798.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  combination of a couple different factors. Taking away the headphone jack allows them a little bit  more space for battery as well as for a slight reshaping of the case. The lightning port, you  know, isn't that much bigger. The headphone jack is that much bigger. It's not just to make it  thinner, I hope. No, no. But the point is that it goes into the device. So it's actually, you know,  of my 6s Plus here, the headphone jack is taken up probably about that much space on the interior of  it. So that's all space, especially with drivers that Apple could be... There's already a petition,

Start time: 6799.02
End time: 6803.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  many, many signers saying, don't take the headphone jack out. 200,000 people.

Start time: 6806.08
End time: 6842.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you know, I'm okay with this. I'm, you know, I'm normally anti-port removal for Apple.  The new MacBook is not a computer that I'm going to buy anytime soon. But for the 6s Plus,  I actually think it makes a lot of sense or the 6s Plus for the future generation of iPhone. It  makes a lot of sense. For one thing, the lightning, you know, the lightning connector offers a serious  amount of power inherent in it. And I think that if you want to talk about wired headphones,  there might be a way to make the sound quality better by going via lightning. And I know some  analog traditional headphones users will be like, that's fine on you, Serenity Caldwell. That's

Start time: 6842.92
End time: 6863.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  horrible. Oh, yeah. But I have to say you could, if by taking the DAC out of the iPhone and having  an external DAC, because the lightning port will give you digital audio, you could really improve  it. If you have expensive headphones, this is actually a good move for you. You're listening  to a kind of a not so great DAC in the iPhone. Absolutely. And there are a lot of things that

Start time: 6864.06
End time: 6891.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they can do with this, you know, that it encourages the adoption of wireless headphones, which you  know what, I'm wearing wired cheapo wired headphones right now, but I actually recently bought my first  pair of like really good wireless headphones. And I'm, you know, even with even with Bluetooth not  being the best connection in the world, it's still it's incredible. I did not expect to enjoy  the wireless headphone life as much as I as much as I am. And I'm like, how did I ever deal with

Transcript:  Yeah, they were they were there. I didn't see them. I've seen things like them from other  companies that have gone unreleased. But I mean, these wireless earbuds are definitely coming,  whether they're from Bragi or any other company. And and I think for anyone that goes to the gym,  it's like a no brainer. I mean, you just don't want you know, there are Bluetooth wireless  headsets that that require you to wear like a necklace or terrible. Yeah, they're wired together.

Start time: 6937.84

Start time: 6941.26
End time: 6958.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So these only have five hours and then they come with a little charging case that I guess  charges them up. Yeah, five is decent for work. You know, it's not like one and a half.  My main thing with the Bragi, I think it's a really interesting proof of concept. And I love  that their little their little case is also a charger, because that's a way to motorola did

Start time: 6959.06
End time: 6963.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 6963.72
End time: 7017.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've been using that. It works well. Yeah, it's interesting. But the thing about the Bragi that  intrigued me and I actually got tipped off to this by a reader on Twitter. So again, the idea  that it has a it has a built in music player. It doesn't it doesn't need to connect to your phone.  Oh, has memory. Yeah, it has four gigabytes of memory. So you can actually you can actually put  in your your stuff. So I was talking, you know, completely unrelatedly on the I'm more show,  we were talking about the future of the iPod. And I was joking, you know, if they're going to,  you know, I originally last year thought the future of the iPod was the Apple Watch,  because that's you know, it's wearables. But what what better place to wear and wear an iPod than  actually in your headphones? Interesting. So I don't know, I, I wrote this article, and I'm like,  there's some pros and some cons to this and battery life. Well, Apple owns be head beats headphones.  They do. They do. So they're positioned to do something like this. Exactly. You can enjoy my

End time: 7039.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 7040.18
End time: 7056.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for for the iPod to have any kind of future, I feel like it has to be wearable in a way,  because the people who are still using iPods for iPods are runners,  and people with huge collections who want to want to take their music collection. And, you know,

I mean, I'm still, you know, I've tried just about every  smart watch on the planet and I can't, I wouldn't dare replace any of the analog mechanical watches  that I have. I mean, they're just like way nicer. They look way cooler. And I haven't found either  the killer app or the killer feature on any of the smart watches. So what's the point? I guess

Transcript:  Yeah. No, I mean, what I enjoy, for one thing, I'm not an analog watch wearer and I never,  I haven't been since I was about 12. So having the Apple watch on my wrist actually fulfilled the  like, oh, I have a watch again. That's nice. The big things for me, and I'm actually, I'm going to  write something on I'm more about this. The big things for me almost a year into my Apple watch  ownership is the fitness tracking is hugely important. There's a app called Heart Aware on  the app on the iPhone now. That's I think like one or $2 that that's fascinating. It takes all of  your Apple watch data and it's able to show you averages and all sorts of things with your heart.  And if so, if you're at all, if you're interested in exercising or if you're, or if you're someone  who needs to track, keep track of their heartbeat for medical reasons, that's a really cool way of

Start time: 7194.86
End time: 7209.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  very accurate. It's really I use because I am on a treadmill and I have, you know, handles that  will measure my heart rate, which is very accurate. And it almost always is exactly the same within a  beat or two of my Apple watch. Okay, so I found it to be very accurate, at least for me. What was

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that app called Serenity? Heart Aware? Heart Aware. Yeah, I found out about it from Federico Vettice  over at MacStories. It's pretty neat. No, like the heartbeat sensor will malfunction for me  occasionally. But I'd say it's accurate probably 90, 96% of the time, which is better than a lot of

Transcript:  Yeah, it's I saw it on Facebook. That's how I know. Ah, see there. Facebook is a great unifier.  But aside from the heart rate, what I've been really using it for, I still use it for notification  difference, where when I'm out, I just leave my phone in the bag. And that's really, really nice  as somebody who gets a lot of emails and a lot of texts and a lot of like, things that are important  for me. It's very easy for me to glance down and be like, message from Renee. Okay, it's about Star  Wars. It can wait until after I'm finished eating or something like that. It's not the site is  burning down. We need you right this second. The other thing that I really like is with watchOS  2 and complications, third party complications have basically become my lifeblood. There's,  I don't know if I can really try and show it upside down here. I have a carrot weather on here.  Yeah, the competition's not a weather. Yeah, super snarky. It's like it's fracking sunny.  Go wear some sunglasses. I like instant weather glances. I like the fact there's an app called  Just Press Record that has a complication. So essentially, this will record voice memos.  Watch it anytime. I have to try. If I have an idea while drawing or while driving, all I have to do is  press the complication and it immediately brings up that and starts recording. I'm going to get that.  That sounds good. Yeah, that's one of my favorite Apple watch apps and it's built for the watch.  So unlike every other watch app, which is like loading, loading, loading, loading,  it loads instantly. Oh, that's good. What's that called? It loads instantly and it stores  Just Press Record. Just Press Record, okay. Just Press Record. It's great. It's one of the few.  It'd be good for any journalist, right? Yeah. It's very-

See, I'm waiting. I think that the smart watch, I'll be much more interested  if we could take my blood sugar, my oxygen, when it can really tell me, you know, it can get some  good important numbers, then it's going to be hugely valuable. This is kind of interesting.  This is a sock that monitors your baby's heart rate and oxygen level and can tell you,  warn you on your smartphone if your baby's in trouble. Yeah, baby tech and senior tech.  Huge. Was really huge at CES this year. Well, as a, everybody's one or the other at some point,  maybe both if you're lucky.

Transcript:  Need to play some lullabies. No. Yeah. I mean, I think that you're right, Leo, like the health  and wellness, you know, what I found is- That's what we need.  The health and wellness category as a whole is sort of ripe for the taking. There's going to be a  lot of growth in health and wellness over the course of the next 10 to 20 years. I mean, we-  As we age. Absolutely, people want to know more about their health. I mean, I think any  well-educated person wants to know how healthy they are and basically how their body's holding  up over the course of time and what they can do to be better about that and whether it's eating  better or exercising smarter.

Transcript:  Yeah, so I mean, you know, I've written a bit about some of this embedded technology.  Yeah. And Project Jacquard is another one from Google.  That's from Google, yeah. And a lot of that stuff is great,  but like you said, you know, it's just about who's providing the most helpful information.  And, you know, what I found with basically a large majority of the wearables market is that  there's redundancy across the board. So the Apple Watch doesn't seem to be doing anything that  even the Fitbit Blaze, which is, you know, a total piece of vaporware-  Which I still can't cancel.  Yeah, sorry. Yeah, I unfortunately don't run after like-  But yeah, I mean, it's just silly to me to see how much redundancy there is across the board. And,  you know, that's the one thing I'll give Under Armour with this health box. You know,  they've at least packaged all of this stuff together in one big box so that you can get  it all at once. But for the most part, they're all doing the same thing. They're all using  accelerometers to count your steps and pulse oximetry to tell you-  It's a market that's- A differentiator.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The differentiator will be the data, right? The data is going to be, you know, Under Armour  is going to be really interesting because they have this data processing monster on the back end,  right? And data is going to change health and medicine immensely over the next couple of decades  we're going to look back in 30 years from now and think like, oh my God, like we barely knew  anything. We were, you know, treating all these things. We were just throwing crap at the wall  to see what would stick. And the dark, yeah.  Yeah. And in the ways and because this is going to lead to the era of personalized medicine,  right? We're seeing that already. The data is going to enable medicines to be able to  be customized for you and treatments to be customized for you based on how your body reacts  to, you know, to medicines and to exercise and to food.

Transcript:  Yeah. And those two things are helpful. Certainly, you know, it's better to know those things than to  not know them. But like you said, there's so many other pieces of biometric information that they  can be feeding you. And right now they can't. And a lot of the technology is available in hospitals.  And so there's going to be this weird trickle down effect where the things that are available in  hospitals will slowly reach consumers and as they do, will live healthier and longer lives.  And, you know, I just don't think that the Apple Watch is going to present that either in its first  iteration or next year or in 2016 iteration. I don't think that I've seen really any consumer  electronics that can really provide that level of detail, you know?

Our show brought to you by the company of all the advertisers we have. I've been using the longest  since 2000. I am an audible lover. I have been since I had a long commute and I discovered audiobooks  and I was buying, renting boxes of cassettes. And then along comes audible. My life changed for the  better. Now today, 180,000 titles, rich books, but also performances and lectures. And by the way,  the great courses are on audible now. You can listen to the best college lecturers on every  subject. I am a huge fan. We're going to get you two books for free. I'm almost embarrassed to  admit that one of the books I'm reading right now is that book by Marie Kondo on tidying up  the life-changing magic of tidying up the Japanese art of decluttering and organizing.

I'm now listening to Neil Stevenson's latest seven eaves and loving it. It's hard  science fiction by this in the sense of great science. They've gone back and recorded some of  the classic science fiction books of all time. Oh, here's one of my favorite audio books of all  time. Angela's Ashes by Frank McCourt, one of the classics. And Frank McCourt reads it in his  beautiful Irish accent. It's a tragic tale, but it's his life and it comes to life in his narration.  That's one of the things I love about audible books. The readers make this it's not it's not  somebody reading a boring but it is a performance. And if you haven't you may have seen the Martian  in the theaters. If you haven't listened to RC Bray, bring the Martian to life and Mark Watney's  incredible story. You'll love this too. I just there's so many great books. Here's the deal.  You're going to get two two books for free. You'll be going to audible.com slash twit to  audible.com slash twit and the number two. You're going to choose two books.  Basically, you're signing up for the platinum account. That's two books a month account. It  also includes the Daily Digest of the New York Times of the Wall Street Journal.

I love this audible.com slash twit to  I'll tell you what, whether it's a commute, a boring hour on a treadmill, walking the dog doing  the dishes or tidying up your home, there's nothing like having an audio book. And by the way,  if you have an Amazon Echo, you can have it read to you. And I do that all the time to audible.com  slash twit to you will love it. Alright, so a little, little, little John Ledger action. I  think John Ledger, the CEO of T Mobile has taken a page from the book of Donald Trump, he's realized,  if you're going to make something up, say it loud, yell, a little profanity wouldn't hurt.  The Electronic Frontier Foundation starts this story by talking about T Mobile's new Bin John  service saying, Hey, guess what? Bin John doesn't optimize the video feeds of its Bin John providers.  Bin John, the idea is you get free, you know, no, no, no bandwidth use, viewing of Netflix and other  stuff, not YouTube. Turns out what Bin John does is just takes any video stream, if you got to turn  it on as a T Mobile customer, it takes any video stream and just downgrades it to one and a half  megabits. Doesn't optimize it. If you're watching twit and the server you're on isn't noticed that  you're at a slower bandwidth, it'll pause, it'll hiccup, it'll freeze. It is throttling, pure and  simple. Now you can turn it off by turning it off. That's why John Ledger says it's not throttling.  You could turn it off. He said it's BS to complain about it. And he said, who is this EFF anyway?  Wow. Wow. Oh, my, my. You know, I'm a T Mobile customer. I love T Mobile. I don't like zero  rating. That's this thing that some of these companies do where they don't, it doesn't count  against your bandwidth to watch Netflix or to listen to Google Music or Spotify. I don't like  that. It's really anti-net neutrality. Customers love it though, right? What's wrong with that?  But it makes T Mobile kind of the arbiter of what's successful and what's not. He says, well,  anybody can join Bin John. It's not about that. It's T Mobile slowing down all video to one and  a half megabits. And T Mobile has confirmed that. Even if John Ledger says it's BS.  This is their free thing, right? Yeah. The idea is if you are a T Mobile customer and by default,  Bin John is turned on, you won't have to pay for bandwidth for Netflix. I can't really play this  because he's very angry and he swears a lot. Bin John includes a proprietary technology. And

And I can't play part B of his answer, which is profane.  Who are you, EFF? Why are you stirring up so much trouble? Who pays you? I pay them because I'm a  donor. And a lot of other people pay the Electronic Frontier Foundation to call BS when they see BS.  Shame on you, T Mobile. Shame on you, John Ledger. We know what you're up to. The big lie does not  work. All right. I think we're done. We got to go watch the Golden Globes. Got to go live snark.  Live snark time. I'll be following you, Saturn. S-E-T-T-E-R-N on Twitter.
