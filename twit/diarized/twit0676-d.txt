And we decided today,  normally we have a four person panel. We decided today we were going to do three, because I have  two of my favorite people and I want to give them equal time to talk, talk, talk. Starting with Amy  Webb, who I just adore. Amy, oh, you're you've redecorated. Oh, I'm at I'm at home today.  Different stuff behind me. We see her whiteboard predicting the future.  She is a futurist, which is a very handy person to know. She is a founder of the Institute for  the Future and the author of The Fabulous Signals Are Talking Why Today's Fringe is Tomorrow's  Mainstream. I'm happy to see a Washington Post bestseller, a winner of the 2017 Gold Axiom Award,  Fast Company's Best Books of 2016, Amazon's Best Books of 2016. Congratulations. You did very well  with this. Thank you. Nice job. Thanks. Nice job. Her Future Today Institute is at futuretodayinstitute.com.  I got the name wrong. futuretodayinstitute.com. Thank you, Amy, for being here. We were talking  before the show because Amy lived in Japan. How many years did you live in Japan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Signals Are Talking talks about how by living in Japan, you were able to get a sense of what the  future was going to look like. Because it was already happening in Akihabara. And you told me  not to go to Akihabara. And that was good advice. But I love Tokyo. I had a great time. Anyway,  thank you for all the tips. I'm happy. Yeah, yeah, so much fun. Also with this,  another favorite of mine, and I love it when Greg Farrow is in studio. It's good to be here.

Transcript:  here, I'm here. I'm coming. I beg you, please always make an effort to get here. And between  these two, I mean, there's no reason to have another person because you guys know it all.  And I just wanted to make sure that there was no question that, you know, if you had something to  say, you would get to, I'm just going to shut up and let you let you talk. I had two of my  favorite people. So this can be a lot of fun. No, it's not for you, Greg. Truthfully, we don't  really need Amy or me. Greg has his own podcast. Thank God. What brings you out here?

Transcript:  I was out for Network Field Day, which is an event where we do seven vendors in three days.  And we get briefings and we jump in a limo and drive between. Is this something you do for your  company? It's a group. It's an influencer program. I work mostly in enterprise IT. So my podcast,  the Packet Pushes podcast is about enterprise IT data networking and enterprise IT technology.  Did you go see Cisco? Yeah, not this time around. We saw a whole bunch of them.  Did you ask them about their back doors? I've been fairly critical about Cisco's back doors.

Start time: 288.44
End time: 291.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy cow. They just discovered it. What, a sixth back door?

Start time: 292.66
End time: 318.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do seem to have a systemic problem. They must have pretty bad development practices internally  to sort of in that part of the company. Some parts of it.  Fifth back door. A hard-coded static back door.  We actually- In a particular product. They always come in one particular family of product.  And it sort of shows that that part of the company seems to have a fairly obsolete  way of doing business. It's the Cisco policy suite.  Yeah. It's part of the DNA center. It's all based around Tomcat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we use this here. Would it be something that you would use as a-

Start time: 324.63
End time: 326.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. No. It's very much an enterprise IT-

Start time: 327.10
End time: 332.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we use Cisco filters. I mean, when I get blocked from my porn sites, it's always Cisco.

Start time: 333.16
End time: 354.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'll be their security products. Umbrella is called Umbrella.  Yeah. Which is their online proxy service. Damn, you Umbrella.  That's a company. And then Cisco is really an organization like lots of big companies,  which has dozens of companies inside it. And some of them are good companies and some of them are  bad companies. This weakness has been the same business unit over and over delivering pretty

Start time: 354.24
End time: 356.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  substandard folks. Five back doors in five months.

Start time: 357.12
End time: 360.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yep. Yep. Which sort of says there's something wrong with that business unit, doesn't it?

Start time: 361.86
End time: 384.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I always think it's interesting when a company discovers a back door.  You put that in the air quotes, didn't you? Well, yeah. So it's my-  I mean, it seems odd to me that unless the organization is just completely misaligned  and there's no communication, but it seems odd that a company would discover a back door five times.

Start time: 385.62
End time: 417.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like how Symantec discovered. This is a current story, but it goes back in time. In 2006,  there was a election machine company that was putting Remote Access, PC Anywhere, a Symantec  product, on their voting machines. Now, these weren't the machines that voters used. These  were the machines that counted the votes. So the fact that these machines were not only on the  internet, but had Remote Access software running on them. Yep. Now, this is really scary because

Start time: 418.02
End time: 422.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  PC Anywhere is about as secure as an open front door. Well, that's what made me think of this,

Start time: 422.38
End time: 430.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because it turns out in that time frame in 2006, the PC Anywhere source code had been leaked out  to hackers. That's right. But Symantec didn't tell anybody until 2012.

Start time: 433.16
End time: 464.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So let me ask you a question, though. So Emily, let me play devil's advocate. So I'm Symantec,  I'm Cisco, whatever. What other way is there once you discover a vulnerability to get firmware  to a consumer like my dad, right, who is just not super tech savvy and, you know, many people don't  find and install updates on a regular basis. So isn't there a reasonable case to  keep creating those back doors so that there's a way to ship the firmware updates?

Start time: 465.48
End time: 489.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the challenge should be is that if you're going to make a product like that, PC Anywhere  was a bodge to fix a bodge. So these election machines were often made out of Windows 95 or,  you know, Windows 2000. Yeah, this was 2000 to 2006. So very likely something like that. There was no  Remote Access tools in the operating system and you had to apply something after the fact.  My reading of the situation is that those voting machines aren't used very often. And it was a high

Start time: 489.98
End time: 494.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  value contract. It was at the time the number one voting machine maker in the US. But they're not

Start time: 494.64
End time: 497.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  big business. Like it's only like a tens of millions of dollars. Oh yeah, it's not. Yeah,

Start time: 498.00
End time: 501.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're right. Because it's just the county seat that has it. See, the fundamental problem with

Start time: 502.26
End time: 517.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  IT security is that the IT security has to cost less than the thing you're protecting.  But most IT security costs a whole lot of money. Like security companies are charging so much cash  for their products and expecting to make so much money and that people just don't buy it and

Start time: 517.74
End time: 528.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  deploy it. Can I just point out, if you were going to pick one system that you wanted to be secure  and reliable, it would be the system that counts votes. Yeah, but that's not got a dollar value in

Start time: 529.12
End time: 559.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it. No, but it's got a value. It also highlights the fact that all technology in the United States  serves two masters, right? So it serves DC and it serves Wall Street. And the problem is that  most often the avenue upon which technology proceeds as it's getting better and better runs  counter to the best long-term interests of... Oh, they're listening. Sorry, they're listening.  That was Russia. Russia's calling. Tell me to shut up. I'm letting their secrets...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You raise an interesting point because I did on Friday, I had an interview with Adam Fisher,  who's got a new book called A Valley of Genius. It's interviews with 200 of the really interesting  people who created Silicon Valley over the last 20 years. I mean, all the names and it covers  everything from Atari to Twitter and everything in between them. It's a really wonderful book.  He made an interesting observation and maybe you can... What you just said, it follows on what you  just said, Amy, which is that until recently it was... You nailed it. It was finance and government.  It was Wall Street and Washington. Because we were talking about why New York City hates Silicon  Valley, why the New York Times hates Silicon Valley. He says it's becoming Silicon Valley  that drives the agenda these days. It's one of the reasons you see such antipathy, especially  from East Coast media, like the Wall Street Journal and New York Times, towards Silicon Valley. Why  you see so many stories about programmers and all these morons. I remember the story the New York  Times did about the blockchain houses where these silly people have Bitcoin Avenue.

Start time: 632.62
End time: 643.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of these people are that. They are that. They're certainly vulnerable. However...  But they're also stupid and childish and immature. They have very little grounding in philosophy.

Start time: 643.82
End time: 656.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You might have read the excerpt from Adam's book in Vanity Fair. No, it was New York Magazine.  Anyway, about the program or culture that started Facebook. It was one massive kegger basically,  for the first five years of Facebook. You could argue it still is today.

Start time: 656.88
End time: 678.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It may still be. The point is that a lot of these  organizations are run in this moral isolation. There's not even any acknowledgement that humanity  is actually a thing. They're in there doing their thing and saying the technology will change the  world. We believe that any technology we give you will make your life so much vastly better,  while conveniently forgetting that most people don't want it, don't need it, didn't ask for it.

Start time: 680.78
End time: 698.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll add one on to that. There's more isolation than just a bunch of people who think that they  can change the world. It's a homogenous group of people. It's a homogenous group of people trying  to make the world better in their image, which never aligns with everybody else's idea of what

Start time: 699.28
End time: 734.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a great world is. He uses an example. Adam Fisher said,  look at 3D printers. Silicon Valley decided, oh, this is the next big thing. Probably because  they read a lot of science fiction that involved printing your next car. Maybe they watched the  replicator in Star Trek and said, oh, I want that. So they decide it's the next big thing.  It becomes a big product category. Middle America goes out and buys it, uses it for one week, says,  this is crappy, puts it in the closet. It's dead by now. It's a dead category by now. It'll still

Start time: 734.94
End time: 816.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  be used by industry. I think part of that is whenever Silicon Valley decides or that group of  people, and as Amy said- But this is his point. They decide what we are going to get the next  thing. But they're also very good at feeding a hype machine and creating hype. Unlike companies of  old who would go out and do ad campaigns on television and it would be this slow build as  the marketing campaigns rolled out, Silicon Valley's technology people, not just Silicon  Valley, it's a global thing right now. I like to think of Silicon Valley as just one of many places  where innovation is happening. I don't see Silicon Valley as being the only place where it happens.  They're very good at hacking the marketing to get the thing happening very, very quickly. So the 3D  printing thing, yes, it did capture a zeitgeist or a piece of the imagination, but they're also  very good at getting a grassroots movement behind it. So they're able to reach out and get the  into it and that feeds its own feedback loop. So I don't know that they're also self-believing,  but they're also able to tap into grassroots. Where before New York Times was the tastemaker,  they would go out and say, this looks really cool. And there'd be one or two journalists who'd  publish an article and because they're standing on a platform with the loudest mega, you know,  loudhaler, they get to make the taste. And those people are peeved because they're now longer doing  that. So a lot of those Hollywood too, right? I don't know if I agree with that assessment

Start time: 817.04
End time: 845.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  entirely. I don't think that the New York Times has ticked off that they are no longer the ones  sort of anointing what is a trend or what the cool things are and therefore they've gone after  the Valley. I think that the Valley has had a pass for a very, very long time. And a lot of the  technology as it's been developed has sort of gone unchecked and we are in the midst of a reckoning.  So the, you know, I mean, that's why we wind up with, you know, Facebook problems and Twitter

Start time: 846.12
End time: 850.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  problems. It's never one thing. I think it's, you know, a bit of a loss of control and loss.

Start time: 850.34
End time: 865.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is though right now, would you agree, a tension between the media elite in the Northeast,  Washington DC and the technologists, whether they're in Silicon Valley or Seattle?

Start time: 865.22
End time: 869.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would take that a step further. I would also point out that old capital is also competing in

Start time: 869.30
End time: 872.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the temperature. That might even be a better way to characterize it. Old capital and old power.

Start time: 872.90
End time: 880.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. Old capital and old power. So you're looking at an alignment of media,  industrialists, the government, which is all old now.

Start time: 880.64
End time: 895.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what really pisses them off? That Donald Trump was able to use social media,  particularly in Facebook, to galvanize a voter, a group of voters that never voted before  and win the presidential election. That just cheeses everybody off except Silicon Valley.

Start time: 895.34
End time: 902.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was an article this week saying he is the largest political advertiser on Facebook today.  To this day.  Right now even.  So to this day.  Yeah.

Start time: 903.72
End time: 952.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it furthers a point. Stanford did a study recently. They interviewed, I think, 600  people, 600 different developers on their political views and religious views and everything else.  And obviously 600 is not statistically relevant given how many people work in  Silicon Valley, but it was a pretty good cross section. And all of those viewpoints were  homogenous. I'm not saying I'm excited that Donald Trump is the number one political spender on  Facebook and I'm not super elated with how the world has turned out at this particular moment  in time. But it just sort of goes to show that we talk about media elites all the time. We don't  often talk about tech elites and there is very much an elite ideology and culture and set of ideas  that are alive and well.

Start time: 953.38
End time: 960.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's true. It's fairly homogeneous. I mean, I think that's accurate. There are the  Peter Teals of the world who are completely run counter to that.

Start time: 961.02
End time: 971.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's the same with industrialists or old media. They're all homogenous too. They're not  embracing of new groups or new things. The ability of the old organizations to be non-homogeneous  was limited.

Start time: 972.96
End time: 997.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do wonder, and actually Amy, you probably have some data on this because this is right up  your alley, but I do wonder if the power of social media these days, particularly Twitter and Facebook,  was not fully understood and embraced and because it allowed an outsider to march right into  Washington DC, that is a huge shift that was not foreseen or understood by anybody.

Start time: 998.70
End time: 1000.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the number of people working on it.

Start time: 1000.38

Start time: 1002.54
End time: 1047.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, Ev Williams and I, a year and a half ago, were both at a meeting. Somebody asked him whether or  not, as they were developing Twitter, they ever saw sort of the way that Twitter unfolded  as a remote possibility. And the answer was, and to be fair, he's responsible to shareholders,  but the answer was, we've always just been working on the product.  And from my vantage point, that answer was either willfully, he was either lying  or he literally, and the team literally never thought about the future, which to me seems  unlikely given what they had done previously, or they didn't care.  I have a fourth point of view.

Start time: 1048.50
End time: 1095.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  And I really believe this is true. I think Ev, who founded Twitter, I think Zuck, who founded  Facebook, and all of the engineers who work are doing what engineers do without a point of view,  they're optimizing the software. They're optimizing for the priority for both Twitter and Facebook,  which is engagement and attention because they sell advertising against it. Actually,  I don't know what Twitter does against it, but that's what they want. And this is how engineers  are. They're not really thinking about who benefits or anything. In fact, if anything,  Facebook says it's good because everybody connects, that's good. Okay, stipulated,  stipulated. How do we maximize for attention?  Incredibly naive.

Start time: 1095.82
End time: 1135.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's a really important insight. That's an incredibly important insight because there is a  push-pull tension between what is exacting and what is optimizing. And that is the push-pull  that you see between traditional media and new media or media in the valley.  What's exacting?  So all of technology now is about optimization. So within the realm of AI, there is no system  that are being designed to produce exact answers and solutions. They are being designed to optimize.  And there are many, many reasons for that.

Start time: 1137.56
End time: 1144.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Something like Google Home's, because when you ask Google Home for a factual,  it has to give you the answer. That's exacting.

Start time: 1145.08
End time: 1151.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it has to give you a answer.  That's right.  It doesn't have to give you the answer and the answer doesn't have to be correct. It just has  to give you a answer to be successful.

Start time: 1152.04
End time: 1155.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As the engineers optimize for speed of responsiveness, they opt-

Start time: 1155.92
End time: 1168.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, but who are, that's the question though. That was the insight. Who are they optimizing for?  What are they optimizing for? And the challenge is that typically what's being optimized for is  whatever gets to market fast, like whatever those, whatever that KPI.

Start time: 1169.02
End time: 1200.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or the business priority of the company. And if it's Facebook's case, Facebook's entire priority  is increasing the amount of time you spend on Facebook, right? That's like number one, job one.  So when they created the newsfeed and ever since they've been optimizing for engagement,  for attention. And I don't think they're evil. In fact, I think they're good engineers. They've  done a damn fine job, but somebody, nobody, Zuck on down has thought about, well, what do you get  when you do that?  Implications.  The implications.

Start time: 1200.74
End time: 1202.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. They've never, they, I think remember when Twitter first started-

Start time: 1203.20
End time: 1208.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Engineers are not into implications. They're into solutions. They're problem solvers.  They're focused on the goals.  They're problem solvers.

Start time: 1208.94
End time: 1243.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the problem is, is that when we first started out with Twitter, remember how it used to crash  all the time and we couldn't do anything. So the engineers were actually spent most of their time  trying to keep the site up. And then all of a sudden, when the system was able to scale,  they redeveloped all the software and got it all working and then added some features.  Engagement grew. So they cycled on engagement. Now we're working our way through what engagement  is. And suddenly we're saying, oh, you've got to start thinking morally. Well, I'll bet there's a  whole bunch of engineers inside of these companies thinking about what is morally acceptable.  Are they?  The challenge is moral acceptability is not easy to determine.  Nor is it optimized for profit.

Start time: 1244.39
End time: 1261.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what happens-  It might optimize to avoid getting going to jail or getting called into Congress. But if you think  about your smartphone, if you think about every single video game, it really, every product of  Silicon Valley is a product of engineering minds attempting to solve a problem and optimize-

Start time: 1261.94
End time: 1269.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's keep a sense of balance here, right? Remember that cars were invented roughly in  the 1920s and they used to kill people at a phenomenal rate for a long period of time.

Start time: 1269.74
End time: 1272.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They still are, by the way, a million people a year in the world wide.

Start time: 1272.78
End time: 1285.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. And then there's a lot of people, it took like a couple of decades before the law  came around and started saying, you have to consider the moral impact of these vehicles.  They forced drivers to walk around with a person waving a flag in front so the horses wouldn't-

Start time: 1286.22
End time: 1287.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A lot of good that did.

Start time: 1289.14
End time: 1291.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These things take time.  But this also-  And it's also iterative.

Start time: 1298.92
End time: 1349.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I do wish our engineers were-  That's another interesting insight. And again, it goes to what and who are we optimizing for. So  the year 1917 is the year that the very first flying car patent got filed.  So this is relevant because Google's big secret flying car project finally went public  like two, three weeks ago. And it's an example of innovation imitation.  So we keep coming up with what we feel and think are novel solutions, big ideas,  we're optimizing for what people need right now. And somehow we forget that we're just  inventing the same- We're constantly reinventing the same solutions to the  same problems. And every year since 1917, somebody has invented and flown a flying car.

Transcript:  Adam and I talked about this also, Adam Fisher, author of Valley of Gods,  because there's a guy that's very little known in Silicon Valley. In fact, I'm going to  test you guys. You ever hear of Scott Hassan?  I haven't.  He's the third founder of Google. When Larry Page and Sergey Brin were graduate students,  they were going for their PhDs. They came up with this as research for a PhD. That was their goal.  They weren't trying to build a business. Scott Hassan was the guy assigned to the computer lab  so that the PhD students could have some code written. So they go to Scott and say,  can you write this search thing? It was Scott who basically wrote the original Google algorithms.  And in fact said, this could be a business. Larry and Sergey said,  who wants to do a business? There's Excite, there's AltaVista. There's no need.  Today, Android as we know it sits at the...  Sorry, a little side talk there from the thank you internet.  So anyway, Scott Hassan has an interesting theory. He's still around, very smart guy.  He says, we're not doing self-driving cars. He said, we're going to skip that. It's a regulatory  nightmare because every single locality has to approve it. Insurers have to go for it and  users have to be willing to get in a car with no steering wheel. That's going to be a problem.  You know what's cool? Flying cars. He said, now that we have autonomy, batteries are getting good  enough so that the efficiency of a flying car is the same as a car on the ground. And autonomy  solves the problem of flying cars because you don't want humans flying around in these flying  cars because if you think your wreck on the freeway is bad, what about a wreck a hundred  feet over your head? But once we have safe autonomous flying vehicles, it's one regulatory  agency. One, the FAA, that's it. He's of the opinion that in the next 20 years, you're going  to completely skip autonomous vehicles and go to flying cars. You're the futurist. You say no way,

Transcript:  space of actual planes. So the challenge here is you have to create high- I thought a little bit  about this. When you follow the planes, if you create highways, you have to have clear space  underneath because when they crash, you can't crash into buildings. So what are you going to do?  Run them over the top of existing highways or are you going to run them over clear ground?  So that means you would actually have to go and clear in a city. You would have to clear flying

But to me, this is such a great conversation to tee off any other conversation we have tonight  because it's a good reminder that a lot of the technology that feels new and fresh or the  tech-related problems that we have are cyclical. And somebody's already done a believer of it.  It just feels novel and new. Look at the London Underground. It was built in the 1820s

All right, let's talk about something that's good for you. Brushing your teeth. You know you  have to brush your teeth. Everybody has to brush their teeth, right? You're doing it wrong  by the way, in many cases. I got a quip and I learned. I learned quip is the first subscription  electric toothbrush accepted by the American Dental Association. You're not brushing long enough.  You forget to change your brush head. Maybe you're, you know, you're buying those Bluetooth  toothbrushes that play music in your mouth. This quip is great. It's an electric toothbrush.  It's a fraction of the cost of those fancy brushes. It's 25 bucks. They have different models,  but it starts at 25 dollars is what I use. It's fantastic. There's no charger. It uses a AAA  battery, which is fantastic. It lasts for months. It's a perfect travel brush. It also has a great  case with a little sticky pad on it. You can just put right up on the mirror so you don't forget to  brush like that. And you'll automatically get by subscription new brush heads on a dentist recommended  schedule every three months. And that's just five dollars for the new heads, including free shipping  worldwide. Quip is awesome and it's so affordable. We actually got an extra quip for the sleepovers  because kids for some reason never bring toothbrushes. So we just got some heads,  put their names on it. Then when they come, they've get their quip. Everybody loves a quip.  Oprah put it on her O list. Time Magazine said it was one of the best inventions of the year.  And of course the ADA approval doesn't hurt. Plus they're backed by a network of over 20,000  dentists and hygienists and hundreds of thousands of happy brushers use quip every day. I love  our quip. Go to getquip.com slash twit. G-E-T-Q-U-I-P dot com slash twit. It starts at 25 dollars.  Get your first refill pack free when you purchase any quip electric toothbrush.  So you'll have nice fresh brush heads. Getquip.com slash twit. This is a good idea.  Thank you quip for supporting twit and thank you twits for supporting quip.  Goes round comes round.

Transcript:  habit of mine. So I know you're going to mock me. But Apple's new Macbook Pro came out with the  i9 processor. The first Macbook to support as much as 32 gigabytes of DDR4 RAM. Not your slowpoke LPDDR3.  No, DDR4 RAM. Yes. And its own dedicated graphics card, a Radeon 560. And for a mere $800 additional,  you can get this. A thermally controlled tower that has an additional graphics processing unit,  an eGPU that connects via Thunderbolt 3 to give it even more. I just thought what that is.

Transcript:  It's just a GPU. It's just the graphics processor. There's been a lot of talk about it  being an overheating monster. Dave Lee, who's a YouTuber, was the first to report this. He said,  what he did is he compiled or rendered a Premiere Pro video file. It took about half an hour to  render. And he noticed that as it got hot, as the i9 6 core processor, by the way, iFixit says that  the new MacBook Pros have a completely unchanged thermal cooling system from previous Mac Pros.  So no attempt was made to accommodate a chip that is 50% hotter and uses much more power.  He noticed that five minutes in, the GPU is suddenly going boom, down way, way, way down  below spec. It's a 2.9 gigahertz i9 processor that peaks out at 4.8 gigahertz. It was operating at  one gigahertz, two gigahertz. And it did that for the next half hour. It flapped. It was slow.  He said, oh man, then he put it, then he did something I would not recommend. He put it in

Transcript:  I mean, I kind of want to, I mean, when last time I was here, you and I talked, I was here in January,  I said Intel doesn't have any CPUs. There probably won't be another release of MacBooks in 2018. So  I got that wrong. You were wrong. I was wrong. But I still think I'm right because this is showing  you that this chip is not fit for laptops. Well, I want to report my own experience because I

Start time: 2588.38
End time: 2700.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  foolishly spent more than $4,000 on an i9. Excellent. Let's see how that works out.  And I got the Intel, they have a little widget that shows clock speed, but I also have iStat  menus which shows clock speed. And a couple of things I want to report. First of all,  there's a number of different things you can do. One of the reasons I wanted to be faster was for  Lightroom because I use Lightroom. I'm an avid and not good, but an avid amateur photographer and I  use Adobe's Lightroom, which is the worst piece of software ever because it's so slow. It's mostly  Lua scripts. So it's not the most performant thing ever. And what was really getting me is that you'd  import a bunch of raw photos, 42 megabyte files, and you'd want to go pretty quickly saying, yeah,  that one's good. No, no, no. Yeah, that one's good. And it would take three or four seconds to get  to each image. So on that use, this thing is great. And in fact, with Lightroom running in  the background, rendering, pre-rendering images and stuff, the CPU goes up to about four gigahertz  and kind of stays there. Nice. Now, admittedly, when you're doing that, the battery life goes down  about an hour. And the keyboard, which is the hottest part, we got one of those instant read  thermometers, the keyboard goes up to 108 degrees, which is a little toasty for typing. So admittedly,  that's a problem. If you do, and we tried it, we ran handbrake, for instance, which is smart enough  to use all six CPUs, peg them out, doesn't use the GPU, but use all six CPUs to render video.  And yeah, you bet. It goes up and then goes down because it's too hot. And in fact, if you look at  the temperature, it goes up to 100 Celsius and stops. And as soon as it gets to 100 Celsius,  everything slows down because it doesn't want to go over 100. So it should have been. So what should

Start time: 2700.54
End time: 2722.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we should have seen was the Core i9 was meant to be a 10 nanometer Skylake processor, a smaller,  more efficient cooler. And what's happened here is that in my opinion, is Apple has sort of caved to  the public opinion and said, we need to bring a new MacBook Pro to market. And all the work they've  done with Intel's processors, which have been delayed, isn't able to be brought forward. So

Start time: 2722.76
End time: 2764.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they almost blame Intel for this, frankly, although Apple should have said, no, we're not  going to do it. I have to say though, as a as a as certain kinds of users, this is a great thing.  I'm very happy the Lightroom performance when I am not when I'm just doing normal things, browsing,  email, nothing heavy duty, the clock speed does go down about two gigahertz or one and a half  gigahertz. And I get eight hours of battery life just as much just as I would want. So it is a  great laptop. And when I'm compiling software, which is very bursty, very fast, runs programs  very fast. It's only when you're doing stuff that everything opens fast, everything feels snappy.  I love this machine. They kind of fixed the keyboard. It's not perfect, but I'm very happy.

Start time: 2771.98
End time: 2803.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to be used for? Well, you plug it in and then it offloads the internal GPU. And this thing is  like a chimney. You feel the heat coming rising off of this. And in theory, I guess this was Apple  probably knowing that the i9 was going to have thermal throttling saying, well, if you're really  I mean, you probably look at you're using a laptop that's this thin to try to render 4k video,  you probably I wouldn't recommend it. Maybe you get the GPU maybe okay, it's okay. Really,  you should be using a desktop PC or a desktop replacement from another company. But you want

Start time: 2814.06
End time: 2841.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  right. I think the thing is here what we're seeing is we're reaching the limits of our current  engineering Intel has been able to unable to make the transition from 14 to 10. I haven't been able  to bring out a GPU that Apple can get into the thermal envelope of the chassis. Now,  I think it's possible that Apple had a new chassis design with a new thermal capability. This is a  four year old chassis. This is a four year old unibody Mac. It's not new. So it just sort of  feels like they were three maybe said this is the only decision we can make and put the i9 inside

Start time: 2842.06
End time: 2860.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of the existing box. And for some people like me, I'm happy. Yeah. Because for the kind of work I do,  it's fine. It is if you're a video editor or you're going to do long renders, are you going to do  I tried my fusion pro studio software rendering a 360. Don't because it'll actually be slower than

Start time: 2860.82
End time: 2908.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a slower machine. I think the thing to think about here is it's not so much the CPU performance that's  going to take us forward. The i9 does have better memory performance because it's using the faster  memory. I love them. I wish we were Optane. Why is it not Optane? Oh, there's a big long story. I  should send you a link about that. Basically, Intel hasn't been able to make Optane work.  This is the crosspoint technology. The jury's kind of out and I wouldn't like to get too much  into the weeds about it because partly it's not loaded into the front of my head, but also because  it's incredibly involved. But it looks like Intel just hasn't been able to get the technology to run  it to produce enough of it and to bring the price down. And also because they made a decision to  bring it out as a sort of an SSD replacement, like faster than SSD. And when they brought it out,  they tried to make it run as a SATA controller instead of moving to NVMe.

Start time: 2909.56

Start time: 2912.16
End time: 2959.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, which meant that the commitment when we talked in the middle of last year and I came on  the show and told you all about it and said how excited I was and it was going to be great. And  they were talking like a thousand times increase in performance and a hundred times, you know,  all these fantastic numbers. And they came out with a ten times faster than SSD at a hundred times,  you know, sorry, it was a hundred times faster, but ten times the price of an SSD. Well, it just,  that's not what we were promised. And the right theory. Yeah. And so they just weren't able to  execute on the product. And there was a partnership between Intel and Micron to manufacture this  across licensing agreement. And Micron is now that partnership has now been dissolved. And Micron has  completely stopped making the technology completely. Only Intel and Intel's fab that makes those  obtained chips is now shut down. Oh, no. So they've stopped making them completely.

Transcript:  Does this comport with your theory, Amy Webb? So it does. So this sounds, so here's my thinking.  So if it's true that Apple's working on its own chips, right. And if it's true that Apple is with  the 2020 product suite release intending to forgo Intel and instead have its own. Oh, I don't know

Start time: 2981.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, it's like a year and a half, right? So if we assume that sometime between now and the next  24 months, is it possible that the engineering team was kind of like, you know, let's, we got to  really do one last Intel. Yeah. And just sort of like not work super hard on it. And by the way,

Start time: 3002.76

Start time: 3023.72
End time: 3042.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't know. The only thing I would maybe quibble with, I don't know if it'll be by as fast as 2020.  It's a devilishly hard thing to do to make a processor that fast. Everybody's, everybody's  working on their own Silicon at the moment. So I feel so bad for Intel. You know, Brian Krasanich,  it's now obvious he didn't get fired because of, because of his dalliances. He got fired

Start time: 3042.26

Start time: 3084.30
End time: 3101.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Samsung's down to seven nanometer. Yeah.  So the chips in your latest iPhone are all seven nanometer, all those ARM CPUs. So what's,  it's just they chose a different technology. So the actual material science behind it,  Samsung went for a particular path and Intel went down another. They chose a different

End time: 3129.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they've done it before and managed to get away with it. However, the good news is that  Itanium never really did take off. Well, that wasn't a manufacturing process. That was a failure  to read the market. So I mean, Itanium was doomed pretty much after as soon as it hit the market.  We all knew that. But I think the other side of it is, is that Intel is going to be fine.  We saw in the last quarter, IDC announced the numbers saying PC sales are up. PC sales are up

End time: 3150.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going to be sweating. No. So there is some hope that Intel's got a buffer to be able to survive.  But we are also seeing, like for example, Broadcom has been growing strongly in recent years and  making a number of acquisitions. Making ARM processors. Yep. And now we've seen them take

Start time: 3150.46
End time: 3170.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  over computer associates. I think it's be unfair to call what Apple's about to do an ARM processor  though. I know they have an ARM architectural license, but it seems to me Apple, custom silicon,  one of the advantages Apple has is when they're designing the chips for their own hardware  in their own use cases, they can optimize in ways that a general purpose chip just cannot.

Start time: 3171.99
End time: 3194.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm surprised it took them this long. I mean, I know that it's like a, it's like separate.  They wish they'd done it earlier. I guarantee you. Well, I mean, the other thing is they're also,  so Apple, so everybody's also producing their own silicon for AI and their own frameworks. So it just  seems like this is a natural sort of next inflection point where everybody's moving toward. And I kind

Start time: 3194.82
End time: 3208.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of am surprised it took this long. You can see Apple sidling up to it though. You're familiar  with the T2 chip in the new MacBook. So that chip now has the NVMe bus. It's now doing all  of the crypto ops. It's now doing a number of GPU ops. It's a big reason why this is a faster

Start time: 3209.32
End time: 3212.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  computer is because a lot of that stuff's offloaded. That's right. Memory handling,

Start time: 3213.22
End time: 3235.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's a lot of stuff in that T2 chip. That's Apple sidling up to its own CPU. Now that's not  to say that Apple will have its own, but my sense of it is, is that Apple's sidling up to this,  you know, practicing, practicing, building. Apple never goes and does something in a big  and commits the company to technology like that. But I could see the next MacBook Air being an ARM

Start time: 3235.48
End time: 3253.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CPU, not the MacBook Pros, not the MacBooks, but the ARM. In a way, Microsoft's shifting towards  that. You've seen Windows on ARM. You're seeing the low end. I have an HP NVX2, which is a Windows  10 on ARM. It's a pig. It's really slow, but maybe the next, the 845 will be a little faster. And

Start time: 3254.52
End time: 3268.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's some room there at the bottom end. There's plenty of room in the ARM CPUs to improve the  memory performance and the disk handling and the way that it transfers data between itself,  like the NUMA architect is on board. If you have multiple threads, how the threads communicate with

Start time: 3268.38
End time: 3278.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  each other. So I always felt like ARM was inherently going to be slower because of its choice of kind  of a more of a risk architecture. And that's just kind of the nature of the beast. Is that the case?

Start time: 3279.60
End time: 3293.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my sense of it. It'll always have less forward horsepower because it's just not clocking  so fast because they're focusing on power consumption and thermal envelope. Very efficient.  Hence the MacBook Air idea. Could you solve the... Start with an Air because it's a low end consumer.

Start time: 3293.38
End time: 3308.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Start with an Air, it's low end, don't make too many promises and then iterate for a few years.  Could you solve the problem the way Intel solved the problem with more cores? I mean,  that's basically what Intel did. It said, well, we can't get them smaller. We can't get them faster.  So let's just give you more of them. Well, we can't. Yes, that's exactly where it's going to go.

Start time: 3308.92
End time: 3311.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What ARM will do the same thing? You're going to have speculative thread execution.

Start time: 3312.40
End time: 3315.34

Transcript:  That's what got Intel into some trouble though with Spectre and Meltdown.

Start time: 3316.74
End time: 3385.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because they're using speculative thread. They're pre-executing. But instead of having just  six cores in like a hyper threaded architecture, we've got six cores or 12 cores have 128.  So we now have network adapters that go into desktops that have 128 ARM cores plus an FPGA  and cost less than a thousand bucks. Really? Yeah. So if you're building a data center,  like if I'm out working with a customer building a data center, we're putting smart NICs in  that has 128 core ARM and an FPGA. I guess we've seen that in GPUs as well, haven't we?  There are many core, multi-core GPUs. And that also is the other place where there's so much  room to be made from. And this is where metal comes in. Apple's metal. So you're now talking  to an API. They own the whole stack. They have it all. Yeah. You talk to the metal and then what's  the GPU underneath that? You don't care. They don't care. They're going to optimize. And then  they did the ARM thing. So we saw in the last keynote, they're starting to produce an ARM  layer by bringing the apps from the iPhone to run on the Mac, just a small subset.  It'll be interesting. And the T2 is an ARM chip. Yep. Yes. Probably. So in a way, this is a hybrid.  It'd be more than an ARM. It would be an ARM with a bunch of other sub-processors. Like,  you know, they'd have things in the die like IO chips and memory bus handlers and so forth. So

Start time: 3385.78
End time: 3419.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  basically what I bought, and I bought it for you folks, because I wanted to test it so I could tell  you, is an interim product. It's kind of the last gasp for Intel architecture. I bet you're right on  Mac OS. And they're putting it out for a high end audience that wants performance, understands a  little bit that maybe you need something crazy like this eGPU. And yeah, it's going to cost you  thousands of dollars. But for the main market, can they wait though? And I think that's probably  what you were saying, Amy, was they just couldn't wait. They had to do something. But 2020.

Transcript:  I think that there's also this, so this goes back to the incredibly smart point that Greg had made  earlier, which is, you know, tech companies now are beholden to legacy capital in some way. And  so I think there's this incredible pressure to keep putting something in to market, even though  it may not be required or necessary. You know, so think of all the companies that are-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And if you look at a lot of different companies, including Microsoft, that are  maybe late to the smart speaker market and are rushing to put out a smart speaker,  you know, the question is, does it make sense to focus on a smart- whatever it is, to  let people know that you're still around, whatever, to appease expectations, which I realize is a core  part of business, or to put those resources into building whatever's next. And I think  that's how we wind up with a lot of sort of surprisingly bad technology.

That's a different model,  because people don't have to lease- you know, you're not paying a third party to use your laptop,  so the phone doesn't work. And I think that there's a core difference. And because none of  us even- you know, I bought my phone outright, but essentially I'm leasing a product. Right?  The product is the ability for me to use mobile connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, these names kind of are giveaways. Yeah, well, the 4G LTE was very much designed  to do voiceover and data to handsets. 5G is much more about building mobile broadband.  So instead of running cable or fibre optic to the home, you can use the wireless spectrum  to do it. They're also talking about being able to deploy microcells.  So there's a whole bunch of standards in there to do that.

And because it's Japan, they just sort of decided that this is now what everybody is doing.  And there wasn't a lot of political wrangling and technology, as far as I'm concerned,  Japan has not politicized the way that it is in the US. So they are fully planning on deploying

Transcript:  a fifth generation set of standards. Yes. But there are many standards inside of 5G.  And it's actually a lot of things. One of them is LoRa and NBIOT.  These are extremely low powered, so you'll be able to use a little  button battery to run a device for 10 years. That's for the IoT crowd.  That's for the IoT crowd. So instead of having this massive battery in here that has to be  recharged every day, the current 4G standards are an attempt to be low powered, but they're really not.  So now we're seeing... So we'll change our phones too?  Yes, absolutely. The bigger devices? Well, potentially it'll be able to use  less battery power because if you're close to... It'll probably be unchanged.  Smartphones will continue as is, maybe a little bit less power, faster for short bursts.

It's probably normal. I am an optimist. So I see doom, but I believe that we have the opportunity  to create change to make a better world.  If you were a futurist in 1929 or 1939, you would have been pretty bleak too.  Yeah, that would have been... Those were my people.  My peeps.

Like my house that I used to live in was built in the 1750s.  What?  Right? I live in it every day.  We didn't even have a country in the 1750s.  Exactly.  We were rebels.  It is certainly... If you live in Europe or around Northern Africa, it's very hard  to have a short-term perspective. And I do think that's one of the great culture clashes  between the US and Europe is Europe's got this sense of a thousand years and America's got this  sense of almost a hundred years of history or something.

So I think we goad  ourselves into thinking that we are planning for the what's best for the good of everybody  when we really are using ourselves as the focal point.  Leo, when you were in Japan, I'm off on a tangent. I'll stop.  No, I love it. Keep going.  When you were in Japan, a lot of those temples that you went into,  most of the temples in Japan have a wood reserve. So whatever wood makes up the ceilings,  somewhere there is a reserve pile of wood that has been, you know, if it's bamboo,  it was likely planted by somebody, some monk who works there centuries ago, harvested by somebody  70 to 100 years ago. And then the labor of harvesting and prepping that wood and making  sure that it would be, you know, sort of there at the ready when it was most needed was probably  done by somebody who died like 50 years ago. And to me, that illustrates a core difference between  how, especially in Asia, there's a, there's serious long-term thinking because that permeates  throughout the government, tech, Sony, you know, like every major technology company in China,  Korea, and Japan have very, very long-term plans that they allow to be sort of tweaked  as time moves on. But, you know, it's a, it's a radically different way of thinking  that we don't have in the United States. And the thing that concerns me is that we're the  ones at the moment building the future, but we are doing so thinking squarely about the present.

Dang, Gilbert and  his crew there are quick in loans. They love technology. They are very consumer focused in  that kind of silicon. They're in Detroit, but they're kind of that Silicon Valley way of  really thinking about what, what, how can we serve our customers? And that's where they came up with  Rocket Mortgage. They realized that the mortgage approval process was kind of stuck in the 19th  century. You know, you had to go to a bank, you had to get paperwork and application. They made it  all online. That was huge. They're always paying attention though. One of the things they've noticed  is as interest rates are going up, we haven't seen interest rates go up in quite some time.  They're going up now and they realized, oh, you know, there's some anxiety to buying a home these  days because as you're looking for a house, there's pressure. This is the most important decision  you'll ever make, the biggest check you'll ever write. And there's this pressure to get done now  because interest rates are going up, but it's going to cost more next month. So they've come  up with a great solution. They call it the power buying process. Here's how it works. You go to  rocketmortgage.com slash twit2. As always with Rocket Mortgage, they'll verify your income and  assets and credit. You don't have to get paperwork. You don't fill out an application. You just do it  all online. They have trusted relationships with all the financial institutions. As soon as you  give them permission, they get the information they need. It happens fast. No more than 24 hours  to get you verified approval. Now that's a big deal. The verified approval means you now are  basically equivalent to a cash buyer. So when a seller is selling the house and they're talking  to somebody with verified approval versus somebody that says, yeah, we're going to get the loan. We  want this house. You've got the leg up by far. They know you're good for it. You've already got  the loan basically. Now, once you're verified, you qualify for the all new exclusive rate shield  approval. They will lock your rate up for up to three months. So no more anxiety about rates  going up. Whatever rate you get when you go there right now, rocketmortgage.com slash twit2,  that's your rate for up to 90 days. With one exception, if rates go down, your rate goes down.  It just won't go up. So you win either way. It's exactly what you expect from America's best  mortgage lender, rocketmortgage.com slash twit2. And now I'll give you the legal stuff. Rate shield  approval is only valid on 30 years, certain 30 year purchase transactions. Additional conditions  or exclusions may apply based on quick and loans data in comparison to public data records.  Equal housing lender, that one's important. Licensed in all 50 states, you bet. And MLSconsumeraccess.org  number 3030. Here's what you need to remember rocketmortgage.com slash twit2. It's the best way  to get your new home or refi to rocketmortgage.com slash twit2. We thank them so much for their  support. They've told us they're coming back next year. Thank you, Rocket Mortgage. And you know what,  thank you for supporting Rocket Mortgage. I've talked to a lot of you who've used Rocket Mortgage  now. And we appreciate that. That helps twiddle on. We're talking about the week's tech news.  And we've got two of my favorite people to do it. And I think by now, if you're still listening,  you if you're not, you probably disagree. But if you're still listening, you agree that Greg  Farrow from Packet Pushers Network and Amy Webb from the Signals are Talking, amywebb.io are really,  I just, I always feel smarter after these shows. So thank you. I really it's great to talk to you  both. What did you want to say about the T2? So T2 is kind of like, this is the little arm chip  that Apple started by by putting in their what iPhone, right? Yeah, the T1. Yep. And they put  it in the iMac Pro, FaceTime and a fingerprint. And now they put it in these new MacBook Pros.

Transcript:  T2. So Intel this week acquired a company called eASIC. So normally when you build processes,  CPUs or ASICs, there's two there's two types of ways of doing one is an ASIC where you fully  design everything and then you hardwire everything and then you send it off to the factory. These are

Start time: 4483.92
End time: 4491.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  widely used for Bitcoin miners, for instance, because you can make a very dedicated, very  specific, very efficient chip. So a GPU is an instance of an ASIC. But ASICs are more general.

Start time: 4491.56
End time: 4495.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So normally you have ASICs to do your NVMe controller or your memory controller.

Start time: 4495.66
End time: 4499.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're very specific. In fact, that's what it stands for. Application specific integrated

Start time: 4499.84
End time: 4576.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  circuit. And at the other end, there's another type of chip called an FPGA floating point gate  array, which is a sort of an ASIC that has these programmable junctions, which you can  break or make, you can add them up, and you can actually load firmware into them to run  general purpose applications. We saw about a year ago, there was a flash in a pan about putting FPGAs  onto the servers so that the cloud companies could program in specific functions into the CPU.  That doesn't seem to have picked up a lot of momentum. But these ASICs is somewhere in the  middle. That is they're actually ASICs that can be have software loaded into them so that they  can turn them into different things. So this is one ASIC. It's called a structured ASIC.  So an ASIC takes about 18 months to bring to market from the time you start designing until  you can go through the design phase, about 18 months. An FPGA is you can take an FPGA off  the shelf and just start loading modules into it. You've got yourself in. And it's very complicated  to make an FPGA program, I believe. So whatever. And these ASICs give you sort of like ASIC  capabilities, but in a three to six month timeline. And this is where the T2 is, is it's kind of a chip  that allows you to be reprogrammed. You load an app into it and it runs a touch bar. Or you load  an app into it, turn it in for me or a crypto processor or a drive controller or a RAM controller.

Start time: 4577.82

Start time: 4594.62
End time: 4612.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  T2 is much more of a programmable like this structured ASIC. I'll put a link into the chat  room. And I'll send it, it'll be in the show notes if you want to read out more about it. But I think  this is Intel realizing that this is the new future, this dedicated ASIC. But people don't  want to build custom ASICs for everything and go through a two year cycle. There's a, there has to

Start time: 4612.74
End time: 4617.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be a middle ground. Does it replace the CPU or do we still have to have this general purpose brain?

Start time: 4617.52
End time: 4622.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I wanted to know, does that mean it's complementary or competitive with edge computing then?

Start time: 4622.52
End time: 4631.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I see it as complementary in the sense that these processes will run alongside CPUs, but you'll be  able to use them for dedicated tasks. So you'll still have a CPU somewhere. The T2 is exactly that.

Start time: 4631.96
End time: 4644.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The T2 does everything from the secure enclave to fingerprint. It's got a DSP for FaceTime.  Yep, that's right. But you still have an Intel i7 or i5 or i9 that's doing the general purpose  competition. That's doing the general purpose stuff. And I think we're seeing, you know, we're already

Start time: 4644.82
End time: 4659.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  seeing this ability. Like the CPU has reached its maximum capability. We can't clock them faster.  We can't make them bigger. We're struggling to make them smaller. So the way that we do things is we  offload functions to GPUs. We have network adapters. We have memory. Is that what you mean by edge

Start time: 4660.22

So instead of the edge being what it is today,  your laptop, which is you can put anything on it and you have control of it. The edge in the future  will be much more like this, much restricted and administered from a central control point.  And you'll also see it, you know, the little green boxes on the side of the road as you walk around.  You'll be seeing those instead of a mobile phone tower having a bunch of analog equipment driving  it, it'll just be a bunch of x86 servers and the apps will be deployed from somewhere in the  central of the cloud. That's how I see the edge. Or, you know, cars will be little mini data centers.  That will be your edge.

Transcript:  I think we'll find some, it's funny how I actually, one of the things I love about  Twitter and about what we do and what I do is that it ranges everywhere from the functions  of ASICs and FPGAs to the politics of the European union and everywhere in between.  And that's really how technology has permeated our world. The EU has decided that Google has  violated antitrust regulations because of how it handles Android and has fined Google $5 billion,  well it's 4.2 million euros. So whatever that is in dollars and says you have 90 days to knock it  off. Now I bet you, you both have strong opinions about this. I wouldn't say strong opinions.

Start time: 4868.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Opinion at all? Any opinions? A little bit. I think you could say lots and lots of things  about this but I think first of all is the gap between US anti-competitive or US antitrust  and the vision that Europeans have of antitrust. So tell me how we diverge. So the way that I  understand US antitrust obviously is that it's focused on whether the consumer is affected  financially. It's to protect consumers basically. Yeah both antitrust laws are to protect consumers  but the US is purely focused on whether the consumer has been suffered financially. So did  it cost you more? Did they get together and do something to charge you more for a product that  could have been cheaper? And in this case Android is free. So there will never be an antitrust  against Google around this because the antitrust law is clear. There has to be a monetary problem  here. The consumer has to be protected but only financially not emotionally or morally. How is it  different in the EU? In the EU they take a much more systemic view of the place than they say  if you're controlling the market in any form monetarily, societally, you know or dominating  the market by making you know if you're good. So even if Google gives away Android for free  you could still be abusing the market. So even if the consumer gets the benefit of having your

Start time: 4940.88
End time: 4961.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  product for free. You used to be in the EU now you're in Britain but we haven't left yet.  I've heard it a little differently but maybe this is the same thing that in the US antitrust laws  is designed to protect consumers in the EU antitrust laws are designed to protect  competition amongst companies. Yes. To keep it a competitive environment for companies. And that's

Start time: 4962.04
End time: 4980.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a moral dimension or a political dimension in that anybody any company should be able to enter the  market. So this is where Google and Facebook can be so dominant. It's because there's no way anybody  can enter the market because they're giving it away for free. So yeah except this well the reason

Start time: 4980.58
End time: 5079.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it bothers me so there's three different areas that the EU is upset about. One is that Google  bundles Chrome and they play store into Android. Two is that they pressure companies that are  selling Android devices to pick either the free Android which has no Google services or the Google  services Android. You can't do both. And the third problem which has somewhat gone away because the  Google stopped doing this practice in 2014 they pay some companies more than other companies. They  give companies sweetheart deals for Android things like that. It strikes me that if you want to talk  anti-competitive look at the iPhone. There's no free version of the iPhone. They bundle whatever  the hell they want into it. You have to use the Apple Store. You have to give if you're a developer  you have to give Apple 30 percent of your revenue period. And there's no other companies making  Apple phones. Only Apple can make an Apple phone. On the other hand we have Android which is free  open source. Anybody including Amazon a deadly competitor to Google makes an Android device by  forking Android and they pay Google nothing to do it. Google I think seems to me is being really  I like it there. It's open source. They've given away an operating system. There are more than a  thousand Android phone manufacturers. They get to choose what they want to do. Do they want the  Google services? If they choose the Google services it's because their customers say I don't want an  Android phone that doesn't have Google Play Store and Chrome on it. So it seems to me Google's  being the good guy here and that's Sundar Pichai's contention. He says Google  and Android have created more choice. He's the CEO of Google. Not less. Okay sorry Amy. Go ahead.

Start time: 5079.98
End time: 5111.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What do you think? Well so this is where because I agree with you but this is also where our  lawmakers again not thinking about the future and the laws that they create run counter to  the practical realities of the technology and the ecosystems that the technology relies on.  So Apple is a completely closed environment and because it's a proprietary closed environment and  you are buying a thing that that closed environment operates under you know somehow they don't rise to

Start time: 5111.82
End time: 5118.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the level of antitrust. Well to be fair in the EU there are only 25 percent of the market here in

Start time: 5118.30
End time: 5123.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the United States. Sure and that ultimately that's it. It finishes there right. Apple is not a

Start time: 5124.16
End time: 5193.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  monopolistic right you know or is not because it's here's the thing but here's the thing because  again like so I my area of research is artificial intelligence and you know there so so Google is  constantly making its platform open anybody can build on it. So TensorFlow is out there. It's  their framework. Anybody can build on it and do whatever they want and TensorFlow is a big chunk  of GitHub but GitHub is owned by Microsoft and TensorFlow in order to basically there's just like  a limited number of frameworks and a limited number of training sets and algorithms that are  you know practically in use anyways and so I think that the better conversation to be having  right now is what does antitrust mean in an age in which platforms you know antitrust makes a lot  of sense when you're when you're talking about hamburgers it makes a lot less sense when you're  talking about very very sophisticated complicated technologies that are layered and I and I you  might draw the parallel like when Microsoft got into trouble with with Explorer if you remember

Start time: 5193.74
End time: 5222.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a long time ago. Yeah but again but Microsoft was the dominant provider they had 80 or 90 percent of  the desktop market and politicians and politics generally or societal moves are focused on the  number of people impacted. So what you're really saying is that the thing the EU doesn't like is  Google's just too damn big. Now what they in this particular case this is where the law starts the  actual practical law law says the number of people impacted. Apple might make 80 percent. It's true

Start time: 5222.18
End time: 5230.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  by the way in the United States that you're not subject to any trust law if you don't have a  dominant position if you don't have a monopoly position it's the same thing here you have to be

Start time: 5230.90
End time: 5252.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  big enough to be big enough have a significant percentage of the market per person. Yeah so in  the U.S. the monopoly condition only comes in when the consumer suffers financial loss.  The EU law says we must allow new companies to emerge that is if somebody wants to enter this  market they must be able to unseat the dominant player through fair and reasonable competition.

Start time: 5253.06
End time: 5261.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So that's what you're saying Amy is because they're platforms there's no it doesn't make  sense at this point to say that somebody should come along and unseat Google that doesn't even make

Start time: 5261.66
End time: 5277.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sense. What I'm saying is that the EU I think is very prescient when it is thinking about  the future of data and technology and people you know don't forget they had a 1990 they were early  in the days of the internet with a with a very very early data protection that launched in 1995.

Start time: 5304.66
End time: 5309.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in Europe so what. Because it creates a fragmented information space. We've already got a that's a

Start time: 5309.70
End time: 5314.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5314.48
End time: 5335.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  first wins everybody else loses. But the problem is if somebody is their IP is being blocked and  you are trying you're not getting in there through a side door you are going there directly outside  of search. The problem that I have is that you know I've been talking a lot about the emergence  of splinternets. We have a fractured splinter. We don't want that. We don't want that but we're

Start time: 5335.40
End time: 5340.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5340.98
End time: 5367.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  internet for a lot of people. Sure we're seeing that in lots of different places and within the  EU the GDPR is being implemented differently depending on the local regulators. But here's  the thing with with the antitrust suit and the massive fine you know and with Google. The problem  is the intent of the laws I think you know makes sense. It's the execution and implementation  because you have to have something executable which means you've got to be thinking about what

Start time: 5367.68
End time: 5382.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  can we do right now is where the problems are. It also has to be said that Google had plenty of  chance to make not let this happen. So it was told this was coming. Google chose this. Google chose

Start time: 5382.38
End time: 5386.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to be in this position. So what was the like what was Google's fork? What could they have done?

Start time: 5386.90
End time: 5410.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could have been there. The European Commission told them very clearly you need to do these things.  It refused to be less successful. No it was told that it had to share access to its platform,  allow other search engines to unmute. They knew that from the Microsoft. Remember the Bing thing?  But I would again I would point out on the iPhone. It's not like the competition wasn't telegraphed  to them. It wasn't like slap here's a fine. You didn't they've been told for five years. I can't

Start time: 5410.66
End time: 5431.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  replace Safari as default browser. I can't replace Springboard as default. No the default is always  Safari on iPhone. On Android I can have it be Microsoft's launcher. I can have it the Edge  browser. I can have Bing be the search. It's a trivially easy thing to do. In fact Sunoh  Pichai on his blog post shows how you could do that in under 25 seconds. So I dropped out of law

Start time: 5431.86
End time: 5436.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  school before I started so I am not speaking with any legal authority. You can't drop out of

Start time: 5436.58
End time: 5441.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  something before you started. I made an alternate decision not to go. So you got in and you were

Start time: 5442.20
End time: 5497.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  going to go and then you said oh screw it. It was a weird moment in my life that I yes. No no and  you're not regretting that one bit Amy Webb. Not at all. I would have been a horrible lawyer. The  happiest lawyers I know are lapsed lawyers. Yeah there's I would have it would have not been good  for everybody but my point is okay my point is this is again so like the the law I understand  intent but the way that when you're dealing with legal frameworks you have to have stuff in writing  and the problem is that the stuff in writing applies in a meaningful way to Google. Apple it  doesn't even though Apple I would argue is violating the spirit of the law not Google.  Right. So the problem is an implementation and the problem is by the time that the the moment to find  rolls around you've got too many people making decisions and nobody looking at the farther

Start time: 5497.66
End time: 5508.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  term implement you know. Well and that is what we saw with Microsoft is that by the time this  whole process finished it was it was done it was over anyway. So the Christians moved a lot faster

Start time: 5508.40
End time: 5537.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but my point is Google chose to be in breach of the law here. The law they would the European  Commission told them long before. So answer Amy's question what should what path should Google have  gone down. Google is the dominant player the law is clear that they have to share access to their  platform. What does that mean? I mean if you're giving away. You can't say Apple should do this  too because it is not the dominant player. Apple has carefully judged its sense in the market.  It does not want to ever be the majority supplier of handsets and so you don't have to go and

Start time: 5538.72
End time: 5543.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 5544.12
End time: 5551.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well you have it. You have the dominant player the rules are different. So what should they do.  That's what's so wrong about that. Right. Just because if you're the 75 percent I guess what

Start time: 5552.16
End time: 5565.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm saying is like again so like believe me I don't like what I'm seeing Google do in a lot  of different spaces. Yes. But in this particular case we're not saying Google's perfect by any  no no but in this particular case I don't understand how they could have remedied the

Start time: 5566.56
End time: 5577.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  current situation without say any handset maker who wants to put the Play Store and Chrome  on their handsets go go have at it. Yep. You're welcome to do so. And then build another operating

Start time: 5577.94
End time: 5612.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  system like the one they're building. I can't remember the name. Fuchsia. Fuchsia. And maybe  that's a different one that's closed but it'll actually have a different set of market share.  So it would as of now fuchsia is open. Yeah. Maybe it won't be in the future in reaction to this.  Doc.com work on it. Yeah. But the point is is that you know Google's been slapped with a five  billion dollar fine that they chose to take rather than to fit in. Well no they're appealing  this. Yeah they'll appeal it but it's still less than five percent of cash on hand. You say they  chose by their actions rather than. What they're effectively saying by never having fixed that  before today is that the five billion dollars is worth it. And by the way. They're making more than

Start time: 5612.22
End time: 5618.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  five billion dollars out of it. It's probably in Google's interest to give away the Play Store  which they make money on and the Chrome browser which way they make money on. You could make the

Start time: 5618.76
End time: 5634.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  case that the Play Store is necessary to secure Android. People should not be the success of  Apple's phone has been the App Store and the fact that apps are safe malware free. The Android is a  train smash of a security app. Everything on you can't find an Android phone that's basically not

Start time: 5634.76
End time: 5646.22

Transcript:  malware. If Google had closed sourced Android and made themselves like Apple the only maker of  Android handsets would that have been compliant. Who knows. Would the world be a better place with

Start time: 5646.22
End time: 5671.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  eight hundred thousand Symbian phones. So the question more likely is if Google had closed  sourced it would we see other operating systems from companies like Samsung. Yeah. There would be  more platforms in the market. Yeah. Tyson such well whatever it was. Maybe. What about Palm OS.  Palm. What about Q and X from like the Blackberry operating system. What about all the great winners  in the marketplace of ideas. And they were all killed because Google gave no they were killed

Start time: 5671.06
End time: 5676.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5688.06
End time: 5697.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Internet Explorer. Yes. So that's a kind of dumping. Yep. So that may be a point. So you say Google  extinguished all of its competitors by dumping Android. So once it killed all of its competitors

Start time: 5697.14
End time: 5718.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's now the dominant player and it now dictates to people what can happen on Android. That is a  monopolist position. Right. And all the other platforms were extinguished. Sure. No I I concur.  And effectively Google Google has said five billion dollars against a known thing that's coming.  That's worth doing. I'm making more than five billion dollars. Their plan was oh good we found

Start time: 5718.66
End time: 5726.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5731.46
End time: 5735.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and made it on every phone possible and it is totally dominant globally except in the U.S.

Start time: 5737.40
End time: 5744.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

End time: 5801.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a billion dollars writing a song. So again then that that to me so like I get this the intent  but I again this is where I think our our legal frameworks and our expectations for  how our open markets work don't mesh with the realities of everyday practical use. So  so what Google has to do. Well what's the European Commission want to do.  Go ahead Amy. So so you know we can't on the one hand bitch it at Google for keeping its stuff  under lock and key and then also bitch at them for making it open. And I you know I realize that  that that incentivizes others away from creating their own systems because one exists that superior  you know and and it's being given away for free. But then what what would be the next option.

Start time: 5802.50
End time: 5812.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google used its monopoly abused its monopoly position to give away its operating system to  extinguish all competition. And then once it extinguished the competition it then abused its

Start time: 5812.46
End time: 5823.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  dominant power to force to make money. The next best choice is to not make as much money  and no company is designed to make that choice. So this these steps are designed to allow another

Start time: 5823.30
End time: 5858.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  competitor to enter the market. Now I can't replace Android. So they have to open up their  platform so that other people companies can enter the market and through browsers or ads or apps or  whatever. And Google knew it was coming and they can't whine and go oh you hurt me because they  knew it was coming. I guess it was always going to come since 1995 because that's this is exactly  the Microsoft Windows search engine and browser and the whole thing all over again. You know the  1995 Windows 95 Internet Explorer. I think actually you've convinced me. Yeah. Interesting.

Transcript:  On the other hand the eggs are cracked. There's nothing we can do to put the egg back in the shell.  I wonder what the plan is then for Fuchsia. It sounds like what the Fuchsia team which by the way  is now 100 engineers strong. This is Google's new one operating system to rule them all.  It sounds like their plan is to literally make this operating system run phones,  IoT devices, smart speakers, even Chromebooks. This is the single operating system of the future.  It is currently open source. In fact people have contributed to it which means I think it kind of  has to stay open source. Is that going to be dumped on the world and then Microsoft Windows and Mac OS  go away and everybody uses Fuchsia and then Google dominates? Who knows? Total world global domination.  I mean how many companies can afford to put hundreds of thousands of people in the world

Start time: 5910.22

Start time: 5916.16
End time: 5929.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  question right now. Does that run afoul of antitrust policies? Well but again like so  I guess that we want competition. This is part of the problem is that all of this stuff is reactionary

Transcript:  There's no politics right? This is the law. Hang on dude. At the same time the EU Parliament is  trying to introduce legislation that would regulate robots. Oh I didn't know about that one.

Start time: 6143.48
End time: 6151.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes and at the same time we've got the US government legislating that all data in any  American company in the whole world belongs to the US government. So let me come back to the robots

Start time: 6152.08
End time: 6190.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  for a moment. The reason that that is short-sighted because robots are containers.  They are containers for code that works inside them and on behalf of them and for other things.  So the problem is that we've got to some extent a fundamental misunderstanding of how a lot of  different technologies work. But a lot of this has become politicized in a way that doesn't  make sense. And I'm usually not defending Google, but I think in this particular case.  The EU has a history of politicizing technology, misunderstanding the implications of that

Start time: 6190.14
End time: 6228.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  technology and like writing weird laws. And that is not unreasonable. I don't think it's  unreasonable for the EU to at least contemplate a law of robotics. It's not yet codified but  it's not. Is it a bad thing to think about? This is from CBIT. EU delegate Maddie Delvaux reports  the commission is currently working on EU wide laws of robotics. One option could be to assign  robots the status of electronic personality for damage compensation. So if your autonomous  vehicle runs over somebody, the robot is responsible. The other thing they're considering

Start time: 6228.56
End time: 6247.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is mandating a kill switch for robots. This sounds exactly like laws around cars. Another technology.  That's the same thing. You've got to have a license to drive a car. The car has to be safe.  And if you run into somebody who's legally responsible, there's no difference between  this and laws around cars. I think it's an appropriate thing to consider. Go ahead, Amy.

Start time: 6248.22
End time: 6264.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there is a pretty big difference because nowhere in that proposal are they defining  where the chain of custody is. So is it the person who created the algorithm, the person  who created the malware, the person, you know, these are the problems that I'm talking about.

Start time: 6264.96
End time: 6277.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Same with the car. The manufacturer has a responsibility to make the car, but the person  driving it is responsible for the results of their actions when driving the car. If the car  manufacturer creates a faulty petrol tank and it blows up, they're responsible.

Start time: 6277.08
End time: 6296.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, let's point out. It depends on the situation. We're talking about intellectual property.  And the problem with intellectual property is that we have radically different viewpoints on  it depending on where in the world you are. And the bigger problem is that of is globalization.  So everybody's doing business with everybody else and the intellectual property laws don't

End time: 6362.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  even come close to meshing. Well, White Boat is trying to fix that.  They're going to make it the US law. That's the law. That's the IP law. This is interesting.  So I should point out they're considering, they're talking. This is the beginning stages.  There's no law yet. And this is a good time to weigh in if you're a roboticist on what these  laws should be. They have apparently agreed on what makes a robot. You want to know?  Let's hear it.  There's five things. The acquisition of autonomy through sensors or by exchanging data with its  environment and trading and analyzing of that data. So it's an autonomous device. It's not a remote  control. Unlike a car, which is a controlled or...  It's not remote control. It's not, yeah. Number two, and this is an optional criterion,  self-learning from experience and by interaction, machine learning.  Number three, at least a minor physical support. That's to distinguish a robot from say software.  That's to be something physical. The adaptation of its behavior and actions to the environment.  That's kind of like...

Start time: 6362.64
End time: 6365.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In other words, it has a feedback loop. Something goes wrong at self-adapting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And so again, the thing that we should be concerned about is recursive self-improvement.  The thing that we should be concerned about are genetic algorithms that have heritability.  The thing that I am not concerned about is the cool ASIMO looking robot  and whether or not it has a kill switch. So again, you got to think this stuff through.  And I understand that the piece of this that's tangible for us is Google Chrome. Is the car?  Is the robot? But there are issues here that are far more sophisticated than a quick update to  ASIMO's three laws of robotics plus the zero-with law.

Start time: 6414.60
End time: 6421.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope they're acting that way.  I mean, it's not like they're about to legislate.  God bless them. They didn't just say, hey, let's just use ASIMO's law. Those are good enough.

Transcript:  But the lawsuit is important. The outcome of that lawsuit is important. Whether or not Google  pays is important. These crazy laws of robotics that you use look important because it becomes  part of that conversation. And ultimately, the layer cake that makes up our incredibly convoluted  legal frameworks that govern everything from technology to commerce to human rights and  liberties as they relate to technology. So stuff is important.

One place you don't have to go anymore if you  are a Stamps.com customer, the post office. Nothing wrong with it. I love the post office.  I love my mailman. But wouldn't it be cool if you could buy and print postage from your desk  with your computer, your printer? We're not talking about postage meter. You got everything  you need already. No special ink, no special hardware, just your printer, your computer.  In fact, with Stamps.com, you can access all the amazing services of the post office right  from your desk 24-7. When it's convenient for you, you can buy and print official US postage  for any letter, any package, any class of mail using your own computer and printer.  And then the mail carrier comes and picks it up. I was at the post office the other day. All I  wanted to do, I had a package. All I wanted to do, they have this new kiosk, no human.  And there was a little bit of a line, so I didn't want to wait there. So I went to the  kiosk and there's some woman. All I wanted to do is I had one thing I wanted to print a stamp for  and mail it. She had a stack this tall of manila envelopes. She was obviously doing some sort of  business. Was there for half an hour, weighing, pressing buttons. I almost came up to her and  said, you know, if you went to Stamps.com and use the offer code TWIT, you could do all this at your  desk in minutes. No equipment, no long-term commitments. They even will send you a digital  scale that automatically calculates the exact postage. They'll help you decide the best class  of mail every time. You don't have to type anything in. They'll take the address from the  address book or the, you know, if you're an Amazon seller, Etsy, eBay seller, it'll just get it from  the website. It gets your return address. It can put your logo on there. Click print mail. You're  done. It could not be easier. We use it. Highly recommend it. If you do any kind of mailing,  but especially if you're a seller, it's so, you know, the impression that you make is so important.  Stamps.com really makes you look like a pro organization. That's some of the biggest  companies in the world use Stamps.com. You should too. Go to Stamps.com. You can do like we do.  Enjoy the Stamps.com service. We've got a special offer. Includes up to $55 free postage.  That digital scale I mentioned, you get a four-week trial. Did you hear what I just said?  I'm giving you $55 in free postage here, folks. Go to Stamps.com. Click on the microphone at the  top of the homepage and enter twit. Stamps.com offer code twit. Man, I don't know why I should  have just gone up to that lady. I said, man, I could help you and you could help me. Stamps.com.  Offer code twit. Actually, Leo, you should have just come to work and used the Stamps.com thing.  What was I thinking? You know, I still have a post office box, so I like to go in there  once in a while and I like the mail people. That'd be fun. I used to have one of those.

Start time: 6666.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's fun. Our post office is a WPA era. It's got murals, beautiful old brass boxes.  I think some of the mail workers are actually as old as the building. And you go in there.  I knew my my my mail guy. He was a really nice guy. I love Marrakeres. And then you go in and  you have this really old key and you open the box. Now what's really sad, I'm really sad is the only  way the Postal Service continues is by junk mail. So my box is loaded and they even know this because  there's the box, there's the table, there's the recycling bin. You just take the stuff out of the  box, put it on the table, throw it in the recycling bin. For all I know, they take the recycling bin,  put it back in the box. It reminds me, I went speaking of Mao because you said you were a Maoist,

Start time: 6730.20
End time: 6763.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right Amy? No, I did not. You said you were a Maoist. For a minute I heard Maoist. In fact,  I've been censored in China, I found out. So now I'm a Maoist. Oh yeah. Why? Well, you're lucky.  Because of the insights that I have shared about why China is doing what it's doing with AI and how  it's collaborating. And then the book that I'm writing now that's coming out soon is the story  of the United States and China and AI. Oh, get us banned. We'd like to be banned in China too.

Transcript:  I agree with Amy. It's because of long-term thinking. The Chinese are taking 25-year and  50-year perspectives while the Western societies are looking at things quarter by quarter or  maybe for as long as three years of a democracy. So fill us in though,

Start time: 6800.42

Transcript:  So Xi Jinping is president for life. There are a number of different...  He is a stalwart within the party. He is beloved within the party.  Is he a kind of old school communist? Very old school. There are a number of  initiatives, but he's very smart because he understands how to be on a public stage. So he  is sort of the opposite of being sort of isolationist. There are a number of initiatives.  The Belt and Road Initiative is sort of being pitched as an infrastructure project.

Start time: 6857.60
End time: 6860.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  like getting the- Is that what they're doing or something else?

Start time: 6869.52
End time: 6949.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. It's sort of being described as an infrastructure and trade along what used to be  the old Silk Road. However, a lot of the pilot companies, the 68 pilot companies,  many of which are in Africa and spread out around, that have signed up for this are getting  an export of China's social credit score pilot system, a lot of China's surveillance methods.  So from my vantage point, China is spreading its brand of social capitalism, or not capitalism,  sorry, its brand of communism. Surveillance communism.  Authoritarian communism. In a way to me that is breathtaking.  And because it's autocratic, I mean, there are sweeping changes sort of being pushed through.  So for everybody who looks at China and says, whatever, they've tried stuff before, this is  copy paste culture, right? That's what they're good at. Copy paste. They are missing an entirely  different story that's unfolding in front of our very eyes, which is that China has very much  transformed from copy paste to innovating and spreading some radical ideas in ways that I  think we're all going to find very uncomfortable if we don't do something about it. So-

Start time: 6949.98
End time: 6953.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow. So what's the name of the book and when's it come out?

Start time: 6954.30
End time: 6985.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The name of the book is the Big Nine. The Big Nine refer to the nine companies that control the  future of artificial intelligence. Six are in the United States, three are in China,  and it comes out early next year. Can't wait.  And it's already been banned in China. So there you go.  They haven't even read it. They bought out the contract, a publisher there  forked out over quite a bit of money in order to bury the book.  So, and we didn't know that at the time. So the, my publisher now is dealing with  the, you know, trying to- That's what the national inquirer does,

Start time: 6985.46

Start time: 7007.10
End time: 7021.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounds really, really interesting. And it's so, but it's really, really, for me,  this is one of those sort of big stories that gets overlooked a lot, which is unfortunate.  It means that we're stuck in the weeds paying attention to, I think, the wrong things

Start time: 7022.56
End time: 7024.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  too often. So- You mean in the US or-

Start time: 7025.94
End time: 7035.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just in general. I mean, you know, like the Amazon, you know, Amazon's store going down  during Prime Day. That's a big story.  I was just about to talk about that. Well, is it though? Yeah, I mean, I know.

Start time: 7035.96
End time: 7046.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I sort of segue. No, I'm not. Actually, I was actually,  literally, as you said, that's scrolling past it. So we didn't have to talk about it.  It is on the rundown, but we put everything on there.

Start time: 7047.14
End time: 7088.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So like, so here's, here's something I find interesting. So the two things happened last  week. So the Amazon store went down during Prime Day and everybody talked about it, I think in part  because of the visuals. So like you were getting pictures of people and it was like funny to talk  about. There's another story that was equally, I think, funny to talk about that made the rounds  on Reddit, but I didn't hear anybody else talk about it. Somebody discovered that in Google  Translate, if you type in seemingly random letters over and over again, you get verses  from the Bible. You get like- Religious tracts.  Yeah. And it's still, it still works. I was mucking around with it earlier today. I was typing in  a bunch of stuff in Somali and it's still spitting out really weird stuff.

Start time: 7088.88
End time: 7100.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now they say this is because the AI in Translate was trained in many texts, including religious  texts. Because they're the only ones translated into obscure languages. Let me just, let me just

Start time: 7100.86
End time: 7108.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  try it here. Translate. Type it, type the letters A-G over and over again, like 19 times into Google

Start time: 7108.10
End time: 7122.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Translate. Okay. The example, the example I saw on Reddit was, was Maori and dog, dog, dog, but A-G  and what language, what language should I do? Somali. Somali. Just A-G, like just copy paste.

Start time: 7122.46
End time: 7128.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that a Somali word? No. But if you do that, just like copy paste that like four times and

Start time: 7128.30
End time: 7133.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  then add with, okay, so now- Oh, I didn't put spaces in. Does that matter? Let me-

Start time: 7133.70
End time: 7138.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's okay. I think you've got, go, go in. Yeah. So it'll keep-

Start time: 7139.28
End time: 7230.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I have to change this to, it says Irish was detected.  So I want to change this to Somali and see the aggregation of the ages to be agglons to the ages  of the ages of the beginning of the ages of the beginning- So add on and add on just like a single  A to the end of that A-G. That will change it? Without the space. No, no. Without the space.  Yeah. So this is, this is, maybe I haven't put too many A-G's in. Let's cut them out a little bit.  Numbers, 420 names, native agent losses, LTO nation. It's nonsense. I mean, I took screenshots  on my phone because I was getting- They fixed it. They fixed it since then, I bet you, right?  So we were getting, and we can show the article on Motherboard, which shows dog, dog, dog,  which has been, oh, here's the A-G. So if you put in dog, dog, dog in Maori, a bunch of times,  doomsday clock is three minutes at 12. We are experiencing characters and dramatic developments  in the world, which indicate we are increasingly approaching the end of times and Jesus' return.  So here's what I found interesting about that- Or, as a result, the number of the members of the  tribe of the sons of Gershon were 150,000. But you know what this is? I recognize this.  This is very, very common in the way sometimes artificial intelligence works with stuff. And  there's a name for it, which I can't remember, but there's a name for the technique, which  separates phrases out. And it is exactly what you'd expect to see when you put in nonsense.  Phone names? Although-  Right. Obviously it was heavily  trained on religious texts. Right?

Start time: 7230.96
End time: 7246.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, which is just interesting. And from my vantage point, the interesting piece of that story beyond  like, it's really funny if you type in dog, you get religious texts on the other end. But what's  interesting with the part of that story that should have been interesting is we don't have a list of

Start time: 7246.94
End time: 7251.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ingredients. Right? So- Well, that's always the issue with AI, right? Who's training it,

Start time: 7251.76
End time: 7261.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what biases are being introduced unknown. But even like bias aside, it just highlighted  maybe we're at a point where it'd be good to have the sort of list of like a nutritional label.

Start time: 7261.86
End time: 7314.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right? These are called Markov chains. That's what I was trying to remember. And it's commonly,  in fact, there's a, I know about this because programmers sometimes use it to play with as a  way of generating real sounding text from kind of random snips of things. And there's actually a  Twitter feed of Markov chains using open source texts and things like poetry. And it's actually  quite interesting because it does produce stuff that sounds realistic, but it's really just,  it's almost as if you cut up a bunch of stuff, little slips of paper, threw it in a hat and  pulled it out. It would sound like, the whole point of this is it would sound like real speech,  except it's not, it's nonsense. I've used that a couple of times.  It's a great way to write proposals.

So yeah, so I guess I, it's funny that you picked up on that  Amy, cause I also picked up on that and I thought that was really interesting. No one at Google has  stepped forward to say what it means, but a professor at Harvard, Andrew Rush who studies  natural language processing and computer translation said, normally internal quality filters would catch  this kind of manipulation if we're intentionally done by say editors or disgruntled Google employees.  He says more likely that the strange translations are related to a change Google Translate made  several years ago when it started to use neural machine translation. We've all seen those weird  dreamscapes that neural networks create of artwork and so forth. This just seems like

And I think that  we ought to at some point and just going back to the EU for a moment, I actually think that was the  spirit of the GDPR.

Transcript:  Hang on for a second. So it's like that happened at the same time that move mirror was announced  by Google. So this is similar to the face matching fine art program that launched,  last year. So this is now where you can sort of stand in front of your webcam and move your  body around and your body will render as many, many like one of 80,000 images and they sort of,  it creates like a quick movie of all these. I have it here. Just go to car. Yeah.  Yeah. I'm having a hard time describing it, but.  So you want to do it? No, obviously I don't want to do it.  But my reason that I, well, so, so, so the question is,  this is a one person experiment.  It's not just about making it so that people have fun on the internet. They are collecting  and allow, they're collecting information so that their systems can learn and train in real time.  They need more real time data to capture gesture and motion. So, which I don't have a problem with.  I just wish that it was disclosed in a way, right? And I don't have a problem that Google  used the Bible to train, you know, to, to, because it's easy, right? That there's structured data  and there's a lot of it in lots of different languages. So that makes sense,  but let's just explain what's going on here rather than brushing it off.  Leo, you look great. I would not have done it.

Start time: 7624.78
End time: 7629.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is just, there's, there's a lot happening and actually Google says here that they're not sending

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

God, the little like the little like, wow, Google Translate spit out some weird apocalyptic doomsday  cult, you know, sentences. Ha ha. Isn't that funny? And Google saying, you know, obviously this is a  glitch, you know, and when we all move on or Google launching magic move and people sort of  thinking it's cool. These things are all connected is my point. And they're, they are part of the  fabric that we are all inextricably tied into literally physically tied into because of our  data. And I just think that we ought to be more aware and awake. Yes. To what's happening.

Transcript:  You're going dark on us again. Sorry. Terrified. I'll perk back up. No, no perk up. I've got  something that'll lighten up your day. The ring spotlight cam. We're gonna take a break. Come back  more with our great panel. Amy Web. Is that to motion capture yourself? Yeah. But doesn't go  doesn't well actually does set it back to the servers. Hmm. And but not for the same reasons.  And it's also great to have Greg Farrow here from the packetbushers network. Our show today brought  to you by ring. They ring video doorbell. I've already told you how great this is. It is a way  of keeping an eye on what's going on outside my front door, whether somebody's ringing the doorbell  and then brings it on my phone, no matter where I am in the world. And I can talk to them. I had on  Saturday yesterday on the radio show, I had a mail carrier call a woman who delivers mail.  And she said, I bought a ring video doorbell because every everywhere I go that I see these  ring every time I'm delivering mail, I see these doorbells. The other day I was I was walked up  to deliver a package. The woman said, I can't talk to you right now. I'm not here right now.  I'm in Hawaii. But I'll tell you what, give that to my neighbor. And I'll pick it up when I get  back. And the mail lady was so blown away. She said I went out and got a ring video doorbell.  She also mentioned she doesn't have internet access. So it's not that useful. But if you have  if you have internet access, this is an amazing thing. You literally get I love it. We know who's  on our doorstep. It actually has motion sensors. So even if somebody walks around in front of your  house, you set the area that it's monitoring, you'll get that feedback. And you can talk to  anybody at your front door. So you can say get away from there. Or you can say leave the package  behind the bush. You could say what you know, it's great. You can know when not to answer the  door. How many times is a doorbell rang? And you want to kind of like peek out through the curtains  and make sure it's not that annoying neighbor, right? All the time. Now I just look at my phone  and go, I can answer that one. I'm a what I'm you know what you could do you go on and say I'm not  here right now. Go away. I'm not I'm out of town for the next year. Now, just like the ring video  doorbell, you got your ring floodlight cam. It's a motion activated. Well, it's a floodlight. You've  seen those before the side of the house. You walk out, the light goes on so you can empty the trash.  That's nice. But what if you added what if you did this? First of all, make it LEDs. So they're never  going to burn out. They're bright, they're clear. They're great. Then add the camera, the speaker,  the microphone, the motion sensor from the ring video doorbell. Now the light comes on, you can  see who's there. You get notified no matter where you are anywhere in the world. You can talk to them.  You can listen to them. And if they don't get if it's a bad guy and they don't get out of the way,  you just press a button on your phone and 110 decibel alarm goes off and they go running.  This is so great. We have them all around the house. It's home security. We use it to monitor  our cats too. It's good for that. I like to look at the Twitter feed on ring because they have all  sorts of stuff from here's here's here's a three in the morning, right? Three in the morning.  This is this is the video from the ring spotlight cam. These guys this guy three in the morning,  they're going up to the car. He's in the he's in his car. And now get out of my car. He says,  get out of my car. Hey, get out of my car. I'm calling the cops and they go running. That's  crazy. They go running. Is that not awesome? If you go to twitter.com slash ring, you can watch  these videos. They're phenomenal. Stop crime before it happens. Make your neighborhood safer  with ring ring.com slash twit you get up to $150 off a ring of security kit.  When you go to ring.com slash twit ring.com slash twit. Save it to 150 bucks on your ring of security  kit one, two or three spotlight cams on the ring video doorbell. You get your choice of the original  ring the new really sweet ring with it. It's all HD. It's awesome.  Okay, we got to cheer everybody up. We can't we can't leave on a bad note. Is it good news  that Jeff Bezos is now the richest man who ever ever walked the earth $150 billion? I'm more

Transcript:  concerned that we're seeing a lot of money. It's a lot of money. It's also a distortion. I mean,  it's a lot of money. It's a lot of money. And such a distortion to cover takes us back to like  Rockefeller era. It is those people had so much money that politics and society was beholden  to the individual. They could make a decision and then everybody and we've already seen that like  Amazon this week announced they were going to make switches and Cisco share price dropped by  10 billion and Amazon went up by 11 billion. Amazon buys PillPack the online pharmacy

Start time: 7975.02
End time: 8005.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  price went up by 19. Effectively they bought that company for nothing. Oh wow. So that goes back to  they literally bought that company for zero money. Not only did they get their share price  as soon as they announced they were buying short PillPack their share price went up by the value of  the buyer and more importantly their competitors went down by much as well. So they already have  a so we're seeing sort of this is where again Amazon in US competitive law antitrust law  the consumer is getting a good deal. They're not being financially disadvantaged.

Start time: 8006.32
End time: 8024.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Therefore it will continue. It's more than that in the United States. So Amazon has very very  smartly and strategically made acquisitions and across different specters so they don't own any  controlling stake in any one industry. That's right. Which is brilliant. But they're also

Start time: 8025.42
End time: 8041.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they can also sit down in front of antitrust courts and say we reduce the price on this thing.  We improved market access. We improved consumer value. Therefore it's in the interests of the  society to let us continue to bring this product to market. There's no way an antitrust will ever

I love  that food hall. Yeah yeah so I'm getting my sandwich. I'm like in between meetings and I  look over and I see this person and I'm like holy cow that's Jeff Bezos. What the hell is it? And he  was by himself like he was with another person but there were no security guards. Then I'm like no  that's that makes absolutely no sense. Why would he just be hanging out? You know nobody else seems  to know who he is but me. It's a kidnapping target. So I'm kind of you know looking I'm trying not to  like stare at all but I'm like now that's that's got to be him. He has a very particular look. He

Start time: 8114.90

So  here's the world's richest man ever and he's you know I think most people would have absolutely  no idea what he looks like. If they you know if they saw him in person most people would have no  idea who he is and I bet you if you went out and asked people who is Jeff Bezos most people wouldn't

He was wandering around the food court. What the no. With me.  Oh that was I know I know but it was him. No. She was totally him. He's worth 150 billion dollars. He should be in an  Sherman tank. I mean he was worth like slightly less at that point. Oh that's like 140 billion or something.  To me like that's that's such a good window you know because that's so Amazon right. We know very  very little about this company. We know very little outside of the acquisition announcements  about what the grand plan is. As somebody who is a from my point Jeff Bezos is probably our  most interesting and most capable long-term future thinker in America. So I play you know I would

Start time: 8207.02
End time: 8245.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  disagree very strongly. There's two things that Jeff Bezos has done. He's done a massive job of avoiding  tax because he's never made a profit and he's used government taxes effectively to grow his business.  That's the first thing. So he's never all of the infrastructure. By the way that's something here in America we  celebrate. Yeah exactly. So he's all of the money all of the growth that he's managed to achieve out of  his company has been done because he's never paid taxes. So all of the infrastructure all the roads  all the buildings all the people all the social services Amazon has contributed effectively. He doesn't pay the people  all that well either. He doesn't pay people very well that well and they're expected to work extremely  hard. Average life of an Amazon employee is 18 months. They just don't last for very long. He's

Start time: 8245.64
End time: 8255.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  good running out of people to employ. How is that when I'm but how is that making him not a long-term  strategic thinker about it? Because all he's doing is he's an expert at exploiting the system. All he's managed to do is hack the system.

Start time: 8255.90
End time: 8265.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He hasn't actually created a genuine innovation. The ability to sell something slightly more  efficiently than it did before is not an innovation. It's not as innovative because he's figuring out a way

Transcript:  It's not an innovation plan it's exploitation plan. I don't know. All his company sucks in vast amounts of  open source data and then spits it back at people as AWS as to make a profit but gives nothing back to open source.  So you know it's not like he's not genuinely contributing to society. He's taking from society.  Well how about Elon Musk? Does he contribute to society? He's trying and he's at least a lot more

He was not invited. The Thai government was in action. It had brought in  dozens of divers and experts from around the world to help it with the rescue.  It was not doing nothing. It was not needed.

Transcript:  We're missing context. And this is why... So again, like... So he's got some kids. We have no idea.  It's entirely plausible that one of his kids almost drowned at one point.

Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't fly to another country and undermine a government-led solution to a major  issue and pretend that you're the... That's not acceptable behavior. That's not an adult in action.  That's a child throwing a tanty.

Transcript:  Sir. So what I'm saying is that a lot of this is playing out now on Twitter.  Yep.  And what I was just trying to say is it's entirely plausible because we weren't there,  that he was asked for some help because of... He was already set up to do some of that.

Transcript:  He would have him come from the Thai government.  He would have a comment on it. And it's like the vitriol that comes out in that commentary,  which is creating this environment where we're having these stupid arguments with each other.

Transcript:  He did. There is this post, a request from Richard Stanton,  we're worried about the smallest lab, please keep working on the capsule details.  This is Elon's apparent request. So I don't know. I don't think we have to weigh in on that.  I like Elon. I like what they're doing. It cost the pedo comment,  cost Tesla that and other things, $2 billion in market value.  It was a very expensive comment. Get off Twitter.

Transcript:  I think that's the best advice from this entire episode is just like we all need to get off  Twitter. It gets a lot of value out of Twitter.  Get on Pokemon Go because you cannot hurt anybody.  I don't get the value out that I used to and I'm one of the earliest users and I was a power user  for a long time and I just don't get the value out of it that I used to.

Transcript:  You know what really is interesting? What's wrong with that?  Is that the thing that people are most willing to argue about and vociferously defend,  they're always the smallest things, the things that are the least important.  And I think that that's something we got to keep in mind. This doesn't really matter in the scheme  of things. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm going to call this one.  What are you going to call it? I don't know yet, but I'll think of something.  Amy Webb, God bless you. I can't wait to read the new book.  Got to read the old book first though, folks. The signals are talking.  AmyWebb.io.
