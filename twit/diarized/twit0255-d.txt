The show that covers your technology news.  We bring in brilliant pundits and analysts to talk about something that happened last  week.  That's kind of the model for the show.  And today we live up to the models.  My good friend Steve Gibson is here at the GRC dot com, the Gibson Research Corporation.  He's a creator of Spin Right.  He's our host on Security Now, our weekly podcast on security.  And you'll see why Steve's here when I introduce our other guest.  Hey Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey Leo.  Great to be with you again.  And I'm sorry that this week we don't have any gurus and pundits for you.  Just wish we could only find some.  Couldn't get them on the fourth of July weekend.  So you got us instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we had a bunch of young people on last week.  Kevin Rose, Dan Shapiro.  We had a lot of kind of entrepreneurial types.  So this week I thought we'd bring out the gray hairs and I'm really pleased to the other  side that we could get Jerry Pornell back on the show.  I love Jerry.  Everybody loves Jerry.  Jerry is of course a very famous sci-fi author.  Wrote so many great books like Lucifer's Hammer.  And he is also kind of the guy who inspired me to get started in this business with his  Chaos Manor columns and Byte Magazine for many years.  He continues to write Chaos Manor online and publish it for people who want to read it  and subscribe.  Is it chaosmanor.com Jerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, that somebody else got that and the terms under which they would sell it to me were  not acceptable.  So it's just it's Chaos Manor reviews.  Perfect.  But the easy way to find it is just me.  If you can spell my name, you can find me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry Pornell dot com.  There it is.  The view from Chaos Manor.  I thought it'd be fun to have, you know, it's always fun to mix it up a little bit.  I thought and I tried to get another gray hair, John C. DeVorek on, but he's off for  the Fourth of July weekend.  So it's the three of us.  Although I have another fellow joining us in just a minute.  It was an RF engineer.  Our radio frequency is a really a black art.  And I know you both know quite a bit about it, but but I thought we'd get somebody who  specializes in this to talk about this iPhone issue.  iPhone, of course, the big story of the week and not so much that it came out.  That was last week's story.  This week's story is all the brouhaha around the iPhone antenna.  Steve, you wrote a pretty good blog post on this, as a matter of fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, what happened was someone who was following me on Twitter created a video which just very  clearly and graphically demonstrated that when he put his finger, just one finger in  one particular spot on the band of his brand new iPhone four, watching this video and the  whole thing was like 53 seconds long, the the YouTube video, you could just see the  bars drop down to nothing.  And some people had repeated it.  Other people couldn't.  That, you know, they did the same things.  So I got feedback when I when I posted this and I thought, you know, the explanation for  this is that that you're seeing five bars through a large part of the typical reception  power range.  So only toward the very end, as as you're nearing the point where the phone can't maintain  a connection, can't do data reliably and so forth.  Only then do you begin to see the bars drop off.  And if that were the case, that explained what everybody was seeing.  It turns out, you know, from an engineering standpoint, I guessed right.  That turns out to be what is going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple's defense was I brought my phone.  By the way, I was able to demonstrate this and I'm demonstrating it right now for people  watching on video.  I was able to demonstrate it the day we got the iPhone right away.  But we were also able to demonstrate it on a Palm pre.  People say the same thing happened with the three GS.  Almost any phone if held improperly will will cause this problem.  Really the problem is not so much that this is happening is that Apple's response to this  has been pretty anemic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, one of the nice things about being what is it we are old farts or gray hairs  veterans.  Oh, gray hairs.  And I'm sure Jerry will relate to this.  I was very concerned as an engineer when I started seeing antennas disappearing, you  know, what in the mean on the phone and physically?  Yes, yes.  I mean, there was something very comforting about like pulling the antenna up out of the  phone.  You know, early cell phones had had telescoping antennas and it was like, OK, now I believe  that I really have an antenna.  And generation after generation, they just sort of went away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They disappeared, didn't they?  But they can't go away.  You gotta have an antenna.  It's a radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, it's got to be up there and it's got to be able to receive a signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're going to address this in two parts.  First, let's talk.  We're going to talk about the actual issue, the antenna issue, and then we'll talk about  Apple's response, which is really much more of an industry issue than the actual.  They were shocked.  Yeah, that was the letter they sent out.  And Steve Jobs himself sent out a few notes.  We're going to talk about that.  But let's get Spencer Webb on the line.  Spencer is a RF engineer.  This is his field.  He wrote a, I thought, day one, he wrote a very cogent blog post at his blog, antenna-sis.com.  Spencer, thanks for joining us on Twitter.  My pleasure.  Good to be here.  So I know you were interviewed by everybody from PC Magazine to the networks about this  post.  Indeed.  Your response was exactly what Steve just said, which is as soon as they took the physical  antennas out of the phone, they had to put them somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely true.  What Steve was just saying about the history of antennas, especially in cell phones, is  correct.  They have been pushed down into the housing of the phone and made integral to the little  monolith that the phones have become.  And it has caused the consumer public to forget that there's actually a radio in there and  the radio needs an antenna.  I have a little museum of old cell phones here and it's pretty graphic how the pull-up  antennas, which we loved on the flip phone, and I had a Samsung with a pull-up antenna  that I wrote a blog post about that worked great.  And then we had little stubs and then bumps and then they were gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You said, in fact, that one of the Motorola phones had a pull-up antenna, but they knew  that people weren't going to pull it up, so they put an internal antenna in as well  just in case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was the classic flip phone, the Motorola flip phone, the StarTAC.  The little bump out on the case had a helical antenna in it and when you pushed the extended  antenna down, there was literally a switch.  It switched over to the helical antenna, so you still had a real antenna even though you  pushed the antenna down.  Many people thought that the antenna was a pacifier and in fact it wasn't.  It was the real thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is it better to use an external antenna?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is absolutely better to use an external antenna and it does a bunch of good things.  It gets the point of maximum radiation away from your head.  It makes the antenna physically larger so it can become efficient and broader band,  which the RF designer of the transmitter really likes.  They have eliminated it on all the modern phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really a design choice, a cosmetic design choice that isn't optimal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  It's purely consumer driven.  It's because people don't want to have an antenna.  It's just sort of not cool.  So unfortunately, the radio waves don't feel the same way.  They really want to have an antenna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spencer, your reaction was, well this is life.  There's every phone, there's going to be a way you can hold it that's going to kill reception.  But don't you think it's particularly bad in the iPhone?  In fact in every Apple ad, this is exactly how the iPhone is held.  It's exactly like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact if you go look at the pictures of Steve Jobs holding the iPhone at the keynote,  in nearly every shot he's holding it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's holding it like you're not supposed to hold it.  Exactly.  Well he probably had a bumper on it.  Well that's the question is why didn't, did Apple know about this?  And why didn't they do something about it?  Is this a necessity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Apple could have solved this problem right at product release by having a sub one  cent piece of paper in the box that said, that had an international line drawing of  a person holding the phone with the correct Vulcan iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, but you shouldn't have to hold a phone like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you know it has an antenna in it.  I think what we need to do is admit, we all need to just say phones have antennas in them.  And then if we cover up the antenna we're going to kill the signal.  And it doesn't matter where the antenna is.  It just happens to be, I'm sorry go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say, didn't they really though, exacerbate the problem by externalizing the  antenna by like actually giving us electrical contact with the antenna?  That's kind of not normal right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Normally it's insulated by plastic or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well we did a test yesterday.  One of my engineer friends came over with his brand new shiny iPhone 4.  I still don't have mine.  I see you have a 3 there.  Yeah.  No, this is not a 3.  This is a primordial iPhone.  Wow.  That's the original iPhone.  It will not die.  It keeps working.  I love it.  But anyway, we had a test with the iPhone 4 here yesterday.  And we, in fact, if you bring up my blog page, I posted a very brief blog entry showing some  photos of what we did.  But we held the phone with the dangling two-hand grip and observed signal strengths during  a call.  This is an important point.  We made a call and the goal was we were going to try to drop the call.  And when we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is not the grip that you're recommending.  Is it this one here?  No, that grip requires federal certification.  That's from MyExtraLife.com.  So let me see.  Is this in your first impressions?  Oh, here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right there it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, there's the two-finger suspension grip you call this.  There we go.  I need a freaking manual on how to hold the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you shouldn't.  But let's just get through this and then I'll...  Okay, all right.  I'll calm down.  So it's important.  So the two-finger dangling grip in my office yielded a five-bar response during a call.  And you could barely see it in that photo, but there it is.  And then when we went down to the grip of death, in fact, we didn't just do the grip  We did the two-handed grip of death.  Oh, wow.  And yeah, we almost made it thinner.  In that case, we got it down to one bar, but we couldn't drop the call.  But the important thing is we then...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, that's important to what you just said.  And we're going to get back to we couldn't drop the call because that's, I think, maybe  the important issue.  Here I am.  I'm holding it in the pleasant accepted whatever it is, the two-finger Vulcan grip.  And it's got five bars.  And I can demonstrate this very clearly.  Is this only happening in places with a weak signal though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's four bars.  Well, it depends on how strong the signal is.  If you're in an area that's marginal...  Swept back up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's not supposed to happen.  Stop it.  Why does it fluctuate?  It shouldn't go back up, should it?  It wants to make you happy, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And see, that's, I think, part of the real controversy here is that by designing the  bar formula the way Apple did, the consequence of that is you've got five bars almost all  of the time until you really have very little signal left.  Instead of it being like a zero to a hundred or like a much more useful scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what exactly...  Let's go to Apple's letter, which they sent out.  Apple's response to this has been kind of weak.  And we're going to talk more about this.  First, Steve Jobs says, hold it different.  My friend Chris DeBona said, no, that's nice.  Apple's philosophy went from think different to hold it different.  Credit Chris DeBona on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem is that you actually relied on that indicator.  Right.  And that turns out to be totally... only loosely coupled to the actual signal strength and  perhaps not coupled at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's what Apple says.  Apple said, we have discovered the cause of this.  This is a direct quote from Apple's press release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So live with it.  If you get connection, then you had bars.  The notion of bars is a little odd in digital phones anyway, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well that's a good question, Spencer.  Does that make sense to have bars?  Is that an analog leftover?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well it's a human factors problem.  People want to see a number.  They want to see an indicator.  They want to have a feeling for signal strength.  And the fact of the matter is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a binary situation.  You've either got enough connection to be able to make a call or you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It works or it don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't have worse quality or better quality as you did in analog days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and when I went in to complain to the AT&T folks, and Apple's even said this, I've  said, AT&T said, OK, the bars, but are you dropping more calls?  And I said, well, I hardly use the phone at all.  And no, apparently I'm not.  In fact, I tried after I went home and I said, well, let me see.  And I was able to get it down to zero and the call still didn't drop.  So maybe it doesn't affect the call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, we don't know what the bars mean.  The bars are a relative indicator.  OK?  Nobody knows what the bars mean, but they like the bars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently even Apple.  Apple said upon investigation, we were stunned to find stunned to find that the formula we  use to calculate how many bars of signal strength to display is totally wrong.  Our formula and many wrong mean.  Well, look, you know what?  You know what they did?  They made sure that they that they showed five bars all the time in previous phones.  Our formula in many instances mistakenly displays two or more bars than it should for given  signal strength.  I'm shocked.  Shocked.  I'm shocked that gambling is occurring.  For example, we sometimes display four bars when we should be displaying as few as two  bars users observing a drop of several bars when they grip their iPhone in a certain way  or most likely in an area with very weak signal strength.  But they don't know it because we're erroneously displaying four or five bars.  It's like they're saying, well, we kind of fudged it before.  Is that true, Spencer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or go ahead.  Well, I think the fact that AT&T has a standard for the signal strength and Apple wants to  adhere to the standard, that's a wonderful thing.  But it doesn't mean anything.  It doesn't change the performance of the phone.  It doesn't change the number of dropped calls people are going to get.  They had to make a response.  This is the response they made.  I don't think it has any particular validity.  I also think that the measure of whether the system's working well or not is whether you  drop calls or not.  And that really has nothing to do with what the bars mean.  But the marketing guys won't take the bars off the phone because everybody expects them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one other sort of really interesting sort of conspiracy theory side also is that with  the release of iOS 4, they removed the field service screen.  You could enter a really bizarre phone number.  You can't do it anymore.  And you could see the true, like a screen of true data that meant something and that  disappeared.  It's like, why?  Everyone liked that except maybe Apple must have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The smartest thing Apple could do is quietly put the field service screen back in the iPhone  4 and just leak the information and not officially acknowledge it.  And I think people will start making measurements.  I honestly believe they'll find that the iPhone 4 is a more sensitive radio than the previous  models.  And getting back to something Leo said, is the iPhone 4 more sensitive to having the  human hand interfere with the antenna?  And I think the answer is yes, because they've moved the antenna action from the back of  the phone to the side of the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, really, it's a beautiful piece of design, but you need to give it a case.  Put it in a case.  If it's a little rubber band around the antenna, that's fine or whatever.  But then you really solve the problem.  And that's what I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got a case for the thing and you're right, it doesn't happen anymore.  I have to take the case off to do it.  Don't you think, I mean, as long as we're talking conspiracy, that's a little suspicious  that the Apple releases the first case it's ever done and it's this weird bumper case  that doesn't work.  And it's $30.  For a piece of rubber that just by coincidence happens to insulate the metal band and nothing  else Apple must have known.  Jerry, we cut you off.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's all right.  I find it all amusing because I think the whole thing is to protect AT&T from people  finding out that their service sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody's paying attention to AT&T at this point, are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  I used to have back when bars meant something and I had a different kind of phone, I used  to have four bars here, but that was when my wireless service was from a thing called  Singular.  And then AT&T bought it.  What do you know?  Half my house I don't get any at all.  And even up here I have to stick my head out the window to get cell phone service in my  house.  So if I like Apple stuff, I'm kind of stuck with lousy service.  I wonder how long Apple will continue to do that because I suspect I'm not the only one  who has that problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rumors abound, of course these rumors have been going on for ever since the iPhone came  out that Verizon, and this is now coming from good sources like Bloomberg, that Verizon  will have this phone in January.  But then we'll lose that one nice feature of the phone, which is that you can surf while  you're on the phone.  So we'll be good because we'll be on CDMA not GSM.  So there's a very good article, I don't know if you saw it Spencer, on AnandTech.  It looked like they did a very good analysis of the antenna.  This is the actual physical antenna that's in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was one of the slides at the keynote that Apple showed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple at the keynote was very proud about how good this antenna was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They were.  And one of the questions I got asked during the last couple of weeks is do I think that  the disguise cases that they had the company phones in for evaluation might have hidden  the severity of the problem.  And I thought about that and it's very possible that that could have been true.  However, the thought that Apple didn't have a clue that the hand interference was going  to be an antenna issue is preposterous.  They had to not only know about it, I'm sure they quantified it and they took a risk and  decided that it was worthy of it and they shipped it like that.  I still think the little piece of paper in the box would have solved the whole problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wonder if the whole deal with Apple and the iPhone and the signal strength and the  deal with AT&T even is a consequence of the fact that maybe they're in the shadow of a  huge AT&T cell tower and no one ever realized that at Apple you get really good AT&T performance.  Which is true, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And nowhere else.  Yeah, Apple has unusually good signal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You mean there is a place where you get good AT&T service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's called One Infinity Loop, Cupertino, California.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We'll have to move to Cupertino to be able to get decent cell phone service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  Maybe it's a coincidence, but I wouldn't be surprised if AT&T's executive said,  make sure that Steve gets a good signal.  But it does make it hard to test, doesn't it?  So Anon's conclusion, in fact they have a chart, which must make it true.  It's a nice chart, by the way.  Nice chart.  Yeah.  Signal attenuation comparison in dB lower is better and you can see that the attenuation  goes from holding it naturally inside a case of 7.2 dB to 24 dB, if you cup it tightly,  much more than you see on the 3GS or the Nexus One.  I don't know about their methodology.  Spencer, does this make sense though to you as an RF engineer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the most impressive thing that AnonTech did was hack the phone so that they can get  DBM numbers out of the receiver.  Yeah, that's amazing, isn't it?  They did a wonderful job doing that.  They actually have numbers here on the bar.  Yeah, they hacked it and reverse engineered it to find out what the numbers meant.  Of course, that's all going to change as soon as Apple releases the patch.  But what they did was pretty good with the tools they had.  I was actually reasonably impressed.  One of the things that we have to keep in mind is that when the phone is being observed  and tested, regardless of what change you're trying to make to observe if it's better or worse,  you don't know if you're sitting on one cell site or you're switching between three different  cell sites as conditions change.  There is nothing on the phone save that service screen that will tell you that.  So all of the tests, 100% of the tests that have been published, including my own, if  you can't be certain that you haven't switched cells, then you don't know if your data is valid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's very good.  So you can't move around, but you could even switch cells while you're sitting still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely, yes.  In fact, if you're covered by two cells and how you hold the phone or even where in your  house you're standing, it might change the directionality of which side of your house  the signal is squirting out.  And you could be switching back and forth between cells and not know it.  And that's the beauty of the cellular system, but that's also what obfuscates the ability  to make any observations.  I think Apple should re-enable the field service screen and let us nerds play.  I wonder why they turned it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, that's highly suspicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably all it did was cause them problems.  You know, the word got out, the screen was there, and you know, users are going to complain.  They're going to say, hey, wait a minute, you know, it's like too much information.  And Apple would just rather we had five bars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They'd rather we read the press release and just, you know, listened to them and...  And were sorry that they were shocked.  And hold it different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I keep coming back to wondering what's the difference between one bar and five bars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently none.  Or four, actually, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve, we know you can do arithmetic.  Spencer, what is it?  It's a logarithmic scale, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually the ANN-ANTEC chart, if you could put it up, shows a DBM on the bottom.  And for those of you that don't know what a DB is, a 10 dB change is 10x in the signal,  10 times.  A 3 dB change is two times.  So that chart is actually makes the bars useful and lets you make some evaluations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it can make some evaluations, but what is your different expectation?  If I have one bar or I have four bars, what should I expect to see differently when I'm  actually using the cell phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Jerry asked the question, and this is why Chaos Manor was such a great column.  You're a user.  You asked the legitimate question the user should ask.  How does it affect me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Am I going to get better data transmission?  Are you going to sound better if I have four bars than if I have one?  My understanding is that bits is bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bits is bits.  And when you hit a bit error rate or a BER that is below what is acceptable to the system,  you fall off a cliff.  So I have to agree with you 100% that you either have it or you don't have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In which case, why shouldn't it have a light bulb that says yes or no?  Good or bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's binary, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think in this august group, we've already made the argument that it should both have  a light bulb that's green or red and that it should have a bit error rate readout on  some screen that you can only get to if you're a certified nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It needs an analog meter with ballistics so we can really see what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And to Jerry's point, when you think about it really, the question, can you hear me now?  It's binary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, that's the binary question.  If you're going to have a nerd screen, it probably ought to also use some kind of location  system to point to where the signal is coming from so that you know which tower it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it, Spencer, a warning that I might get a dropped call because my bars are plummeting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know that it is a warning.  And I think if we grow an ear inside of our ear canal, I mean an eye inside of our ear  canal so we can watch the bars.  Exactly, too bad we can't see them at the same time.  And then it becomes really useful.  I think we should work on that.  A little genetic engineering will have it solved.  Well, you can have a tone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can have an audible tone.  Could I opt out of that?  You don't want that?  No ears in your, no eyes in your ears, Jerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think I need that.  The maintenance sounds expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is great stuff.  Spencer, I said I'd only take 15 minutes.  I know you've got a lawn to mow or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm good as long as you need me to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, stick around if you'd like.  You can continue with the discussion.  I mean, this is such a great conversation.  We rarely actually have anybody with any technical standing on the show, so it's kind of nice  to have somebody who knows what they're talking about.  And I've got three people who know what they're talking about.  Jerry Pornell, the legend, the myth.  It's so great to have you here.  The myth?  The myth.  No, that's not mythical.  The mythical Jerry Pornell.  He's like a unicorn.  So it's so nice to have you.  Steve Gibson from GRC.com and of course from antenna assist.com.  Spencer Webb, who is an RF, an actual RF engineer, which is mythical like a unicorn.  RF is a black art as far as I'm concerned.  You've designed cell towers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, I design antennas.  Antennas.  And most of the antennas that I design, the majority would fit in a bread box.  And then there are some that get pretty big.  But I'm an antenna designer.  I have done RF design, but that's not my specialty.  If it radiates, that's what I make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Spencer, you probably heard that Apple is hiring antenna engineers now, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Desperately, quickly.  I wonder if these are coincidences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve, you're the 57th person to remind me of that.  And every person that reminds me of that, I tell them the same thing.  And that is Apple knows how to find my phone number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, they do now.  We're going to take a break.  Come back.  If you guys want to take a break, please do.  We've got a minute.  But I want to talk a little bit about my friends at Ford and the fabulous Ford SYNC that's  in my Mustang and many Ford, Lincoln and Mercury vehicles.  It is the best hands-free out there bar none.  I can just say that absolutely without equivocation.  You've got true hands-free calling.  And by the way, I tried it.  It works fine with iPhone.  Works great with Android.  Android, by the way, is an example of a phone that in many cases does not have hands-free  because it wasn't built into the Android operating system.  Doesn't stop the SYNC.  When you pair it up on the Bluetooth, it downloads the phonebook.  And I can now call for anybody by name.  I press the button on my steering wheel.  I don't have to take my eyes off the road, my hands off the wheel.  I press the button on the steering wheel.  I say phone and I can call anybody for my Android phone, my iPhone.  I can even have multiple phones in the car.  I just love that.  Turn by turn directions too.  You don't have to have the big display.  It'll talk you through your route.  If there's traffic, if there are traffic problems ahead, it will reroute you automatically.  It's got 911 assist, which is very nice.  I hope I never have to use it.  It's a feature you don't want to have to use.  If the airbags are deployed at any time in your car, it will call 911 from your phone.  It'll automatically send you GPS coordinates from your phone.  Or actually it has its own GPS.  So it's not from the phone, but through the phone.  And play a pre-recorded message and then give you a chance to talk as well.  So a great feature should the worst happen.  I use it for music all the time.  I just, I have to say, I love the Ford SYNC and I have tried many others, but there's  none better.  You can take a look at, of course, SYNC at your favorite Ford Lincoln or Mercury dealer.  Ford Lincoln or Mercury models, optional and others.  Or go to the website, syncmyridepodcast.com and they have videos and so forth you can  see.  I can get sports scores.  I can get movie listings.  This is fun.  You can say, where's the cheapest gas?  And it'll steer you there.  Are you nodding because you have one or just because you want one?  It's great, isn't it?  Yeah.  Syncmyridepodcast.com.  We love Ford and we thank them.  By the way, we're going to be going to Dearborn, Michigan at the end of this month to cover  Maker Faire, which is in Detroit for the first time, Detroit area for the first time, which  will be a lot of fun.  And we are also getting, I am told, an exclusive tour with our cameras live of the Ford assembly  plant in Dearborn.  So that I'm really excited about because talk about high tech.  This stuff is really advanced in so many interesting ways.  That's coming up at the end of the month.  We'll see that on Twitter Live.  Back to our conversation.  Jerry Pornell is here as well as Steve Gibson and Spencer Webb.  We're talking Spencer.  Did you really, is your name really Weber?  Did you, did you make that up just for the, for the website?  I'm not at liberty to say it's a great name.  Apple says in their, in their PR release to fix this bar problem, we are adopting AT&T's  recently recommended formula for calculating how many bars display for a given signal strength.  And this is important.  The real signal strength remains the same.  But the bars will report it far more accurately, providing users a much better indication of  the reception they'll get in a given area.  We're also making, and this is the real fix, we're making bars one, two and three a little  taller so they'll be easier to see.  They're going to make them bigger so you think you've got a better signal.  This is in a free software update.  What do you think Spencer, the chances are that Apple will also slipstream without any  notice and maybe a little rubber thing on the, I mean, couldn't they easily just coat  it with something or do something to insulate a little bit better?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they would have, any change they would have made to improve antenna performance would  have made the product bigger.  And I think that's the important key.  There are a lot of pressures on the design of this product and the antenna performance  is only one of them.  The industrial designers, the artists have a lot of say at Apple, probably more than  other companies.  The mechanical engineers have something to say.  The battery engineer wants more battery volume.  They're all competing for this volume in the phone.  And I'm sure that there was a meeting in some dungeon at Apple where somebody innocently  said, well, can't you use the band on the phone as an antenna?  And the antenna guy said, well, I probably could.  And that was the end of that.  He lost any volume inside the phone.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would have been a mistake.  And don't you just hate it when art gets upset by physics, you know, the immutable laws of  physics.  Sorry, art guys, but you're just not going to have what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and this is the sad irony of it is that, well, so now I have this, what is truly a  work of art, the iPhone 4 really is gorgeous.  I have it in a case because it's the only way I can keep those bars from going down.  And I think that's probably going to be the solution.  Maybe at some point Apple PR will say, all right, give anybody who complains a free bumper.  How much can it cost them to make?  I know they sell it for 30 bucks, but seriously, it's a piece of rubber.  We try to live strong bracelet.  Those rubber band bracelets that you get from Lance Armstrong's foundation, Livestrong,  they work fine.  Anything, anything to insulate would work fine.  It's a piece of scotch tape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you go to my blog, I wrote a little bit on, on why the, the thicker the bumper, the  more it pushes your lossy hand away from the phone.  And it's going to, and it's going to reduce the sensitivity to your hand.  And I am not so sure that Apple hadn't considered this from the beginning.  Obviously the evidence is that they came out with the bumpers so quickly.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you used electrical tape and that, did that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I used electrical tape.  In fact, here's the actual role of electrical tape.  This is exclusive to, to this week in technology.  Electrical tape was blue.  It was black.  No, antenna engineers are permitted to buy white electrical tape.  Oh, you have to have a license.  You do.  You have to show it at the Home Depot.  So we, we used white electrical tape.  This is serious.  And we, we, we did the insulation and we did the, we did the grip of death and it had no  change on our experiment.  Now I have to admit it wasn't a rigorous experiment.  It wasn't a very carefully controlled experiment, but it was enough of an experiment for two  RF guys sitting next to each other to look at each other and say, yeah, okay, no change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's not that the moisture in my hand or I'm somehow bridging this, this plastic gap.  That's, that's a misnomer.  That's not what's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's, that's DC think that's light bulbs and flashlights think we're dealing with radio  frequency currents that are switching back and forth at in this case, about a billion  times a second RF acts differently.  And if we take a thin insulator and put it over that band, the RF actually doesn't know  the difference because we're making so much capacitance with our hand.  So it's not really what we would call a galvanic connection that's causing the problem.  It's, it has nothing to do with that.  It is a combination of, of detuning the antenna from putting our hand there and, and literally  attenuating the signal as it's coming off the antenna, which means it's turning into,  into heat inside of our hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the farther away the bag of, of, of moisture that is your body is from this part of the  phone, the better.  Yep.  Pat, to a certain point, obviously, if you're, if you're six inches away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it only takes one thin piece of tape to do that.  Is that correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sounds like no, you need to, the bumper case pushes your hand.  I haven't, I don't have a bumper case in front of me, but I have the, I have the case I use  on my, uh, my, misunderstood you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I suspect if I did some others did, thanks for clarifying, you're saying that a piece  of tape won't do it.  You have to have something that has a physical difference to actually affect the capacitance  of the connection between your hand and the antenna.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I, I predicted that a thin piece of tape will have no effect.  We observed that a piece of electrical tape didn't seem to have an effect.  And next week I'm going to get much more detailed in the measurements.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course, if you use something other than white tape, people have reported scotch tape

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  works, but it sounds like that wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think plastic tongs, maybe that would be a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Vulcan grip of death.  We've already established Spencer told us you have to hold the phone with two fingers  like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Three fingers.  Three fingers.  Oh, is that one on the top back.  Okay.  All right.  And then one on each side like that.  And that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it necessary to extend one's pinky or is that just a finesse only in polite company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold it like a teacup.  That's right.  Absolutely.  And it's a shame to cover up this work of art with a case, but you know, when I bought  the primordial iPhone, it had a case on it before I left the Apple store.  And it looks great now and it's been dropped and it's still working awesomely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just every once in a while.  I take it out, I polish it up, I look at it, I go, ooh ah.  So let me ask you, so Spencer, you are an iPhone user.  I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Will you get an iPhone 4?  Not only will I get one, I'm wondering where it is.  Actually it should be delivered here on Tuesday.  Awesome.  So yes.  And I have to make a confession.  I've said that I'm getting one.  It's absolutely not true.  I'm getting two.  My wife is getting one and I've told her that she's getting one and I've told her that she'll  like it.  There you go.  So she has reluctantly agreed to give up her Motorola Razr, which by the way, strangely  enough, I did a little research and the Motorola Razr has the antenna right on the bottom.  Just right where the face would be.  If we do the grip of death on the Motorola Razr, guess what's going to happen?  The exact same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Steve, you're an iPhone user or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nope, because I'm like Jerry, I feel the same way about AT&T.  The only account I have with them is the iPad because I had no choice.  That was good enough to drag me over there and I'm a Blackberry user also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Jerry, what do you use for a phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use an iPhone.  Long ago when they first came out, one of my readers said, hey, this is the pocket computer  from your old novel, The Moten God's Eye.  It is, isn't it?  And you ought to have one.  The next thing you know, one appeared in the mail.  So this one because I've still got the ancient one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you and Spencer.  It works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It works fine.  I don't like you.  I don't do much talking on the telephone, but I also don't tweet.  So it works just fine for a phone.  And it's very good for looking up things when I'm getting online.  And I Google more with my iPhone than I do with anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You maybe should have a Google phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually, what I really want is a stylish carry bag for my iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was going to say the iPad has probably replaced Jerry's use of the iPhone because it's just  so right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's exactly correct.  I use the iPad when I have it with me for almost every I would now, except that my iPad  just did something goofy.  Well, I've got you experts on the line.  Can I ask some advice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go right ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, my iPad connected to my network, but it would not use it.  That is, it kept saying that it couldn't get email or Safari.  You sent me an email and I sent forwarded on to my Mac account so I could be looking  at that at the same time I'm looking at this, which didn't work.  Although it appeared on the MacBook Pro I'm using.  So I thought that's very interesting.  The iPad, which was working fine down at the beach with a different network, seems  to believe it's connected to my internal network here, my Wi-Fi here, but it isn't.  So I pushed the button, the two buttons, which makes it do a hard reset.  And it came up and it worked fine.  And now I've got the it connects to the Internet just fine.  It believes it's connected to my local internal network.  But when I turn it, it no longer reorients itself.  It's now locked into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know about the switch at the top, Jerry, the locks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll bet you that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unlock that switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a switch at the top and I did it, I hit it wrong.  So it's easy to hit that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, but let me ask, this is actually germane because Apple has had problems with the Wi-Fi  on the iPad, problems which they've denied and then said, well, you know, Princeton University  said, well, it's a DNA, it's doing DNS wrong.  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That was the switch and I had inadvertently hit it and I'd forgotten about it, which tells  you the problem would be an 80 years old if you forget there's a switch at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There is something still not right, Leo.  My first, remember, this is my second 3G iPad because the first one was locking up all the  time.  And I remembered mentioning to you that I, at the time I was switching back and forth  actively between the Wi-Fi and cellular, sort of depending upon where I was.  Well, I've just left everything in cellular mode because I was, I'm grandfathered in,  thank goodness, to the unlimited account.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, never let that lapse because I'm told that if you let that lapse once, you  never again get unlimited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I've got one and I guess I'll never let mine lapse.  AT&T swears to heaven that they're going to put a new tower in our neighborhood shortly.  Well, if any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's good because you'll get a tan that way too.  So anyway, when I do mess with the turning on and off the LAN, the Wi-Fi, I, every so  often the pad locks up and I've got to do Jerry's two finger salute in order to get  the thing going again.  I mean, so something's not right somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Steve, when it locks up, do you mean it stops working or it just simply believes it's connected  to Wi-Fi, but it's not really connected to the net?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've seen both behaviors, a complete freeze of the UI just that it never recovers from  or sometimes it's got problems.  I found that for my particular email servers, the UI on the iPad didn't give me enough flexibility  for configuring it.  I had to set up the email on my Mac and then dock the iPad in order for the Mac that had  more sophisticated email UI to then synchronize into the iPad.  Then it was able to work with my email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  I didn't mind with just it was connected to the Wi-Fi, but it didn't, but it really wasn't,  if you see what I mean.  It gave all the indications, the settings said so.  I went into settings and turned Wi-Fi off and then back on again, no effect.  But when I did that hard reset, it reset itself, connected to my internal chaos manner Wi-Fi  network and it's working just fine, which is great.  I was horrified because I never had a real problem with it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I first got the iPhone, I had a similar issue.  It would get on the Wi-Fi and after a while, it would simply act like it wasn't connected  to the Wi-Fi, but it was.  I had to turn Wi-Fi off on my iPhone, turn Wi-Fi back on the iPhone and everything worked  okay.  I exchanged iPhones and that didn't cure the problem.  Then finally, I took my blue Linksys wireless access point, I think it was a WAP54G, if  I'm remembering correctly, and I took it offline and I went and I got an Apple Airport Extreme  and the problem went away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that generally works, but I use D-Link and Belkin here and they both work very well.  I'm very fond of those two companies for that sort of thing.  But this was interesting, but I thought it was a tragedy because I'm getting kind of  dependent on this iPad.  I think that's the big news of the week is that there's this huge race for making e-books  and textbooks and magazines and everything while it's cheap now.  Readers are, there's a price war on readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's interesting and I wonder how much of that is in response to the iPad?  How much is it that Barnes & Noble is eating some of Amazon's business?  As you know, Barnes & Noble dropped the price on, I'm sorry, Borders dropped the price on  their Nook.  No, that's B&N, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  B&N is Nook.  That's the Nook.  They dropped that price down.  The Nook was the first one to cut and immediately Amazon retaliated and then the last I heard,  B&N is, I mean, that war isn't over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  B&N, they dropped the Nook to 150 bucks for Wi-Fi only, 189 for Wi-Fi plus 3G and then  Amazon responded dropping the Kindle price similarly.  This happened a couple of weeks ago and now Amazon's announced a new Kindle DX which has  an improved E-ink screen and you said, Steve, you've already ordered that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The moment I found out about it, I got my order in.  You didn't like the DX or did you?  Was it too big for you?  No, I use it every day.  It's the reason I upgraded to this latest one.  I've got it rubber banded to the head of my stair climber and I read science fiction on  it when I'm stair climbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you're going to like it better than the iPad, you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  What I'm finding is that there's still nothing better than the Kindle for just reading.  It's lightweight, the battery lasts forever.  Well, unless you're in the dark, then you're not going to be able to read very much.  But as a purpose specific, just e-book reader, I really like it better than the iPad because  I've gotten used to the smaller screen.  It's easy to hold it in one hand.  You really can't hold the iPad in one hand.  It's too heavy to hold it for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I suspect your eyes are better than mine.  What I really like about the iPad is reading Kindle books on the iPad.  Well that's the beauty of it.  You can see that little slide bar at the bottom and you can thumb through pages very rapidly.  And that's what's going to cause...  That feature is the difference between whether you can have textbooks on electronic books  or not.  You'll never have textbooks on a Kindle as long as you don't have some faster way to  flip through the pages, which you can do so easily on the iPad.  That was genius on their part to have done that.  They got better.  The Kindle app on the iPad is better for reading Kindle books than the Kindle itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, and they put it on the iPhone and they've added audio and video to the iPad and iPhone  and they've also put it now on the Android phone.  I was told, and I don't know how true this is, that there's two different divisions at  Amazon.  One selling the hardware and one pushing the software.  Because I could never understand why...  Is Amazon in the book business?  If they are, put Kindle everywhere, right?  You don't care about the hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're in the razor blade business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  They just want to sell the books, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They want you to have something to read it with, which is why they didn't resist having  Kindle apps on iPads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But why do they still make a Kindle then if they've got a platform now?  They don't need to make the Kindle anymore.  How long do you think they will?  Well, I don't know.  They just announced a new one on July 1st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That still makes razors too, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're making a big deal about the new Kindle DX.  50% improved contrast.  By the way, they say this may be a first step towards a color Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, a color Kindle with an easy to...  Look, there is an enormous potential in this business in textbooks.  High school textbooks are so doggone expensive that if you can do them with e-books, it's  a lot cheaper for the schools.  And over time, it'll be cheaper for everybody.  But you're not going to do it unless you can thumb back and you can do bookmarking and  thumb back and forth between those pages much more rapidly than you can with a Kindle right  now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other interesting thing that Amazon introduced with the Kindle, I'm not so sure how I feel  about it, but they've added sort of a social networking aspect to it where you're reading  a Kindle book and you're seeing highlights that other people who read the same book made  before you came along.  That's kind of weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can and I have been very careful to ignore all that.  Can you turn it off?  You don't have to see it.  Okay, you can turn it off.  Yeah.  Well, if I knew it was Steve Gibson or Leo Laporte's comments, I would probably leave  them on.  But since they are more likely to be those of somebody who has picked up the book in  a bookstore, who do I know?  I mean, there are more, let us face it, I think everybody on this program has more social  contacts than we need right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, in this case, Jerry, you definitely, I just want to advise you, stay away from  Twitter.  That's not where you want to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have never tweeted in my life and I am sorry to say, Leo, I'm proud of you that you are  the leading twit in this world, but I don't have any, I have never even been vaguely tempted  to find out when you were having lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, watch out, Jerry, because Steve felt like that a year ago and now Steve's got three  Twitter accounts.  Really?  He can't stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gibson, are you now a tweet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't realize that.  Oh yeah, he's got at, what is it?  What is it Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have Gibson Research for corporate stuff.  I have SGGRC for my daily stuff that occurs to me and SGPad.  And what I'm finding is I've got, I don't know, like 11,200 some followers and I'm deep  into what's going on.  Well it takes a while, you got to build up.  And so I'm following along what's happening with the industry, but for example, last Saturday  when I realized what was going on with the iPhone just based on sort of other people's  experimental results, because I don't have one, I created a blog posting and then I was  able to announce it on the Twitter and a lot of people found out about that way.  So for me it's just a great communication medium.  And for example, earlier this morning I said, hey, Leo and you and I are going to be on  Twitter at 2.15 p.m. Pacific and I got a ton of feedback from people who are really happy  to find out about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm sure a lot more people are watching because of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure that's the case and I guess that's true, but can't you do it just by announcing  it on blogs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter pushes it out as opposed to a blog where people have to go to your blog to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they don't.  Well they don't.  Well then no one to subscribe to feeds don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know what's happened, Jerry?  I think fewer and fewer people use feed readers and read feeds.  That's become I think a little less popular thanks to Twitter where you get these little  short bursts.  Twitter, if you craft your list carefully, becomes kind of like a feed reader that's  put together by other people.  And this gets back to this idea that Amazon's having, which I think is very interesting,  of including others' annotations in your book.  And you hit the nail on the head, Jerry.  If you could pick whose annotations you were looking at, wouldn't that be valuable?  That's kind of what Twitter does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I suppose.  You have probably talked me into looking at it and that's horrifying because my notion  of Twitter up to now has largely been that the only twit I ever saw was somebody was  telling me he was about to have a sandwich and then go to the toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't need that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I thought, why was it that I wanted to know this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well you don't follow that guy.  You follow people like Steve who say interesting things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the fact is, Jerry, celebrities of various walks of life get a lot of followers and you'll  be able to share things that you care about.  Like little short bursts about a book you found or a movie review or a restaurant that  you liked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I do on my day book now.  I mean, I invented the blog for heaven's sake.  Stick with the blog, it's okay.  I have a pretty good claim to have been the first blogger and I don't know that I want  to abandon blogs for tweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, don't, Jerry.  And how many people are reading the blog?  Do you have a sense for subscriber number?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know how many paid subscribers I have.  I know the usual ratio and I know how many uniques I get, which is in the order of 100,000  a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are you happy with the success of the view from Chaos Manor?  Has it gone well for me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I'm not getting any 20,000 a month out of it the way I heard you say on the radio  you were doing.  But that's donations, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those people are contributing to the cause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's because you don't have a Twitter account, Jerry.  That's entirely wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Contributing to what?  Contributing to what?  I mean, is that just gifts to you or what the cause was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We did this a while ago.  When we first started Twitter, it was all supported by donations because we didn't have  any advertisers.  And as it grew gradually, the plan was always, well, not always, but the plan after a few  months of this was, I should get some advertisers because I'm not going to be able to live off  what people donate.  And we now have a fairly good stable of advertisers, very high quality advertisers.  And I realized, well, why are people donating?  It doesn't make sense to have donations and advertisement.  But I still want to encourage donations because what it really is is a buy-in.  We're only asking $2 a month, a way of saying, I'm part of this.  I support it.  I like it.  And it's a way of feedback too.  So I thought, well, here's what I'll do.  I won't take a salary out of Twitter.  We've got enough people taking money out of Twitter, including 10 employees now and about  30 or 40 contractors.  They'll be funded by the advertising, but I'll take my salary out of donations.  So that when you donate something, it really has a direct result.  And that's worked out pretty well.  And it went up to about $20,000 a month when I started doing that.  I don't take all that money, Jerry, because I take 10 out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I don't provide, let's say my subscribers feel satisfied, I guess, because I have one  of the highest renewal rates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're supporting you.  I think that that's a really worthy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's not my full-time job.  I'm still a fiction writer.  And I don't have time to supervise employees to come up with the kind of content that would  justify taking that kind of money out of Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just don't put that much in it.  Back in the bank days, I had 30 editors working with and some of them for me back in New Hampshire.  And I could go to all of the conferences and keep up to date and have somebody, I want  you to follow this for me and let me know if something interesting happens.  Now it's all in full.  But you know, I get, I think I have the most interesting mailbag on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you publish this, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I have my mail on the web as part of the Jerry Purnell.  I think that's a great idea.  I also have a mailbag in Chaos Managed Review.  Chaos Managed Review is not political.  It is purely technology and it's the old bike column and it's comments.  My website, that one, the one you're showing in the background now, that website is whatever  I think of.  But I think of it as my technology and civilization seminar.  Richard Feynman was getting me on to the faculty at Caltech to do a senior seminar on technology  and civilization.  Oh, I would have loved to have seen that.  And this is basically what I do on that.  And that's what people are subscribing to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I didn't know that.  I thought they were subscribing to Chaos Managed.  So it's JerryPurnell.com.  They get them both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You get them both.  They get them both.  The same subscription is to both.  I don't try to distinguish them.  And I don't have any ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, we're going to do an ad because we've got to make some money here.  But I do want to talk about leaky capacitors.  And this is, you know, we were talking about Apple's problems.  Well Dell's got some big problems they're facing, including some lawsuits over these  leaky capacitors.  And I want to get your take on that in just a second, if I might.  Before we do, though, I do want to talk a little bit about Carbonite.com.  Yes, another one of our great sponsors.  They've been with us for a long time.  In fact, I'm putting Carbonite, I mentioned this on my daughter's laptop.  I just put it on last yesterday.  She's got a Mac.  Carbonite works on a PC or Mac.  She's going off to college this fall.  And I can tell you right now, I know I'm going to get the call at some point where she says,  Daddy, I lost my paper or the laptop or the hard drive died and all my data too.  And I'm going to say, I'm going to be the hero.  I'm going to say, don't worry, dear.  You've got Carbonite.  Carbonite, the leader in online backup.  We all know that computer disasters happen.  Hard drives fail.  Steve's made a living on failing hard drives.  Laptops get stolen right and left.  Carbonite is the way to backup.  It's automatic.  As soon as you put Carbonite on your system, in fact, you go right now to Carbonite.com,  use the offer code TWIT.  You can put it on and try it for two weeks free.

No credit card needed for this free trial either.  It's just absolutely free and open.  Carbonite.com offer code TWIT.  Just do me a favor, try it.  I know you're going to like it.  So Dell, this is an article in the New York Times came out a couple of days ago.  After the math department at the University of Texas noticed some of its Dell computers  failing, Dell examined the machines.  The company came up with an unusual reason for the computer's demise.  The school had overtaxed the machines by making them perform difficult math calculations.  Not so.  That's just their excuse.  It turns out Dell knew, it's being sued right now, the lawsuit is in process.  Dell knew at the time that they had faulty electrical components.  They sold millions of computers with bad capacitors from 2003 to 2005.  Dell more than any other, HP and Apple had the same problem.  These capacitors were used widely.  But Dell had a huge number of problems with these computers.  And unfortunately, even though they knew what was going on, they decided to, well,  basically sounds like a lie about what was going on.  Now they're admitting it.  These bad capacitors popped, leaked fluid, caused crashes.  And the documents that were recently unsealed in the case against Dell in the federal district  court in North Carolina show that Dell had far more of a problem than others.  11.8 million computers in those two years that had the faulty capacitors for my company.  We had one of them.  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are these on the motherboard or in the power supply?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  They're on the motherboard and we had a large, at the time, large Dell computer that we were  using for simulations.  And the same thing happened.  We started getting weird memory errors.  Too much math, Spencer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Too much math.  You've got to stop that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you ever actually have too much math?  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You remember Intel had that problem with one of their math chips for a while.  Yeah, they had that bad floating point, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  So we got a brand new motherboard under service contract in that computer.  And it was obvious when you looked at the electrolytics, they were swelled.  And those were the bad caps.  And the technician told me about it.  He admitted it.  Oh, yes.  He said, yeah, we have a bad load of capacitors and that's what's causing it.  And when you looked at the board, it was obvious that that was so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the discovery, these documents...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Is this an ongoing problem or is it something that happened, they fixed it and now their  big problem is they're going to have to replace a bunch of motherboards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They fixed it.  They said if you had the bad capacitors, the chances of it failing were 97%.  The problem is, and this is the smoking gun that's coming out now with discovery, is that  Dell employees went out of their way to conceal it.  In one email exchange quoting the New York Times between Dell customer support employees  concerning computers at a law firm, a Dell worker says, quote, we need to avoid all language  indicating the boards were bad or had issues per our discussion this morning.  Another quote, don't bring this to the customer's attention proactively.  Another quote, emphasize uncertainty.  That's why I was curious, Spencer, whether they told you what was wrong.  So they admitted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The technician absolutely admitted it.  But if you looked at the motherboard and you were an engineer, it was plain.  You couldn't miss it.  It was just you wanted to get under the table before they exploded.  That's how bloated they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The thing that's interesting is that this has been a known vulnerability and problem  that's been ongoing for like a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's been longer than that, Steve.  We had those problems with S100 bus boards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In this case, I think what's happened is that no offense made to China, but we have very,  very inexpensive Chinese manufacturers who are producing something which is unfortunately  not solid state.  The electrolytic capacitors on motherboards and power supplies are arguably liquid state  because they have a dielectric in them in order to make them go, which can dry out over  time or in some cases it can get punched through.  And so the capacitor starts to heat up and then pushes this dielectric out of itself.  So unlike resistors and chips, which are like the other components on the motherboard, which  really are sort of solid state, capacitors are not so much that.  And the quality of manufacturer, when you really squeeze the price out of them, this  is sort of a consequence of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that has been true since ham radio days in the 1940s for heaven's sake.  So just bad manufacturing.  You bought quality items for when you were building your stuff back in those days.  You always paid attention to the capacitors because those were the ones that were most  likely to fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a $40 million lawsuit now from a North Carolina Internet Services company.  They say that Dell tried to hide the problem.  There's also a risk because these capacitors could also burst into flame.  You could have a serious, not merely bad math calculations, you could have a serious problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But did anyone, did any of them burst into flame?  Did anybody get hurt?  Or is this just some lawyers who have found a way to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I don't know, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are all pretty low voltage.  Normally the symptom of this is just the machine locking up.  It just, you know, it freezes and the machine doesn't work and they replace the motherboards,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  right?  When you, when they may have said it was the deal on the dongle rather than it was a bad  capacitor, but they still replace the motherboard.  Is that not correct?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes with the bad capacitors on the new motherboard as well.  Yeah.  If you've got a bad supplier, you're going to have bad capacitors.  You know, that's a good question.  11.8 million computers were shipped with these bad capacitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And these computers have like 15 or 20 of these capacitors on the motherboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's pretty, for the most part, Optiplexes again from 2003 to 2005.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's pretty likely the machine was going to fail if it had that bad lot in it.  Oh yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say 97% chance the machine would fail.  Sooner or later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They replaced them all as soon as they, as somebody complained.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The issue is that Dell is, you know, had an active policy, not according to these documents,  had an active policy, not to say that's what was wrong.  Of course they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Apple has an active policy not to admit anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you're just saying it's endemic, huh?  It's in the nature of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm saying that it's the normal way people do business for heaven's sake.  And it is the normal way the law used to try to get themselves rich.  Because you can make certain that the client is never going to get a dime out of this class  action suit.  The client will get a coupon worth a new capacitor someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well now we have these alleged lawsuits that are filed.  Actually, they're not alleged.  There were several lawsuits that were filed against Apple with respect to the iPhone 4  antenna.  And they're saying that the antenna was defective and Apple knew it.  And you know, what do you have to say about that?  I mean, the antenna was a design choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only thing that could happen, I think, would be if the lawsuits don't get just dismissed  out of hand, through the process of discovery, we would get access to documents.  And it would be interesting to know what Apple knew and when they knew it, if anything.  I think that's probably unlikely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it ain't my business.  My business is to use Apple products until I don't like them and then I'll go buy something  else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that is Steve Jobs' defense.  In fact, that's what it said in that press release is, you know, we'll give you 30 days  to decide you want something else and if you want something else, go buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pioneers are the ones with the arrows in their backs, for heaven's sake.  I mean, I've been doing that for 40 years.  I've been using equipment, some of which wasn't in...  I had two of those Intel things with the bad chips in them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's why you're sort of careful when you sit down, right, Jerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wouldn't you agree though, Jerry, that the right thing for a company to do would be to  acknowledge the problem and fix it as opposed to stonewall, deny, put it off as long as...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What's the right thing to do?  Now tell me who does it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well apparently not Dell or Apple.  Who else?  I don't know.  That's a good question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Name somebody who does what you think is the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could name one, but it's not a technology company.  Who's that?  L.L. Bean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, that's true.  Yeah.  You have a problem with your waterproof boots.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And Eddie Bauer used to be.  It's no longer the case, but at one time Eddie Bauer's stuff was always guaranteed forever.  If you didn't like something, you brought it back 20 years later.  I didn't like this jacket very much.  Oh, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if you've seen these...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Notice they went out of... they didn't exactly go out of business.  Eddie Bauer...  They're not flourishing.  ...no one's their own Eddie Bauer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now I got to warn you, there's a little bit of profanity in the video that I'm about to  play.  This is a very funny video.  Everybody in our studio audience is now turning to face the screen and listening carefully.  The very funny video made by a Best Buy, I believe a Best Buy employee.  Right, Best Buy.  About the iPhone, the typical iPhone customer.  I'll just play a little bit of this.  We'll bloop out in the download.  We'll bloop out the profanity, but for those of you watching live, just cover your shell-like  ears here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Welcome to Phone Mart.  How may I help you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  iPhone 4.  Where is the iPhone 4?  I need an iPhone 4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I'm very sorry, but we are currently sold out.  However, we did finally get some more HTC EVOs in.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is that?  Is it an iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it is that 4G phone on Sprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's not an iPhone, why would I want it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well it's similar to an iPhone, but has a bigger screen.  The internet speeds are around 3 times faster.  It has a higher resolution camera on both the front and the back.  And it doesn't require you to be on Wi-Fi to use video chat.  Its battery is replaceable, as is the memory card.  It is highly customizable, everything from the widgets to the icons, the fonts and even  has video wallpaper.  The monthly bill is cheaper.  Prince money.  I don't care.  It's inbred up to 3 wishes, even if one of those wishes is for an iPhone.  I don't care.  It has an app that will build you an island, and then it transforms into a jet and flies  you there.  I don't care.  And it's mother f***ing indestructible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't care about any of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay fine, then what the hell entices you about the iPhone 4, if you don't mind me asking?  It is an iPhone.  You do realize that doesn't mean anything, it's a brand.  They could put out a f***ing brick and call it an iPhone if they wanted to.  Yes, but it's the best phone.  Can you explain how?  I can download apps to it.  Big deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, it goes on.  It's actually totally inspired.  It's brilliant and the kid who made it is about to lose his job at Best Buy.  Because I don't know why, I don't know what their justification is for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well in fact, he's been suspended and now they're trying to figure out how to make it  permanent.  So I don't think they know yet what the justification is either that would pass the attorneys.  Brian Moppen is a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well that's alright, Droid should hire him immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah exactly.  Get him a job at a Sprint store.  Brian Moppen is 25 year old Kansas City, Missourian.  He's been working at the Best Buy selling mobile phones for the last three and a half  years.  I think he's offended them indefinitely because the video which currently has millions of  views on YouTube offended somebody at corporate.  They felt quote, it disparaged a brand they carried as well as the store itself and were  fearful of stockholders and customers being turned off to Best Buy mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did it mention Best Buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did the video mention Best Buy?  Not once.  In fact, at the beginning it says some random name for a phone store.  Yeah, they don't have a case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think he may make his next couple of years salary in the lawsuit.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if Missouri is an at will state.  I mean in California they can fire him for any reason at all.  But they ought to move him into creative services.  A libertarian like me, I think they ought to be able to fire him because they don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  like his looks.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's...  Right.  He did make by the way a rebuttal video.  It's not as funny.  But it's a video to...  I don't know if this was after he got in trouble.  Probably not.  But I think he felt bad about the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Welcome to the Apple Store.  How may I help you today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Can you fix my phone?  I heard you have the genius geeks here.  Can they fix phones?  Yes.  Which iPhone do you have?  I have the HTC Evo.  Oh.  I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not an iPhone though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I read on the internet that it was just like the iPhone, but better.  I see.  Well, what is wrong with the phone?  It keeps saying my app has crashed and the battery only stays charged for one hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it could be caused by Google's programming.  How do I fix it?  You throw it away and then purchase an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But this has more MPs than the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's actually...  He's quite fair to both.  In two videos, he definitely gives you the pros and cons on both.  So I think the guy...  You're right.  At this point, it's all good for him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's just all pay him to keep making videos.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No kidding.  Yeah.  Subscribe.  Yeah.  I'm going to talk about a viral video that made the family $150,000 in merchandising and  more.  But before I do that, I want to make a little money myself and tell you a little bit about  audible.com.  We all know Audible is the bookstore online.  Jerry, you have some books on Audible as a matter of fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have lots of books on Audible and I can tell you that they are very fair to authors.  I have been getting quite reasonable royalty checks from Audible for some time now.  That's good to know.  I endorse Audible.  Buy my books on Audible.  They actually do a very good job.  Oh, I love them.  You got to do your commercial, but I can tell you, they get good readers.  The people who read them actually have read the book and understand something about them.  I've even gotten questions on pronunciation from some of the people.  When you invent aliens in alien languages, it is not always obvious how those words are  to be pronounced like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's Larry Niven, the protector book.  They did a great job with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No skits clickers out of Mote and God's Eye.  It was in fact Larry Niven's phrase, not mine, but it wasn't, but it's from Mote.  Audible just does a very good job of reading those books.  They've got most of the ones Niven and I have done and many of mine alone are on Audible  and they are very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As you can see, it's in my library, the Mote and God's Eye.  I listen to both Lucifer's Hammer and the Motes in God's Eye, one right after the other,  which is about 40 or 50 hours worth of entertainment.  You can get them both absolutely free and Jerry still gets his royalty.  All you got to do is go to audible.com slash twit2.  You sign up for the platinum account.  That's the one I have.  It's two books a month, which is my minimum.  I know people who have multiple platinum accounts, people with long commutes.  Two books a month is about right for me.  Those first two books are free.  You can cancel at any time and you get to keep the books forever.  But don't just stop with the Mote and God's Eye or Lucifer's Hammer.  There's also Star Swarm and Footfall and Oath of Fealty.  There's a great Jerry Pornell collection right there.  Inferno.  What's your favorite of these, Jerry?  Escape from Hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the collaborations are one.  They're the only one of those that's a single one so far, but they're coming out with more  from Audible later.  It starts from one, which is a juvenile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  That's right.  So, that's another thing that's great about Audible.  Kids love Audible.  It's a great way, believe it or not, to get them reading.  I have a friend whose daughter is a big Harry Potter fan.  She's only in second grade.  She's actually reading the books, which is pretty impressive.  This is a very smart kid, but she loves listening to them as well.  Audio books are a great way to introduce kids to chapter books a little ahead of time.  Get them reading ahead of level and kids just love them.  For long car trips, for dad and mom too in the car or at the gym.  I listen all the time at the gym.  Audible.com slash twit2.  Give it a try.  We're Audible fanatics here at the twit cottage and I know you will be too.  In fact, I hear from people all the time say, I stopped listening to your show.  I'm just listening to Audible now.  You're allowed.  It's okay.  I understand.  So, did you ever see the viral video David after dentist?  I'll play a little bit of it.  It's a pretty old viral video.  It's kind of a...  Yeah, I know.  His father videotapes his kid who's just had dental surgery and is still stoned out  of his gourd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's seven years old.  Let it go.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I didn't feel anything.  Yeah.  I feel funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, this video, believe it or not, they have made $150,000 off of it.  But they sell t-shirts.  Kind of an amazing story.  The guy shot it on a flip camera just intending to share it with friends.  Not put it publicly, but he didn't have a choice on YouTube.  It had to be public.  And now, I should check.  I didn't see what the numbers were, but millions of people have watched this video.  It just shows you it's possible to make money on YouTube videos.  Whoa, whoa, whoa.  Wow.  62 million views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good grief.  And so it's because there's also ads on that YouTube page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's ads on it.  And YouTube shares some of that revenue.  Kind of amazing that there's that much money in viral videos.  I don't know if there's anything more to say about that.  Rumor that Google is going to do a Google Me.  We talked about it last week.  Kevin Rose spread that rumor originally on Twitter.  He was asked by somebody.  We don't know who to take it down.  He did.  Didn't matter.  It was too late.  And now, the world seems to agree Google is going to do a Facebook clone called Google  Me.  Eric Schmidt was asked about it during a speech in London this week.  His denial is a non-denial denial.  He said, that would be a product announcement and I won't say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I love Jerry's Facebook page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's your Facebook page, Jerry?  I don't have a Facebook account, so I can't see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My daughter had it up and they maintained it.  And at some point, I suppose I should go look at it.  But in fact, I have never seen my Facebook page.  Isn't that awful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I probably it's hooked right into Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I suspect it does.  My daughter as a you know, was an Army intelligence officer and she's now in publication.  She's a she's got a PhD in anthropology.  She her thesis has changed a lot of what we knew about 5000 years ago.  So she's a pretty sharp girl and she pretty well runs that thing.  I haven't paid much attention to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boy, you look good on that page.  You do.  Look at that sharp tuxedo.  And Jerry, when you post on here, then it's it's it's your your words, but your daughter's  writing them because I see posts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That so she probably takes them out of my my books.  But we've never really even corresponded on it.  She just said she thought that somebody ought to have one.  So she's got it going and she's done a good job with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It could be worse. She could name it.  My dad says and just from the dinner table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Wouldn't that be wonderful?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And publish a publish a know this guy this talk about guys made money.  This was a Twitter account.  The guy is 29 years old, lives with a 74 year old dad who is a little outspoken, shall we say.  It is now a book.  It has been optioned for is it a TV show or a movie?  That Shatner is going to do a series.  William Shatner is going to be the dad.  See, Jerry, there is some value to Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're convincing me.  Maybe I should go get rich on Twitter by telling people when I'm going to have a peanut butter sandwich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't don't knock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't knock it. So this is I have a very brief Twitter story.  Yeah, last when the on this first blog post I put up last week was published.  I went on the Antenna's Twitter account and I tweeted just the fact that there's a new blog post, which I do every time I do a new blog post.  Right. Yep. And the next day, my unique visitor count, which is typically around 11 to 15 unique visitors.  And one of them is my mom went to eighty nine thousand unique visitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I'm one of them, by the way, first time I've been there.  And you know what, Spencer, I bookmarked it and I'm going to come in back there.  So this is good for you. OK, you got me convinced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you, Spencer. You're welcome.  I'm not sure I'm a wordy old codger.  I'm not sure I can think of anything worth saying in one hundred and twenty eight characters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what's so nice is by being limited to one hundred and forty, you sort of, you know, you're not being expected to write a book every time.  It's just, you know, how dry was the peanut butter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  All of those courses I took in formal English on poetry, on odes and sonnets and that sort of thing.  Maybe that will help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, Jerry, you should write all your tweets in the form of a of a sonnet.  It should all be an iambic pentameter. There you go.  What is that? I follow Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would follow the drum and makes a dreadful noise.  That's one to be or not to be.  That is the question.  But you'll notice that question ends with a soft sound and it has 11 beats in it.  And besides, I think that we've already been taking that too.  But it is an ambic pentameter as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think, Jerry, this is how you make it interesting for yourself.  You create this artificial structure.  You say, OK, I'll tweet, but it has to be iambic pentameter or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's a thought.  Or maybe all of it put together will become an ode.  You'd be right. Be right in a sonnet there.  An ode is not a sonnet.  I'm sorry. Shocking, shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I have to say, for me, it's great feedback, too.  I learn as much from the people who follow me as I think or more than they do for me.  So it does create some connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But that's just on the mail.  I mean, I don't need to tweet to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Something something about it. Give it a shot.  I'll bet you get hooked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, man. This just cracks me up because Steve was so resistant for this.  Steve echoed everything you've ever said, Jerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, for many years, I used to say that I wasn't the smartest guy in the world,  but I had such a long enough readership that there were very few questions  that I couldn't get an answer to because somebody reads me, knows the answer,  and is going to send it to them.  Well, that's still the case.  There is very little I can say on my in my day book.  I hate the word blog, but there's very little I can say in my day book  that doesn't get me some answers from people who really know the subject a lot better than I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's kind of actually be more true today, Jerry, than it used to be even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. And I think that's kind of what happens on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You may remember that in 1980, I said that by the year 2000,  everybody in Western civilization will be able to get the answer to any question that actually has an answer.  I said that in 1980 and everybody said I was crazy.  And of course, I had to say Western civilization because I certainly didn't believe the Soviet Union would be gone by 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now, in fact, I mean, Twitter is very much global.  In fact, the new Twitter statistics are that Asia tweets more than anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But China does censor the Internet and by you can't tweet from China.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I found that out when I was in China.  One last story and then we'll move on.  And I want to pose this question to you, Greyhairs, because I cannot.  I think this is unprecedented.  Microsoft announced a phone six weeks ago.  They called it the kin.  They released it and they have canceled it in six weeks.  And I cannot think of another time that Microsoft or anybody else could have killed a product this fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so impressed by the speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The fastest failure in I can think of six weeks from announcement to you can't buy it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It took them longer to kill their stupid soundboard than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right. That was an early Microsoft flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On that in that phone, in fact, the antenna was your ear.  You had to hook a wire to your ear.  What?  No, it's true.  And if you hook one wire to each ear, it actually was a smart.  He's teasing us. He's teasing us now.  I can tell he's teasing us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That couldn't be. It is a funny looking phone.  It's a little tiny little pebble of a phone.  I don't know where you would put the antenna in this thing because there's nowhere you cannot hold it.  I mean, you have to hold it in your hand.  That is tiny.  If this phone doesn't have an antenna problem, then Apple's got a PR problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the evidence is that it disappeared in six weeks.  Isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can buy it. This is the Amazon page for the Kin One.  The list price $349. The sale price one penny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this shows how clueless Microsoft is.  What went wrong?  That they could think that they're well, they were just envious of everybody else doing it right.  And they said, well, we're Microsoft.  So we're just going to do one, too.  And, you know, I mean, you know, Jerry knows that Microsoft doesn't doesn't create things for a market.  They just force what they have to fit into where the market is gone.  It's like they didn't have an Internet network capable OS.  So they just stuck it on the Internet, you know, stuck windows on the Internet.  And then we had years of security problems when when when phones started getting smart.  They didn't have a smartphone OS.  So they just tried to sort of squeeze windows down.  And we know how well that worked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I am not as anti and Microsoft as you seem to be, as you historically have been.  But I am hardly one of their.  Toadies either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you do? What do you do if you're Microsoft now where you're struggling, you're just struggling to keep up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think they have.  I think that Bill Gates always ran scared, you know.  I mean, I knew Bill back when he was actually running the company.  I used to could win bets from people by saying I could get Bill Gates on the telephone.  And the way you do it is you just dial the Microsoft switchboard number at night.  He'd be the only one there.  Those days answer the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those days are long gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But he ran scared and he paid attention.  There isn't anybody doing that now.  Right.  And so they're having that his company was number one for as long as he could keep it there.  And he had some fiefdoms at work.  The the the office fiefdom was run very well by.  Oh, come on, we both know his name.  He bought a bowling alley after he retired.  Anyway, they.  But but it isn't the same Microsoft anymore, and it's trying to be run by.  Different crews and they don't have the same.  They're not scared and they're not as hungry.  I don't know that they can survive this this the new wave.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it might be time for them to be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The interesting thing and Paul Theroux, if you were here, would point this out,  he's their Windows Weekly host and a really, really great guy.  Microsoft's revenue is still huge.  You know, you talk about the market cap that Apple beat Microsoft's market cap.  But there's no question that Microsoft's is still extraordinarily profitable.  A massive company.  I guess the question is, is the trend in Microsoft's favor or not?  In other words, is Microsoft I mean, clearly Microsoft is still doing very, very well.  A ton of inertia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I would have to agree that the trend is not in their favor.  When you when you look at open source in the long term,  you look at all of this next generation portability.  I mean, you know, Jerry is jumping up and down and carrying an iPad around as am I.  I mean, we're traditionally Windows people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Microsoft said this week that a billion people use Microsoft Office.  One billion people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. And Office is pretty good for all the people who say they don't like it.  The fact is that most of the books written in this world are written on Microsoft Word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except Jerry, I remember very well that you were the guy who wanted a clean screen.  You didn't want Microsoft Word to write.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't want Microsoft Word for a very long time.  And Bill, was it Peter's?  They took DOS away from us.  The product manager came down here and said, what would it get to cause you to use it?  So I told him three things to put into it and by God, they did.  And at that point, I was doomed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You had to use it. They'd done it for you.  It was the pornell feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Notice that that with Office 2009 with Word, the word, you can do that control F1 feature.  And most of that gobbled that ribbon goes away and you've got what amounts to the old clean screen again.  So you use you use Word to write.  I use Word to write, but I use it with using that control F1.  Right. To clean it up.  To clean it up. So there's nothing up there except what I do.  Oh, yeah, I like type ahead, Leo.  I like automatic word correction.  I'm a sloppy typist.  I type T-E-H quite a lot.  Right. And I don't like to have to go back and correct it.  I like it that it automatically corrects that.  Also, I like being able to have special dictionaries because I have a lot of character names I don't want in the normal dictionary.  I want one in the specific to the work I'm working on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I guess it's not over for Microsoft, but it's certainly no longer a Microsoft era.  And that's true.  The kin is a surprising, surprising stumble for a company that's done really so well.  But wasn't it inevitable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The problem is that the hardware that is available to everybody is so much better than software that nobody really can keep.  But there is enormous room for improvement in everything that's available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me say this again, because I think it's really important what you just said.  The hardware available to us today is better than the software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By a lot.  Why is that?  Because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't hardware hard?  Isn't hardware harder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Of course, law doesn't scale for software.  They take smart people and we don't have any way of doing that.  And until we get the singularity where you have computers designing themselves, if that ever happens, you know, AI and you get assisted evolution rather than Mendelian evolution and so forth, Lamarckian evolution, then maybe software will begin to catch up.  But the hardware is going to get better again.  And the other thing is that...  The hardware has to be correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And software, sadly, doesn't have to be correct.  It can be sort of approximate and the system appears to work.  But if the hardware is not correct, it doesn't go at all.  It's built Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Everybody, you know, the OS 2 Windows war was very instructive.  IBM was a company that prided itself on doing it right.  And they weren't going to put things out there until it was really done well.  Meanwhile, Gates would ship it tomorrow because it doesn't matter how bad it works on the equipment people have now.  The next generation of equipment, it's going to work very well.  And he was out. He bet.  Essentially, he bet everything he had on Moore's Law and he won.  But that was Gates and he was willing to take chances like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Microsoft needs an injection of new blood.  Young engineers who are given the freedom and the cash to go out and design something that will have to be better than what Apple can offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sure. And they wanted them for a very long time. But the trouble is Google got them all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google got all the brains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things that impresses me about Apple, which also upsets people about Apple, is that Apple is willing to obsolete their stuff very quickly.  I mean, it upsets people when a new version of the phone comes out after, you know, two days before they bought the prior version.  And one thing that happens when companies get big like Microsoft is they have so much investment in in their own existing product line that they cannot obsolete it.  They have to simply creep it forward very slowly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gates wouldn't have put it that way. He felt and I know this.  I mean, he's told me himself he felt an obligation to people who had bought previous generations of the stuff that they wouldn't just be suddenly left in the lurch.  And his his choice was to was to make a lot of concessions to legacy.  Apple doesn't have to do that and didn't.  For there, as a result was until not very long ago, Apple had what, two percent market share?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. In fact, Jerry, I'm sitting here looking at I'm not typing into it right now, but I'm still in a DOS based text editor for writing my code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what's interesting is that both of you are using iPads and iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, not iPhone for you, Steve, but I'm on here on a Mac MacBook Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So what does that tell us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Tells us I like them both. It tells us that the operating system is becoming irrelevant.  It people know user gives a damn what operating system is using.  What he wants is the dang machine to do what he wants it to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. What about Google's Chromium OS?  Google's moving towards an OS that's in the cloud.  Do you think that's reasonable?  That that kind of is the ultimate response to that.  It wouldn't be for me because you don't want to live in the cloud.  Twitter, Jerry, Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't I don't want copies of my novel out there where somebody else can get at them if they know how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's interesting. You're afraid of the security issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not just security.  I'd say it's privacy.  And also I've had enough interruptions in my high speed service,  especially since I'm dependent on AT&T for some of it that I want to make  dang sure that anything I do can be done with stuff I have here.  And why in the world should I have sitting here?  I'm talking to you on the equivalent of what would have been considered a supercomputer in 1990.  Why in the world should I want to go out to do the way I used a supercomputer back in 1990?  In 1990, I used to have to go to the University of Illinois to get the solution to some tensor,  which I don't do anymore, but I did in those days.  I can do all of that stuff on my machine here.  Why would I want to go back to having to use the web to do things?  Which I thought was wonderful that I finally got a machine that would do it here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what about the notion that you've got a bunch of devices  and having them all say the same thing is valuable.  So it makes sense if Jerry, you got one computer, a desktop computer,  but now I got an iPhone, iPad, laptop, desktop.  Shouldn't they all have access to the same data, the same information, the same?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't yours? Mine do.  Well, that's thanks to the cloud, right?  No, I network right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you do your own network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a perfectly good network here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's because you don't get out of the house much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of my machines is available to every other of my machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happens when you hit the road?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When I hit the road?  I carry terabytes of information with me when I hit the road.  Don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  No.  I have it all in the cloud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's clear that the future is for us to carry viewers  and that we'll be connected, amazingly enough.  I mean, the fact that this is really happening as an old gray hair just amazes me.  It does surprise me because I had the same objection Jerry had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's what I described in Moten God's Eye, you know.  Yes.  The machine that they were carrying, the pocket computer they were carrying,  really had very little internal storage.  Right.  It connected to what we would call a desktop now in the room they were in  and that connected to the ship's main library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But here's the good news.  You don't have to make the choice.  You can do both.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you get what you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, to that extent I do, but I don't really want my...  Well, okay.  There was a proposal in the Congress last week that the president should have a big red button  that allows him to shut down the internet whenever he thinks that there's a national security reason to do so.  Do you remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Uh-oh.  Yes.  Steve and I talked about this, the so-called kill switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The big kill switch for the president.  Now, when that happens, Leo, where are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now, Steve, you didn't think it really was a kill switch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'll never know where Leo is because he won't be able to tweet his location.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll have no idea where I am, exactly.  Chaos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll be right here in chaos manner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have no physical locus, Jerry.  I am everywhere.  Unfortunately...  Virtually.  There are limits and we've run against the limit called time.  I wish I had a day for this show, but Jerry, we'll just have to get you and Steve back.  And Spencer, you too.  This has been a lot of fun.  You guys are...  Sometimes the gray hairs have some perspective that the young guys don't have and that's, I think, often much more interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The young guys think things were always connected.  And we remember when things...  I mean, when the idea of connecting things was like, wait a minute, how can we have all these computers network together?  You can't do that.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry Bornell is the author of so many great books, The Moten God's Eye, Dante's Inferno...  I mean, sorry, Lucifer's Hammer.  I always want to call it Dante's Inferno for some reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Inferno is the name of the book that Niven and I wrote and Escape from Hell is its sequel.  And they are essentially Dante's Geography and Vatican II theology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry, let's pick a Twitter handle and create a Twitter account for you before we get off the air.  What do you want to call yourself on Twitter?  Big red button.  Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What do I want to call myself on Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess probably the best would be...  Steve learned this.  The best is something short, but your name is always good, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Chaos Manor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Chaos Manor.  Now, there's a good...  Beautiful.  There's a good handle.  Let's cross our fingers.  Well, I'm not going to sign up for you, Jerry.  I want you to sign up for yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll have to figure out how, but I can do that.  I'm sure you can figure that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twitter.com.  And JerryPornel.com is the place to go to read Jerry's postings, his musings.  Do donate.  Take $2 from Leo and give it to Jerry instead.  He's certainly earned it.  We all are here because of Jerry Pornel.  Jerry, it's great to have you here.  Thank you.  Steve Gibson is the man at GRC.com.  That's where you can get Spin Right and all his other wonderful free security programs.  And of course, let's not forget Security Now, the greatest podcast on security.  GRC.com slash security now for that.  Jerry and I'm sorry, Steve, thank you for being here.  We'll see you on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a pleasure and Jerry, great to be with you on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh man, it's so fun.  And Spencer, you've been great to sit here while these old cats have been talking.  Oh, I've been enjoying it every minute.  Spencer Webb is the man in charge at antenna assist dot com.  He is not looking for a job, Apple, but you know where to find him.  Attenasys.com.  Thank you for joining us and giving us a straight story on the antenna situation with the iPhone.  Thank you.  Happy to help.  Thank you all for being here.  We do this show normally and we're a little off today.  We do this show normally on Sundays at 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2200 UTC.  We switched it over to Saturday because of the holiday.  I hope you have a wonderful Independence Day, 4th of July.  Anything patriotic you'd like to say, Jerry, before we sign off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, God bless the legions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And with that, another twit is in the can.  Take care.  Thanks, Leo.  Thanks, everybody.  Thank you.  What a great show.  Do it.
