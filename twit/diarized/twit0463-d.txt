You know, this was a very hard  panel to put together because as  it turns out, apparently the  World Cup is going on right now.  It's kind of a big deal. And the  United States is playing Portugal  as we speak. But we'll give you  play-by-play every once in a while.  And if I leap up and say goal and  yell goal, that's why I'm horse.  I've been practicing all day. I  thought you were playing your  vuvuzela. Bring me the vuvuzela.

Transcript:  good to have him back. Jerry  Pornell, longtime columnist at  Byte Magazine, Chaos Manor. He  still writes on the web, Jerry  Pornell dot com. And of course,  you might be familiar with a few  science fiction novels he's  written over the years. It's  great to have you, Jerry. Thanks  for joining us. Thank you. Just  back from Hilton Head Island  where I guess you were at a  nanotech conference. The 30th

Start time: 226.14
End time: 254.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anniversary of the U.S.  conference. I think the formal  name of it is sensors, activators  and probes or something of the  sort. I'm going to the probe  conference. It started before  nanotech was a word one used and  most of what they were working  in in those days was microns,  which as far as I'm concerned,  a micron is pretty damn small to  begin with. This is the, I'm

Start time: 254.10
End time: 259.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  going to read the official title,  the Solid State Sensors Actuated  and Microsystems Workshop. Yes.

Start time: 260.80
End time: 290.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that was the 30th  anniversary of it. And this one  in 1994, the conference theme  was what will happen when  sensors and microsystem actuators  and sensors take over the world.  And in 2014, it was, well, we've  kind of taken over the world.  Where do we go from here? Which  is where they invited us on the  science fiction writer, namely  me. Oh, how cool. So I'm familiar

Start time: 291.22
End time: 297.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with MEMS, microelectric  mechanical systems, and these  are not quite nanotech. These are  kind of microtech. Some of it is

Start time: 299.10
End time: 314.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  nanotech. Some of it is not.  Some of the people, the probe  people and some of the others are  actually down in nanometers. Most  of it is in microns, which is  still pretty small. Yeah, not a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a millionth of a meter and  the nanotech is a billionth. And  to get some picture of it, a  tenth of a nanometer is an  angstrom unit. So. Now, I think

Start time: 329.62
End time: 331.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it was a Dvorak. Ten angstroms is

Start time: 332.12

Start time: 352.10
End time: 374.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they are doing them and  they're very small and it's  amazing what, I mean, they were  showing stuff that you wouldn't  believe could be done, only  they're doing it with little  bitty stuff that turns out to be  not very hard to fabricate. So  do you want your TV screen  lithographed on your arm? I guess

Start time: 375.12
End time: 378.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 412.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you? A lot of stuff, but most,  but understand this is practical  stuff. This is stuff that's  working. They're making products  out of it. They're selling them  as opposed to the things that  you, if you go to one of  Kurzweil's conferences, it's all  going to be things that are  happening 20 years from now. A  lot of blue sky. Maybe. Yeah. And  maybe they won't. Yeah. That's

Start time: 413.20
End time: 425.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  always bothered me when you have  these conversations about nanotech.  There seems to be a lot of sci-fi  with all due regard to you, Jerry.  A lot of stuff like in the future  we'll be able, there'll be gray  goo and things. That is the

Start time: 426.48
End time: 479.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  attitude of this conference  towards that picture. It reminds  me of the gray goo conference.  The gray goo conference, no. I'm  not going to that. But the last  30 years, commercial fusion  power was going to be online in  30 years. And every year, well,  not that late year, but 30 years  from now. Next year. And it's  still 30 years from now, as best  I can say. This is stuff you can  buy today. There is a kid there  who's got a gizmo that you attach  to your computer with a serial  cable. It's got a stage on it.  You can then do electron  microscopy. And they'll sell it  for under, they're hoping to sell  it for under $100. Wow. So my,  you know, our eighth grade class

Start time: 481.79
End time: 484.09

Start time: 486.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to your telephone. And it's got a  little spring and a needle in it.  You put your finger in the cup and  you twist it and it stabs you and  draws a drop of blood. I have a  question. What's a telephone? It

Start time: 504.38
End time: 505.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  does, well, the phone is good

Start time: 507.00
End time: 523.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  enough to do a complete blood  show. It's a little bit of a  sugar analysis for diabetics. That's  cool. But it does more than that.  It looks at ketones. It looks at  various other things. And if it

Start time: 525.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 528.00
End time: 535.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  your doctor. So you have a, that's  interesting. That's an app that you  can buy for under $100 or at least

Start time: 537.02
End time: 589.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they hope to be able to sell that  shortly for under $100. And as  a matter of fact, I don't think  that's the right quarter. Obviously  they used the inspiration from  Star Trek to create a device that  they were doing a Kickstarter for.  They said we've developed  technology that will allow you to  hold it next to the skin and you  can find everything from blood  sugar to oxygen saturation. And  that's a great thing.  So I think that's the  great thing about technology.  Although it's very cool, I don't  think we're anywhere near yet. The  ability to wave a wand over someone's  skin and be able to tell all that

Start time: 597.10
End time: 681.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  very precise. By shining infrared  light but by ultrasound you can do a  lot of things.  So I think that's the great  thing about technology.  We're going to see Google I.O.  We're going to see Google Android  Wear. There's rumors that LG and  others will show Google watches,  Google Android Wear based watches  that will have some health aspect.  But I'm actually really glad Jerry's  here because I have a question. You  know, Jerry, I'm wondering if you  could tell me how well I find the  world's first battery free item  locating tag. They were looking for  $25,000. They still have a week to  go. They've raised half a million  dollars. And I think there's  significant question of whether this  is in fact a scam. Kickstarter is  not responding to a lot of people if  you're not a Kickstarter fan.  And I think that's the way that  they're doing it.  I think that's the way that they're  doing it.  But Jerry's me. They say it  recycles electromagnetic energy and  stores it in a unique power bank so  you don't have to have batteries for

Start time: 682.00
End time: 705.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this Bluetooth design. Now I've heard  of RFID.  RFID kind of does that.  Bluetooth is a radio transmitter.  You don't have to have a battery if  you were coming around with some kind  of gizmo that powers it. But I  you understand a  gadget that does recording of what's  going on without having to have a

Start time: 708.00
End time: 709.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  battery in it is every spook's dream.

Start time: 711.04
End time: 736.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a perpetual motion machine.  I mean, every intelligence officer in  the world wants one of those and would  have to have a battery in it.  The batteries run out. You bug the  guy's office. That's fine. But unless  you can connect it to his telephone,  you have no power source and the  batteries run out after a while, which  is, by the way, why there is no

Start time: 746.12
End time: 760.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there.  It just doesn't seem, if it is really  if it's really Bluetooth, it's got to  have a battery. If it's RFID, I  understand it doesn't have to have a  battery, but it wouldn't be much use

Start time: 762.00
End time: 763.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because you'd have to track something.

Start time: 764.02
End time: 808.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You'd have to be standing on top of it.  Well, they claim a 60 meter range.  So that even puts it beyond the range  of Bluetooth. I think this is higher  than the  Kickstarter.  The Kickstarter approved it, I  presume, although I gathered it, not  quite as careful now.  Kickstarter did remember, say, you  have to have a physical prototype.  There's no prototype.  If you read in the risks and  challenges page, it says the main  risks are reliance on outside  sources within the supply chain.  The contractor has to order  the product.  If these vendors slip, the  complete production is at risk.  It seems like there's more risks

Start time: 809.08
End time: 829.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  than that.  It's a physical impossibility.  I could build you a gizmo that  used, I think it would be  illegal to do it, but use  Bluetooth frequencies that worked  out to 50 or 60, that were  powerful enough to activate an  RFID Bluetooth receiver at 60  meters.  I could do that.

Transcript:  They would collect power from  the...  That was Tesla's dream.  You were going to be able to do  it, but the problem is the  inverse square lock kind of  makes it impossible to do it.

Start time: 859.44
End time: 864.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a huge amount of power.  The farther away you get, the  amount of power you get

Start time: 865.08
End time: 906.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  decreases by the inverse of the  cube.  It's a huge...  I think this is possible.  If we give these guys the  benefit of the doubt, and they  say they have patent pending  technology, we give them the  benefit of the doubt and  assume this actually does work.  We assume that it does work.  We assume that it's untested.  Nobody else that we know of is  using this kind of thing or has  successfully productized this  kind of thing.  Even if it does work, if we  assume that it does work, I think  we have to also assume that this  is something that's going to  have some hiccups and that is

Start time: 907.10
End time: 928.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  going to be untested.  You are way too kind, Jason.  When they say patent pending,  I'm going to go down that way.  I'll file it.  They say it uses our  patent pending  EM harvesting technology.  I can't wait to see that.  That's going to change the world.

Start time: 929.22
End time: 942.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sure sounds...  That's Tesla's dream.  There have been a lot of people  trying to do what Tesla claimed  he knew how to do but never did.  So who knows?  I don't think so.

Transcript:  I should really pursue this more.  Pando Daily has been spending a  lot of time on this.  My point is you have seven days  to take it back.  In seven days they are going to  cash the check.  Kickstarter will get funded and  that money will be withdrawn.  At that point you have new recourse  even if you never see anything.  Although Kickstarter has some

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  dollars.  The problem is if you've got a  gadget that will do that, I can  think of so many things that are  more interesting to do.  You could power my car.  That may just be from my whole  background but I can think of  lots of things I would love to be  able to do with a gadget that can

Start time: 999.18

You could get it down into  technically maybe five,  one milliamp somewhere in that  vicinity but you're still going  to need a lot of power.  You're going to need a lot of  energy straight at this device in  order to give it enough juice to

Transcript:  We'll try to get a hold of them.  We're going to take a break.  When we come back, Amazon had a  big party in which they  announced a new phone.  Interesting because we heard a  lot about it.  One of the rumors that only  to be semi true was the notion  this was a 3D phone.  Not exactly.  It's dynamic perspective.  We'll talk about that more.  Jerry Pornell is here from  JerryPornell.com.  My hero.  My inspiration.  Also with us Jason Heiner from  tech republic, also my hero.  And Padre.  You're the wind beneath my  something.  My cushion.  But first, a word from Citrix and  the folks who do go to  meeting.  If you are in business, you know  that getting people together to  hash out differences, to  brainstorm, to plan is so  important.  But nowadays with businesses  spread out all over the world,  it's hard to get people together  and have a conversation.  It's not easy.  We're in Louisville.  How are we going to make that  work?  Go to meeting.  It's the most efficient way to  meet with clients and customers  right from your computer or  smartphone or tablet.  You pay once a month a flat rate.  You don't have to count the  minutes of the meetings.  You can have it all day if your  phone is on.  Go to meeting lets you share  screens so you can review  documents.  I've used it to rehearse  presentations in real time.  You can use the built-in HD  video conferencing.  As we're looking at those  screens, cut out the wasted time  and expensive travel without  losing the personal touch of  meeting in person.  You can do it right now with go  to meeting.  Go to meeting.  Go to meeting.  Go to meeting.  Go to meeting.  Go to meeting.  Go to meeting.  We thank the folks at Citrix  who have been such great  supporters of the network  practically since day one.  We knew when we went to the  Amazon or watched the Amazon  event, they didn't stream it,  but we had Larry Dingen there.  Larry.  It was a small group about the  auditorium in the Fremont  Theater in Seattle.  I've seen differing reports, but  it's hundreds of people, not  thousands.  Amazon said several hundred  people were there from the  public.  You remember on the front page  at Amazon.com, they said would  you like to come to the event,  and they did.  We had a couple of people who  applied got invitations.  There were about 200 press  there.  Jeff Bezos did the whole thing,  90 minutes on stage showing off  Amazon's first phone, the fire  phone, a phone that Bezos said  later they had been working on  for four years.  That explains the rumors we've  been hearing for four years that  Amazon would do a phone.  It's not cheap.  It's not cost.  None of that happened.  It's not in fact cheaper than  any other phone.  It is not carrier free.  It requires AT&T in the U.S.  $200 with a two-year contract.  $650 unsubsidized for the  32-gig version, $750 for the  64-gig version.  If you look at it, it seems like  a fairly typical high-end  smartphone.  There are a lot of people who  don't use Android that Amazon  calls fire OS 3.5.  That was one thing.  One of my takeaways is there is  now a fourth mobile OS, along  with Android and iOS and  Microsoft's Windows phone.  It could be fifth if you include  Blackberry.  This fork of Android is really  a new mobile OS.  I think that this is  differentiated enough.  I think that the apps come from  Nokia's here division.  They're here maps.  The store is Amazon's own store.  Quarter of a million apps in  that store.  Unfortunately, most designed for  the Amazon tablets.  I don't know how many will work  well on the phone.  Without Google services, it's  not an Android phone.

Start time: 1329.58
End time: 1384.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Jason, is fire OS really a fully  qualified operating system in its  own right?  I think it's a fully qualified  operating system.  It's a new phone thing and not  an Android fork now.  I guess the thing that, the only  thing that this phone really  innovates is a shopper's phone.  Right?  And they do some innovative  things with firefly.  Exactly.  That's the crux of the story.  I think for me is they're  innovating with shopping.  I think that's a feature that  somebody is going to buy on or  somebody is going to switch on.  I think the 3D interface stuff  is pretty gimmicky and I don't  think it is potentially going to  be even sort of confusing and  not necessarily fantastic user  experience.  Did Larry get to play with it  at all?  Yeah.

Start time: 1386.44

Start time: 1410.50
End time: 1430.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that's going to cause people to  switch.  If you're a phone guy, if you're  a geek, if you're looking for  something that's not a phone,  you're not going to be able to  play with it.  You're going to have to get  someone to play with it.  It's hard because they're a

Start time: 1430.54

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  couple of years late and  everybody's invested in Android  or iOS.  It feels like Amazon has paved  the way better.  Is it enough?  It is in this sense.  Bezo specifically said in his  book that it's not enough.  We want the person who buys so  much from Amazon, media,  products, movies, entertainment,  everything, that it makes sense  for them to have Amazon in their  pocket.  It's what they've been doing  with their tablets.  You look at their tablets and  they're decent devices, nice  screens, decent specs, but  people have always said why  would I buy that when I could  buy it?  People will say is that enough?  Bezo would say yes, there is.  There's enough people who just  like Amazon that they'll buy  this phone.  Amazon can take a loss on every

What they could have done and  probably should have done was they  should have basically sold a phone  whatever, less  hardware, quit messing with the  3D goofy thing  and sold a phone  for $350 off contract  or $50 on contract, whatever.  It's Prime with it.  And then they give you this very simple value proposition.  When you get our phone, you get Prime with it.  Not only do you get these benefits of  free shipping on your Amazon stuff  but you get free music streaming.  You get free videos.

What if they seeded the market with a million of these  phones to their best Prime users?  People start seeing, oh wow, they can  get their stuff much better.  They go to a retail store and they whip out their phone  and it tells them the price of everything and they just  hit buy.  They could still, if the sales aren't high enough,  use that model.  That's actually what I like about this.  Do you think they might turn that on?  They could. Because it's their platform, they have the option.

The other thing with that, kind of what you're  getting at Robert, I think this is what they should have  led with and not what they have led with  instead in their  announcement is something stronger like this.  But they also have the advantage of all  these eyeballs that come to Amazon.com  every day and they can promote this phone  to them and we also shouldn't  underestimate that because the value  of that is something  that Apple has to pay a lot of money for.  It's something that Google  has to pay a lot of money for.  Obviously Google can do it a little bit but  slapping a Nexus  text ad on Google  pages is one thing. Being able  to put a flashy  our phone for this much  if they discount it or start giving them away  or whatever on an Amazon page  or on an Amazon checkout  is something that is super valuable.

Transcript:  I hear that argument a lot but I don't  think it's pushed the Fire TV to  the top of the heap or the Kindle  Fire HDX to the top of the heap.  I think they're probably selling OK.  We don't know because Amazon doesn't break those sales  figures out. There's an interesting  irony with the Fire phone  that Prime users  I guess it's best target  are among the most  sophisticated internet users I would think  and yet one of the features on this  phone that I think makes it very appealing to first  time smartphone buyers is the Mayday button.  I think if  my mom or somebody who's never owned a smartphone  came to me and said which smartphone should I get  if they shop on Amazon  and I would say get the Amazon phone  because of the Mayday button.  That's a different audience.

Start time: 1821.44
End time: 1866.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So if they had that audience  again if they went with sort of a lower priced  phone and were targeting more of these entry level  users they can basically convert  people to Amazon  Prime users.  Say at some point they get rid of their Amazon  phone they don't have it anymore and all of a sudden they don't have  free shipping anymore. Well all of a sudden they're kind of  addicted to it right. They're like this is a great  service I don't have free movies I don't have  free shipping on my  Amazon stuff and now they're hooked in  I think they should have used it that way  because I think they're going to have a much harder time  converting  technophiles and  phone lovers and people who are already using Prime  to buy this device  and to go over to their ecosystem  rather than  when you can do all this stuff on your  iPhone or your Android phone already.

Transcript:  Amazon has an SDK so if you're Best Buy  and you're worried that people are going to use, by the way this is kind of cool  because there's a dedicated Firefly button  on the phone. Firefly launches within  one second and you can take a picture of  anything and then as the phone  ships it'll show you how to buy it on Amazon  but there's nothing to stop Best Buy from  creating an app that says press  the Firefly button and here's how much it is on  Best Buy. Why not?  Maybe they did that on purpose so that  Best Buy can't sue them for, I mean because it really is  the ideal showrooming thing.  I like this Mayday button. Let me read you some stats.  This comes from Amazon's  financial filing.  I think they're 10k that they filed recently.  The average  response time on the Mayday button  9.75 seconds.  He promised under 15.  He means it. That's fast.  They must have a huge  customer service team to do this.  Think of the cost of that.  75% of the questions from Kindle  Fire customers come in through  Mayday. That's the first device that Mayday supported.  Questions from all around  the world including Australia, Bolivia, Egypt,  Kenya, Santa Lucia, and Venezuela.  But what's  really interesting is what they support.  So these are some of the things  Bezos shared in the press  release about how customers have been using Mayday  over the first eight months. This is before  the Fire Phone.  After being stuck on a specific Angry Birds  level for a week,  somebody pressed the Mayday button  and a tech advisor helped the customer beat the level.  A group of friends  were trying to figure out how to make  a perfect peanut butter and jelly sandwich.  They asked the Mayday advisor  to judge  which approach was the best.  I don't know what the choices were.  Peanut butter first or jelly first?  Peanut butter on the outside?  Not a non-starter.  Tech advisor sang happy birthday to somebody  as they were receiving a Fire  HDX from their boyfriend.  He pressed the button and said,  okay, I'm going to give it to her right now.  Sing happy birthday. And he did. They did.  Customers have asked tech  advisors to draw  things. Because you know they have the  ability to then manipulate the screen  including  happy faces, rainbows,  unicorns, fire breathing dragons,  and aliens.  They have received  I think 35 marriage proposals.  A lot of people ask  for the woman who was in the  ad who was not in fact  a Mayday advisor.

People noticed that  some major Hachette books were  no longer, you either couldn't  order them on Amazon or there was a  three to four week wait even though these books,  according to Hachette, had been supplied to  Amazon. It was pretty clear Amazon had  decided to do a kind of a slow

But  I have a different view  of what's going on with Amazon  than some of the other. I  wish Amazon had competition.  Don't misunderstand me.  And they do. Here's the good news. They do.

And everything I have seen  so far up to now bears  out what he says. And you do understand  every now and then he gets a group  of science fiction writers together and  flies them up to Seattle so he can have dinner  with them. Oh, that's neat. So he's  kind of sympathetic to the  work I do. So I  start off with a prejudice in  his favor. I haven't seen too many  people at Fleshette do that.

Start time: 2375.16
End time: 2398.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm going to give the  counterpoint to that since I'm still  talking this story. You know, Mike Elgin  published this actually great piece on  Computerworld today  where he called the Fire  Phone the most effective device  ever sold for harvesting the personal data  from its owner. So this is another  one of the things. And  Mike, who obviously you guys all  know well, he's our news

Start time: 2399.14
End time: 2403.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 2403.26
End time: 2472.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Phone. He did. He did.  And so so just  to just to bring some balance here,  you know, Mike's point is that  every time you  do Firefly, you know, every time you  use Firefly is uploading  you know, images, audio  and GPS coordinates  every time and that  Amazon is storing that data. And that also  because they're looking at through this 3D  feature, they're looking at your face, you  know, all the time to  judge, you know, if you're looking at  your facial angles and things like this,  they're going to be able to do this amazing  thing that we just talked about and that  the facial recognition potentially  because of all the data they're collecting on  that could be better  than, you know, anybody  has done before because of that  database of sort of facial  images if they were in fact, you know,  storing those and connecting them to a  profile on you. So  on all Mike's just making a pretty  strong argument. Then he's bringing in sort of the cloud  storage and Silk browser and other things  and he's saying that this thing is going to have  so much data on you, you know,  Google and Facebook will be jealous,  you know, in terms of what they're going to have  because of some of these features.

But we have such a freak out as  a collective society anytime we think  our privacy is being invaded,  which is interesting because with  all of this information being collected by  not just this device,  but Amazon's entire existence,  why there hasn't been a complete  freak out over what  Amazon does with big data.  Jason, let me add... Well, that's partly because

Start time: 2511.14
End time: 2528.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is inevitable. Mike's point, though,  is that this phone is even  better than any other Android phone for  doing this because of Firefly and because  it has four cameras on the front face. So  it's seeing you, it's seeing where you are,  in other words, it's an even better  data collector. But they're not doing anything  different than Google's.

Start time: 2529.56
End time: 2558.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But Google has been,  to Google's credit, they have been getting  more and more transparent about what  they're doing. And that's Mike's complaint.  And Mike's point, and I think he's right on,  is that Amazon is not...  They need to be far more  transparent and detailed about what  they are collecting, what they are saving,  and what their practices are on anonymizing  the things or allowing you to opt out  and those kind of things, which  they currently do not. And if they're going to do  these kind of things, they have to do it, and  we should hold their feet to the fire. But do they?

Start time: 2559.22
End time: 2593.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because Google sells you.  You're Google's product.  You're the thing, the data  point that they are offering to their  advertisers. For Amazon,  they're really honest. Even if we don't know exactly  what they're doing with it, we know  the purpose, the entire purpose of Amazon's  existence of all their data collection is to sell you  stuff. That's it. And they're very  open about that. They're not pretending  like they're not selling you that book  or that gizmo. So maybe  that's why we cut them more slack. Because even  if we don't know the minutiae  of what they're doing with that information,  we know the final  product.

Transcript:  I think as Internet citizens, though, our expectation  is becoming and should  be that  if you are using my data, if you  are taking data on me, that you should  be transparent about that. You should let me  know that, especially on the scale  of what places like Google and Facebook  and Amazon and Apple  are doing.  So I think that is  a fair point. It's not something  that's out there. It's not something that should be mandated  by law, but I think it should be  an expectation. And I think it's  something that as journalists, it's something that we  can do to sort of hold people's feet to the fire  on it.

He said, see, we've never had to think about  Amazon in that regard, but all of a sudden  with his phone we do. And he says  this is quoting Mike's article,  one can imagine three years hence  when users are more jaded and worn down  by massive and constant privacy  invasions that Amazon might  choose to turn on some killer  future face recognition  algorithm using those pictures  that they've been uploading. Remember, they're giving you  free, unlimited storage  for all of your photos  in order to compete more effectively against other  data harvesting companies.  If Amazon, and this is what he asks,  he says, he wants, he says, if Amazon  doesn't promise to never do this, then  they're just leaving that option open. And  potential buyers, and I think this is fair,  should be aware of this. You may make the  choice, you may do the deal with the devil,  if you'll forgive me, Father, but  you should understand that Amazon has  this potential, and if  they don't promise never to do it, then they,  we want to assume they might.

And they say, if you  don't like it, exit the browser and do not install,  use, or access  Amazon Silk. In other words, we're going to keep track  of everything you do, and that's the way it is.

Transcript:  It's a different society. Twenty years ago,  if someone had had a case  where they said, look, I have a right to have  all these companies erase their data  about me. We'd probably say, oh yeah,  yeah, that makes sense. You know, if it's your personal  data, they have no right to it. We just  had that right to be forgotten case, and  people are looking at it going, you  don't have that right.  If you're on the internet, you're in a public space,  you don't have the right to tell companies to get  rid of the data that you left behind.  And it just shows you, we  will accept this. As  long as you give me something, something  shiny, Gmail, a better shopping experience,  I will take invasion of privacy as long as I don't  think it's too invasive.  And that  two part shifts.

But I do have  to point out that one of the, in the  Facebook world, the post-Facebook world,  you know, notice we have a  president who admitted to inhaling.  That the standards are changing. You're not  going to be able to elect a president who hasn't smoked  pot or hasn't served porn.  You're not going to be able to hire an employee  who hasn't got pictures of him drinking  heavily on Facebook. Because  these, everybody, what would become  apparent is everybody, except  with the exception of Father Robert  Bowser. Everybody does this.  And so, is that  a bad thing? Maybe,  you know, Javorak always brings up the,  I think it's the  boogie man of insurance companies  finding out I'm eating too many donuts and refusing  to insure me.

Transcript:  Great quote in our chat room from  Bruce Schneier, Web 7  says, Bruce Schneier in 2006  wrote, quote, patterns we  leave behind will be brought back  to implicate us by whatever  authority has now been focused upon  our once private and instant acts.  We lose our individuality because everything  we do is observable and  recordable. I mean, I understand both  sides of this argument. I really do. I've decided  because I'm too lazy to  do anything else just to buy the Amazon  phone.  Because it's cool and I  want it. Now, what about the judge  in Ottawa  who has the Supreme Court actually  wasn't in Ottawa, the Supreme Court of the British Columbia  was ruling on a case  in which a company  Equistek sued  because another company they claimed  was making  programs,  Datalink, that stole  Equistek's ideas  and designs and  in effect violated their patents.  The judge has  ruled, yes, in fact, this company, Datalink  did steal your designs  and has informed Google  that it must  pull down all links  to Datalink's site,  not just in Canada,  but they have to kill all the search results  on all their servers  worldwide. Now, the judge obviously doesn't  have jurisdiction worldwide,  but this is the first time I've ever heard of a  national court telling  Google, you've got  to get all  the addresses, all the references  out, not just Google's CA.  The judge wrote, websites  could be generated automatically resulting in an endless  game of whack-a-mole with the plaintiffs identifying  new URLs and Google deleting  them. So as a result,  Google must kill all  Datalink search results worldwide.  Not just any particular  website, but anytime you search for Google

Start time: 3337.26

Google is most  likely going to appeal.  And  Michael Geist, who is a  really excellent constitutional scholar  in Canada, said, it seems  likely that this will be  thrown out.  He writes, based on earlier  Canadian cross-border internet cases,  the global order will probably be  struck down, quote, this judge has decided  she's going to decide for the rest of the world.  He says, adding that it appears that the judge, seeing  the size and power of Google, may have decided  that, quote, judges need powers that are  equally large if they're going to deal with it.

One thing I know you don't  want to do is head  to the post office to wait in line to buy Stamps.  But you don't have to.  The post office approves this  message. Stamps.com  turns your PC or your Mac  into your personal post office.  You can buy and print official U.S.  postage. With your computer  and your printer, you do not need special links. You do not  need a postage meter. You can print  anything from some stamps to shipping  labels. You can print right on the envelope.  In fact, it really looks pro to do that, by the way.  I always know when I get mailings  from people who use Stamps.com because their  fulfillment looks great. It looks great.  Because  your logo, you get the return address printed  on there, the address,  it's just slick as heck.  And by the way, you're still giving  business to the post office? Mailman still comes  to your door, picks up the mail. In fact, the post  office loves you so much they'll give you discounts  you can't even get at the post  office. I just drive by the  post office. I love the post office. Don't get me wrong.  I am a big fan of the U.S. Postal Service.  What they do is amazing.  I am a huge fan.  I go by, whenever I  go by the post office, I wave, but I do not  stop. I go home to my office and I print.  And by  the way, what I do not love is that postage  meter companies,  postage meter ink is  100 times more expensive than  inkjet ink,  which is by itself 100 times more expensive than blood.  Plus,  postage meter companies will charge you to reset  processing fees. If the stamps  go up, you've got to pay them  to change the rates.  With stamps.com, it's simple.  The rate changes automatically.  You don't even have to worry about it.  They always have the right rates. I'm going to  get you a USB scale so you always have exactly  the right postage. If you are  selling on eBay or Etsy,  Amazon,  PayPal, it will automatically take  the information from the website,  print out the mailing label,  send out an email if you're doing  a confirmed mail.  If it's international, they'll fill out the  customs for us automatically.  You don't have to hand write a single thing.  Go to stamps.com, click  the microphone in the upper right hand corner,  and enter  the offer code TWIT and we've got a really  good deal for you. $55 in free  postage to use over the  first few months of your stamps.com  account. That USB scale I  mentioned, you get a free  activity account, and 30 days free of stamps.com.  This is a $110 bonus  offer. Go to stamps.com,  click the microphone in the right hand corner,  and use the offer code TWIT.  Stamps.com.  Don't get me  wrong because I love the United States Postal Service  and actually this is the best thing that ever happened to the US  Postal Service frankly.  Alright, let's see  here. We can move on from privacy.  I think so.  Net neutrality, huh, Jerry?

Transcript:  it's all good. Google,  alright, here's one. Let's stay with privacy for a little bit.  Google bought Nest, which is  the thermostat company.  They also make a smoke alarm that talks  to you. And then  Nest has now bought Dropcam  for more than half a billion dollars.  $555 million  Dropcam, we use Dropcam. We have six  Dropcams. If you go to twit.tv slash  Dropcams you can see views of the studio  always live from a lot of different places.  It's a Wi-Fi enabled camera.  Quite good quality.  Gee, you know, does that make you  nervous that Google's buying a camera  company?  Are they going to...  You know, one of the things that Dropcam does that's very interesting  is... There we are.  There's a little delay but if I start  waving you'll see us. Yeah.  One of the things that Dropcam does  is they store  if you pay, you have to subscribe  but they'll store all the video. You can search it.  You can scroll through it.  So it's got a  server component along with it.  Online storage. $99 a year to save  a week's worth of video at a time.  Nest  now...  Nest can see you.  Dropcam can see you.  Nest is saying that we bought  not Google but we bought them.  Like Nest customer data, this is the quote  Dropcam will come under Nest's  privacy policy  which says data will not be shared  with anyone including Google.  I think this is smart. Without a  customer's permission.  Nest has a paid for business model.  Ads are not a part  of our strategy.  And acquiring Dropcam will apply that same  policy  to Dropcam as well.  I'm actually thrilled. I think  Dropcam is a great company.

Start time: 3909.14

Transcript:  I'm going with Jerry on the inevitability of all  these kinds of things. But  still, I agree that  not playing devil's advocate  any longer on some of the privacy  stuff. I agree it's a smart move.  And it's going to be an important part.  I think this is an important aspect of  the smart home.  And if Google  wants to do that and go  full out with it,  then, you know,  and obviously they do with the Nest purchase,  then that's got to be part  of the equation too.  And so I think it's a smart buy.  I think getting them before somebody else did  helps Google, helps Nest.

And he said to me, our biggest  competitor isn't Sony or Samsung, who've  been doing a lot of smart watches too and really trying  to compete with them. He said, our biggest  competitor is people not wearing watches.  Right. And I  think he's exactly right. Exactly right.

And I've tried them all. The  Basis, the Fitbit, the Flex, the  Fuelband.  Every one of them. And they're  none of them quite there. The Pebble.  Chad's got my Pebble.  There's two categories. Two ways  to go. One is health and one is phone  extension. The Pebble's all phone extension.  Fitbit's all health. I can  imagine Apple might unify the two.  But I think this is a tough  category. Jerry, what do you think from  your perspective? I mean, you've watched categories  come and go. It's pretty clear now  tech companies have gotten to the point where  they're just trying to predict what's next because they want to be  there before we get there, right?

Yeah, it would cost  something right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  overthinking this? No. I think they're  trying to make technology...the  whole thing about wearables is making  technology disappear into the background  more. Making technology become more  human. That makes sense. Making it become  less of you staring at a  screen all the time. And I think that's an admirable  goal. I just think the execution  has never been right yet.  And  hopefully between Google  and its  wearable API and  the stuff it's going to talk about next week and then  Apple most likely  in the fall when we  could hear about iWatch  if the product is  ready yet, then  hopefully we're a step  closer. It's still going to be pretty rudimentary  but I think we're ready for the next step.  I think all of us are ready. Certainly all  of us are ready. We'll see if sort of the more of  the masses are ready to sort of try some  of these things and see if they can take  some of this technology to make it more  fade into the background and be  more human and less of people staring  at little pieces of screens or bigger

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I went to Moscow  in the late 80s  when it was still the Soviet Union.  And Stepan  Panovich of Paragraph was  writing the handwriting  recognition software that eventually  went into the Microsoft  tablets. And he  didn't have any examples  of American  handwriting. So I  took out my log book  and I  showed him.

Start time: 4529.40

I want  to point out something to you that you  seem to have forgotten. Uh-oh.  Moore's law is inexorable.  Yes.  The  micro-probe  people are up  to something  like a couple of thousand  channels  of information on a probe  to your head.  They have a doubling time  of under seven years, and  I suspect that's going to go down  more and more. When you get to  the point where it's ten to the  tenth  channels of information that they can  do unobtrusively  with maybe one little  plump in your head,  why do you need  to wear anything? Why doesn't  the computer just talk to your brain?

End time: 4655.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right? Yes, well, it's young adult  characters. The story is  probably adult, but yes.  And of course, Oath of Fieldy  was an early attempt  at what happens if you have a human-man  machine interface like that

Start time: 4655.18
End time: 4674.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that works. So the fact that  so much science fiction talks  about that, does that  say this is what we secretly hope  and desire? I mean,  you know more intimately than anybody  the process of science fiction.  When you start  seeing something just turn up all the time in  science fiction, what does that mean?

Start time: 4675.99
End time: 4701.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It means it's selling.  The general populace likes  stories that have that in it.  Okay.  That's fair. Samuel Johnson  said it very well. No man  ever wrote, no one but a blockhead  ever wrote for anything except money.  It's too arduous.  I guarantee you that's the way I feel about it.

Start time: 4701.60
End time: 4724.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that great? I love it.  And yet I do feel like  I don't want to get too airy-fairy, but  somebody used the word zeitgeist,  that there's something in the air  that you start just to see, and maybe  it is that feedback loop between an audience  and a writer, where the audience says, yeah, we  like that, more of that. And so there's definitely  this desire  for a human  machine interface.

Start time: 4725.58
End time: 4795.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But until the 90s,  there was no,  it was just fiction.  Nobody realistically expected it to happen  very soon.  When we wrote Oath of Fealty  in the 70s, 80s,  everybody, you know, I had people  thinking at their machines, and everybody  thought that was kind of goofy. Nowadays,  nobody thinks that's goofy. They think  it isn't here yet, but they don't think it's  goofy. And when you're talking about  10 to the 10th channels of  information going from your head  to outside and outside to  end of your head,  you are now talking about a  fair amount of  capability of simulating your  brain in a computer.  See, I don't think I can think  at you, and you understand it.  I think you and I,  each, all four billion  of us on this earth, have  our own internal language.  But I think we are getting  to the point where a computer  can  listen, can read and write  Leo, so to speak, and  it can read and write Jerry, and  then it can have those two talk to  each other within it, if you see what I'm  getting at.

On the other hand,  I point out to you something I said  to the Nanotech  conference a couple of weeks ago.  They say,  what's going to be going on in 2034?  Well, one  thing that's going to be going on in  2034 is  that whatever you're  carrying around with you  for a telephone  will be more powerful than the  most powerful computer on this  earth right now.  And that includes Watson and  Big Blue. Imagine that.  And it will have terabytes  of information on it,  on it, internal to it,  as well as connected to the cloud.  But you'll have Watson in your pocket.  And you'll  be the most formidable  competitor  on Jeopardy, there ever was.  Except that the other people will  have them too.

But the information  technology has  for years been basically  that every two years, it  either gets twice as powerful  or half as expensive, and  sometimes both.  It's been going that way and it has very  little to do with the number of chips you can put  on the  number of transistors you can put on  a chip. A lot of other things happened.

If I hadn't, over the  past few weeks, I've been working on this story  it's about some of the  people working in early days  at Apple. It's a long-form story that's  coming out next month.  It's fun stuff.  The cool thing, the  realization that I've come to is talking  to them about some of the early work they did  and the things they were actually working on  the problems they were trying  to solve and accomplish.  Comparing with what we're doing now  35 years later,  almost 40 years later,  it's a staggering  how far we've come.  I look at this stuff and I'm so  blown away in talking to  people that were working on technology  in the 70s. They're  blown away. The stuff they're working on  they're even so excited about.  We're looking at  how far we've come in such  a relatively short  period of time.  It really is quite staggering.  Because of that,  if we can come that far  and what we're doing is essentially  accelerating and building  upon what we're doing.  I don't know. I think there's a lot of things  that we're going to solve in the next 30 to 40 years  that we're  going to blow us away. That's why I don't

Transcript:  Well, we had, they had  a conference at Beharo Dunes.  It was run by the University of  Santa Clara.  And it was on self-replicating  machinery in space. The notion was  you send something up to space  and it makes a factory.  And the factory makes robots.  And robots make more factories. And factories  make more robots.  Could you do that? Then you can either  harvest factories or harvest robots.  And can you do that?  And  with the technology of the time  you couldn't do it. I'm not sure.  I don't think you can now. Either you can't quite  close that loop.  But one of the things to observe was  if you could do it  then how many years  would it take before every  star in the universe  which is billions, of course  will have been visited.  And that turns out to be  only a few million years.  Which is a pretty short period of time  given the number of years  since the universe was formed.  It's kind of like Fermi's  question. Where are they?  Where are the probes? Why is none?  And Minsky came up with this.  He said maybe that's the one rule  in the galactic civilization.  If you build a self-replicating  machine and send it out, we come in and  blow your planet up.  That is the one thing thou shalt not do.  Marvin and I were roommates  at that conference.

Transcript:  First rule about Gizwiz  is you do not talk about Gizwiz.  Sorry.  So, Patrick  Leahy  and Congresswoman Matsui  have introduced  landmark net neutrality legislation.  I'm opening the door here  for Jerry Pornell.  As you know, the Federal Communications  Commission is debating this whole thing and they've  been told by the courts that they don't have the  jurisdiction to ensure net neutrality.  So, a lot  of us are calling for them to  enforce Section 2 of the  Telecommunications Act, which  would declare, basically, broadband  providers to be telecommunications companies  and regulatable by the FCC.  But maybe the solution  is this bill,  the Online Competition and Consumer  Choice Act, which would do the most  important thing, the thing we're most worried that the FCC  will approve, paid  prioritization deals.  The internet service providers would go  to companies like Netflix or Google  or YouTube or Twitter and say,  if you would like to  have high speed internet delivered to  our customers, you would give us extra money  so we could have a faster  connection.  And they want to make this  illegal. The Online Competition and Consumer  Choice Act would prevent the creation,  they say, of a two-tiered internet system.  Al Franken, co-sponsor,  Henry Waxman of California,  Anna Eshoo of California,  all original co-sponsors. Waxman  and Eshoo both have constituencies  in Silicon Valley, so they obviously have  some interest in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good, because I'm not necessarily going to take  a side here. I'm just going to set the scene  a little bit into  this thing, this net neutrality  thing, is really starting to  line up kind of like health care  and immigration in that  most of us agree  in the principles of what needs  to happen.  The thing that we can't agree on  is how do we  get there? Because  when and how do we accomplish  the goals in the case of net neutrality  is the goal being sort of the free  and open internet, right?  Or at least  a sort of free, fair,  open internet. But the  problem is in enacting  legislation or  legislating it and trying  to legislate those solutions, there are going  to be winners and there are going to be losers  and there are going to be unintended consequences.  And that's what everybody's  I think scared of  and can't necessarily  see what the results of all  of those things are going to be.  And that's why we can't come to  consensus  about what we should do,  not so much what we should do, but how  we should do it, how we accomplish  it. And that's the challenge  with net neutrality. And  I think that it's one of  those things, I don't know,  this doesn't feel any closer than anything  else that we've talked about  over the last couple of years.

Start time: 5833.56
End time: 5865.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, one of the things that I've seen  over the last couple of weeks talking about net neutrality  is essentially  when it's boiling down for the telcos  is they'd like us to trust them. We saw this  when AT&T put forward  their proposal to buy Dish,  or sorry, DirecTV,  where they basically told the FCC,  look, look, look, we promise,  we're not going to give you any actual written promises,  but we promise that this is going to be good  for the consumer. We won't tell you  how, but this is going to be good.  Trust us. They've got no  store, they've got no reservoir of trust.

End time: 5884.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. All right, Jerry,  you and I agree on one thing.  A deep  abiding fear of government regulation  on the internet. The internet has grown without  government interference, and  my fear is that if we don't  protect it, that the  telecoms and the broadband providers  are going to screw us.

Start time: 5933.18
End time: 5983.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is the only thing you have  to worry about. And if you give  the government a monopoly, it's still  a bloody monopoly. That's a good  point too. So  you're  worried about something that isn't  a problem yet, and doesn't  look like it's going to be because bandwidth  keeps getting developed a lot  faster than the ability to use it  to begin with. I mean,  I used to get net  slowdowns a heck of a lot more a few  years ago than I do now.  You just had to turn me off  and recall me because we got  a slowdown on Skype.  But it was all  free, and it happened quickly.  I just don't see what  it is that you want... Why is  it you want to give the SEC geniuses  the power to  tell you what you can and can't have?

Start time: 5983.26
End time: 5998.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I've actually come around  to the idea that enforcing  Section 2 is probably a bad idea  because that just gives the  FCC a lot more  to regulate.  But do you think this bill is a good  idea? I think

Start time: 5999.20
End time: 6012.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that the bill is a horrible idea.  What I would like to see  is a revision of  the German Antitrust Act that  makes it very clear that we are  not going to have companies that are too  big to fail. Right.

Start time: 6013.79
End time: 6042.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, because it's  exactly true. And when  I think any legislation  almost always  in the US, the US is much  more on the side of businesses,  especially big businesses, than it is on  consumers  typically. So any legislation,  my concern is any legislation  that gets enacted, the unintended  consequences is that it helps  the Comcast and the Verizon's  and the Time  Warners of the world. And if

And he ain't got that capitalists don't  want to pay for compliance officers.  So you don't get startups.  I mean, it's a really  all of this stuff that you're talking about  net neutrality is  really a conspiracy against startups.

Transcript:  Yeah. Fair enough.  Supreme Court has done something  for us in the  battle against patent trolls on Thursday morning.  They ruled unanimously  to dismiss  a patent awarded to an Australian company  for business software.  Yeah.  Hoorah.  The court wrote, we conclude that the method  claims, which merely require generic  computer implementation,  failed to  transform that abstract idea into  a patent eligible invention.  Justice Clarence Thomas writing the  majority opinion, a unanimous  opinion. Now, this  is important because software patents  the door was open to software  patents when the court  ruled that a process,  a computer program used to vulcanize  rubber was patentable  first time ever because  it controlled a machine.  And they  said, well, that is an implementation  because it's controlling a machine. That did open  the door for software patents. And of course, we see a lot  of very generic patents that control no physical  machine.  They're things like patenting the  slide to unlock things that would in the  past have been copyrighted or trademarked  but not patented.

Start time: 6207.30
End time: 6250.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  not patent trolls are not over  because of course, as often  happens with a decision like this. Now the lower courts  are going to have to decide, well, what is  what is a generic  computer implementation? What is  a what is a physical  implementation? Well, you know, and  that's going to there's going to be a lot of  question marks. Judge Sotomayor  wrote a concurring opinion that said  no business method should ever  be patentable.  That that's getting a little close  closer to the idea.  But the  question is still open about whether software  itself could be patented.  But this is a big I think  a good step in the right direction.  I don't know what the upshot  will be with the USPTO, but I thought we'd mention

Start time: 6251.30
End time: 6283.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that. Yeah. But on the other side, you still  have the USPTO  handing out a copyright for  Pi in January of  this year. Not Apple Pi? No, just Pi.  They were able to get a copyright  on Pi, the symbol for Pi, because  obviously there's no prior art for that.  You still have Oracle who is  they've got a new wind in their  lawsuit against Google's use  of their  APIs. So  this is one little  ruling. I'm no f***. But  I don't know. I don't see it propagating.

Start time: 6655.54
End time: 6698.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says phone in the name, but it isn't really  a big part of it.  Or maybe it's just something you don't have to mention.  Well, of course, you can make phone calls,  not that you'd ever want to.  So let's get back to the Surface.  The other thing I was a little worried about, and I don't know if you know, Robert,  but we were talking about this on Windows Weekly,  both Paul and Mary Jo had the pre-released Surface Pro 3s  that they got from Microsoft  at the announcement.  And they've had weird power problems.  Yes.  It would lose power, it would lose the time of day.  You'd have to reset the machine.  And there was some question about  if Microsoft was going to fix this with a patch  when the Surface Pro 3 came out,  if it would be forced when you download it.  Did they fix it?  What is the status?  Maybe someone in the chat room knows if you bought a Surface Pro 3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, the machines that they got,  even though they say, oh, well, these are preview machines,  they were part of the manufacturing batch.  They didn't manufacture a thousand prototypes  and hand them out to the press.  So those same machines are the ones that you're going to buy in the store.  I wasn't able to duplicate the power problem  because I didn't have it long enough.  But I have read about it.  It's fairly serious, it sounds like.  I'm not convinced that it's a software problem.  I think it might actually be a hardware problem.  Right. See, that was part of the question.

Start time: 6725.20
End time: 6735.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They believe that the software fix could fix it.  So we don't know.  But it's something you should probably ask  before you run out of time.  Well, that's a matter of some concern.

Transcript:  What I want,  I need two things.  I need a production laptop.  And frankly,  an air would work very well for what I'm doing on that.  I need something I can write on when I'm away.  But I also need something I can sit at the breakfast table  and use OneNote to go through the newspapers,  both online and the paper paper in my hands.  That's a perfect OneNote machine.  That's what the surface is going to be.  It's made for OneNote.  Because you press, you take out the pen  and you press the button and one of the launches,

And basically, you take out the pen and you press the button  and one of the launches, it is like a dedicated,  it would be a great dedicated OneNote.  By the way, Mary Jo Foley did tweet that  there was a firmware update  that when you open the Surface Pro 3  and turn it on, immediately applied.  And they say it does fix that power problem.  So apparently they have,  yeah, apparently they have fixed it.  Given that, if they fix that problem,  then Jerry, and given what you want to do,  I think the Surface Pro 3 is exactly what you want.

Transcript:  Well, given what I do,  I need both a laptop and a tablet.  I did manage to do a couple of conductors  with just that compact Acer.  I did manage to do a couple of conductors  with just that compact HP laptop.  And it worked pretty good.  And I could go in the press room  and connect it to the internet  with its built-in ethernet  and file stories from it.  But I've found by and large  that tablets, few of them,  have a keyboard that I can write fast on.  Yeah, and I think you'd feel the same way

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with this touch or type,  I guess you only do the type cover now.  Although try the Acer keyboard  because like a lot of,  Acer's are good, yeah.  But like a lot of modern keyboards,  it has a very short throw.  And you may find, I actually have trouble typing with it.  And if that's the case,  then you should stick with your Lenovo  and the Carbon X1.

It's kind of an event  about innovation and  some of the stuff that they're doing.  But it's really not just about Ford.  It's barely about Ford.  It's more about kind of global innovation  and the future of  the ways innovation is going to  going to impact society.
