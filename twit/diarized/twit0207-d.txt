We have Scott Johnson says boys versus girls.  Scott Johnson is Mr. Extra Life.  He also does the Instance podcast and he's a proto podcaster.  He's been doing this since long before anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Very, very long time.  I'm thrilled to be here, Leo.  Thank you so much for having me on the show.  I'm excited to talk tech with someone I've watched since the tech TV days.  This is a big moment for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gosh.  And your webcomic Extra Life has been around since?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  2001, June of 2001 started the comic and the shows started rolling in around 2003, 2004.  And most recent was App Slappy, show for app store lovers and iPhone, iPhone, iPhone.  iPhone honors.  iPhone honors.  iPhone freaks out there.  They just can't get enough of the app store.  So we started that a couple few weeks ago and that's doing well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did Scott and Tom Maron have a new podcast called Extra, I'm sorry, called Forecast,  F-O-U-R, Cast.  And I did that last week and had such a good time.  And I thought, well, I should get Scott on the show.  And then he said, well, if I come on the show, you better bring Miss Veronica Belmont on  the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we're old friends.  I just love Veronica.  She's the greatest.  She's like the weird little sister I never had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Veronica, is Scott our guild master?  Should I be bowing down to him?  He's up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Randy is really our boss guy in the guild.  But yeah, Scott and Scott's up there, too.  He played hard these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Veronica and I were there the day we founded it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alia Jakta Est.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Correct.  You should be in there.  You should be in there, Leo.  You're still on a roll.  What do you mean I should be in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm on the rolls, dude.  I just don't play this silly thing.  You know why?  You know why?  My life's work.  Every time I launch World of Warcraft now, it says, check back in five days.  We'll be updating.  You know, if you don't update like every time, you pay the price.  It takes hours.  And now they're using peer to peer.  So it's even slower than before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, the way that I met Scott was through Buzz Out Loud, actually.  He was a listener and called in all the time with really great comments.  And then I think one time he mentioned that he had a World of Warcraft podcast.  So I started listening to that and then we became Buds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, great show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, speaking of Buds from Buzz Out Loud, ladies and gentlemen,  Miss Molly Wood is also here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hello.  Another so nice to be here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alum from Buzz Out Loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know I didn't understand a word of what was just said because I didn't go the wow route.  But the Buzz Out Loud thing.  Yay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got two words for Molly.  Bullet bourbon, baby.  Oh, I hope that's not still the first bottle.  I'm still the first bottle.  No, what do you think I am a lush?  Molly brought me this last time she was in studio.  It is good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You fueled your your guest appearance on forecast with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely.  I discovered that it goes very well with Odwalla lemonade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's funny, because I was also drunk.  I did forecast.  Were you?  I think that was the inspiration.  Your glass of wine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should know that for today, I have a nice summer lambrusco,  which is sort of like a fizzy red wine.  It's really it's quite lovely.  How delicious.  It's my goal to do twit with some sort of liquor all the time.  Also, it's hotter than blazes, so we need whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Molly's out on the deck of her lovely palatial estate in the  in the Oakland Berkeley Hills.  She actually owns the Oakland Berkeley Hills.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true. The whole thing.  And it's just it's just gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The view is spectacular.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it is spectacular.  So let's get to the stories.  And the big story, of course, was the Thursday meltdown  that everybody experienced when Twitter was not online Thursday morning.  Kind of an interesting story.  It turns out that it wasn't an attack on Twitter.  It was an attack on one Twitter user and not just on his Twitter account,  but on his Facebook account, on his YouTube, on his live journal.  He's a Georgian blogger.  I feel like he's a Georgian blogger straight out of the Soviet  former Soviet Republic of blogging from Tbilisi and wearing the number 42.  It's and I can't pronounce his name.  Yeah, some weird name.  But that's what I call.  But this this started apparently with with somebody.  And you've got to think it's the Russian government.  I mean, who else would want to shut this guy down?  He they started sending out spam.  Ostensibly from him with links to his articles,  but they sent out so many millions of these people clicked.  And pretty soon his his blog, his Twitter, his YouTube, his Facebook  are all staggering under the weight.  Next step was to DDoS it.  Yeah, yeah.  And, you know, you got to wonder about the  the fact that of all the sites, Twitter was the only one that really  couldn't handle the traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Facebook had a lot of trouble for a while, especially,  you know, mostly in the United States, which is funny,  they brought up the servers back in the area that the particular user was located  in, people could get onto Facebook in that region.  But people were having a lot of trouble everywhere else in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they well, what actually turned out, according to Facebook,  they blocked him everywhere else in the world.  So the way that they solved their DDoS was they said, you can if you're from Georgia,  you can see his page, but everybody else were going to block it.  And that way, I guess most of the traffic,  the DDoS traffic was not coming from Georgia, but from all of the  owned computers here in the United States and in China and around the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, once again, I mean, Facebook had slowness, but Twitter was nuked.  I mean, it was absolutely unavailable for days and I think is still pretty flaky.  And Facebook did seem to, even though it had trouble,  it seemed to weather it a little bit well than a little bit better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They recovered quickly.  And what's interesting is Google, which also was hit, you know,  didn't even stumble, didn't even quiver.  But Twitter, yeah, I mean, does this say something about Twitter's infrastructure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That wasn't that that's what this serves to do once again, is that an attack like this  that supposedly on one guy takes down the entire service, it's a total wake up call to Twitter.  They've got to figure out a way to scale better.  And I know we talk about it and talked about a billion times on this show alone.  But they don't they are not ready for something really, really major  for people who really want to take him down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dave Weiner has been saying, I actually asked Dave to come on the show, but he couldn't make it.  Dave Weiner has been saying this is Twitter needs to be distributed.  Twitter needs to be distributed.  And boy, this points it out.  And what he's saying is there shouldn't be one Twitter.  There should be a lot of Twitter's federated together so that, you know, one goes down.  It doesn't mean Twitter goes down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and he's been saying that for a long time because Twitter just had so many  performance issues for so long.  And this, I think, has got to be frustrating for Twitter because it is a giant setback in that sense.  Like they kind of barely had recovered from the Oprah onslaught and then, you know,  after which they got embarrassingly slow.  And then they basically proved that they can't handle a DDoS attack, you know, as well as your local bank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. But they're saying even now that they don't even know when things are going to go back to normal again.  It could be any amount of time.  It's the scaling issue is definitely a big deal, but they've they've done better.  I mean, they've added tons more servers and the more money they get, the more they build up their infrastructure.  But I don't think they were expecting this kind of thing, although they probably should have been, you know,  really a matter of time before something like this happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it really things as people like everybody with their trying to use the API to use their little services.  I use I use Tweet Reel on my iPhone and they're down for days and days.  That's what I haven't heard of before.  Tweet Reel is great, isn't it?  I haven't heard of Tweet Reel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's awesome. Great app.  It only does one thing. You don't Twitter from it.  You upload video or pictures from it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you can't. But to the solves the iPhone problem.  I don't have a 3GS.  Well, I think it'll work with.  Oh, you can't do video, but you could still use it for pictures.  But the problem with video on the iPhone 3GS is that, you know, even like a 10 second video,  the iPhone says, no, that's too big.  I won't I won't send it.  But Tweet Reel doesn't care.  So I was Tweet Reeling from China.  In fact, when China was blocking Twitter, I was able to use Tweet Reel to get out, which really.  It's so odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The downtime didn't even affect me for some reason.  Like I was I was shooting all day on Thursday and I kept hearing about all these problems.  Like I was checking tech meme and everything every so often.  But I sent out a couple of Twitter's.  I don't know if they made it out there, but I didn't have any actual issues doing anything  or reading tweets that whole day.  So I don't know if I was just in some kind of like safe pocket or if I was just on at the right times.  But I was like, what's everyone talking about?  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you must have been on on base for sure, because I was going crazy that whole day.  Like, I can't believe how I had to go ghetto with Facebook.  It was just so depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, as Evil Monkey says in our friend feed room, is Twitter really that important?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you know, I think actually, I mean, whether or not it's that important,  it certainly is perceived that way, because all day long, the media was calling CNET for comment.  And, you know, there was the number one story on the Times in Newsweek.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was the number one story, number two story on NPR.  It's as if, you know, it's as if the Bank of America collapsed or something.  It was huge. It upsets your addiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Infrastructure went down. Yeah.  And it's not. Telephones are gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I miss the people I follow was my problem.  So as soon as this hit, I was like, wow, it's quiet in Twitter.  There's something wrong. It feels like apocalyptic almost.  I hated it. I felt lonely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I was all alone without my peeps.  I didn't like it. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Twitter really is an addiction. It's like Starbucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It really is. It's bad. It's bad.  It's a bad addiction.  And I think it's totally bad for, I think, a certain  a certain kind of maybe not a certain kind of person,  because I don't want to paint myself with some sort of personality brush.  But if you have a really good dialogue going with the people  that you follow and who follow you, then I think it can be really  it can feel like you're all of a sudden kind of off in the void.  And none of your friends are calling you right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They say there's so many other ways to reach out to people.  I mean, we're all on Facebook and we're all on friend feed, or at least we should be.  And so I think there's a lot of different ways to kind of fill that gap.  If you don't have Twitter for a little while for a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Friend feed got really busy. I live on friend feed.  It got very busy. No, no. You don't need a replacement. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't I don't want to do those other things. I only want Twitter. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Were you an early Twitter adopter, Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I was late. Veronica knows I was pretty late.  I didn't adopt it until.  2007, I think it was right around the time I went on maternity leave,  like right after I had my son and I had discovered it just shortly before that.  So maybe February, April 2007.  According to the. I mean, I guess relatively speaking, but, you know,  it had been around. Kids don't use Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Teenagers don't use Twitter. My teenagers kind of very, you know, sketchily.  They like Facebook.  They like MySpace. Younger people don't use it.  It tends to be professionals in their 30s and later. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. My daughter, my 15 year old daughter started using it.  She unfollowed me and I said, what are you doing?  And I asked her that.  She said, she says you tweet too much.  I was like, well, crap.  I mean, I can't even get my own daughter.  Your daughter says you tweet too much. Yeah.  Yeah. So that's not a sign of addiction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. That's a boring episode right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Daughters. My mom's on Twitter, but she only follows me and LeVar Burton.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  She just really likes LeVar Burton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fathers who tweet too much and the daughters who love them on the next.  Mori. I think it's good.  I like it. Yeah.  I don't want to drive this story into the ground.  I think we have, but it's just I was stunned  more by the media reaction to this than the fact that Twitter was down.  I mean, big deal. Fail wells. We're used to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, the Twitter love is connected.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How's that Blackberry and Twitter working for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Twitter love. I think the interesting thing I just think it's so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute. You broke up with your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did. I broke up with my iPhone and I've been using Uber Twitter on the Blackberry.  And I mean, I have to say,  the iPhone is a better device than the Blackberry, but the Blackberry can.  And this is astonishing.  Both send and receive text messages and also make calls at my house and at work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you have an AT&T problem is your problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I have an AT&T problem just like everyone else in the Bay Area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw a tweet from somebody who said, now I understand  why there's so much hate from the didgeridoo.  AT&T sucks in San Francisco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, when people come to visit in San Francisco, they go like, oh,  now I know what you've been talking about all this time,  because it's just it's appalling.  I mean, I shouldn't be.  It's one thing that, you know, I live up here in a treehouse,  and I guess it would make sense that I don't have great coverage.  But in downtown San Francisco, south of markets, not be able to make a call  or send a text. Suck it, AT&T.  That's just embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That is I admit it.  I was sad when I heard you dumped it, but I agree.  That's terrible. I can't believe that.  I have great service and I'm out in the middle of the West Desert in Utah.  And I don't know why I'm getting better service than you.  It doesn't make sense in a big city like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's probably too many people or if it's, you know,  it has something to do with the geography and just there are too many  being too many people trying to get onto the 3G network at the same time.  And I feel like there should be ways that they can fix it, you know,  by installing repeaters around the city or putting up new antennas or  it's just like a bandwidth thing.  There's just too many people on at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Show of hands, how many of you go to Verizon if iPhone shows up on Verizon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In one second. Yeah, instantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Veronica, not you, not you, Veronica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I had bad Verizon experiences in the past.  The only the only time I would switch was if it went to T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really? T-Mobile?  I like T-Mobile a lot.  Well, you can jailbreak it. Jailbreak it.  You're there. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have no interest in being on that.  And I a lot of people ask me why I didn't just jailbreak my iPhone and go to T-Mobile.  And I have no interest in being in that kind of running gun battle with Apple.  Once I jailbreak the phone, like, it's just that, you know what it is?  It's a pain in the butt.  Well, you know what Apple says? I want it to be legit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple says you jailbreak your iPhone and the terrorists win.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Also, I don't want to be a terrorist.  Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's not nice. You're the problem, Molly would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. No, I'm not, though, because I decided to be a good citizen instead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have talked to more and more people who, for a number of reasons,  have abandoned the iPhone.  In fact, Jason Calacanis just wrote a scathing article about Apple  and how he was, you know, felt abandoned by Apple's moving away.  A lot of people with the Google Voice application problem last week  where Apple blocked the Google Voice from the iPhone.  I think. Do you think that when we last week's tweet was really much  pretty much like a bunch of us going, Apple, you broke our hearts.  Now, Molly, you've never been an Apple fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. In fact, I'm kind of happy to see everybody finally coming out,  coming around the trance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think, oh, wah, wah, wah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like on the one hand, everybody who suddenly discovered that  the closed platform that is the iPhone is in fact a closed platform.  I kind of want to say, like, what are you so surprised about?  You know, of course, this was bound to happen.  And of course, they don't want Google Voice on the iPhone.  That is actually not surprising, not unexpected from, you know, given  everything that they've done with the iPhone in the App Store approval process  so far and hardly the only reason to leave if you're going to leave.  Like for me, it's a great device.  It doesn't work on AT&T. It's that simple.  And yes, it is a fault card.  You either like that or you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're working on a good web app now, right?  For Google Voice, that's the next thing they're going to do.  That's a really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  David Pogue had this story in The New York Times.  That is fascinating. Google says, no problem.  We will do it as a web app.  We will have every one of the features now block us.  Apple now block us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And I've been already using it that way a little bit for sending text messages  back and forth on Google Voice.  That's pretty well now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It actually works really well now.  As a matter of fact, we took so much heat for that on AppSlappy.  I don't can't tell you how many readers were mad at me because initially I kind of said  I was a little sympathetic.  I was like, all right, well, look, AT&T wants to control their network.  Google's maybe got something going on with Google Voice.  It's just going to kill the network.  You know, I'm making these excuses for Apple and my gosh, I had people.  I've never had so much hate mail about any issue.  So people really are worked up about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think that this is the beginning of people turning on Apple?  Oh, man, as I stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. It goes back all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No way. No.  Because really, if you think about it,  the people who are angry about Google Voice are the few hundred people  who are invited to the Google Voice thing right now.  You know, I mean, I just don't think that the mainstream, the people who are really  snapping up the iPhone in droves who have perfectly good AT&T service  in the middle of America or wherever they live.  I honestly don't think they care.  I think for such an echo chain, like it matters to us,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but it doesn't matter to real users half the time.  You know, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who have no idea what Google Voice is.  And no matter how many times you try to explain it, they kind of don't get it.  You know, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a little hard. It is a little hard to explain.  They say, OK, so you're saying instead of making my phone to make a call,  I call Google Voice and then they call me back.  And then I'm making the call on my phone.  But I'm not using. But I'm not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They go like, oh, is it Skype?  And then you just go, oh, you're still paying for minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I'm going to say that Google Voice is really nice  when you're testing a lot of different phones at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I use it for. Yeah, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Instead of having to give people different numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For a small population. That's the echo chamber right there.  You know, for those of us who have eight different cell phones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there's nothing like Google Voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For those of us who have review units raining out of the sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My gosh, Google Voice.  Well, you know, I often wondered if it wouldn't be smart for somebody  to design a product that would just like make Walt Mossberg so happy  that, you know, just jump up and down and David Pogue and Ed Begg,  all the big reviewers and, you know, and and Ryan Block and Veronica and Molly.  And everybody go, oh, this is the best thing ever.  Even though it has no usefulness for anybody else, wouldn't it be a success?  Because everybody say, well, I'll have to I got to have that.  Maybe that's what Twitter was.  I think that's what Twitter is, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's you know what? I think that product is chumby. Chumby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I still want one. I don't know. I want one so bad.  Oh, OK. Well, you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, so I have a chumby that's in the drawer that I will give one of you.  The winner of tonight's show gets real fine.  My old chumby. I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Arm wrestle or just straight up mud wrestle.  I don't even know where to go with this.  Well, you're on diagonal.  You're on diagonal monitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If there was some way you could like spit at each other across the screen.  I don't know.  I don't know.  No, I tell you, I bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought enough crap around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't turn me against my friend Veronica over a chumby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't really want to come between us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, geez. Come between us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You mustn't really relate.  Here, I'll put you in a double box and let you guys fight.  You can you can figure out who gets who gets what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I got the chumby.  I thought this will be really cool for a video, right?  I don't know. Video what?  But video like I could use this somehow.  And it's just stupid.  It's just stupid. There's no reason for a chumby.  Fight girls, fight.  For those of you not watching at home on video, you are missing an amazing battle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And or you are totally bored and baffled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Since like a fight with a blue screen, that's usually Dvorak here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get you.  Facebook now the fourth largest site in the world.  The global rise of Facebook.  Nothing less than astounding, says Eric Schoenfeld, writing in TechCrunch  in the month of June alone, it gained 24 million, gained  24 million uniques for a total of.  Drumroll, please.  340 million unique visitors worldwide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Get out. Crazy.  Do we know? Do we have any idea what MySpace was at its peak?  At its moment?  MySpace at its peak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was their moment? What was the peak?  When would that have been?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  April 2008.  But I don't know exactly what that was.  I think it was 150 million as I remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so. Yeah, I think that's that sounds about right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Passes remarkable days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, according to according to Facebook itself,  they they only acknowledge 250 million active users.  But I think that if you think about it, people visit their Facebook,  if you get 340 million uniques a month, that's because it's people  visiting their pages again and again, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, the pages are becoming like landing areas for for bands  and people and personalities, and so they're trying to kind of take that  home page style market that MySpace has had for that kind of thing as well.  I don't know if it'll pick up in the same way that MySpace has for music  and entertainers and movies and videos and that kind of thing.  But it's possible.  I mean, it's just going to take a while for people to make that mental shift  to think that, oh, I can go to Facebook to interact with my favorite,  you know, bands and personalities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wondered if that shift had already happened because I know, you know,  it's long been the domain of bands, but if Facebook had sort of picked up

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  any of that long, long ago, I started using Facebook as kind of  not long ago, like last month as a long ago in dog years and Internet age  as kind of more of my it's almost, I think, becoming people's blogs.  If you go to Facebook dot com slash Leo Laporte, the fan page,  that's more and more becoming like the blog, right?  The center of the center of the universe for me.  And I just think that that's the trend.  That's where that's where it's heading.  Get this in the month of June.  Seventy seven million uniques in the US.  That's like a third of the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, people get you're talking about how they don't get Twitter  or they don't get some of these other technologies.  They totally get Facebook.  My mom gets Facebook.  They do. Seven.  She totally gets it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you as much as Twitter seems like it's dead simple, Twitter is hard to.  We've talked about this.  It's sort of hard to get a foothold on Twitter and hard to get that conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Easy to use, hard to understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But everybody can understand.  I do that. All of a sudden, you're in contact with all the people  that used to go to high school with and they're fat now.  So, you know, that's easy.  Yeah, I get that.  That is not true of any of my Facebook friends from high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're all gorgeous. I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not those ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not those, not my friends.  No, my friends are fat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Facebook has been really good about getting people that you care about together.  Twitter's gotten really good about bringing people together  that may have no idea who the other guy is.  But Facebook, as long as it has that sort of my mom, my sister,  these guys I went to high school with, my buddies from college,  they're going to kind of win that whole, you know,  the social part of social networking.  Yeah, I think that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I said they're number four.  Do you want to guess, Gang, who one, two and three are?  I think you probably could do that pretty quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Google. Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google, right? Google with, get this, 844 million uniques.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow. Good Lord.  That's that's that's a third of the what is that?  That's the third of the I mean, if you take out 80 people over 80 and under 12,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's everybody. Yeah, that's remarkable.  And of course, they withstood a DDoS attack.  If they're getting that kind of usership, that's that alone is a DDoS attack.  Well, and of course, Facebook kind of weathered it because what is Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like 20 million users, I think 45, 45 million.  OK, growing fast.  Higher than I thought.  I'm thinking Yahoo's got to still be in the top three.  Aren't they like half a million? Yahoo, 581 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very good. Molly Wood, probably like live Microsoft.  Total Microsoft.  Not just live, but the whole Microsoft is number two.  That's 691 million.  Then Facebook.  You know, here's another surprise.  Wikimedia is number five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really? Oh, that makes sense.  I mean, a lot of people are.  Yeah, that makes sense. Right on Wikimedia beating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know why? Because it's all coming from Google.  They have such remarkable SEO.  Oh, they have such high Google, you know, Google search returns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I always like first or second result for most things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some people have thought that that's a little suspicious  that that Google is maybe preferring Wikipedia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have wondered about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What? But why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I don't know.  Those entries are so keyword filled.  I mean, they are perfectly keyworded.  Just naturally.  I agree with Scott. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I can imagine Google's algorithm saying this is perfectly relevant  because this is, in fact, the purest form of like information  about the topic that you're searching for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'm trying to remember the blog post I read.  I was a John Gruber.  I can't remember. Somebody was saying  it had compared Google search results over a period of three or four years.  And bemoaned the fact that in three or four years ago,  if you search for something, you would still find good results,  but there'd be a more variety.  You'd be a variety of different pages.  And now if you search for something in Google, you really tend to get  mainstream media, Wikipedia, you know, the same old suspects over and over again.  Is that because people have figured out how to do it right  so that Google finds them?  Or is it is Google up to something?  By the way, a lot of those sites are Google sites that you find.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google, so they're pretty limber with this.  They change this stuff up all the time.  And when I work for a company for a while, where our goal every day  was to say, how do we get keyworded in the best possible way  without actually breaking service agreements and making them mad?  I mean, there's tons of SEO specialists

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  whose whole job it is to like make sure that your results come up on top.  So there's ways to game it, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you really want that.  I think don't you want the diversity?  Don't you want Google to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Google has I think Google has always had a little bit of a relevance  hegemony. I mean, it's almost it's almost a search result popularity contest  in some ways, like there is other information out there,  but you really don't see it.  And you kind of I do wonder if Google could benefit from something  that just kind of said, like, turn off relevance, just show me everything.  Just put on the front page the things that are, you know, maybe totally weird,  but but actually fit my query the best.  And I would just kind of be curious to see.  It would almost be like some sort of Wolfram Alpha experiment, basically,  just to see what would happen if relevance was off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say, when I search for, say, Scott Johnson and I see Wikipedia  as one of the links, that's the first one I go to anyway.  So Google's just giving me what I really am looking for. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And some of that some of that, you know, those results are based on.  I know Google says it's not based on clicks, but I have to think  there's something in there that says, OK, well, a lot of people clicked  on the Wikipedia article for my name.  Therefore, that has higher relevance than something that's keyworded better.  I just have to think that's the case.  I'm not 100 percent about that, but I just Google's always said, oh, no,  it's all totally organic. But I don't buy it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No way. Yeah.  Maybe it's not only based on clicks, but come on,  everything on the Web is about clicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, have you have you guys been using Bing regularly?  Have you been trying it out? No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the results are awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Kind of bad. I think the results are pretty questionable, actually.  I use it for video search.  I actually find it very useful for video search and better than Google in that way.  But even then, like not that often, because honestly, any more.  I just control K into my Chrome toolbar and type whatever I want to search for.  And then, you know, since I've never changed it to Bing, it's like,  I don't go to a search homepage  and can't remember the last time I ever did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it does. I had kind of a I had kind of an ooo shiny week.  And then I went back to Google after that pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. There is a blog.  We should do this. There is a blind search engine test.  Oh, yeah. Oh, all right.  Let me let me give you the link to this.  It's blind search dot features.  F E G U S dot com.  Go there quickly before everybody else does.  Oh, shoot. I know. Totally. Oh, too late.  Yeah. Features. It's too late. It's down. It's already down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. I was going to say my little netbook can't even handle like more than one  tab open at a time without dropping my Skype calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So, you know, you mentioning everyone else will bar.  Made me wonder. I haven't even tried. But is there no and that wouldn't work.  Can you not? I was thinking, wouldn't it be funny if you could put Bing  in as your default search toolbar for Safari, which I'm using now?  You can do it obviously for IE very easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could do it for Internet Explorer.  There is a way to do it for Safari, but it's nontrivial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I thought all the browsers just kept it like an updated list of preferences  and search engine preferences that you could choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wouldn't. It would be nice if Apple would do that.  But yeah, I actually was going to try Bing, you know, I mean, try to be fair  and say I'll do Bing for a week.  And but in order to do that, I'd have to modify Safari because I use Safari  most of the time and I couldn't find an easy way to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So and they don't include that. See, that's not cool. It's not cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Again, Apple showing that it's not exactly open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not exactly. Yeah.  I think you could say they are not exactly.  But everything else is so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's it's cool, but not open.  Last class last week, I said Apple was like Mussolini's Italy.  Yeah, you had no freedom, but the trains run on time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a very beautiful little prison that you live in, like White Collar Jail.  So it's really nice. Yeah. White Collar Jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's nice here. It's nice here.  It's not. It's going to be high on Thursdays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That should be their ad campaign.  They should come to jail. But it's nice here. It's nice here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have five Macs in here and they're all looking a little ominous now.  Thank you, Molly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're like surrounding me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How do you like living exactly how Steve wants you to live?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's Steve's world. We just live in it, Molly.  Now I'm just blatantly baiting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's good. No, plate bait bait away.  Blatantly blatantly blatantly blatantly blatantly blatantly blatantly.  Sound like me. Blabla.  Hey, let's take a little break, give everybody a chance to quaff  some beverages while I mention our friends at.  Wow, Molly, is that you quaffing?  It's absolutely robotic.  Did I quaff?  I think we're going to start a rumor that Molly's actually a Cylon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's true. Well, I am a Cylon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If I was a Cylon, I'd be making better noises.  I want to talk.  What is that, I wonder?  I think it's you.  All right, I'm going to mute and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just noise.  They're saying it's me.  Oh, it is. It's you. It's you.  It's you, Veronica.  What did I do? I didn't do nothing.  So here's what you do, Veronica.  You unplug and plug into the other port.  You're on a MacBook, aren't you?  Yes. Yeah.  Yeah. Use the Mac.  Use the port closest to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I'm on the USB hub.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, now you're better.  You're all better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  OK, I just kept it in the same one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a weird thing that happens with Macs.  Sorry.  Whenever you start mentioning Steve Jobs' name in vain, it starts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Picking up on that, they're actually tapped into our conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was probably my fault, even though it wasn't on my end.  So I apologize.  They're making fun of me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're saying I'm a freaking sound engineer,  but I couldn't hear that happening on my end.  No, you wouldn't hear it. Yeah, you wouldn't hear it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only we can hear it. Exactly right.  I want to talk about GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting is fantabulous.  I know you you don't like to travel.  And but at the same time, if you're in business,  face-to-face meetings with your clients are often very important.  There is a way to take that conference call and turn it into something  truly useful, truly engaging.  Every bit as good as a face-to-face meeting.  It's online meetings. You probably tried it.  But if you haven't tried GoToMeeting, you haven't tried the best.  In fact, you could go there right now.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit, G-O-T-O, meeting dot com slash twit  and sign up for the 30 day free trial.  You'll be done before I'm done talking.  It's very easy to install.  And now the next time you want to have a meeting,  you can click and send an invitation.  It's very simple, automatic set up.  Or you can even do it manually.  You're on the phone with somebody and say, look, just go to GoToMeeting.com.  This is what we're doing all the time.  We do. In fact, I just had a GoToMeeting the other day.  We do it with Ray Maxwell and Maxwell's house.  I said, just go to GoToMeeting.com.  Here's the meeting ID. They enter it in.  They don't even have to have it installed within seconds.  They're seeing your screen on their computer.  They see the it works Mac or PC.  So they see the keynote or PowerPoint.  They see the drawings. You can work together.  We were great. We paid for Ray's account.  And then Dane said, you know, you don't need to pay for his account.  You could just you hold the meeting and give him control.  And I said, oh, yeah, because I could see his computer, too.  It goes both ways. GoToMeeting.com.  You're going to try it and you're going to think of 100 ways to use it.  I'm not even going to try to list them all.  It is the simplest, secure, easiest way to collaborate, to train,  to demo, to do sales presentations, try it free for 30 days.  By the way, includes phone and voice over IP conferencing  for less than 50 bucks a month for this.  GoToMeeting.com for as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  I got an interesting debate.  Maybe you guys would have some opinion on this.  I tweeted this week because, you know, there's a new service, ISEA.  Have you seen that? ISEA that pays people to insert ads into their Twitter stream.  And I said on my Twitter stream, I said,  you know, ISEA ad in your stream ads in your stream, instant unfollow from me.  And then somebody said, well, how is that any different from an ad in your podcast?  And I said I had actually rocked me back and I had to think about it.  So, well, you're right. That's just putting an ad in content.  How is that different?  And I thought about it and I think that you tell me what you think, guys,  because this is this was my answer and I'm not actually shook me up a little bit.  Boy, I guess you could put out there's something that bugs me about  having ads in the Twitter stream. And I realize what it is.  Why? You tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The reason I think like to each their own, if someone chooses to do that, that's fine.  You know, it's their own business.  But to me, it feels like Twitter is like a really personal thing in a way.  Like, yeah, sometimes I self promote on Twitter, like to a blog post  I've written or a podcast I did an interview on.  But mostly I try to keep it, you know, my personal life, stuff that I'm doing,  you know, things I think are funny.  And when you stick ads in there suddenly, it feels like you're  kind of selling yourself in a way.  I don't know. It's like something about it.  It's spammy. Right to me.  I think it feels like spammy, but it really isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It really isn't significantly different from having Google ad words on your blog.  Or, you know, I mean, I think it is that I think that I understand  that either that the content.  Yeah, I don't do that either.  Well, here's the difference.  Content feels different, but it's really not.  It's really all just content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's what I thought.  And maybe now you tell me if I'm full of it.  When you intermix content with advertising, with the intent to fool somebody,  that's when it goes over the line.  So that what Isaiah does?  No. In fact, they make a big point saying, no, it's an ad, you know, blah, blah, blah.  But it somehow seems to me that the Twitter stream,  for instance, if you put Google ad words in your blog post  or in your content, I hate it when people do that.  And when you put ads in between posts even.  But if you put the ads to the right of them on the blog, that I know  that's the ads, this is the content, and they don't.  And they're separated clearly.  And I guess that's what I figure is that you people advertisers pay a little bit more  if the paper post thing, they pay bloggers to to write articles  about their products because it tricks consumers into thinking  this is editorial, not advertorial.  Well, I'm glad I'm not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad I'm not the only one here that turned this down.  I had an advertiser approach me, a specific advertiser,  not somebody who does this like Isaiah, but someone said,  you know, would you be willing to do, you know, reviews,  even though you haven't seen product or whatever, put those right in your Twitter feed.  And I'm just not I was just they freaked me out, to be honest.  And Molly makes a good point.  I don't know why it's so different, but something feels really different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I said that. I said, and I'm sorry that I said, you're crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But here's the thing, Veronica's Veronica made a really good point, though.  She says, OK, you want to tell people when you're on a show  or you want to let people know there's a new blog post up.  That's why they're following us.  People want to know when my new comic is up on Monday morning.  They want to know when Extra Life Radio posted.  That's why many of them are there.  So I don't see that as a thing at all.  All I you know, my my bottom line is if you want me to put ads  directly in Twitter, we're just can't make a deal.  There's no way I'm doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that I think we're on it.  We're at a very tough point on the web because we are very conditioned  as web users to be anti advertising.  I think we've been over advertised to.  And so we're exhausted by it.  And we have gotten very used to a free product.  But the fact is, like, that can't last forever.  And and the line between advertising and editorial is increasingly blurry.  And there's kind of this question of like, well, OK, but what do you want Twitter to do?  Like, I'm so sort of tired.  Twitter doesn't make the money there that you do.  Right. That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But I think you tell me what the ads look like in the stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't seen him.  You know, here in our chat room, Noman Steven says it would be like having an ad  in the middle of a conversation with your friends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But is that what Twitter is anymore?  Like, are you really I mean, I guess that's my own.  I guess that's what makes me wonder is I'm not sure that Twitter really is.  Even though I just said that I missed my friends when Twitter was down.  I think that people really are branding themselves on Twitter.  And I think that it's become, you know, the reason that it's so important  when Twitter goes down is that it's there's this idea that it's this huge kind of  very important thing.  And so I can kind of branding themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  If Twitter is going down, you're missing your friends.  It's not because you miss their branding.  It's because you miss their personal insights.  I miss your brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. But me missing my friends is not the reason that people care  that Twitter went down.  They care because Oprah is on Twitter talking about her show all the time.  I mean, you care.  You're totally not other people.  One at a time.  To me, that to me, that's not significantly different than  than having ads in Twitter.  Like the reason that Oprah is on Twitter is to advertise.  So then I feel like if Joe Bob wants to make some extra money  by putting ads in his Twitter feed, shouldn't he be just as entitled  to do that as Oprah is to come on and basically spam all of us  all the time with her bull crap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's true. But I think it's for people who have, you know,  been on Twitter for a super long time and you kind of have built up this reputation  and this certain dialogue that you share with your readers to suddenly interject  ads in there. And I'm not really sure how they're being disclosed.  I don't know if there's like the ad.  Yeah, there's a hashed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's no the problem partly is that Isaiah gives you all these different  ways of doing it.  But one one way, for instance, is a pound ad.  So there's a hashtag that says it's an ad and it even says brought to you by.  I have to say, I changed my tune.  At first, I was really dogmatic saying, no, I'm not going to follow somebody  that does this. And then I really feel like, well, it is kind of like  what we do in podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I know I just I feel like if I'm going to do it,  if I'm going to do it, I'm going to I'm going to let my readers down.  I feel like they're not they're not going to come there and they're not going to go,  this is why they followed you.  I can't wait to see the ad you're going to post on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And they told me, oh, I mean, you went Leo and Scott and Molly.  You all have podcasts that are, you know, well, maybe not buzz out loud,  but the other ones are like advertising supported.  You know, that's kind of how you make your career.  That's how you make your money.  And people expect that, you know, you've you've you've if you've always had ads  on there, people have come to understand that once in a while they're going to have  to have that time where they have to listen to a little ad  or they can fast forward and go through it.  But that's expected to suddenly interject ads into tweets  where you're not normally used to seeing them, I think would be really  kind of misleading to my readers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that was it felt wrong to me and I couldn't pinpoint why.  And and I think it is there's a you do have a contract, unwritten contract  when you blog or when you Twitter that this is going to be my thoughts.  And when this ad comes in there, it's like, well, wait a minute.  Somebody you're selling out.  I don't think it's about I don't think it's about us doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's the I think it's about the people.  It's like the same people on YouTube who are making kind of content  distribution partnerships with YouTube.  I think it's about it's not about necessarily the person with them  with two or three million followers doing it.  I think it's about people who are building a reputation on Twitter  or who are just kind of on Twitter goofing off and then feel like  I might as well get paid for throwing these ads in once in a while.  I definitely think that for us to do it would just be weird  and also kind of sleazy because we already get paid for the brands  that we've built.  And part of our Twitter outreach is to continue to build that brand  and also like make friends, you know, on Twitter.  I don't I don't look at Facebook.  I think for like us to do, if that makes any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, this and this bothers me less than an inline Twitter ad, by the way.  But Facebook will do is take your aim unless you tell them not to.  And the default is on that you that you can do this.  So I go to I'm going to my page.  Molly Wood has just bought.  I don't know, just you just bought got a new mortgage on your house  from a mortgage lender.  I go to my page. Molly's a friend of mine.  Molly's picture shows up on Facebook on the right saying  Molly just got a loan from XYZ lender. Why don't you?  Yeah, they're beacon thing. That's beacon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I'm not even getting paid for that.  I'm just saying that that idea thing seems way better than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very bugs me.  And by the way, I immediately went to my Facebook settings and said,  you can't do that.  But at least it's in an ad column.  You know, it's an ad, right?  But it does feel like Molly would somehow had some some hand in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, to any extent, we're getting in a Twitter hole again, as usual.  I know. Anything else to talk about.  All right. I got one for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is this this just in and I thank Dr.  Mom in our chat room.  Trim has just gone out of business.  You know, Trim Tr dot I am.  This is a internet shortening service.  Trim is now in the process of discontinuing service.  Effective immediately.  Trim links will continue to redirect.  Did Bitly put him out of business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's of course they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says there's no way for us to monetize URL shortening.  Users won't pay for it.  And we just can't develop justify further development  since Twitter has all but anointed Bitly in the market winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How is Bitly and Tiny making their money?  Oh, please. That is just bitter cakes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't be such babies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My God. Oh, Twitter decided it's Bitly.  We quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Twitter previously anointed Tiny URL.  So maybe you could have just come in and done a better job.  Like Billy did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's my point, though.  Good riddance, Trim.  This is this is maybe this ties into the previous message,  which is we get a lot of stuff free on the net.  A lot of people putting a lot of effort, a lot of time spending a lot of money.  If there's no way to monetize, they're going to this is they're all  going to start going away like Trim did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. That was a crowded market.  That whole URL shortening thing was taken off.  I mean, like hotcakes, it was that was the thing to do.  But nobody had figured out how to monetize it.  Bitly is maybe the closest because they're doing some data collection.  They're becoming a search engine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They did the right thing, which is their search in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They innovated exactly like I'm sorry that Trim didn't.  But come on, there are 50 million URL shorteners out there.  And if you don't have a good, unique proposition, then bye.  Yeah. Yeah, I like Bitly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I use Bitly, too, because of the stats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then seeing the stats, what really is going to become valuable?  You know, it's funny because Delicious, which which was there  before anybody else and really had the opportunity to monetize this,  didn't really Yahoo once again drops the ball.  But the value and the way you can make money on this is the way Google  makes money on its search.  Bitly search.  Bitly has a ton of information about links, about who clicks on about  about their relative merits.  They know more than Dig does about some of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the whole like you are you are shortening thing  does make me a little bit nervous, though, because even though Trim says  all the redirects will continue to work, what if suddenly they don't?  I mean, a lot of people are depending on these to, you know, send information  around and use them as permanent links to things.  And if all that breaks down all of a sudden, what are we?  We've got a bunch of broken URLs all over the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they have to be used the way I think you have to use these  shortener services simply as throw away stuff.  If you use them as permalink stuff, you're going to hang on to for a long, long time.  Bad idea. And I don't care who it is.  Tiny URL, Bitly, whoever.  You got to use that for Twitter, get people stuff quick and be done with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Ken Sheverson. There were times there were times when tiny URL would go down  and when Bitly have they've gone down in the past, I think.  And, you know, that's a big issue on Twitter.  But, you know, using those as permalinks is probably a very,  very bad idea for the long run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And don't forget the security issue because you're hiding this  the link that you're going to.  And I'm sure that that's a huge problem with people using shorteners  to hide the fact that you're going to a bad site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I think that I think URL shorteners and Facebook and Twitter specifically  are encouraging really unsafe behavior on the web.  It's like click on anything.  And Facebook is all about, you know, sending you emails that are like,  click on this and add an app. OK, click.  And then URLs that you don't know what they are.  I mean, it's unfathomable to be in some ways in this day and age  that we're just clicking on links left and right.  We have no clue what's at the other end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish there was some kind of preview like like a mouse  over preview, like there are browsers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And FriendFeed does that. FriendFeed expands them.  If you use Power Twitter, it does.  And I would imagine that a lot of the Twitter clients do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure Tiny URL lets you create a preview version so that you click  and then you get to a landing page where you see a preview of that link.  But Bitly doesn't that I know of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People send me bitly links all the time, and I just don't click on them  because you never know.  So unless there's someone I trust or it has a really good description  that I've seen floating around, then I will.  But otherwise, I just don't mess with it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why they work on Twitter well, because you've got people you trust,  first of all, and second of all, you it's killing the hundred  and forty K character problem.  So you have both those things solved and it's a great solution.  But in every other way, I'm terrified of those links.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So a couple of a couple of that stuff on the Internet.  Patent stories in the news.  Twitter is being sued by a company called Iris,  Immediate Response Information Systems, saying, no, we invented that.  I'll read Iris's description.  You tell me if this is Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a Twitter conversation again, by the way.  Here we go. Drink.  I do this again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I could do a different one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's fine. No, it's fine.  The patent system is broken.  I mean, it's kind of stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't know. Let's hear this, though.  I think Iris might have a case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Iris is Techradium's flagship emergency response  mass notification communication service.  Iris simultaneously delivers uniform, reliable  and verifiable emergency messages to an unlimited number of contacts  within seconds across all means and devices of communication.  Iris will confirm contact has been made and verified by the system.  So it's not it's not a microblogging system.  They call it a mass notification system.  But texting.  But texting to groups.  Right. Yeah.  Now, for many different medium, one of the things that's key to this is,  I think, to Twitter is follow, right?  That the act of following.  And I don't know if this involves that.  It's the other way.  Would you subscribe? Maybe you would subscribe.  You'd subscribe to it, right?  Maybe you would probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it would be following.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you would subscribe.  You would become part of the group, right?  That wanted to receive the emergency broadcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sounds kind of ominous.  Simultaneously deliver uniform, reliable and verifiable emergency  messages to an unlimited number of contacts within seconds across all means  and devices of communication.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it seems to fail an obvious test.  But yeah, in terms of, you know, as it's written and depending on when it was granted,  could be problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's one that really is, you're right, the bottom line,  and there's nothing to say, patent system broken.  A company called Volo Media says they invented podcasting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's just too broad.  I mean, they really have to learn to.  I mean, we've had we've had this discussion a million times, Molly,  and buzz out loud in the past year over over patent disputes.  And what it comes down to all the time is that people just put out these super  broad patents and then, you know, they expect it to like umbrella over all these  different ideas. And it's just it's not specific enough.  And there's always going to be problems like this going forward.  And these frivolous lawsuits and patent problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And remember when British telecoms said we invented hyperlinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Well, and in Volo Media's case, like they definitely  filed this patent a really long time ago, the original version.  But then they amended it later to basically what the hell took them so long.  Technology that was specifically podcasting.  So then it's like, well, how can you after that, after a ton of prior  art has already been established, how can you go back and amend  a patent filing to include all of that stuff?  It just seems absolutely ridiculous that that patent should be granted at all.  But since it was, there's no question that podcasting is in trouble from Volo Media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Molly, talking about patent law is one of my favorite things on Earth.  That's why I love it. I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know it gets me all hot. It is crazy hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you ever consider a legal career, Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I often think about going to law school, actually often.  I think you would be awesome. Yeah, that's my total.  Like I won the lottery and I'm just going to do a thing.  I know that it seems like that shouldn't be like a lottery dream, but boom,  intellectual property law. I would love to do IP law.  Yeah, I think I would really love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd be great. Holy crap.  I would not want to square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, she'd be an incredible advocate, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe I'll start going to night school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you got you know, you got plenty of time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, some lawyer like call me or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then, you know, it's too bad you can't apprentice.  Remember, that's how you would learn something.  You wouldn't go to school. You'd be an apprentice.  You should apprentice to a lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want to take like a whole bunch of classes and then all of a sudden be a lawyer.  I don't know. Can you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bar exam. No bar. Nothing like that.  Bar exam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll take that. You can't call yourself a lawyer until you pass the bar exam.  She'll pass. Yeah, she's not scared of tests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I ain't scared. I ain't scared.  I hate tests. I ain't scared of your tests.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would you do patent law?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What would I like?  Would I do? Yeah, I would do patent law.  I actually think that I sure had a trademark.  I would do the heck out of that.  I am definitely I am much more interested in intellectual property law  specifically, like the kind of the First Amendment stuff, the the infringe,  you know, the intellectual property infringement.  And I guess that would get into patent and trademark law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I think it'd be fascinating.  I think you're fighting unfair patents. Awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're absolutely right.  I think you should have been around in the 60s.  That's what I think. That's my second career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Being around in the 60s is your second career.  Oh, really? Interesting. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was like, no, it's a lot of school.  You could be like Ari Gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could be an agent. Way too much school.  Hug it out, bitch. You could be an agent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, stay in school, kids.  Say yes, kids.  Lots of school for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you graduate? You graduated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Me? Yeah, yeah. I didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did. I didn't.  And that's why my career has gone to hell in a hand basket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I noticed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I only had that BA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Learn from doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Be cool. Stay in school.  I'm talking to Andrew, my my my nephew, who's your student at Cal Poly in engineering.  Yeah. Be cool. Stay in school.  That's right. Yeah.  He's going with it.  Meanwhile, back at Squarespace, let's take a break.  And see, this is what I do.  I try to make it very clear that was content.  This is an ad, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was a good job. You did a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is an ad. This is the ad portion of the show.  And then I, you know, I I say we'll be right back after this word.  I don't. I don't know.  From yourself. From myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just like Isaiah does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing. I mean, I had to say I had to pull back and say,  I guess it isn't that different.  Oh, no, she didn't.  Oh, yes, she did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody has to come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody has to. Right.  We can't be all in agreement all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Can you do that head thing? I'm trying to do.  I can't do that head thing.  Oh, no, you didn't. Nice.  Oh, she's got it.  Oh, baby.  For those of you not watching at home, Molly Wood got it.  Any of you use Squarespace?

I thought you guys were just talking smack, but I, you know,  you're just running the line, but I actually, you know, got it.  I went there and got a name and I went, Leo's not kidding around.  This is actually pretty sweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The idea of Squarespace is it's a hosting service.  So you get it.  I don't even want to say it's like a blog service.  It's a hosting service.  But they but they're but running on that hosting service is the most amazing  website software you've ever used.  I mean, these guys are brilliant designers and programmers  who've decided just to make it easier to set up and host a website.  It could be any kind of website.  They they have an iPhone app.  They have social integration with YouTube, Twitter, Digg,  StumbleUpon, Flickr.  You've got it's great for photo galleries.  Amazing templates.  But even better, once you get the template in there,  the way you can customize it with Ajax, you know, you just drag  and move margins around amazing stats,  form building, data collection.  And look, if you're already on another platform, if you're using WordPress  or if you're using TypePad or Blogger  or movable type, they'll import and export right out of it.  So that's important, by the way, you're not stuck there.  You can import it, you could try and you can export it out  if you decide to go elsewhere.  So you're never trapped inside of Squarespace free for 14 days.  You'll be started in 30 seconds with no credit card  when you go to Squarespace dot com slash twit.  So it's very simple to just try it.  No reason not to.  If you stick around, by the way, use the coupon code twit  and you'll get 20 percent off your your new account.  So Squarespace, remember the name Squarespace dot com  slash twit.  If you want to find out more, they say smarter publishing.  It's just amazing.  And they're they're really a great company to really nice guys.  Dane Atkinson and Anthony Casalina and the gang.  Just really nice.  Good. I'm glad you're I'm glad you're giving it a try, Scott.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like it was like Star Trek, the new Star Trek.  Remember, there was all those solar sun flares all the time.  Yeah, I just tell.  I asked them about that.  They said they did that on purpose.  That they overdid it.  They overdid it.  I'm with you, Scott.  I thought they did it way too much.  It was like, oh, my eyes.  Yeah, I was out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what they were thinking, but I and it was kind of cool  like once in a while, but every shot was something  with gleaning off something else.  It's like, holy crap.  Please. And it's all CG in outer space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So yeah, well, it's true.  There is there's quite a bit, but it's all CG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're consciously doing it in space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can see the gleam.  OK, I'm sorry.  I'm really sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have we gotten over Battlestar Galactica?  We kind of gotten over the grief in all of that.  I miss it.  I'm so mad.  Still, oh, you're mad.  You didn't like the end, did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I am angry.  I didn't like the end either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't love the end.  I didn't hate it, but I just missed the show in general.  I miss sort of the hard edge sci fi sort of thing going on.  I really hope they can do that.  Caprica and whatever.  Oh, yeah, I won't spoil it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, what's the deal with Caprica?  It went straight to DVD or something like that?  Or is it actually going to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they sent out they put out the first the pilot episode.  And it's coming out.  It's on my Roku.  Released it on like iTunes and other stuff.  And then it's going to air on TV, I think.  And then they're going to, you know, start the actual series.  Oh, good. OK. Well, that'll be something.  I like they did with Glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, here this this just in from Shelter Watch.  There's an online law school which allows you to sit for the bar for three  thousand dollars plus per year.  There's another law school which meets only Monday through Thursday at night  only for people want to have a law degree for nonprofits.  It's called the People's Law School.  Five thousand dollars a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Interesting. So you can thank you for three thousand a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can get a a bar, you know, be ready for the bar exam  and five thousand a year, Monday through Thursday at night.  Nonprofit. Thank you. Shelter Watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know that's really cool.  I like the idea of the nonprofit one. That's pretty interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Would it be neat if after this show, Molly becomes a lawyer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I became a lawyer.  Yeah, it was the one that like picked it off. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we have a name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Molly is the day.  Molly becomes a lawyer on a very special twit.  Magistrate. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Barrister. I'm in the white wing.  Yes, I am. Barrister Wood for the defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sony is going to the bar after this show, just a different one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't need to spend three thousand a year to pass that bar.  I have a big tab.  Hey, you had a good party, by the way, Ryan Block, Peter Rojas.  You hosted, I know, Veronica for GDGT.  We got some great video made a little movie of it.  It looked like it was a lot of fun. That went well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was so fun. Colleen was there. We missed you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Colleen and Dane went. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was a lot of fun. We had a line around the block.  We had a lot of people showing off new gadgets.  The Zune HD was there for the first time in public, and it looks amazing.  Amazing. It makes me kind of wish I had a Zune. Really?  Yeah. Bell was going.  No, no. I know.  No Mac software yet, but maybe someday.  I'm a little until then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a little perturbed by the fact that they imply that it's an HD screen and it's not

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the video, the content on it is HD, though, right?  It plays HD. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it plays it, but doesn't play in high def.  You know, it has.  So you could put 720p on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really good, though.  I mean, if you can tell the difference between what that display shows and like HD,  then I don't think you'd really have much of a complaint because it's basic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The purpose of having the 720p content, I assume, is so you can plug it into a TV  and really see it in HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you can. There's output to TV and it looks really good, too.  So I'm kind of jealous.  I have a little bit of Zune envy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We can get you a Windows machine.  All you need is a Mac software and we're ready to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do have my gaming PC and I guess I could do that way.  But then all my all my media is like iTunes stuff.  I do have some MP3s that I do from eMusic, but I'm lazy.  I just buy things on iTunes. I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're telling us you have a giant DRM content collection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do. I do. Old school.  I buy everything on iTunes plus now, so it's not.  But, you know, back in the day, a big part of my library is still all DRM to heck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. I know. Blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Blah, blah, blah, blah. Me girl.  We tried so hard to. I told you I'm exceedingly lazy. Exceedingly lazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's just it's too easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scott, you and I, let's just sit over here in the corner.  We'll let them.  Yeah, we'll let them. Everyone's going to give me crap now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know. God darn it. I shouldn't have said anything.  There you are.  A little dark, deep, dark secrets that I buy things off of iTunes sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The entire point of Buzz Out Loud podcast is nonstop anti DRM screen.  And then we find out that our most famous alum, Veronica, is like,  oh, yeah, I'm just sitting on tons of protected AAC.  I didn't have the choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's like it's like, you know, when I see stuff, I'm like,  I'm just going to hit it. It's like impulse buys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're hurting my heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they've mastered that.  They're good at that. And that's why you do it.  Exactly. It's so fun and so awesome that you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then later, but you're justified now because they've dropped the DRM.  So it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We all have our vices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, now we know Veronica is a secret booze hound and DRM lover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, secret.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  DRM lover. You're a DRM lover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dr. M. Dr. M.  DRM lover.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My secret love affair with Dr. M.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mm hmm.  Oh, here's some news on Caprica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, thank you, Tatroom.  They're good. They're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm standing by one foot now while I wait for this news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Caprica starts according to Ken Sheppardson, January 22nd, 2010, on Cifi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cifi.  Cifi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the story with Cifi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like I like it better if I pretend it's French.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What the hell's wrong with them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, they their whole their whole thing was that sci fi was too general.  Like it didn't have. Oh, so Cifi is not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it was too specific.  It was too specifically sci fi.  Like they wanted to be able to branch out into other original content.  I think like, yeah, that's what I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now they could do what? Sufi stories?  What does Cifi mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Cifi would be like a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hold on, though. I got a theory.  I mean, as a Cifi, I will speak for the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I'll speak for the Cartoonist Guild of the Internet  and say that that gave us really great joke opportunities.  I'm grateful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, well, there's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't it like a swear word in a different language?  Yeah, I mean, terrible. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What is it in Polish?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I think it's bad to say over Twitter.  I can't remember, though. Oh, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was thinking of rebranding Twitter, you know, because of all this Twitter stuff.  Twitter pick and Twitter stuff.  Yeah. So maybe I should like T.W.Y.T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Let's talk about the shack for a second here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The shack. The shack.  I love it.  What the heck are they thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What is wrong with people?  Is there a I think there's a renegade branding company  that's going around talking executives and doing stupid things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the shack is kind of cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You like the shack? Oh, God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you serious? It's like the hunt.  It sounds like somewhere.  It is like a hunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sounds like somewhere you'd go within your woody.  What? What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What? No, it does kind of.  Yeah, like a dark bar, like record stores.  Yeah.  Leo, I knew you like technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a station wagon with wooden sides on it.  You young people today, you're so dirty minded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Get off my lawn.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really? They call that a woody?  That's awesome. My grandpa had a woody.  Yeah, they're country squires.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, they have a wood on the side.  They're called woody's.  And somewhere the shack sounds like somewhere you'd go,  you know, in the woody with your best girl to get a pop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it does kind of.  That's the problem is that even though I think the shack is not  it's an OK name kind of, but it doesn't say anything about electronics.  That's the point.  I didn't want to say radio so blatantly, just like general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What about the Sifi shack?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The Sifi shack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The Sifi shack.  They took out all the important words from the name.  They should have called themselves pizza.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's a good point.  Totally.  Because, OK, radio is bad, but shack is worse.  Yeah.  Shack is dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the relevant words are gone.  Unless it's S-H-A-Q and the basketball player is there.  And then then you have a store.  Now is the real shack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, there's a two hour pilot of Caprica.  That's what they've put out.  And now and then they're going to be 18 one hour episodes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Eric Stoltz.  Do you really want to buy something from place that calls itself the shack?  Like how technologically advanced can a shack be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you want to buy something from radio shack to my big concern is that  as they try to rebrand, they're going to try to become a more general  electronics store and I consider them basically the ace hardware of electronics  goods like I do not want them to all of a sudden be getting rid of those little  trays of connectors and aux cables and like don't start turning into Best Buy  with all your little netbooks and TVs because I need you for like cables.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The adapters and the things.  Yeah.  I used to run over to radio shack all the time to get stuff for the for the sound  room at Buzz All Out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's but that's where you go because they're everywhere and  and you don't care if it's crap.  You just need it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's utility.  They're like they're a hardware store.  Yeah.  And I think that they I mean, they have done very well with that.  They're still in business when Circuit City and CompUSA are like gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So why adapt for the wind is right.  Sorry, they're saying that in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But then like, why are you going to become Circuit City and CompUSA  when they didn't make it in you?  Radio Shack, the hardware store of electronics goods are still there.  Just be who you are.  Be who you are. Be yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Love yourself. Be Radio Shack.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think they should have stuck with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Flavor should stick with it. I agree.  Great name. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sony is going to boy, this is becoming the e-book.  I think 2009 might be the year of the e-book.  What do you think?  Sony now is a unveiling cheap, small e-books, relatively cheap.  They're going to do a reader pocket edition by the end of this month.  It will have a nine. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah, it's still 200 bucks.  It's not that cheap for a single purpose.  And a Kindle. It's 100 bucks.  But that's all it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Five inch screen. That's not bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't use any of the audio stuff on my Kindle, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think for $199 for a device that has a five inch screen,  why not get some kind of awesome Arcos portable media player?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the screen's not the same to look at for an extended period.  It's hard to read. You could use your iPhone.  It's a big difference between an LCD screen versus a...  Sorry, LCD. You know what I mean.  Versus an E-Ink screen, which is so much easier on the eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I agree. I just think if I want an E-Ink device,  that I want it to be like book size.  I don't really understand the idea of the reader.  I don't understand the idea of an E-Ink device  that's smaller than a paperback even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it should be kind of paperback size, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I just feel like at that point, then I'm more compelled  to get an all-in-one electronics device  as opposed to just a little single use thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Important thing to note, too,  neither of these two devices from Sony are going to launch with 3G,  sort of the thing that really makes the Kindle attractive.  Yeah, you have to connect them to your computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  Can you imagine?  Oh, my God.  It's a big deal when you're traveling.  Oh, I agree. I totally agree. I'm not being sarcastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on, how often, though? I mean, how many books?  Dark ages.  How often?  Yeah, do you put a new book on every day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  At least probably one or two a week, yeah.  Really? Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and you know what? Almost all of it is left.  For a drunk, you read a lot.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you go through two books a week? That's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe not two books, but I download things.  I don't read them that fast, but I save them for later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, and that's where Amazon has the marketing skill  because it makes us, again, it's point of access.  So easy to buy a book on the Kindle.  Yeah, they have this three times selection that they do on...  Yeah, it's so easy to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you just pull them up and bam, there they are.  And if the app store wasn't so convenient on the bus,  you probably wouldn't see as many apps, in my opinion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Almost every book I've ever bought on the Kindle  has been a total impulse purchase,  which means that it was nowhere near my computer.  It was like, it was, you know, after a giant beer  and somebody could talk me into buying Infinite Jess.  Like, really? Oh. Did you read it?  Did you read it?  I just, it would just happen like three days ago.  I guess I'm going to have to read it now  because that's $10 I can never get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've been trying to read that book for eight years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. God, how embarrassing.  Now I'm that person too with Infinite Jess on my Kindle.  Ha ha ha ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I look like such a jerk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I, I think that that's where the Kindle is really good  because that Infinite Jess was a thick book, right?  It's huge. Yeah, it's huge. Gigantic.  So, but you can have it on your Kindle.  You get all the value of having carrying the book around  without actually having to carry the book around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Or reading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I look like a big jerk when anybody looks at my Kindle.  Or reading it. You don't even have to read it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you get the New Yorker and the Fed.  Oh, you get the New Yorker and the Fed.  Are books are okay, Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You don't just use Google Book Search?  Oh, Smackdown. Oh.  Oh, no, you didn't.  Touche.  But Cameron gave me the idea.  That was not my idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, still.  But he was right.  Snap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boom goes the dynamite.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Point Veronica slash that dude in the tower.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are we going to rename Amazon?  The Zon?  The Zon. Ammo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ammo. Ammo.  Ammo. Ammo.  Or maybe it's the same.  You just spell it with dumb letters.  That's all anyone else is doing.  Just spell it wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So here's a job you don't want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, only weirdos do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This even when you get your law degree, Molly,  do not become the White House Cybersecurity Czar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the worst job in the world, apparently, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Melissa Hathaway.  Quit.  She, she, she was the leading contender for the position,  according to The Wall Street Journal.  She said, can you take my name off?  I don't want the job.  And she's also resigned her position in the Obama White House.  She was leading the 60 day review of government wide cyber security preparedness.  Do you think she said, took one look and said, it's such a mess.  There's no way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's like, I'm out of here.  She was like, not possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  I have the sense, I have to say.  So Anish Chopra was in town.  Everybody knows now like rock star.  And I really had the sense after his talks and after he came on Buzz Out Loud that  they're kind of front loading technology related personnel in the White House.  But it's not entirely clear what the differences in all their jobs are.  And and I have the sense that maybe that whole cyber security thing is kind of just  a weird unfunded mandate and that it's the kind of terrible job where, you know,  there's a lot of pressure, but maybe no clear idea what you're supposed to do or  how you're supposed to get it done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thirty people are rumored to have been offered and refused.  Oh, my gosh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What other White House positions have 30 offers that people turn down?  That's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And who is turning down offers to work in the Obama White House?  I mean, people are so like desperate to do that.  But that one job, whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the reason is that they made a political concession on this that the cyber  czar would be beholden to both the National Security Council and the National  Economic Council.  So you have kind of two masters and to Anish Chopra, the CTO and to the chief  information. So you got four bosses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's kind of unclear what the differences in all those jobs are anyway.  Like it is a mess up in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You feel like they're like token positions.  They're not they've got really no authority.  They're there to say, hey, look how open and technology minded we are as an  administration. And that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe like I'm thinking that Anish Chopra has about six months to really hit  people with some specifics.  Otherwise, it's going to look like that's a little bit of a PR job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tell us about him.  Did you get a chance to talk to him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I did. Yeah. I mean, he's a really he's a really nice guy.  I get the sense that he is legitimately interested in technology.  He really wants to. He came on Buzz out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's impressive. He came on Buzz out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's like he's like a fan of the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He talked to Scoble. I mean, he even knew who Scoble was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Like I think he is kind of a legit tech guy.  I don't I really don't.  And we asked him and then he talked about it in his speech later at the  Computer History Museum.  What is your job and how is it different from the CIO and the cyber czar?  And frankly, to me, I know I still don't know.  I still don't know what his job is.  I don't know what the difference is.  We can be more confused.  Yeah. And it was just like, oh, you guys need to maybe  you might be a little top heavy in the cyber department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is your job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is your job?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it was like, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do this, that like really nice guy.  Not sure what he does or what he's supposed to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When the windows doesn't work, I come over and I bang on the box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that's the CIO, but that's not him.  Like, it's just, you know, a lot of those things were like, well,  that's kind of the CIO, but maybe that's the cyber czar.  But then that's sort of me.  But then it's like, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He seems qualified to do things.  He's smart guy. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he might just go in there and talk about technology things.  I must be it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So he's just I don't want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't I mean, this is an important thing.  I mean, the next war will be a cyber war for sure.  Look what, you know, I mean, look at Russia did to this poor blogger.  One guy.  I mean, this is not this is not a throw away position.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  I so whatever it is that's causing people to walk away from that cyber czar position,  I hope that with this woman leaving and saying hell no to the job,  that they are going to that they're going to restructure.  Because you're right, it is really important.  And clearly they have it just kind of not not structured right in a management way.  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, Americans, stand by for commercial.  We're going to come back in just a second.  I want to talk about Rupert Murdoch.  He's the new he's the crazy of the week  and a new feature on the show, the crazy of the week.  But first, a word from audible dot com.  The folks who do those great audio books that, yes, they have DRM on them.  It's not their fault.  It is it is very easy when you buy a book, it's yours forever.  You can go back to the site and download it again and again.  They play on hundreds of different devices, your iPod, your Zune,  your iPhone, they play everywhere you go.  I mean, I have to say audible to me, audible is really straightforward  and not a problem in any way.  I just listen to it all over the place.  It even plays on your Kindle, which is kind of cool.  So if you want to have a book on your Kindle.  And let me just check and see if infinite jest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you could read a lot.  Oh, stop. Oh, how embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How long would that be, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you let's do let's just have an infinite jest book group internet.  Let's do that. You all get it on your on your audible and I'll have it on my Kindle.  And then we'll just kind of we'll spend like three years trying to read it.  And then we'll all give up together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It'll be great. You're making me want to read it.  It's actually a very good book, but it's just telling you, let's read it together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll be great. All right.  Someone else can be in charge of reading the footnotes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On audio, audio books are a really good way to  read books like that, that you just can't get through.  You know, if you have you seen Julia and Julia yet?  Oh, I want to see. Oh, you saw it.  I want to. You didn't see it, Molly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought Molly said no, not yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really wonderful book.  If you want to read the book before you see the movie, I highly recommend it.  Of course, it's a new movie, but you can read the book is by Julie Powell.  365 days, 524 recipes, one tiny apartment kitchen.  This is a true story.  She decided to make every recipe in Julia Child's The Joy of French Cooking.  That's what the movie's about.  And of course, Meryl Streep plays Julia Child in the movie.  But what a wonderful book.  Highly recommended. You can get it at audible.com.  I like before I see a movie, I often like to read the book just in case,  just in case the movie is not so good.  I don't want it to spoil the book.  So read the book first and you can read it right now.  Absolutely free by going to audible.com slash twit to.  In fact, I'm going to give you two books.  They don't have infinite. Jess, I just checked.  Not enough room on their servers. Probably not.  Probably not. But you can pick another great cooking book or great thriller sci fi.  I know before you pick books on the sword and laser, you often listen.  In fact, that game of Thrones is available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just reading right now a book called The Beekeeper's Apprentice  on Audible, I guess, listening to not reading.  But it's all about a girl that meets up with Sherlock Holmes in his later life  and becomes like his. It's really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that sounds great. All right.  We got two books, Julie and Julia and The Beekeeper's Apprentice by Laurie R.  King. Oh, that sounds really good.  Is that going to be on sword and laser or you just reading it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm just reading it for fun or listening to it for fun.  Audible. Is that the right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always have said reading when it's an audible book,  because I feel like I can't think of another way to put it.  You're reading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dvorak gives me a hard time.  It's every word that would be in the book.  It's as if when your mother reads out loud to you, is she reading?  Yes. You're reading you the book. You're reading the book with her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can I make a recommendation for dudes?  So because you got these two books, those were chick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's not a chicky book.  It's a frickin Sherlock Holmes book. Yeah.  Lady and the Lady.  Just has a woman in it that doesn't make it a chick book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just saying everybody should go to audible and they should get the Dark  Tower series, specifically Book One, The Gunslinger by Stephen King,  read by Steve or what's his name?  Gwydel, George Gwydel.  Oh, George Gwydel is one of their best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I read those books far too young, I think those I read them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I messed up my head.  Oh, really? I read them within the last three or four years  and I listened to all of them, actually.  I think that they were all audible books for me.  And that guy who reads, especially The Gunslinger.  Oh, it is just wonderful.  What a great series that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll play a little bit of it so you can hear his voice.  George Gwydel is one of their best readers.  I've listened to so many books that he's read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So was the horn he had once carried.  Gone for years, American Gods said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spilled from the hand of a dying friend.  Go then, there are other worlds than these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he missed them both.  He breasted a gently rising dune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is absolutely the best guy to read this book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, God, I know that book particularly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Any book, any book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I also read a good collection on Audible lately.  What was it called?  My Supernatural Wedding.  It's a collection of all different sci-fi and fantasy writers.  With like, it's like all the common theme is like weddings  and there's like werewolves and vampires  and all this really funny stuff.  My Big Fat Supernatural Wedding.  My Big Fat Supernatural Wedding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love the idea.

We thank them so much for their support.  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, Hodgman's new book is on Audible now too.  Oh, the new one is?  Yeah, because the old one was.  Yeah, more information than you require.  It just came up recently, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, the first one's the Aries of My Expertise,  which is great.  Does he read more and more?  Him and Colton do it again, I think.  I heard they were doing it together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, is Colton in it too?  I haven't listened to it yet.  Oh, man.  Good, that was so much awesome.  So full of awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When he sings the hairy old lobster song.  I just love that.  Well, you see, this has got to get into it.  Audible.com slash twit two.  We thank them so much for their support.  Lots of great stuff.  I asked John Hodgman to...  I'm gonna be doing a keynote at Macworld.  The one that David Pogue did, the Macworld Live keynote,  which is kind of like a tonight show.  In fact, I'd love you guys to be on it.  Not you, Molly, because you hate the Mac.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I frankly think that makes it more hilarious.  You should come on, actually.  You could come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll be your counterpoint.  Do a rant.  Oh, I know, you could be like Ed McMahon,  except instead of laughing, you could snort at everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll just come and be the PC.  But don't die.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ha!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I asked John to come on, but now he's speaking  at this thing called, I don't know, TED, something like that.  So he couldn't do it.  Some little dog in portico.  A little show you may have heard of.  He was good.  If you've not seen his TED Talk from last time.  That's awesome.  It's so funny.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God, is he brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So talking about crazy loons, our loon of the week,  Mr. Rupert Murdoch, who has told analysts  in a conference call after releasing such crappy results  for News Corp that some people wondered  if he could even survive.  Murdoch said, the digital revolution has opened  many new and inexpensive methods of distribution,  but it has not made content free.  Accordingly, we intend to charge for all our news websites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if any guy was gonna say it,  it would be Rupert Murdoch, right?  The one guy who has made money off of charging  for a news website.  The Wall Street Journal website has been behind the paywall  since the beginning of time, despite, you know,  howls of protest and makes money.  And financial times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And financial times.  But Jeff Jarvis pointed out yesterday  on our This Week in Google show,  those sites make people money, right?  Cause they're financial sites.  And the other thing he said is,  and by the way, the boss usually pays for it.  It's a business expense or your company pays for it.  Can you really get somebody to pay for the Sun  or the Daily Telegraph?  Probably not.  The New York Post.  Somebody's not gonna pay money to see the New York Post.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The journal's just different people.  I mean, it's just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Journal people have to have it.  They gotta have their fix and they'll pay for it.  I pay for the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes I wonder why. I pay for the Wall Street Journal.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I pay for the website too.  I mean, I think that I do agree.  I think it's a totally different kind of content.  And I think that he must be bluffing or he plans to,  cause the problem is taking something that was free  and making it for pay.  The Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times  have been paid long enough that no one,  it's not ever, you cannot transition a free product  to a pay product.  I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're right.  He says the extended downturn has only increased  the drum beat for change.  We're going broke in other words.  Quality journalism is not cheap  and an industry that gives away its content  is simply cannibalizing its ability to produce good reporting.  That's why we give away all these podcasts.  We believe in cannibalizing good reporting.  The increase we've seen in our Wall Street Journal  subscription proves to me the market is willing  to pay for that quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, then he's assuming that he's offering the quality.  Like if he's gonna say, okay, these are the 100 things  that we're gonna do to make the sun absolutely phenomenal  and so much, head and shoulders better  than any other subscription or any other newspaper  that you will just be compelled to pay for it,  then that's one thing, but you can't just say like,  hey, you know that water that used to come out of the tap?  Now it's like nine times more.  Yeah.  But it's the same water, like what?  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's a very good way to put it.  I think you're absolutely right.  You can't backtrack.  You can't start, I couldn't start charging for Twitter.  Everybody'd laugh at me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't Rupert around 100 years old now anyway?  I mean, isn't he about to change?  The whole thing's gonna change hands  in the next couple of years.  He doesn't really care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there still is the open question, right?  Like what are they gonna do?  What are they gonna do?  What are they gonna do?  Journalism is expensive.  I mean, he's right about the one thing.  Good journalism is expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, another thing Jeff was talking about yesterday,  I just love his take on journalism,  is that there are at least a few now,  maybe more than a handful of journalism blogs  that are making over 200,000 a year.  These individual bloggers, it is absolutely possible  to make a living as a journalist online if you do it right.  Huffington Post says we're gonna spend  a million point two a year on investigative journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and I guess here's the question, right?  Is actually when Murdoch says good journalism is expensive,  he's talking about the New York Times idea of journalism,  the idea that you have to have a bureau in every country,  that you're sending reporters all over the world,  and that any other form of journalism is not good.  But the fact is, like maybe the distributed journalism model  is how you do it.  And it's actually better because you have boots  on the ground that aren't outsiders, that aren't Americans.  You know, you have boots on the ground  in Baghdad that are Iraqis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, who's to say that isn't better  than a single organization that owns all the news,  which is kind of what he's saying,  that's what he wants to be,  the one guy that owns everything  and that's the only way to get quality, I call crap.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't crap on that.  Crap on that, yeah.  I crap on that, or say that that's crap.  I mean, I definitely, I really like good editorial,  and I'm willing to pay for that kind of thing.  I have magazines that I subscribe to  because I like getting that information first  before it goes online.  And you know, it definitely depends though.  I don't want to pay for just my everyday news though.  I don't think that would be something  that I would put money into  because it's going to trickle down  through other methods eventually.  I'm going to see it in blogs and I'm going to see reprints.  So I don't know.  I don't know what the answer is,  but I don't think it's that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think what's going to happen, no,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure it's troubling because we, you know,  we don't want the newspaper to go away, but it is.  And we don't want journalism to go away, but it's changing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is changing.  And it's sort of, it is exactly like,  I don't know what I want, but I know it's not you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like, yeah, I'm stuck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's all right.  I think we're reinventing it.  I think you're reinventing it.  I think everybody who's working in this space  is trying very hard and cares very much about journalism,  about information, about telling the truth, about integrity.  I think that it'll work itself out, I really do.  I don't think you're gonna get in a situation  where nobody's covering this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People care about it.  Yeah, I think it's gonna work itself out,  but I think a lot of people are gonna be out of work  and a lot of newspapers are gonna go out of business.  There's just no question that we're in  the really painful period where that is kind of all  that Murdoch has left.  That's the one tool he has in his box,  is to start charging in and see if that works.  And if it doesn't work, he shuts them down.  But at least some of them, I think people will probably pay  for and those ones will stick around.  But it is kind of, it's his last resort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm with you on that.  And it is sad to see that happen in the Times and so forth.  Although I think the Times, I've been very impressed  with the Times attempt to go digital.  It seems to me of all the newspapers out there  really thinking about their digital strategy.  They've made some good applications for reading the Times  on the iPhone and online.  They've doing a lot of podcasts now.  They've got, I think a website, their website's doing  I think 25 million uniques a month.  They're doing pretty well.  I don't know if they're making money.  And I know they're losing money.  But I think they're trying to turn around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can tell when these news organizations  have somebody there who is thinking this way.  And you can tell the ones who don't.  It's too bad, because they need to,  or they're totally out in the dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I want to say what a great panel you have been.  Scott Johnson, I'm so glad we got you on.  MyExtralife.com is his website.  The new podcast is Forecast, F-O-U-R-C-A-S-T.  Is that dot?  It's ForecastPodcast.com.  That's it, ForecastPodcast.com.  But I'm sure you have it linked at MyExtralife.com.  Don't forget the instance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, the instance.  If you play World of Warcraft, what are you doing?  You should be listening to that show.  What are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What are you thinking?  What is wrong with you people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and they can follow me on Twitter,  Twitter.com slash Extra Life.  I always like new friends to talk to, so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Veronica got her first name on Twitter.  She is just at Veronica.  That's how long she's been tweeting.  Yeah, she's an old timer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think I joined in 2000, early 2006.  I think it was when I got on.  Early 2006?  If that makes sense, or relatively.  No, you could have.  I think they.  It's actually, that thing online tells you when you joined.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they started in April 2006, if I remember.  I signed up for my first account in December 2006.  But I looked at it and I said, this is stupid.  And then come back till April 2007, I think, is when I started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did that too.  I think we all did a little bit.  This is dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I heard about it from Tom and Veronica  and thought it sounded dumb until they finally  explained it all the way.  And then I was like, that's awesome.  That's just what I want to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Explained it all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they sort of, yeah, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So maybe I wasn't listening.  Well, we had fun because you and I and Tom  did that novel for a brief period of time.  That was fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was really fun.  I loved doing that.  Turns out writing a book is a lot of work.  Maybe we should pick that up again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's still there, right?  It was novel 140, something like that?  140 novel, I think.  Yeah.  That was really fun.  It got really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It did get really weird.  That's the problem is it got really weird  and nobody knew how to pull out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, I joined on the 24th of October 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're very early.  So my account was deleted.  Very early.  And did you use it from that day on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did.  Well, you were just like a little intern  at Buzz Out Loud at the time, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, you were just like a little bib squeak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, no, I started at CNN in 2004.  So by 2006, I was an employee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember the first time I met Veronica,  you were and I were on TwitMolly in the Apple Store.  Remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, I do remember that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think Tom was on too.  And I don't think Veronica was always on the show.  She was still really kind of the engineer of the Buzz Out Loud.  And she just kind of peeked around the corner.  She was like, I'm Veronica.  It was so cute.  And Leo thought.  I was intimidated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That girl's got potential.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wish I had said that.  I wish I had known.  But obviously, she did.  And Veronica is at Tekzilla.com, also on Core Qore  on the PlayStation 3 network.  And where else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Sword and Laser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sword and Laser podcast she does with Tom Merritt.  If you're into sci-fi, it's a sci-fi book club of the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we're doing a live show at DragonCon this year  in September.  Oh, fun.  It's a week.  That's going to be really, really fun down in Atlanta,  Georgia.  Oh, great.  So I'm really looking forward to that.  And I'm also doing a live Rift Tracks.  I'm hosting a live Rift Tracks event in movie theaters  on August 20.  Really?  And like 400 theaters around the country,  the guys from Mystery Science Theater  are doing a live Rift Tracks performance in theaters.  It's going to be simultaneously cast throughout the country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you know what the movie will be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's Plan 9.  Of course.  What else?  Oh, of course it is.  The original.  And so they're going to show Plan 9.  He is?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they're going to show Plan 9.  And then will they have the guys in the theater seats  in the front row where they're outlined?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, they don't do that.  It's not like that, because they're Rift Tracks now.  They're not Mystery Science Theater anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's going to be really, really fun.  So if there's still tickets available in your area,  check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't know about that.  Is there a website?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it's Fathom Events.  Just go to Rift Tracks.  It's on my blog, too.  I posted about it recently.  VeronicaBellmont.com.  Oh, that is awesome.  .com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That'd be so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  R-I-F-F-T-R-A-X.com.  Correct.  If you go there, they actually have  Thursday, August 20, a one night event in movie theaters  nationwide.  That's cool.  So you can actually that's the wrong page.  There it is.  So you can.  I've frozen the TriCaster.  You can see.  Yeah.  Press your button.  Press your button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Fix it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, go to Rift Tracks.  It's been acting funky today.  I don't know.  It's because you're on.  There we go.  Rift Tracks.com.  Plan 9 from Outer Space.  The worst movie ever made.  Yep.  And funniest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And therefore best.  Because it's awesome.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Molly Wood is soon to be a lawyer in a courtroom near you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  Watch out.  Patent squatters and would be intellectual property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Things.  Dictator types.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bad guys.  People.  CNET.com slash Molly.  That's right.  So what are you doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am.  I'm going crazy on The Buzz Report lately.  I'm trying to turn that into the total daily show of tech news  and really double down on that.  I'm still doing Buzz Out Loud twice a week.  I do the Mailbag Show, which is all just reader feedback  and making fun of grammar.  Yeah, I like that one.  That's like my goof off show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the show you should be on.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then my other goof off show is Gadgets,  which is two women and then Jason Howell, the producer of Buzz  Out Loud, talking about gadgets in really, frankly,  ways you would not expect.  Like we have a whole segment all about vibrators.  That show is great.  Yeah.  Gadgets.cnet.com for a whole other Molly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's nothing wrong with that show.  That show is awesome.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the not at all lawyer type Molly where we make fun of.  You're going to give Leo an aneurysm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to go blots.  But you have nothing to do with the Mollywood parrot rescue  and sanctuary.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not yet.  I think I might have to get involved, though,  and lend my name to him.  I did finally, after a protracted battle,  I have finally won the rights to facebook.com slash Mollywood.  Yay.  So that's very exciting.  And then twitter.com slash Mollywood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So somebody else had facebook.com slash Mollywood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I made a joke about them rolling out their new  personalized URL system on the buzz report.  And I said, yeah, don't take that name because it's mine.  And that's the big problem with the personalized.  And then this kid squatted it and sent me  a note that was like, I did that because you said not to.  I'm sorry to say, I unleashed the internet on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yay.  Yay.  Wapped him upside the head a little bit.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I filed an intellectual property complaint  at Facebook and it worked.  Ironically enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, we had a group on the show, by the way.  I want to mention this on the Floss Weekly Show  called Open Source Maps.  And they said that they want me to mention this on Twitter  and everybody should go help them.  You know, you've seen Google Maps and Yahoo Maps.  The problem with Google Maps and Yahoo Maps  is they use commercial mapping services.  They're very limited in what you could do.  You can't, you know, a lot of iPhone apps  don't use those because they're limited.  So OpenStreetMap.org is a site where  they are creating like Wikipedia.  And they've done an amazing job creating street maps  with the help of people with GPSes and so forth.  So they wanted me to give a plug to OpenStreetMaps  and invite people who would like to volunteer to help them out  to go to OpenStreetMapSingular.org.  And if you look at the Wiki, it'll  tell you how you can help out.  If you've got a GPS or even if you just check your area  and want to name some streets, it's actually quite amazing.  They've really built an amazing series of maps.  And it's very complete, but they sure could use some help.  Open, and they wanted me to give it a plug.  So I'm giving them a little free PSA.  OpenStreetMap.org.  Molly Wood, Veronica Belmont, Scott, what's his name?  Thank you so much for being here.  Thank you so much for being here.  It has been a lot of fun and we'll see you soon, OK?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  Thanks, Leo.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Great.  Take care, everybody.  Another twit.  This is amazing.  It's in the camp.
