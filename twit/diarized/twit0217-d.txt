We've never had so many people in studio, starting with Mr. Jim Louterback.  I turned into Roger Daltrey.  Jim Louterback.  Timmy.  Hey Jim, good to see you from Revision 3.  What is your title?

Transcript:  Yeah, CEO.  Still the CEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, I know.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's cold.  More than two years, I've kind of pulled the wool over their eyes at least so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Still the CEO.  David Spark is here, former PR flack, but now he's rehabilitated.  No, never PR flack.  I'm so sorry.  So David's here because I have to make an apology.  I have to make amends because last week we were talking and then we were talking two  weeks ago we were talking about your great article, was it on Mashable?  Mashable.  About ways people are monetizing.  I think John and I were talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And thank you John for giving me props on the article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're welcome.  What do you say, he called the site Mashies?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I remember it was like Mashamusha, Mashamusha.  He couldn't even put it all together.  Where were you moments ago saying that he's a pro when it comes to broadcasting?  He's an absolute pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look it, let me tell you something, he knew it was Mashable.  He knows exactly what is going on.  Mash potatoes.  John C. Dvorak dot org slash blog, also channel Dvorak dot com.  Great to have you.  He's wearing the Akron nerds sweatshirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's good.  Akron arrows.  Oh arrows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does look like nerds from this.  From this angle.  You know what, I'm going to complain to Skype John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't think it's a Skype issue.  I think it actually is a poor logo is what it is.  I think it's that hot purple issue.  Wait a minute, that voice ladies and gentlemen, you might recognize that voice as the great  Wow.  Who is joining us in studio for the very first time.  Great to have you.  Great to be here, Leo.  Now let me see if I can get all the credits right.  You see him on the Science Channel with the show is called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Popular Sciences Future Of.  It's about the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Mondays at nine.  Science.  He's also the web and politics editor for The Onion and a stand up comic who appears  tonight at the punch line in San Francisco, but normally every week in New York City at  the.  Sage Theater and beautiful Times Square.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did I get it all?  I am the co-founder of Jack and Jill politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know that.  Is that a site?  Political blog.  I love that.  Pimp that too.  I love that.  Why not?  So did I say everybody's name?  I think everybody is here now.  And we also have some audience members who are just here for fun.  Adding a little a little pulchritude to the ensemble.  And let's talk tech.  I want to start with a story that you just mentioned right before we began.  The face that everyone sees when they sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, my wife who has vivid dreams and kind of can go ahead dream and then remember  most of it.  She said she has never seen this face a and she went into her dream and asked everybody  in the dream if they had ever seen this face.  And then nobody.  Everybody said, no, it's bogus.  This whole thing is made up by somebody or other and it's bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The story is that some guy is going to his therapist's office and there's a drawing  on the desk.  Is that how it happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, something like that.  Apparently there's somebody drew this face and this other guy said, well, I've seen that  face and then this guy looked into it and said, apparently these other people have seen  this face too.  So a lot of people are having a dream with this face in it, which looks a lot like David  Spark I might add.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like actually it looks like one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does not look like me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like one of those.  Whoa.  Identikit, identikit faces, you know where they say here.  Paul Schaeffer a little bit here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mitch Patel.  Okay, but I'm asking you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So universal.  It's like a face that's really nondescript.  That's very eyebrows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  He's got big bushy eyebrows.  Narrow lips.  There are top lip kind of a fat lower lip.  You know what it looks like to me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like one of those, you know, wooly, wooly magnetic drawing things.  That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People are just remembering their childhood with wooly wooly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could just move the eyebrows down to the mustache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could spare some hair down there.  Let me, let me, and now everybody's saying it's a hoax.  Well, of course it's not.  What do you think I was proposing that this was actually true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, it's a hoax.  What a discovery.  Oh my goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And you know what?  There was nobody in the balloon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'm shocked to discover gambling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you'll be, I'll be, let me guess though that.  Some lawyers are crooked.  What?  I'm guessing tonight, Baratunde, there'll be a little talk about Falcon the Balloon

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boy.  You know, here's my thing with the Balloon Boy.  I successfully avoided knowing what that story was about for four days.  Me too.  I saw the hashtag.  I was like, I will not click this.  Don't send me links.  And I remained willfully and intelligently ignorant about this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only reason I knew about Balloon Boy is because I happened to be attending the real-time  web summit and we were all talking about it.  Balloon Boy, Balloon Boy.  Let's see what's the latest thing that's going on right now.  It's all Balloon Boy nonsense.  And I was sick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was supposed to be there and I was laid up in my hotel room and I was like, I'm not  clicking.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good for you.  You avoided the whole Balloon Boy contagion.  But you know, I have to say this is, this was an example of I think the online world  doing a much better job than mainstream media of this.  Almost immediately I saw a post saying, well, I've calculated the capacity, the carrying

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  capacity of the Mylar balloon.  Given the amount of square footage in the helium lift capacity, that balloon could only  hold 30 pounds.  There's absolutely no way there's a child in there.  Any idiot would know that.  I love the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love how you do a colossal impression of everybody that posts online.  That's how all nerds sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Neckbeard voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know why I could do that?  Because I've had to get many of these people to come visit our offices.  Now it's Jerry Lewis.  It is turning into JSR.  I like that though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good Jerry Lewis.  It's Professor Frank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Professor Frank, exactly.  All right.  We've covered the two biggest stories of the week and neither of them had anything to do  with tech.  Maybe we can just move on.  Balloons are very high tech.  Balloons are.  Mylar.  It was Mylar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's shiny.  It takes a lot of technology to make a helium balloon that can lift a 30 pound boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A real boy.  I want to be a real boy someday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's the reverse of the boy getting stuck in the well.  That was baby Jessica.  That was baby Jessica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She is the best child suffering victim of all time.  Really?  Yeah.  Oh my God.  Because she got hours.  Days.  Days.  Days of coverage in a well.  We're all compelled by this idea of a child in a well.  It's beautiful.  In fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Four kids should fall in wells.  That became the kind of canonical child loss story.  Anytime the Simpsons they want to mock, TV news reporters, they have them looking down  a well.  It's just kind of like the thing you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although, you know, the mashup of the balloon and the girl down the well could have just  ended that much more quickly.  That would have been awesome.  Send the balloon down the well.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hot.  Why didn't we think of that?  Two negative do make a positive.  Next week on Trending Topics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, balloon boy.  Well, you actually, David, you've been doing a little studying on real time search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, trending topics is a real wasteland on Twitter.  And yet isn't that real time?  I mean, isn't that real time search?  So yeah, I'm happened to be actually writing an analyst report for GigaOM on this very  subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So which is why I brought it up.  I real I'm doing I went to the real time Web Summit and there.  Well, Twitter has its own search.  And they have the trending topic.  By the way, have any of you seen the site?  What the trend dot com?  Yeah, I use I use.  I use.  Yes, obviously.  How do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's quickly typing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been there for three seconds.  It makes sense.  I have known about that for three seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's real time.  Real time.  But every time you go to look at whatever the trending topics are, how can you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  by just the words or the words that you're looking at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not going to say that.  I'm not going to say that.  I'm not going to say that.  I'm not going to say that.  What it is, if you go to the what the trend, it will explain what these things are.  And usually it's a community like everything else with real time Web community adding in  the definitions of what all these.  I use I use Brizley Sameir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, Brizley does that.  That's.  Oh, that's good.  Brizley is a it's funny.  You know, I don't know how this is a business.  It's like, oh, well, this is the Web page we think Twitter should have done.  But it has one of the things it has is if you click on a trending topic, it'll it has  and it's kind of like a wiki.  It explains it.  There's a thing that says next to it.  Why? So here's Balloon Boy.  You click why it says how do you spell Brizley?  B R I Z Z L Y.  Oh, why? Of course, they would.  Titans Patriots, Pats, Tom Brady, NFL, TDs.  But, you know, some of it's stupid.  Like every night it's good night is one of the trending topics.  Yeah. A lot of noise in these.  You think Twitter would kind of get a little wise about that.  Now, Twitter added, I think, a feature this week that is actually  revived Twitter from the dead for me.  And that's this done done done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You actually used it where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm on the list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Not supposed to talk about it.  What? Because Calcana's posted it out.  And then a minute later, he was like, oops, I wasn't supposed to say anything.  So they didn't end me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They just put it on.  Sorry, Calcana spoke too soon.  Am I reading this correctly?  What a shock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if you if you if you if you are one of the anointed,  you'll get this thing on the right hand side of your Twitter that says lists  and you can create lists.  You see, I've you get 20.  I've used all 20 of them.  And so let's see. I have a list of twits.  And it's all the people in.  I have 56 names in there.  And then people can follow.  This is the thing. There are two things that make it valuable.  First of all, you can follow somebody's list on mass group.  Follow that's bad.  Follow. That's a good. Yeah.  Yeah. It's a group follow.  And that frankly replaces the suggested user list,  which is really a broken feature on Twitter.  If you weren't on the list, as all of us who weren't on the list.  Exactly. It's so broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody on the list is like, keep it going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, who's on the list is people who have millions of followers.  That's how they got their millions of followers.  The only way. In fact, it's interesting because I want to say Drew Barrymore.  Who's the guy? Drew Carey on the Price is Right.  Oh, Drew Carey, right.  Is asking to be on.  He wants to give a buck per follower up to a million followers. Whoa.  Yeah, I'll do it. Exactly.  Is we will follow Drew from TV at Drew from TV.  And but he's only like at one hundred thousand.  And my point is, even with the campaign where you get everybody saying,  follow Drew, follow Drew. Yeah.  You can't get to a million.  You need to be on the list is the person he needs to ask is, have  I want to be on S.U.L. Anyway, maybe this list thing. Yeah.  However, I digress, which is pretty much my.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is kind of like the wave crap from Google, which is useless.  I don't think this is useless. I think it's pretty good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you. It doesn't even look like it.  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He just wanted to use the word wave.  I think you want to use the word crap.  The word wave in a sense. Crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, this could be cool.  I mean, I've used TweetDeck a lot because you can create groups.  I have a comedian group, political group geeks,  but they think with TweetDeck on the iPhone, but no other apps.  But even more valuable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I now go to at Baratunde and you've got a list of comics. Exactly.  I press one button and I follow all those comics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can see what they're talking about.  So it's a great way for influencers to curate their influence.  It's curation is exactly what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or it's Follow Friday taken to its illogical extremes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Follow Friday is obnoxious. Right.  Because it lacks context and I've been harping on this endlessly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this doesn't.  This is exactly what Follow Friday should have been.  And I think, frankly, this is a breakthrough for Twitter for several reasons.  First of all, it's the first time I can remember that Twitter  has added a significant feature. Right.  Yeah, I mean, they do not like adding features.  Other than replies. Yeah. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they kind of leave, oh, we got our API open,  so everyone else will add the features. We don't have to add them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but you need some core things like in the service itself.  I agree, but that seems like a radical thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, how is this a company?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John's taking care of that. Go ahead, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think we're starting to talk about Twitter again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes. It's that or the balloon boy, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know. Come on. There is news out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Tell us your big story of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, how about your friend Vivek Kundra,  who obviously had something to do with Virginia some time ago.  And now there are $2 billion of whole Virginia computer system  that they've been trying to put in for the last few years.  It just looks like they just throw billions and billions of dollars down the toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is probably something that he...  Why him or his pal, one of the two?  Why did you call him my friend? I don't think he's my friend.  Yeah, I know he's no fan of yours.  Well, I wouldn't think. Yeah.  You've been trying to get Vivek in trouble for a long time now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, him and his other... Yeah, well, because, you know,  why do we have at the top of government people that don't have any credentials  that are making huge decisions that will cost the taxpayer lots of money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that what government does?  You just define government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So we're supposed to say, oh, great, that's what government does.  It's not what government's supposed to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  District of Columbia this week hired a specialized search engine developer and entrepreneur.  Oh, that's a bad start right there.  As its new chief technology officer overseeing what is arguably one of the most visible progressive  and troubled municipal technology operations in the U.S.,  Brian Sivak is the founder of Inquira, a privately held San Bruno, California-based knowledge management firm.  He succeeds Vivek Kundra, who of course is this nation's CIO.  Right. Where's the story?  I'm making it up as I go along.  Oh, okay.  Pretty good ad-libbing though, don't you think?  That's awesome. It sounded so professional.  Yeah. Well, that's my job.  That's what I do.  All right.  No, this is a story in the computer world.  This is what you're talking about though, right, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's kind of the tail end of the story.  The real problem is some contract they did with Grumman that apparently revamped the entire state.  And it just hasn't gone anywhere.  I don't know why Grumman would get a big multi-billion dollar contract for computer services  when there's a company like, let me think, IBM, Unisys, there's these companies that kind of specialize in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll tell you, I'll give you a big story from this week.  Google announced its quarterly results and a resounding success.  Now, it's not its biggest quarter ever by any means, but it was up 8%.  And given that the online ad space has really been suffering, that's a huge, that's a big, big number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they also said there are the acquisition trail again, which I think is interesting.  They're going to start buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're hiring again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's, it's growth.  It's a go-go time for go-go Google.  For go-go Google.  Optime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Optime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, uh, the okay.  But I haven't finished.  So a new report out from Arbor, they did a two-year study of internet use and found that Google was,  Google traffic is 6% of all internet use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they, there was a while ago, it was showing as high as 10%.  As high as 10%.  No, but for Yahoo's, because of all the property they own, they were getting 10% of traffic.  Huge traffic.  That's a mean, that's higher than Google.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And, and this was the most interesting result from the whole thing.  In all likelihood, Google's bandwidth bill for all of this is zero.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Peering.  Yeah.  Baratunde.  Booyah, he's working with Telecom too.  What?  Let's go.  Let's do this.  Good word.  Let's get into router traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alright, I attempted on this week in Google yesterday to define peering and I didn't do such a good job.  Would you please explain to the crew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you would have a lot of, we used to have a really top-down system where small ISPs talk to larger ISPs,  talk to larger ones and connect these big metro area exchanges.  Often instead of billing between two parties, they'll pool their resources and simply swap traffic.  It simplifies billing and you have sort of a net balance of payments which occurs.  Instead of a hundred billion going this way and 99 billion going that way, the bill's net one billion.  So peering decreases that altogether and says no cash.  The net result is free, isn't it?  Yeah.  And it's free, there are costs involved.  There's still moving traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well the cost of actually the fiber.  Yeah, the lane that fiber.  That you basically own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you have to amortize that over a long period of time.  So there's still accounting charges taking place, but it's not in the same sort of ongoing operating expenses that you would think  metering your electricity at home for like a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the whole 500 million a year is...  Doesn't really work that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was the number that was Credit Suisse or one of the analysts came up with it.  That YouTube alone must be costing them half a billion dollars a year.  In fact, it's goose egg.  The other thing that Google did that's brilliant is when the dot bust happened in 2001, they went out and bought a lot of dark fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, but the thing is, but they bought it and now they're actually using it.  They're writing it.  They're actually amortizing their actual money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How much do we know that they're actually using?  I don't know.  Do you have any documentation on Google's fiber access that they own?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, this report, unfortunately, I think you have to buy this.  One of those analyst reports where they tease the content, but I haven't been able to get the full report.  But Arbor has been doing this for two years.  I mean, they've been aggregating information from, I think they said, 100 ISPs, backbone providers, institutions.  I mean, they've really been looking at it.  I would imagine that when they say that this is how much data Google's using and this is how much of it is going over their own fiber, that they probably know what they're talking about.  But you're right, John.  I can't tell because I'm too cheap to buy the report.  Maybe someday.  John looks like Wilson.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Anybody at the table's got the money.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe you should have your own report.  They have a peering relationship with Arbor and they can give you the report for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, we benefit from peering.  There you go.  Because bandwidth for the shows that we do and all the video would be hugely expanding.  We pay like $40,000 or $50,000 a month.  And AOL, who needs to have a peering relationship because they're a big content sucker, needs to be a content provider, gives us free bandwidth.  CashFly too.  And I'm convinced, they haven't told me this, but I'm convinced it's to balance their peering relationships.  That makes sense, right?  It does both.  Especially AOL.  Because AOL probably, although I don't know how much longer that's going to last.  They're still there.  They have headquarters and everything.  Actually, you know what's interesting about it?  I think I mentioned this on the show a while ago.  But when they bought Weblogs Inc. and all those blogs, they are now a huge content provider.  Because they have some of the best, most successful blogs in the industry, including Engadget.  Video podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's so funny in the fact that they own these sort of top tier geek content, where before they were all about the lowest level content they could possibly do.  They've reinvented themselves.  The lowest level audience.  Very ironic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They also have TMZ though, so let's be clear here.  Do they have TMZ?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  Wow.  But Yahoo's got OMG.  Have you seen OMG?  No.  I went there once.  Yahoo OMG.  It's better than TMZ.  No, but the thing is, do you work for them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounded way too smooth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that like saying the stuff on the bottom of your right shoe is better than the stuff on the bottom of your left shoe?  Pretty close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Pretty close.  Alright, I've got to do an ad.  Speaking of peering relationships.  So you may all take a break.  John, if you want to baste your meat, you just go right ahead.  Are you cooking?  It's so nasty.  I know, it sounds nasty.  It's not.  It actually couldn't be more wholesome.  John cooks on Sundays.  No, actually I have to run down to the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What the hell is that?  What is he doing?  He's got a big fluffy animal in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to run down to an event after the show, so I'm not basting my meat today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, alright.  But I will change out of this purple outfit and put on something like a little bit of a  Would you clarify for me because there's some debate in the chat room.  Is that a sweatshirt or a sweater?  It's a sweatshirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, somebody thought it was knit, which would make it a sweater.  No, I didn't have a knit...  Or for our British listeners, a jumper.  John, are you wearing a jumper today?  Alright, ladies and gentlemen, I want to tell you about the great folks at Citrix and GoToMeeting.  Here comes the pitch.  Stand back.  That's a little baseball now.  Alright, I'm going to go ahead and get the ball.  I'm going to go ahead and get the ball.  I'm going to go ahead and get the ball.  Stand back.  That's a little baseball metaphor for those of you watching the postseason.  GoToMeeting.  How many times have you been on a phone call and tried to say, okay, now, imagine if you will,  I've got a PowerPoint presentation, slide one, and you start describing the slide.  It just takes all the fun out of it.  See, this is the beauty of GoToMeeting.  With GoToMeeting, you set up that meeting ahead of time, send them an Outlook message.  Or you can even do it on the fly while you're on the phone.  It's that easy to use.  You just say, hey, look, I want to show you this.  I've got some magic here, a little magic I want to show you.  GoToMeeting.com.  Alright, see that button on the left there that says join a meeting?  Click that.  They don't have to install any software.  They just enter the meeting ID and all of a sudden, boom, they're seeing the PowerPoint for themselves.  You're walking them through the presentations.  Great for sales.  You can collaborate on a document.  You've got a word processing document open.  They'll let you type here too.  It's like Google Wave before there was a Wave.  It also works for training.  So if you've got the software in your computer and they don't, you can say, well, let me show you how you use it.  Okay, now you want to try it?  You can take control.  You can even swap control back and forth.  It's from Citrix.  These guys really know remote access.  They've been doing it for years.

Transcript:  Do you remember, Jim, the good old days at Comdex?  Did you ever meet Ed Iacobucci?  I've known Ed Iacobucci for a while.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes.  But you were asking for it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was late and there was much frivolity going on.  He's a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to know the details of how you got into a hot tub with him.  He was a large fellow.  I think you're selling the idea of meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know this.  You can't do hot tub meetings.  It doesn't work online.  He was part of the OS2 team.  Well, that's what's interesting.  Because remember, there was a swap between Microsoft and IBM.  Ed was on the OS2 team.  The OS2 team came to Redmond.  Microsoft sent people to Boca.  I think Microsoft ended up branding most of OS2.  Ed wrote much of NT, which is how he got to know all the kernel.  He was able to do remote access stuff.  In fact, Microsoft licensed it right back immediately.  That's where the remote desktop came from, was Ed's code.  This guy knows remote access.  He's no longer there.  I think he does some sort of jet.  He has a jet company.  He's still in Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was down in Palm Springs.  I put on Twitter that I was there and I didn't check.  I got a message from him.  I'm like, you're here? Come have dinner with me.  I totally missed out.  Next time I go to Florida.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Ed, if you listen to Twit, please give us a call.  We can get you on the show sometime.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm connected to him.  It's a good excuse for me to reach out and get him to come up and be on the show.  He's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got a great voice for radio.  He's got a story about Ed.  Gina Smith and I were in a rental car with Ed when he backed into a pylon and totaled the car.  It was a rental car.  It was great fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're alive, I'm alive.  We survived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds like Ed was kind of...  Tech is really dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apparently so.  We'll talk about Comdex.  Anyway, GoToMeeting is from Citrix.  The roots of remote access are deep with these guys.  They know what they're doing.  I almost sounded like you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happened here with John?  John's gone findling.  This is no better, John.  Let me finish the commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Then we're going to talk about John's sartorial choices.  We're still in the commercial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Only because you keep derailing it.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  That's the thing I've got to say.  If you go there, you can sign up for a free 30 day trial.  I'm not kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I love to laugh when I see John at that.  It's very orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I thought it was going to tone it down.  I don't know what I'm going to do with this orange.  I gave you a new camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We gave him the Logitech 9000.  It's making you look like a muppet.  I don't know if it's the clothes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's where I put it.  It may have to do with the hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is there a muppet setting on the camera?  It has a lot of cool settings you can set it to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's super saturated.  Who is this man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You never met him?  I used to read information week in high school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a big nerd.  I never saw a stuffed animal collection at that time.  This guy used to be the back end of Info World.  PC Magazine.  It was a back end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not going to be able to get a picture of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to be able to get a picture of him.  I'm going to be able to get a picture of him.  I'm going to be able to get a picture of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a back end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The back end of Info World.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I believe the puppets were ghost writing.  The muppets?  Whatever they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John was the last page in Info World, weren't you?  For a while.  Was that when you made your bones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, actually when I quit.  It was when I went to PC Magazine.  PC Magazine is where you really became famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll never forget the great inside track column.  Which is in how many years now that you've been doing that?  It's going private shortly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's been going on since 1981.  It's been going on since 1981.  It's been going on since 1981.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, jeez Louise.  It's like mentioning bacon.  Now I'm in trouble with the Christians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Bacon's awesome.  By the way, why don't you tell the viewers out there,  or listeners, what happened in Dubai?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I like Dubai.  The  I felt like Humphrey Bogart in Casablanca.  I came here for the waters.  But wait, we are in the desert.  I was misinformed.  You implied there was something kind of odd about it.  I found it to be a vibrant, exciting place.  It's actually, I think, kind of inspirational.  And everybody who is there is telling me this.  They love Sheikh Mohammed, the guy who runs it.  His father started it.  Dubai is part of the United Arab Emirates.  But they have less oil than a lot of the people.  And they knew that they would have to have an economy.  Post-oil economy.  So his dad and later Sheikh Mohammed said,  we're going to build an economy not based on oil.  Do we have a good economy?  I said, yes, we have a good economy.  We have a good economy.  Not based on oil. Dubai is in a good position as kind of a hub.  From, you know, to Africa to the rest of the Middle East.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You already drank the Kool-Aid on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got more. I'm not done. The chamber got to me, man.  And so it's really go-go.  It's tax-free.  It is basically, you know, they're building 24-7.  Even under recession.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've seen the photographs of how fast that city is building.  It's out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But a lot of people kind of focus on the ski slope and the mall.  You know, the world's biggest mall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They don't focus on the slave labor?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, I keep hearing slave labor.  What makes you think, I mean, how are they slaves?  Are they locked in?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just look it up. They get these people, they sucker them into coming.  They give them a bunch of money in advance and they can't leave  until they pay it off and then they don't give them  the salaries they're supposed to get.  It's just a known scam that's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Isn't that how they got you to work with Zip Davis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you guys are right.  It's fine what they're doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm not condoning it. I just don't know.  And by the way, Sheikh Mo is supposed to be in debt

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to the tune of about seven little...  I think he is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think he is. And a lot of it's to Abu Dhabi.  They borrowed a lot of money from their sister,  Emirate, which does have the oil.  But I think that he's leveraged because  he's trying to build something.  You know, one of the attitudes  a lot of people say is a lot of the other sheikhs  in the other countries will just take  the oil money and enrich themselves.  And he's trying to at least build an economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's not necessarily true. In Kuwait, they spread it amongst the public.  At least the citizenry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's one thing that is true.  There is a very rigid class structure.  There's the Emirati. There's only 300,000 of them.  There's six million expats.  There's a managerial level that's all European and Indian.  The next level down, the drivers,  the kind of the white collar, blue collar jobs  are Pakistanis.  Then there's Chinese and Filipino service staff.  And then there's below that the construction workers.  And I'll tell you, if you're in a hundred degree weather  being a construction worker,  you're not going to be able to build a new economy.  You're going to be able to build a new economy.  So, if you're in a hundred degree weather,  being a construction worker is not a prime job.  I did ask one of the drivers,  I said, tell me how you got here.  He said, well, he's from Pakistan.  He said, they have an agency  in Karachi.  And I said, did they lie to you?  And he said, well, they kind of,  it's like army recruiters, right?  They kind of imply that I,  it would be this and that.  But he's not unhappy.  He's making money. He gets a month off every year  and he's sending money to his family.  And he has a three year contract.  So, I mean, at least you asked. That's good.  Well, I wanted to know. And I didn't talk to a construction  worker. I didn't run into any.  And I don't know if it's worse for them.  But I don't know if slave, look at John,  I think it's probably a lot like New York City was  in the 1880s.  Oh, there you go.  Probably like San Francisco was to the Chinese when they built

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the railroads. Yeah, the problem is it's not the 1880s anymore.  Yeah, it was probably like  San Francisco in the 1860s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on. Yeah, it's a boom town.  You know, I don't know. You're right.  I'm not condoning or saying I even  know anything about the human rights conditions  there. And it could very well be terrible.  But my experience of the place was  very different. It's being sold as the  Vegas of the desert. It's definitely not that.  It seems to me  a boom economy, much like Singapore, much like  the Asian tigers of Beijing.  Did you go skiing?  On a skyscraper. Jennifer  said we've seen malls. Let's not go  to the malls. So we didn't go to the malls. We went to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, that's too bad. It's not quite  the same malls that you get elsewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I didn't shopping. It's not Valley Fair.  We took the water taxi down the creek. They call it the creek.  I don't know what it is. It's a giant river.  And took the water taxi down to this  Golden Spice Souks and that was kind of cool.  You know what the best thing was, John,  is the event itself where they had  a lot of speakers from all over the Arab world.  It was a TEDx, which is a franchise TED.  It was an all-day event.  And they had speakers  from Saudi Arabia. And I met people from all  the Arab world. They had a speaker  Maserat who goes to India.  She has something she calls 8-day school where they go to  India. She teaches girls who are really not being  very well educated about computers.  She says they go from knowing  nothing about these to being able to use  Office. I don't know if that's  the best thing for them to learn, but how to use the internet,  how to use Microsoft Office in 8 days. And it's  really empowering. I mean, it's really exciting what she's doing.  I met a lot of interesting people  and I think I got a better picture  of the Arab world. And my message to them was  we need to hear your story because  we get a story in the US  that is perhaps not reflective  of who you are. We hear about the extremists,  the fundamentalists. A lot  of people came up to me and said, I'm not a religious  fundamentalist. This is not who we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's like them  getting a view of us from saying, like,  Glenn Beck represents all of America.  He represents some people. We all have that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I said, we have extremists too.  And I understand. And maybe this is what  new media can really help us with, which is  give you a chance through podcasts,  through blogging, to tell  your story. And I think you need to tell your story  because we need to hear it.  That it's not this unified, homogenized  world that we get in our media.  So I think it was a really, I think it was a very  fruitful exchange of ideas.  It was really great. I had a great time.  And it doesn't hurt that we flew a business class  on Emirates.  Is it true what they say?  No, there is a shower, but I didn't see anybody in it.  How was the technology on the plane?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What did they say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I came to Fort to hear what business class Emirates is like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very nice. It's like business class and other.  Although they have, the screens are 20 inches.  They're big screens. Their entertainment system's  really good. 20 inches for each seat?  Yeah. Nice. Yeah. Really? Wow.  Yeah. It's a big screen right in front of you.  And a listener,  I want to say hi to Bruno, who's a pilot for  Emirates. He flies the 380, the A380, the big  jet. Did you take the 380?  No, it was just a 777.  He says we don't get a lot of traffic in the US anymore.  The economy's really killed us. But we get  a lot of traffic from  Toronto. So we fly the 380 out of Toronto.  And it flies full every day, he says.  Wow. What? Yeah. Massive plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Toronto, I would just, in Toronto, their economy  is not hurting. I would  at a mall in Toronto, jam-packed.  No problem whatsoever.  I love Canada. I miss

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  going up there. You want to go back?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No. I have a client now in Canada.  You can take joy. The client?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In your PR business? No,  not in my PR. What do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Alright, so I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You sound like his mother. What do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What do you do, David? Is it in computers?  It is in technology. Most of my clients  are in technology.  I have a custom publishing company. I help  companies tell their story of their company  to get the information  out there. But it's all publishing,  publishing, print, radio, TV,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and online. And would you disclose your clientele  so we know if we can trust you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Entertainment Media is one of my clients in Toronto.  And they actually are releasing a pretty cool new  product. It's called Itty Bitty. And the  version that they're releasing is with NBC.  It's called the NBC.com  Communicator. And it's kind of like a cross  between Skype and Hulu.  It's a communications app where you get...  So you call somebody, but instead you get the Simpsons?  Like everybody looks like Bart? Well, the Simpsons is not on NBC.  But it's on Hulu.  So the idea is that you can  have text, voice,  and video chat.  And then also,  all within the desktop app, also be able  to watch videos of anything  you want. And anyway, it's going to be available  at the end of this month.  I didn't ask you for a plug. I just wanted a disclosure.  Yeah, geez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  NBCcommunicator.com  You've now proven why I didn't want to have you on the show  in the first place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm getting my plug in.  David

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  worked with us at Tech TV. He's an old friend.  And I apologize for thinking you were

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a PR shill. I work sometimes with  PR friends, but I don't do any PR whatsoever.  Uh-huh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Except for Baratunde, this is an all-Tech  TV-ish show.  But John doesn't have any scruples about that kind  of thing. I'm the one who has the scruples.  What difference does it make?  I think that that's actually an interesting question.  There seems to be a thread.  And Jim, I want your opinion on this,  because I follow the Jim Latterback  ethical principles. When we were at Tech TV,  you had a great document we all signed  that I think is still the template,  the pattern for me, on  ethical principles in journalism. I thought it was  really, really good. But  lately, it seems to be, and I was talking about this with  Jay Rosen from NYU  at Blog World,  there seems to be the trend that  anything goes as long as you disclose.  So it's- Oh, it's a rhyme.  I know, I like that. I'm just  working on my motivational speaking.  It's  okay to take money- Well, I'll give you an  example. I was invited,  a good publicist I know said,  we do these junkets to  Asia, and Sony and Nokia  pay for it. And I said, I don't  do that. Put me in the pocket of  Sony and Nokia. She said, what are you talking  about? Everybody, TechCrunch, everybody does  this. You just disclose it.  And to me, disclosure does not compensate  for the potential conflict of interest.  But it all depends on what editorial

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  brand that you're creating.  Well, that's right. That's what Jay said.  TechCrunch's editorial brand is very different from  Twit's editorial brand.  And if they don't have a problem with  writing stories about companies they invest in,  just because they disclose it, then end the  story there. That's their editorial brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. And that's exactly what Jay said.  And he said, the point is, let the-  as long as the viewer, listener, reader  knows, you let them decide.  But my point to Jay was, but there has to be  somebody who stands above the fray. Otherwise,  we need that person.  Leading into the whole FCC nonsense with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bloggers? Yes, we're going to get to that. Very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, let me throw my two  sentences. This is an issue.  First of all, most of these  ethical considerations, which  are not the same in Europe, by the way,  as they are in the United States,  in fact, in Europe, they expect  the vendor- for example, if you have  a vendor event in Seoul, Korea,  Did you see the lap dancers in the Japanese event, by the way, yesterday?  Yahoo!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yahoo! Hack  had a- you know, they do this Yahoo! Hackaday  thing where programmers come.  There's a video on YouTube of- they had  lap dancers come, so they'd get the programmers up  on the stage, sitting and say- and these lap dancers  come and dance in their lap. And they thought that this was cool.  Where was this?  This was taken place in Japan?  It seems embarrassing.  It's embarrassing to me to watch it.  I'm always stunned in Texas

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  going out for lunch at a strip club,  both men and women,  is a totally normal thing.  But that's a different country.  Dude, that's Europe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's in Europe, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you just hear Carol Bartz, the new CEO  of Yahoo! start talking about this?  She must be furious about this.  The four-letter words that are going to come out of her mouth  in a tie-rater. She's great that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's salty. Yeah, she's salty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Love that.  By the way, can anyone explain Yahoo!'s  current ad campaign to me?  It's about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You take out the A and the H,  the A part, and then you're left with you.  It's the crappiest-  Is it worse than the Windows

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  have a party ad campaign?  Hey, I'm having one Thursday!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm having one! Come to my party!  Wait a minute, let me show you the party pack.  Oh, you got the party pack? I see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo's lost his studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now it's chaos.  Lloyd Case, who used to work with Extreme Tech,  has, by the way, silky hair. Beautiful silky hair.  So I was trying to get Lloyd to come into  Tekzilla to do this on Thursday also.  You can come to our party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  CNET's going to come and visit.  So here it is, ladies and gentlemen, the Windows 7  party pack. John, did you want to finish your thought before  I open this box of fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no. I can blather on about this for days.  So why is Europe different?  I mean, can you say-  No, I actually had to have more of a European perspective.  This whole thing, there's all this ethical stuff, including  tap dance and other stuff I'm talking about,  pretty much was designed by The New York Times  for the sole purpose of giving The New  York Times an advantage over smaller  newspapers and smaller venues.  You have an event, say example, that's taking place  in Tokyo. They were breaking news  that was going to take place.  You would normally be expecting, in the European press,  some companies would fly you out there,  Sony, Nokia, nope, and if you read the 2010  European reports, they're not giving them  any breaks just because they get a free flight.  The New York Times has it  that you cannot go to this event on  Nokia's, you cannot go to the Nokia  event on Nokia's dime.  We have to pay for it ourselves on  our dime and then you can go and be more  objective when you report on it. I'm thinking  this is just to keep out the  smaller papers that aren't going to send anybody.  Or bloggers who can't afford to go.  The whole thing is a basic scam and the fact of the matter is  if Nokia is putting on an event and they want to  drag you over to it, they should pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, that makes sense. He is so calm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're missing the heart of some of the,  yes, you're right about bringing people over  and I think that as long as  you disclose, there's definitely an argument  to be made there. But it's the giving  of equipment without telling people.  You need to make sure  that people, that you  disclose and I think you ought to stand above  it a little bit. I applaud you for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all about the editorial view. If you want to be  the editorial journalist that  takes money from anybody, will write about

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  anybody. Hold on a second.  I'm going to be a car reviewer. So I'm going to  drive the Chevy Malibu  one week, then I'm going to drive the Chevy whatever  the egg is and then I can afford a few. Does anybody  think I'm buying these cars?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Consumer Reports actually buys  their cars, don't they? It's cool to get stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  loaned, but it's fine to get stuff loaned to you  as long as you give it for that. Fine, then Consumer Reports

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  basically what you're saying and by the way,  I would like to see that documented  that they buy these cars.  They also don't accept advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They also don't accept advertising, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We have Kevin McCain on the show. He's the editor of  PC World.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, you want to see my windows?  The point is that I don't think the public,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you know, everyone is thinking, well,  we're looking at stuff that's, especially  trade media, who cares?  I mean, we have both, it's a corruption  in government and nobody cares about that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  either. Trade media is the most important one.  Exactly, because you're closest to the subject that you cover.  It's the Beltway problem. If you cover the  Washington political scene in Barton,  you weigh in on this one. I would rather be reading someone

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  who knows something about Intel, who's an engineer  and even a guy who works at Intel.  In fact, by the way, there's a lot of new journalism  that is going to start bringing people  from actual places  where they work and have  them write about stuff because they can write  from a perspective that actually makes some sense  as opposed to the, you know,  what we've been trained in these journalism schools.  They have some, you know, some neutral observer  who doesn't actually know anything  but they can maybe ask the right questions  if they're lucky. The fact of the matter is in the  21st century, they don't know what questions to ask  and they never will. By the way,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is the model for my business,  John. Thank you for setting me up.  Just 1995 a month.  I help companies  tell their own story because the companies  need to tell their own story.  If you go through a PR agent and tell  a journalist and they sell it,  you're like selling cocaine cut  three times. We all know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  anytime you read a press, a general press  report about a subject you know about,  whether it's poker or Pokemon,  you know they get it wrong.  They never get it right. If it's a deep  subject, they never get it right. So that's a good point.  But I'm with you, Jim. Somebody  has to stand above the fray and be editorially  pure. Not everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think to say that it doesn't matter  in trade press sort of misses  the point because  whatever the industry is, it does matter if  you're making a purchasing decision, if this  is your school system.  That's assuming, what you're assuming is that there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a level of corruption and I agree with that.  Yeah, no, it doesn't matter if somebody's out  and out corrupt, but  we can't make that  assumption. We have to assume that most of these people are  honest and if they're not, you can get catch them.  Or they can just disclose everything  if they want to. But I don't think  there are more practical reasons why.  I think you have to take a look at the individual writers and determine  whether you think that they could  be prejudiced. There's very few writers  out there that aren't bigoted about one thing  or another in terms of their... There are many, many

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  shades of gray, John. There is the completely  honest journalist who takes  a knotty dime from anybody and then the person who  shills for anyone who throws them a buck.  And then there's so many shades in between.  And you can define  where you want to be in between.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are more practical reasons too. When you are testing  a type of product and helping people to  decide how to spend their thousand dollars on  a notebook or two thousand dollars on a TV or whatever  and if all you get is really  expensive equipment for free and you're used to  using it, you have no sense of how  the normal person who's taking money out of their  pocket that they worked an entire month  for and what they're going to end up using  and getting that into reviewers' heads,  and yeah, I get a new computer every day  and it goes back and I get another new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a very unrealistic point of view. Exactly.  Well, that's fine, but I think people can pick up on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think the more important things are,  for example, during the era  of WordStar, if you'll recall,  every writer, no matter who it was,  because they all had a free copy of WordStar  at some point or another, whether it was bootleg  or whatever, they all had a free copy of WordStar  and they were all given to them,  compared every other word processor with  WordStar as a standard that really wasn't a standard  and now Microsoft Word is a standard  that's not really a standard. I'm more concerned  about that kind of prejudice, bigotry,  and skewed reviewing  than the fact that somebody's reviewing a  $5,000 LCD and he thinks it's  the greatest thing since sliced bread  and yeah, maybe you don't sympathize with the guy  that can't afford it, but the guy can't afford it.  He's not going to buy it anyway, so what difference does it make?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thing is, if you keep doing it, you will  eventually get exposed and that's a wonderful  thing about the internet is that they  uncover fraud very, very quickly.  We are in a better era for that.  Choose to not be transparent,  you will eventually be exposed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you think there's anything in there that's the same color  as Dvorak's orange?  I think there is.  I want to disclose, I got this free from Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a copy of Windows in there too, right?  There's a free copy

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  of Windows Ultimate 7 in there.  So now we can't believe a word you say.  Leo's having a party to pay for it.  I am, you have to invite

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  nine people, so that's why they give you nine napkins.  They have to be very nine neat people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I complained via Twitter that I did not  get invited to one of these and so I'm invited.  You have to apply.  You're invited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come to my party.  Let's look at the tchotchkes.  If you come  October 22nd, you're all invited to the cottage.  Come by, that's the day Windows comes out.  Our party starts at 11. Look what we've got.  We've got a blue streamer.  A streamer.  That's Dvorak orange.  Can I open it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, you're going to ruin it. It's for the party.  Don't drink it.  It's for the party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dvorak orange.  It's exact match.  How did you know, John?  Did Microsoft pay you to wear that orange jacket?  It's a hoodie.  That's yellow.  It's hard to tell.  Here's a special puzzle.  That's the Windows desktop.  A puzzle's work.  This is what they call an activity.  You think I was joking?  Nine  Windows 7 napkins.  Cocktail napkins.  Just nine.  Don't have ten.  Can you sell those on eBay?  People are selling these on eBay.  I can play solitaire if nobody's showing up.  Do the cards have pictures of various Microsoft executives who the government's supposed to kill?  That would be kind of funny if they were naked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm afraid it's just a Windows desktop thing.  It looks like a Peter Max illustration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Undifferentiated balloons.  They don't say Windows or nothing.  They just ballooned.  This is a birthday party pack.  This is a plastic bag you put over your head after nobody shows up.  This is a birthday party pack.  This is a birthday party pack.  This is a birthday party pack.  This is a birthday party pack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nobody shows up at your party.  Nobody shows up at your party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't believe I just installed the game.  Can I ask Dvorak a question?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, what wine do you think goes with a Windows party?  John, what wine do you think goes with a Windows party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll give you the wine.  I shouldn't have upgraded to Windows 7.  I shouldn't have upgraded to Windows 7.  It's not working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's some material for tonight.  There's some material for tonight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think it has placemats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They look like placemats, but these are actually  They're nine of them.  Lovely Windows 7 gift bags.  But there's no gifts in them.  I guess I have to, as the party host,  Make your own gifts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you're supposed to buy Windows 7 for all the gifts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you make a copy of Windows 7?  Oh, good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll just copy this DVD and I'll put it in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Just copy the disc.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's nine coupons for Kaspersky antivirus.  Here's nine coupons for Kaspersky antivirus.  You think Microsoft really wouldn't...  Well, given that they just released their own free antivirus program,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just, you know, it's like,  Oh, and as long as you can use Windows 7,  You might want these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's because they got Kaspersky to pony up big bucks to be able to box.  Free license to Kaspersky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, as if that weren't enough.  Free license for Norton's 2010.  So they're already saying this product doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're both yellow. That's the interest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're saying, as long as you're going to use Windows,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You might want some protection.  There might as well be condoms in here.  Here's Nero.  That'd be a better party.  This is actually so you can burn the DVD.  Yeah, make copies.  Windows 7 exclusive offer for Corel.  Corel?  They're still in business?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Corel Draw?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't that a competitor with Microsoft?  This is cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to give these to each of you for coming to my party.  Okay, this is a thank you card.  Thank you for attending our Windows 7 launch party.  We don't want you to leave empty handed.  We were too cheap to give you a copy of Windows 7.  We have an offer for Windows 7 at Nordsparty.com.  I want to know if there was a little bit of a writer's embellishment there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't actually say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is also a Zune pass for two weeks.  For 14 days.  We're not done. There's more.  There's more crap in this box.  This is interesting packaging.  This is a Ziploc bag.  I believe this harkens back to Bill Gates' early days as a software distributor.  Oh, right.  The Homebrew Computer Club.  What is that?  More paper.  This is a centerpiece.  That goes right in the center of the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't get flowers.  This is getting lamer by the minute.  It started getting lamer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the best part.  This is the Steve Ballmer Signature Edition of Windows 7.  Does it scream at you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Developers!  You filled out a little potion pop.  Developers!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe there's a little vial of Steve's sweat inside.  That's disgusting.  It may be disgusting, but I've got his DNA and I'm going to close.  I think it'd be funny if it did open and his voice started screaming,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love this company.  I love this company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there it is. That's the Windows 7 party pack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to give you a card back because somebody wants...  There's nine of those.  If they don't get their thank you card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The eighth and ninth person come and you'll get screwed over.  Is there any way for them to verify that you're throwing a Windows 7 party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if you just happen to have a party?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can anyone actually define for me if that video that they put out, that Windows 7 video, was a joke?  That video was a joke?  It was real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, totally.  Oh, you've seen it, Jon, haven't you?  Have you seen the censored one?  The puking girl?  No, no, no, not the puking girl.  Is that Falcon the Balloon Boy?  Are we back to the Balloon Boy?  Didn't he throw up on two different TV shows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing they're doing is they're taking over an episode of Seth MacFarlane.  That is the most horrible, stupidest thing I have ever heard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That hurts my soul.  It is sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Seth MacFarlane's own brand of his show, he's got to be doing something that is going to be trashing Windows or Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but there's some question whether it's Seth or Fox.  No, it's Seth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's live with Seth MacFarlane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But who gets the money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Seth and his production company.  I'm sure Fox gets some of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a Fox.  I'm sure Seth's not doing it for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You saw the Cavalcade of Comedy stuff they did online with Google and they had Burger King as their sponsor.  Burger King is Crispin & Porter, their ad agency, and Crispin & Porter are also the guys who are doing this thing with Family Guy.  So I sense a connection to a Miami agency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to say, in Microsoft's defense, I don't know if there's any defense for Seth, but in Microsoft's defense, this is pretty good marketing.  For Microsoft, it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sucks.  Is it as good as the, remember the Bill Gates ads when they wanted to do a shoe store and they had Jerry Seinfeld?  There's no churros in there.  Is it as good as that?  Did they pull all those?  Yes, they ran one and pulled it.  No, they ran two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not a whole series, there was two.  There was one where Bill shakes his butt to show the future of Windows.  That's the shoe store one.  And then there's one where they creepily invade a family.  And they hang out and they live with the family.  It's very weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft and humor are just a weird match.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't go together well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Every time he does a keynote and he shows a video, those are usually pretty funny.  When he gets a lot of it.  Those are usually funny, but anytime he's actually creating videos for marketing purposes, they fail miserably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember the one with the Pacer where they went da da da, and they drive it around?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey Stewie, what are you doing with my laptop?  I'm putting Windows 7 through its paces.  Oh, you're recording your favorite programs on the DVR?  You're organizing your photos in the media center?  Personalizing the gadgets on your desktop?  Using the arrow shaker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Easily switching between programs with the user-friendly interface?  Yeah, that only works when I do it.  Okay, I just tweeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look, see, I said, I am Twittering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Check it out.  That is not even funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That really hurts.  And here's the thing.  Is that real?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that was it.  There's going to be more of that.  Wow.  30 more minutes or 22.  That's must-see TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to watch it though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have to watch a lot of bad things, but I'm not going to enjoy it.  I'm not going to enjoy it.  Here's the thing, artists need to be supported.  We've always had advertising.  Seth MacFarlane does not need to be supported.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's worse than product placement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This guy's got more money than Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I loved it that the Twitter trending topic was Leo Laporte makes $1.  Apparently Twitter couldn't handle all the zeros, I guess.  I'm a little conflicted about this because I love the family guy.  It's bad, isn't it?  It's just awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just really awful.  It's all a spade of spade that's going to suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, wait a minute.  If it had been a hip product, is the problem that it's Microsoft?  It wouldn't have been good with Apple either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, because it's just too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We are being invaded constantly through multiple dimensions and apps and spaces.  You can't think of a product that would be okay.  You're co-writing the whole episode, not just a scene, not picking up a can of Coke.  The whole thing is about the product.  It's also the edge of the family guy too.  The whole point of the family guy is to be anti-the-establishment.  It's a comedy show.  It's a comedy show.  It's a comedy show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a comedy show.  It's a comedy show.  It's a comedy show.  It's a comedy show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a comedy show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you notice that his notebook is Dvorak Orange as well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whoa, whoa, whoa. Dvorak does not own the Orange on this laptop.  Show him your laptop.  It looks like Dvorak Orange to me.  Maybe he looks like my laptop.  This is the Orange Show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who's Zooming Who now?  Who's Zooming Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you just say who's Zooming Who?  I believe I just did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, well, well.  I guess you're a little older than you look.  You're a little younger than you look.  I'm getting it hard.  Any thoughts about Windows 7, Mr. Jim Liderbeck?  Any thoughts about Windows 7, Mr. Jim Liderbeck?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I wrote recently, and you were nice enough to point to it,  that I did a lot of testing on machines that were a couple years old  because now that I'm not a reviewer,  I'm not getting free equipment even for a couple days.  So you put it on your own computers.  I put it on a bunch of computers that I built,  a bunch of notebooks that I had,  and only on two out of seven,  these were upgrades I did with the release candidate,  was it actually good?  I couldn't find drivers for a number of them.  A critical piece that I wanted,  this EVDO card to work, and I couldn't find drivers for it.  So I actually downgraded a bunch of them.  And my take is that if you're running Vista,  Service Pack 2,  and it works okay for you,  do not upgrade because that $120,  buy more memory.  Buy flowers for your wife.  By the way, this happened to me when I upgraded from XP to Vista,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the number of things that didn't work,  like drivers didn't work.  I spent about $400 on that.  I spent about $400-$500 upgrading hardware and software  just to get back to normal again.  Yeah, so there are a lot of things that they say everything works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not everything works.  You know, your take is exactly the same as my take was on Snow Leopard.  And I was like you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the one guy who said,  oh, God, whatever you do, don't upgrade to this.  I said that too.  Did you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I was mistaken.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, you got the check?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Check?  Direct deposit.  Oh, yeah, okay.  No, but I thought it was Snow Leopard causing a conflict.  It was actually an app, and I had to go into console and read all these things.  But you did see

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that Apple admitted  that for, they said it's a very rare case,  but that for some people, when you go to a guest account on Snow Leopard,  log in and then log back to your account,  all your data is gone.  It erases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get side-kicked, I think is what's called.  Hey, oh, hey, oh, we're back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You've been side-kicked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  By the way, why didn't anyone see that one coming?  The name of the company is Danger.  Okay, we've got two jokes now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is good.  We could have a whole routine here.  And what about airplane peanuts, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't they just make the plane out of the black box?  That's good.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Danger Psychic, let's mention it.  By the way, whoever wrote the initial memo

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that said, oh, we've lost all your data,  we're sorry,  I certainly hope they got fired by now.  I'm sorry, I certainly hope they got fired  because in fact, Microsoft's got all the data back.  Yeah, and everyone's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is it all of it or just most of it?  Well, they claim it affected a very minor number of users.  That's what they say.  But again, the data actually technically hasn't come back,  so we don't know yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I'm not user, I'm not minor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm major.  Do you think, as some said, this is a blow to cloud computing, Jim?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not a blow to cloud computing.  It's a blow to Microsoft's designs  for a cloud computing leader.  I don't even blame Microsoft on this one, do you?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know who I blame.  I don't even think people know the danger.  John, you've got your speakers up or something.  Oh, I'm sorry.  There we go.  John, you're the anti-cloud computing guy.  I'm sorry, Brittany?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I blame Brittany Spears because remember she got her sidekick stolen.  They had to put all the security in and that's probably what went bad.  Wouldn't that be Paris Hilton?  I can't keep them straight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Go ahead, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just question the people who put all their trust in cloud computing.  I mean, this device has, you save all your contact information in the cloud,  and apparently it's not saved locally like it is on most smartphones,  and it's not backed up locally.  I don't have a problem with stuff happening where it's more convenient in the cloud.  Then, by the way, right after that episode happened where they lost all this data,  and then of course now they say they recovered it,  the Bay Area had a little rainstorm and most of us lost our Comcast connection  for close, a lot of people in the Bay Area, for close to 24 hours solid.  Ouch.  And that's like a cloud issue because now I can't even get to the damn cloud.  Yeah, latin.  I did find out who all my neighbors are though that have open Wi-Fi.  By a DSL.  Do a little air snorting.  This is an interesting thing to note.  The number of open Wi-Fi connections, especially in the Bay Area,  and I think throughout the country, has dwindled to very, very few.  Yes, that's true. It's very, very hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's also odd is I remember the number of networks that are physically available,  I mean that are physically there, not available.  It was a community.  It was more of a parasitic community than anything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's still a community.  Parasites have communities too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come on, they need love and Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are programs out there that allow you to easily hack in,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so John, you just needed to do a little preparation and download those programs.  Only if they're using web.  If they're using WPA2, you're not going to hack in.  It takes a little while, but you can get there.  It's beside, I don't want to do that.  The point is it used to be where everybody,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because the routers came with the default of wide open,  and now they come with the default that you have to go through an installation process  and give yourself a pass.  Thank goodness.  So that annoys you?  Why thank goodness?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That annoys you that people are keeping their information secure?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, thank goodness because exactly, I'm with you, David.  I mean, what's wrong with security?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What if you don't want it?  What if you're like a free spirit?  I used to be a free spirit.  John is correct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is your network open?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what John used to say to the college girls too.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me in your router.  Yeah, free spirit, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Come on.  I want to know, John, is your network open?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next, I would like to point out I have three gentlemen in this room  and maybe four using open Wi-Fi.  We share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I am totally doing it.  You can drive right out to the front of your place, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Park in the front and you go online and download porn.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I do.  Or share your music library because the RIAA will understand  when I explain that it's not me.  It must have been somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, actually, that's the advantage of having the open port  because when the guys come knocking on the door, you say,  hey, I don't know, it's probably some drive-by downloader.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think that works, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think it might work in a court of law where somebody could.  Where somebody had some brains.  If you have a good lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Plus, you get a jury of your peers and you know that jury.  You pick them so they have no clue, anything technology oriented.  Anybody can snow them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to have a jury of your peer-to-peer.  Oh, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Man, Baratunde, where are you putting your act together for tonight?  You want to do a little geek set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you want just, you know, pure silence tonight,  you'll take all the material from tonight's show.  Thank you guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're so generous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the beauty of doing this on the internet.  You can't hear people scream.  It's great.  Except on the chat room.  Yeah.  All right, we're going to take a little break, come back with more,  if we could find more.  If not, we won't come back with more.  So if you're not, well, just, you know, look on your iPod.  If you see like another 20 minutes, keep listening.  Otherwise, you might as well just turn out now.  I'm never going to get this sponsor back.  Audible.com.  We love Audible.com.  Yes.  Are you an Audible listener?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a big, I've been with Audible from the beginning.  Before Amazon, before like early devices.  Before there was audio.  When did you start?  I was there.  Before 2001?  In the beginning.  Oh, man.  I'm like the Genesis of Audible.  I love it.  Is that because you had a lot of commute time?  I did.  I did.  I used to clean bathrooms in college, and that's how I passed the time.  It was the best paying job on campus.  Did you work in Dubai?  Was that a three-year deal?  Well done.  Well done.  No, but so I would want to keep my mind occupied while I'm scrubbing other people's toilets.  And I listened to so many books.  So many books.  Big fan.  But you got an education, didn't you?  From the books.  And from school.  That didn't happen.  Well, nah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wish I had Audible in school.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, a lot of them, I still have the same things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you notice that when you drive and you listen to an Audible book and then maybe if  you rewind and you go, oh, I was at that corner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like geo-locating your spot in the book is definitely something.  Is that weird?  Yeah, I just said geo-locating your spot in the book, Jim.  I saw you twinge at that.  No, it's good.  Some of my favorite experiences.  You put those words together really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I can sit and listen to you do that all night.  Again, not on stage.  I'm a pro, baby.  I'm a pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything but on stage.  Audible.com slash twit is the place to go if you would like to take advantage of our  special offer.  Don't use the revision three code, whatever you do.  Do you have a revision three code?  Don't say so if you do, please.  Use Leo's code.  It was so rude when Kevin Rose was in here and we're doing an ad and he gives out the  Dignation code.  Completely inappropriate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Shocking.  You should go onto his show and use the twit code.  Actually we're working that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jim and I are working that out.  Good.  I want to be on Dignation.  It'll be a code fest.  A code fest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't use my code.  Don't use my code.  We'll come up with joint codes.  No we won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I actually interviewed the guys at Salon who also have Audible as a sponsor and the shows  were having competition to who would use their code more.  But ultimately you should use the twit code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll be honest with you.  We get the money anyway because we don't get paid per click.  We just get paid.  So use any darn code you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this proves that they're actually paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why they do it.  They want to see does anybody listen to twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The effectiveness of it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Measure effectiveness.  You know what they do?  They pit me.  It's like pitting my children against each other because each show has its own code.  And it's like they're pitting me against my children.  Divide and conquer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well now you can know which child to love more.  You can quantify that love with ad dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the future man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you listening to any books right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually I'm not right now.  I'm in my podcast phase.  But one of my favorite was-  We like that by the way.  That's okay.  I love podcasts.  But it depends on my mood.  I have book moods and I have podcast moods.  And I'll go months at a time skipping both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm listening to a book that Andy and I co- your high school roommate?  Junior?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  We went to junior high together.  Andy and I co-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's so wild.  Wow.  Small world.  As the kids say, how random is that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is very random.  Just to throw out a completely random fact.  I created something when we were in junior high together called the AI Spy Club for no  apparent reason.  Nerd.  I was just-  Nerd alert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have created-  No, but it was a pure joke.  It was a joke.  It wasn't actually a club or anything.  It was just a joke making fun of him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm kind of lonely and I've got a club.  You could be in it.  The AI Spy Club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You were spying on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it was a whole series of joke things that I was creating and Andy was-  I'm sure it was very cute.  It was adorable.  Everybody got the joke, right?  Andy did.  Well, that's what matters.  That's what was important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm trying to find the book that Andy recommended.  It's a history of Hollywood in the 70s.  I am so loving it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's a great book about comedy from the 70s called, I think, Comedy at the Edge.  I'll have to read that.  Have you read that?  A lot of it takes place in New York.  Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet you've read this, Baratunde.  The Tom Shales book on Saturday Night Live is such a good Audible book.  Not yet.  It is so excellent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My favorite Audible is The Company, A History of the CIA.  I've read that.  It's incredible.  And the entire Dark Tower series by Stephen King.  Amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the one he didn't put his name on originally.  No, he did.  The Gunslinger was the first one by Stephen King.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought he used a pseudonym for those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  Okay.  Those are very good.  John has put up a stuffed animal now.  He's flipping his burger.  Really easy to talk to, though.  Yeah, it's kind of cute.  Was he in the A1 AI Spy Club?  Do you think John will have a new outfit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, John's jersey.  He's got another sponsor's jersey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That would be great.  Come on, John.  Keep it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The book is by Peter Biskind.  It is called Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, How the Sex, Drugs, and Rock and Roll Generation  Saved Hollywood.  And it's about Nicholson and Robert Altman.  And it is such a cool book.  I'm really enjoying it.  What's been great is I've been going to Netflix and renting the movies as they talk.  So it's Bonnie and Clyde and McCabe and Mrs. Miller and Nash and Nashville.  Really a fascinating book.  Easy Rider, of course Godfather, Chinatown.  It talks about the stories behind it, the stories behind the directors.  Did you know that George Lucas worked for Francis Ford Coppola?  Coppola really made him his protege.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know if it's based on that book, but there's a series talking about the same thing  that the Independent Film Channel made on this very same topic.  It's just a great subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably based on this.  Biskind interviewed everybody to get this book.  And it is a wonderful audio listen.  And I highly encourage you 23 minutes, I'm sorry, 23 hours and 41 minutes.  And thanks to Andy Anacko for this recommendation.  I immediately downloaded it and I'm listening to it now and loving every minute of it.  Easy Riders, Raging Bulls, How the Sex, Drugs, Rock and Roll Generation Saved Hollywood.  Now you can get this for free.  In fact, you can get two books for free if you go to audible.com slash twit two.  You get the platinum account.  That's a two book a month account.  And of course your first month's free.  Your first two books are free.  And even if you decide not to stick around, you get to keep those books.  So I think you're going to really enjoy this one.  But there are 60,000 other titles you get to choose from in every category.  Science fiction, romance, erotica.  Nothing like an audio book and erotica.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it all depends on who's reading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How to Baste Your Meat by John C. DeMora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a powerful story of a man and his brush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oil soaked brush.  Leo, when do you have time to listen to audio books?  You don't commute anywhere.  That's the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I'm so glad you asked Jim Latterback because it's true.  I got into audible when I did commute.  Yeah, you had the whole day.  I mean, I just drove it up.  It was an awful commute every day.  I can't believe you did that.  In traffic. You did it in Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I remember you went to Cupertino for a while.  You remember that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  Yes.  Like, how did you do that?  Well, audible.  Literally, it was audio books that saved my life.  But even now, because I got hooked on audio books, I listen at the gym.  There's an hour a day, right?  I listen when I'm doing the dishes.  There's about five minutes a week.  They have machines that can do that.  Well, I like my books.  It's time for my stories.  Let me wash the dishes.  You know, when you're gardening, housework, anytime.  You know, I actually, believe it or not, volunteer for carpools, volunteer to drive the kids' places,  because I want to listen to audio books.  You get hooked on these things, and that's the point of audio books,  is it just makes it easier for you to get those things done that you have to do  and still learn something, still enjoy.  Audible.com slash twit2, try it today.  You're going to love it.  Baratunde says,  They're great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that good?  That was so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That was so good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man, you and me, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We got a team thing going on here.  It's like we've done this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like a Frosted Flakes commercial.  Have you ever met this man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was, they're great.  Let's see what the costume change has to offer from John C. DeVorek.  Much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's still a weird color.  It's saturated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He put some muppet filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like it's eating the other colors in the frame.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  It's Richmond blue. Who is Richmond?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is the University of Richmond in Richmond, Virginia.  They were the one double A champs last year in the football season.  And I, by the way, as people know, I like to collect these things.  They're actually going to go into a bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That he's making millions of dollars on hoodies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Richmond spiders.  They should have one with a big giant spider.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you kidding? Their mascot is a spider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The spiders, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's terrible.  Did you buy that or did they give it to you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Disclosure.  They did not give it to me.  A fan of mine sent it to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you have to disclose that you have fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a fan and he sent me this.  So you have one fan that sends all the sweatshirts?  One of the best coach teams that you've ever seen play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're really amazing.  Hey John, Bill Cosby just called.  He wants his shirt back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some of the truly the oldest worst jokes have been told on today's show.  Some of the best ones too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a very volatile twist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You never know what you're going to get.  It could be a chestnut.  It could be something fresh.  Leo, look, even the chat room is heckling me.  Leo jokes fail.  God, you guys are cold.  How quickly they turn.  Oh man.  John, are you still there or we just lost the image?  Are you working on your camera?  Is that what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just fixing it so it doesn't have the problems you guys are complaining about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just overexposed.  I like that look.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it's his new hairdo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You get anything back there?  I have to start with my hairdo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you might have to restart.  We're coming.  Ken from Chicago says, this is Leo's Comic Cottage Cavalcade of computer comedy coming right at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sponsored thankfully, not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not.  It's all Bob Hiles' fault.  If he hadn't given me a golden mic.  I think you might get a call this week from your sponsor saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  would you stop telling jokes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I get that call every week.  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's nothing new.  Any other stories?  I mean, it seems like there's so much to talk about.  I thought the week was terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was boring.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was a boring week.  No, but there's something broke this weekend that I thought was kind of interesting.  This woman wrote this quote, harrowing tale of having her son taken away by TSA agents.  Whoa.  Yeah, it's bogus though.  Yes.  Well, what happened was literally within hours, the TSA posted the video of the actual security video to show that, lo and behold, her child wasn't taken away.  And there was a whole slew of sort of competing comments.  But in general, it was a good response by the TSA, a quick and swift one.  She responded.  People posted all these, you're a liar comments to her blog, of which she removed all the comments on her blog post.  But there is one thing that the video was edited at one point in the TSA video.  So the part where they kidnapped the kid.  Well, no, not where they kidnapped the kid.  They cut that part right out.  Yeah.  No, but the part where she claims her child was taken away is actually shown and it wasn't taken away.  So we're not clear on that one edit point.  So what was her motivation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do we know her story at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's literally an incredibly passionate blogger who writes incredibly melodramatic mommy blog stories.  And it was, you know, I wrote about it.  It's on my top post on my blog, Spark.  It's also on my blog.  One of the mommy bloggers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Dvorak.org slash blog.  Oh, now we get competing blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not on my blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The name of her blog is called My Bottles Up.com.  And where she talks about where there's an image of her holding a bottle of milk and a glass of wine.  And she admits in her bio that, well, she was not an alcoholic, but she likes to drink wine to relax herself.  That's fine.  Which is fine, which is totally fine.  But this is kind of the image that she's portraying on her blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you saying that are you alluding to the fact that you think that she's like a crazed alcoholic and that's why she wrote this?  Well, she also keeps an emergency Xanax with her at all times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?  Let me tell you, have you ever been a mommy?  I have not been a mother.  I don't think I'm ever going to be a mother.  Let me tell you something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing unusual about any of that.  That's just mommy life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I understand, but it's a very, very melodramatic story.  And maybe part of it did happen, you know, but again, it was her viewpoint of it.  Oh my God, she's got tattoos too, David.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's fine.  A mom with tattoos?  Oh my God.  Can I try to bring up a possible news and tech angle on this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Which is you went to the real time web summit, right?  And I was supposed to be there, didn't go there.  But we're entering this age of like really high velocity real time information without a competing high velocity real time analysis to go along with it.  No, in fact, it's the opposite.  So we are changing things in a thousand directions.  And we process them real time without full info to begin with.  Like as events unfold, we've already judged how it's going to be concluded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what it is, is actually a channel of programming.  As I see now, you have your IRC channel, which is actually real time, real time, but it's actually kind of a channel of programming.  I mean, information is happening alongside this program as well.  But what's happening with the real time web, with the fact that people are using keywords to be able to track a story wherever they are, they don't need to physically be in one chat room, that you can all of a sudden see a story build over time.  And this is what a lot of Web 2.0 is doing.  In fact, you know what the Intellipedia is?  You know, the thing that the intelligence community uses?  They use it purposefully as sort of big breaking events are happening, that information that's being gathered from multiple points at the same time can be collected in one space, being a wiki in the Intellipedia's case.  I think there's a role for both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing that's, I liken all of this to the Internet nervous system, you know?  That we now have kind of a sensorium that is much larger than our own personal sensorium.  It's kind of a more global sensorium.  And things like Twitter give us, you know, feelers everywhere.  But just as, you know, you have to think about what you get through your sensorium before you leap to a conclusion, we have to learn, just because it's in print doesn't mean it's somehow valid or magically true.  So we're just learning. But it is ultimately beneficial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right, Leo, you're exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And what we've already had in print is examples, many examples of bogus information that way.  So we're just getting a new kind of bogus information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Having time doesn't necessarily make it more accurate.  But I am with you that this is exactly what we're seeing is these attention swarms moving so fast.  But I think we just have to judge it in a little bit different way than we're used to judging it and understand that this is the buzz of the initial reception of the information.  This is the sensorium going zzzzz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and I'm not saying it's bad at all.  There's a lot of value in it. It's fun.  It's great for comedy.  It's great for business.  It's great for all the aspects of humanity that we've had with tools and without.  But it's different.  It's very different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Imagine if all of a sudden, it's almost like a comic book.  You know, you're like a comic book hero.  All of a sudden, your senses were suddenly extended globally and you're suddenly hearing everything and seeing everything all at once.  Initially, we had that initial reaction a few years ago.  It's all too much.  Now we're getting better at filtering it.  We're using intermediaries on Twitter curating.  So we're starting to we still are seeing much more and much more instantaneously.  I think we're dealing with it pretty well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, you know, it just comes down to common sense.  I mean, where is the common sense in all of this?  You know, you hear about this stuff like there's some kid riding around a frickin balloon.  I mean, come on.  Well, and anybody with some sense would look at the balloon and say that's impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's a human behavior being accelerated.  We've all been reacting like this.  You know, go the Jessica and the Wells story had the Jessica and the Wells story happened with this.  It would have been even more accelerated.  You'd see even more insanity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But eventually we're going to get dampered down is what I'm saying is eventually we're going to understand it better and it's going to happen in a way that we deal with it better.  And in the long run, I think this expanded sensorium, this nervous system is to our benefit.  I think good.  It's one of the ways that good quality content will get surfaced faster and better.  It's one of the ways we'll learn more.  We'll be able to communicate this whole issue.  I was talking about about learning about the Arab world unmediated.  That's what this sensorium is going to do with it.  This it is.  Well, the potential is going to result in Hitler.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we did it.  We reached the good.  Yeah, yeah, it's good.  Well, right there we got to Hitler.  Wow, that was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was I'm going to mark that that was at one minute and thirty five and 13 seconds.  One hour, thirty six minutes into the Twitter show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it's successful and if the good wins out over the base, then we will know more about what's happening in Iran or what's happening in Burma.  What's happening?  We're human.  So we were a mix of good and bad.  But we'll also learn more about the junk that we like the taste of.  Well, that's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Celebrity.  No, that's a good point, because when we've been given the infinite feast of food, what does our body choose?  Sugar and fat.  And it's killing us.  Right.  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a continuum.  And I don't know what percentage it is who are going to spend all their time.  Oh, my God.  So what happens?  I mean, these are the people who read the star.  The Chris Perlotte.  And the right.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just a very good Chris Perlotte imitation is vibrating.  I say that with love.  But they'll be and it'll filter out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There'll be those people who do that.  You know, five of the six things that you forwarded to me ended up not being true.  I don't trust you anymore.  And so we're going to have these trust systems on the people that are in our social graph, as well as we do the journalists.  So, you know, I trust of where acts going to be interesting and controversial.  I trust this person is going to be accurate.  I trust this person is always going to be wrong.  We're going to do the same thing right now.  We do that with journalists will do the same thing with people that with with our social graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the curation that you were talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the major problem with with the real time web is most of what's being moderated or indexed is what is the explicit real time web, what we choose to publish via Twitter and whatnot.  There is the implicit, which is what we're all clicking on, but not necessarily publishing or searching on, which we're not publishing publicly.  And that once you get that into the system and there is actually one right is one of the search engines that's doing this.  You will have a better, clearer idea of what people are interested in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watch what I say, not what I do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no, nobody.  The problem is, what I'm saying is there's only a small percentage of people that are publishing.  So it's not a clear view of what the entire public thinks what's going on.  If only 10 percent of the public is publishing, which is one of the estimates, then you're only getting a view of 10 percent of the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's more than you got when mainstream media ruled the roost and you got one tenth of one percent.  Yeah, well, right.  You just have to figure out who to trust.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know what?  Yeah, 10 percent of the people are out there, but there are still people that you can trust and people you can't.  But what it is, it's different kinds of filters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For example, you are a filter yourself, Jim, as is John is everyone in this room.  And there are people that trust you.  Like an accusation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like you, Jim.  You ignorant slut.  Jim is also an ignorant slut, but that's besides the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I make a great filter.  But this is another kind of a filter.  It's a real time web filter that are out there as well.  So people will use both.  They won't just rely on one or the other.  Maybe it's, you know, John is the, you know, native pessimist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm the native optimist.  That's why we've always made a good team where, you know, we're the opposite sides of the.  And I'm the optimist about this.  I think that this is, this is in the long run, this is almost an evolutionary step.  I mean, I think this is, this is very powerful stuff.  It's like evolution and evolution.  Concentration camps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Filter, filter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Perfect time for a filter.  Going back to the Muppets, he's the Muppet up in the skybox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Complaining about whatever we're saying.  What are their names?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Those guys are so, the old guys up in the balcony.  He kind of almost is in the balcony.  I'm headed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  I already already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate this stuff.  It's all bad.  How's the Tech Grouch doing?  Is it a huge, huge hit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John C. DeVorek.  on and off again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's really basically a 30 second commercial.  And, uh, but it seems to have a lot of people that think it's hilarious for some reason,  but I got some new care.  I'm going to bring in a new character.  The Tech Grouch's wife.  Is that meanie or is it going to be you?  I'm going to bring in a new character.  I'm going to bring in a new character.  I'm going to bring in a new character.  I'm going to bring in a new character.  I'm going to bring in a new character.  I'm going to bring in a new character.  I'm going to bring in a new character.  I'm going to bring in a new character.  I'm going to bring in a new character.  The Tech Grouch's wife.  Is that meanie or is it going to be you too?  No, no, no.  It's going to be with.  Cross-dressing John.  It's the secret.  It's going to be extremely, extremely offensive.  Let's put it that way.  Yeah, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love that.  Waldorf and Statler.  Waldorf and Statler.  Thank you very much.  That's me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm Statler.  Go Hivemind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go Hivemind.  F-T-W as they say, as the kids say today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I can't keep up with the kids.  Oh, those acronyms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're just flying fast and furious.  You know, we've got the TV on and Fox News is showing a Brazilian helicopter crash and  Joy and I'm sorry, Cynthia just immediately gravitated that and we lost our audience.  Oh, no.  There's two people.  Yeah, two people.  Our audience of two, they're watching a helicopter crash which just shows that there are things  that grab you and you cannot turn away.  This is where the risk of this Hivemind is.  Is that we get fixated on kids in wells or boys in balloons or you know, that kind of  thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have to be either up in the air or down on the ground.  One of the others.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  With a kid at his desk doing his homework.  Oh my God, look at that.

Transcript:  Well, you got to dvorak.org slash blog left out, but that's okay.  It's in channeldvorak.com.  This guy is really good at what he does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did I tell you he was media savvy?  Yes.  Mr. Media Savvy.  No, we have to say that because it's a drinking game.  And if he doesn't say that, then people go home sober.  So where's my whiskey?  I got it right here.  I want to thank you for joining us.  As we mentioned, maybe I didn't.  I gave a speech at Blog World on Friday to announce that we are going to start doing  video.  Jim, please don't hate me.  But we are going to start doing video of all that.  Well, because at one point people are always trying to stir up trouble.  At one point, I think it was Kevin and I, I said, you do video, I'll do audio.  I'll stick to audio.  And sure, that was good enough.  But now my reach needs to expand.  And the people demand it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all about getting more people to watch and listen to what we're doing.  It is really what it's all about.  It's not like when I was at PC Week and there was InfoWorld and we were battling for the  same audience.  You're right.  We need to grow the audience and everything we can do helps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At this point, we're such a nascent industry.  There's no competition.  But we are going to start doing video downloads of the show.  Keep watching for that.  We partner with a company called Mediafly that is going to put all of, you know, we  do every show and video.  You can watch this show, for instance, live every Sunday afternoon at 6 p.m. Eastern,  3 p.m. Pacific, 2200 UTC at live.twit.tv.  But then it just kind of ends there with a live stream.  And what we're doing now is we're recording these.  We're going to edit them.  We're going to put them up on the iTunes, of course, as a normal podcast.  But I think point of access is really important.  So for that reason, we've done this deal with Mediafly and they're going to put these  shows you ate.  You're going to be able to eventually in a couple of weeks watch live streams on on  all of these platforms.  But they will also put downloadable versions of the shows on the Roku box, on the popcorn  player, Yahoo TV, the Palm Pre, the iPhone and many other platforms to come.  So the idea is anywhere you are, you'll have an icon.  You could push that button and you'll see the Twitter icon.  You can see our shows.  And by the way, I know Revision 3 is doing that with Roku and Mediafly is is agnostic.  So it's not just we're going to be the launch partner, but every video podcast in the world  will be available soon on almost all TVs.  Awesome.  And this is the break.  This is the breakthrough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we've been anywhere, anytime, any device, any service, put it on the big screen  and people will watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And we really call that the future, the future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I said this in blog world.  I said we are no longer the new media.  We're just the media and we're coming to get you.
