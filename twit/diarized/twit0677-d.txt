Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we're too dumb to know, Mike, but I think he called us old.  I think he's a classic.  I think it's a euphemism for old.

Start time: 131.32
End time: 140.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Talk about classic.  Jason Galacanis is here from Inside.com.  It's really nice to see you.  You haven't been here in ages, but I think it's because you've been very, very busy  lately.

Start time: 141.36
End time: 158.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A little bit.  Are you still touring for starters?  No, it was the one year for Angel.  So the one year ended, but now it did so well.  Got a lot of great reviews.  More people listen to it on Audible, which was pretty fascinating.  That's how we read it.  I think four times as many.

Start time: 158.58
End time: 169.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think one of the reasons is I know you.  So when I read the book, I hear your voice.  But really, if you don't know Jason, you want to hear it in his voice.

Start time: 169.54
End time: 204.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree.  And they tried to stop me from doing it.  Inside Baseball, they're like, as a Harper business, they're like, so we found these  incredible choice.  We have three different voiceover talent.  And this one did this friend of yours book and this one did Tim Ferriss book.  This one did this person, but whatever it was, I was like, no, I'm going to read it.  My people want to hear my voice.  And they're like, yeah, no, we think it should be this.  And I was like, why are you dissuading me?  And do you think I'm going to suck?  They're like, well, maybe.  I was like, all right, I'll tell you what I'll do one day.  If I suck, then throw it away and then hire the other person.  I'm self aware.  And then we did.  And it was OK.  But it was more than OK.

Start time: 204.22
End time: 251.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It has to be in your voice.  It would be a huge mistake.  I mean, there are plenty of people, authors who should not read their books.  And I can understand.  I mean, if I were your publisher and I listened to your voice, I would say, oh, no, he's reading  that.  But it's a distinctive voice.  And the style of the writing is distinctive.  So it has to match.  And also the book, it's advice.  It's timeless advice from an angel investor how to invest in technology startups.  You want it to be from you.  You don't want some guy to say, let me tell you how I made money.  You want it to be Jason telling you in your ear how he made money.  Lisa and I listened to it.  And it's great.  We listen to it in the car all the time.  It's just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wrote it myself.  That was the other day.  They were like, so tell us about writing the book.  And I was like, what do you mean?  They're like, well, we have somebody who wrote your friend's book.  Wink.  We won't tell you who.  Nudge, nudge.  And I was like, I want to f that.  I want to write it myself.  Was that hard?

Start time: 266.36
End time: 268.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Was that a pain in the ass?  It's terrible.

Start time: 268.38
End time: 270.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to tell you, it's a very lonely process.  So what I did was...

Start time: 270.40
End time: 275.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've all written books.  I'm never going to ever, ever do it again.  I have the total solution.  Writer, writer, coach.

Start time: 275.46
End time: 310.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what I did was I hired my friend Brian Alvey, who did Weblogs Inc. with me.  And I said, just come over the house, 20 days, I'll pay you this dollar amount per day,  per chapter.  And I'll write in the morning and you read it.  Then we'll go for a walk.  We'll have lunch.  And then we'll write or clean it up and talk about more topics.  So we did that for 19 days and we got to 50,000 words and then we just did a four day sprint  and got to 65.  So what does he crack a whip?  It was more like having a coach watch you and say, this is boring.  This is really good.  In real time?  In real time.  So every day.  So what happened was...  I hired you to do that.

Start time: 310.80
End time: 313.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and I hired my wife.  Mike's a great editor.  Yeah.

Start time: 314.70
End time: 328.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You need to have somebody you enjoy spending time with.  So I picked the person I love spending time with outside of my wife and my kids.  How long did it take you to write?  About 19, 20 days of primary writing and then another 10, 20 days of like...  All day.  I mean, you devoted...  It was like six hour days.

Start time: 328.72
End time: 331.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  After about five or six hours.  The main job that day was...  Five or six hours.

Start time: 332.12
End time: 352.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I can write two, 3000 words in a sitting.  If you're an expert on something, then you can do it in that amount of time.  But if you're Michael Lewis and you're researching something, I talked to Michael and...  Oh, he must take years.  He spends 18 months researching something and it takes him a year to find a project.  So it's two years of finding a project and then he told me, oh yeah, I write in six months.  I write in three months.

Start time: 359.79
End time: 366.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but you know, this idea...  You're not writing about an area of expertise.  You don't see any type, right?  Like if you know something, you just write it.  You should write one on broadcasting.  Exactly.

Start time: 367.00
End time: 375.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a book where you just did a book called Broadcaster and you just talk about your experiences  broadcasting from the first person, what you believe would be incredible for all these  new podcasters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have a highly refined way to do nonfiction.  And it's just so...  I think the biggest mistake people make is they have this elaborate system.  They use Scrivener and they do all this stuff and they're moving stuff around and the management  of the blocks of ideas is the hardest part actually.  And the collection...  So what do you do?  So I strip it down to nothing.  I spend half the time on an outline.  I do like a supreme outline.  So the outline is the book.  Right.  And then you just fill in the...  And then I just go step one.  And it's just...  You have to realize it's not an art.  You have to go to the draft.  You just go down and you sit down and you're like, okay, this one, you know, one, A, X  or whatever is...  It's like a column.  It's going to be 1500 words.  It's going to be 3000 words.  And that's all I'm doing.  You're chunking it.  Yeah, chunking it.  But the outline is everything because then you never lose track.  It's like herding cats.  You never lose track of the pieces.

Start time: 456.68
End time: 468.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's how coding works too.  There are many coders and it's a bad habit.  It'll just sit down and start typing code.  That's the worst possible thing you can do.  90% of your time should be spent writing the outline in effect.

Start time: 468.54
End time: 477.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm fascinated by the fiction people who just...  They say...  There's some great fiction writers who are like, I don't know how it's going to end.  I don't know the characters.  They like that.  They just know these four scenes.

Start time: 477.84
End time: 481.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They like that because then they actually live in this world and it's developing.  Exactly.

Start time: 482.16
End time: 484.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they just see where it goes.  I'm like, wow, really?

Start time: 484.18
End time: 490.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you stop doing that?

Start time: 503.08
End time: 523.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're doing Text2.  That's Inside Alerts and it's working pretty well.  It's a much more intimate thing to text people news all day.  Like 2% of the subscriber base is testing it right now, but we have to be very careful  because it's a totally different product to send text news to people.  But the people who don't...  Like 20% of people immediately unsubscribe, they're like, I don't want this.  Too much.

Start time: 524.28
End time: 527.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The ones who don't unsubscribe, the open rate is out through the roof.  Exactly.

Start time: 528.28
End time: 535.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, nobody ignores the text.  And then the other half of my time, I invest in 40, 50 companies a year and I've got 11  people at launch who manage that process.

Start time: 536.04
End time: 541.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's the angel investing.  That's the angel investing.  And what defines angel investing?  What makes it angel?

Start time: 541.72
End time: 596.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the early days, an angel investor was somebody who invested their own money, typically with  very little information other than the back of the envelope.  Here's my idea.  Now it's become a profession.  So 10 years ago when I started angel investing or 2008 when I invested in Uber, Thumbtack  and a lot of those kind of interesting companies.  When I started investing then, there were maybe two dozen angel investors that were  known before Angel List in San Francisco.  And then there were a couple in New York like Esther Dyson, it was just very few, like three  or four in Boston.  And now it's become 10, 20,000 people globally are doing this.  That's why I wrote the book.  In our syndicate, so I have a syndicate, jasonsyndicate.com, where if we like a deal and we're putting 100,000  in, we'll invite up to 250 other people can be in the LLC with us in what's called an  SPV and put in 2000 to 100,000 each and then we'll invest a million dollars or a million  and a half.

Start time: 597.42
End time: 599.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you don't have to be loaded anymore to be an angel investor.

Start time: 599.76
End time: 606.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.  You can buy 50K and yourself and then have a syndicate where that then backs into investing  in a company.

Start time: 606.76
End time: 624.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All the details of this are an angel.  All of them are in the book.  It's actually highly recommend if you think this is something you might want to look at  because you've got a strategy, you've got a plan, you've got a way of trying it before  you really get into it and your rules are very concrete and I think very sensible.  So I think this is a good way to start.

Start time: 624.84
End time: 645.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean the big mistake people make is they invest in their cousins, roommates, friends,  and if they were going to invest 500,000 in their angel investing career, they give them  250 before they've even launched the product and then the product never gets launched and  then they want the other 250 that you've got and you throw 500,000 away and go this is  stupid.  So in the book I kind of outline how to not make those mistakes.

Start time: 645.76
End time: 654.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really good stuff.  Thanks, Mike.  And Mike, you're still writing for magazines.  You've got the book which is great, Gastronomad and of course you and Amira are doing the  Gastronomad experience.

It's an orange wine but deeply orange.  It's made with white men's only grapes.  Anyway, there's a lot of innovation.  The reason you have to go to Italy to try some of these wines is some of the best wines  in the world are never exported.  Small.  You can't buy this in the US.  And so yeah, and so this is so orange that it's actually like, it looks like amber.  I can't wait to try it.  Is it a fruity, sweeter?  No, it's dry.  It actually has hints of whiskey and caramel.  It's completely off the charts.  Welcome to the wine cast.

So this thing was this beautiful farmhouse and it was just heaven on earth.  And this is what we do.  It's like super fun.  But no, I don't make a living on this too much.  It's mostly my writing.  Mike's independently wealthier.  He could never do all the things he does.  Well, I don't, you know, this is the, this is the, I'm living off the twit residuals.  This is the thing with the, with the, I talk about this in the book.  There's a whole economic reality to living nomadically that is just fantastic.  Namely, in a nutshell, when you are living in a house, your expenses and costs are more  or less fixed or rising.  And your, and your, your income can just go away or it can double or like it's, your income  is like this and your costs are stable.  When you're nomadic, the cost can be as flexible as your income.  So if you want to launch a business, if you're an entrepreneur and you like, how do I raise  the money?  Well, one way is you go to Ecuador for a year, your cost of living is $12,000 a year and  you take all the rest of the money that you would have spent on a house and a car and  the insurance.

But to do that, you have to buy a four terabyte drive and so forth.  And a lot of YouTubers complained about performance.  If you really tax the thing, the i9 would get so hot that it would perform worse than  an i5 while it was cooling off.  Apple said, yeah, you know what?  I'm glad you mentioned that.  Turns out there was something wrong with it in the firmware.  And on Monday, they released a supplemental update.  They said the bug was a missing digital key.  I don't understand how this works at all.  But a missing digital key that caused this problem.  And in fact, everybody who then retested with the patch said, oh, I love how they found

And they said, oh, yeah.  Oh, oh, look, it's oh, we forgot there's a missing $9000 laptop.  We forgot to turn on the but but on the other hand, it's pretty awesome that you could get

It's toxic.  And you just have to get off of it.  Like it literally is the worst place because you wind up.  It makes you it's the rage video game.  Yes.  You open it up and you're like, what can I be outraged about?  OK, that guy.  And he's no longer the underdog.  Now he's like the billionaire guy.  He wasn't a billionaire when he started all this.  In fact, he lost all his money at one point building Tesla up in SpaceX  and he and he actually did go.  Did he actually go to zero?  He was negative.  Living on a loan.  I'm not talking about school.  He talked about this.  He was living off a two hundred thousand dollar  loan from another billionaire friend of ours.

Start time: 1475.38
End time: 1524.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the ammo is they've been losing money like Amazon and other great companies  for a long period of time.  And the other ammo, which is totally valid.  And you launch like sleeping on the factory floor fixing this is that he's been late.  Right. With the cars.  So when he was late with the other other cars, it was all super fans.  So it didn't matter.  Like if you were late with the roadster or the Model 3, you had hundreds of thousands of orders.  And all of a sudden, now you've got a populace of five hundred thousand people.  It's not the five thousand cozy people who were like rooting for this underdog  to maybe even make the car. Who knows if it'll ever come out.  Now we're beyond Kickstarter campaigning and now it's into the masses.  But he'll figure it out. He always does.  But yeah, I think.  If you're going to bed, waking up,  checking Twitter and involved in like a war with the shorts,  it's just not healthy and you can't do it on the long term.

End time: 1655.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1658.08
End time: 1666.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1667.04
End time: 1671.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1671.62
End time: 1679.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But look what happened. They deleted a million.  They lost 20 percent.  What if they deleted the true number, which is more like 20, 30 million?  Keep doing that over time and then people will adjust.

Start time: 1679.06
End time: 1687.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really about the cost.  So the CFO said the costs are going to.  Well, of course, the growth in costs will be higher than the growth in revenue  because we're not going to focus on revenue growth.  We're going to focus on cleaning up the service.  So in both cases, the companies are being penalized for doing the right thing,  right thing, which makes sense in a way, because if you don't do the right thing  and you let it just go crazy, you sell ads to the Russians in rubles  and bad things happen and, you know, you kind of just let  advertisers run amok and you have Cambridge, Cambridge Analytica  and you have all these weird things.  If you tighten it up, you'll have no Cambridge Analytica,  but also other advertisers will get stopped in the process.

End time: 1803.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can block people.  You just block them. You just block them.  I just block them.  But and so anyway, I've been managing this for years.  Just anybody who seems even remotely trollish, I sort of block them.  And then they wander away eventually.  Regarding Twitter, I think that I think the media deserves huge blame  for the pain they're getting because Twitter tweets like their news.  But that's not what I mean.  What I mean is that this this thing is being reported as that  that they purged users and people lost users.  You didn't lose any users.  If a publishing company has been saying they have a million subscribers  and then they come out and say, you know what, we only have nine  hundred thousand subscribers, they didn't lose one hundred thousand subscribers.  They are now reporting things.  Things are more honest. Right.  When you delete a bot, you don't delete a user.  You delete a non user.

Start time: 1803.92
End time: 1809.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would say, though, so it's really going to be honest.  They should delete about a hundred million users.  Yeah, because about a hundred million.

Start time: 1809.74
End time: 1867.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should even call them users.  They should call them fraudulent accounts.  There you go. We deleted a hundred million fraudulent accounts.  All that matters is the daily active users and as in relation to monthly  active users, Twitter has never released daily active users  because it's so low compared to Facebook.  So they they've only said it's much lower than monthly.  So monthly is three hundred twenty five million or something in that range.  So if they are saying much lower, I think it's probably between  50 and 75 million daily active users.  Yeah, it's still an amazing success.  They're still going to make a couple of billion dollars a year,  but they're in the Yahoo Google trap, which is they're constantly  compared to Facebook and they're fundamentally different services  for different groups of people.  And they should not put themselves in that comparison game.  I was healthy what they're doing, because they're going to start losing,  you know, let's say Elon doesn't have it on his phone and Maggie  from the New York Times says, and I don't I'm not by myself in their categories,  but it's becoming a trend that your life becomes better when you remove the service.  That is a dangerous signal for Twitter.

Start time: 1867.50
End time: 1890.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Twitter is so important, so culturally relevant, relevant,  far more so than Facebook.  I think they really need to take action.  And the action is actually very, very simple.  And we talked about this before on Twig and other shows, Leo.  But I believe strongly that Twitter should do exactly what Facebook does  and Google Plus does, which is that when somebody comments on something you posted,  you can delete their comment.

Start time: 1891.90
End time: 1892.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Instagram does that.

Start time: 1893.00
End time: 1901.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody does it except Twitter.  So what you can do, what that enables is Maggie Haberman can start a conversation  and then she can moderate her own conversation.

Start time: 1901.90
End time: 1922.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Even better punch up to that, which is what they should do is when you post,  it should say, allow replies from your followers,  people you follow or both so you can actually narrow it.  Forget about deleting it. I could just say, only my followers are allowed to post.  Then if you follow me and you write a troll thing, I just block you and you're gone.  And now you're gone forever.

Start time: 1922.58
End time: 1924.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 1924.50
End time: 1954.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I gave him another suggestion, which actually he took.  I wrote a blog post saying whenever they somebody post something really abhorrent  and it's been signaled, why don't you blur it out and say potentially  nefarious content or potentially offensive content and then click to see it  and you can click to unlock it. And they did that actual feature.  So they are listening and they're trying. But they got to remember,  they started with this whole original free speech concept.  Yes. And now they're starting to realize free speech at scale  with anonymous accounts does not work. Right. It just doesn't work.

Transcript:  Unless you can unless you can just have your own world,  live in your own world. So this is one of the things that private social networks.  Somebody in the chat room mentioned Google+.  I am on record for being a huge Google plus fanboy.  I don't think it's anywhere near as good as it used to be.  But still, they have a feature now on Google+.  It's fantastic. With one click of a button, you can you can report, delete  and block. And then another thing pops up and you can get rid of all their other  recent comments. So it's just so powerful. Just clean house.  But the whole way that you use something like Google+, or maybe even Facebook,  is you don't you're not on Facebook. You're not on Google+.  You're on your own little world.  And that's how a social network should be.  You should you should be isolated in your own little world  where it's like a cocktail party.  You don't invite anyone to your house for a cocktail party.  You're specific about it. And somebody knocks over the lamp.  Or two factor authentication.

And then we we stay connected on social media forever.  And Facebook or Twitter?  Instagram, mostly Facebook, a little bit wherever people are.  I'm on all of them.  But the social media is fantastically valuable,  fundamentally.  And I really think that users don't spend enough time demanding  that that you, the company, you, Facebook, you, Twitter, give us the users  control over our own stuff.  They always want to control it because that's where the money is.  That's where the users are.  That's what they want to have.  Algorithms you can never I want a social network where I follow people  and I get what they post.  That's what I want.  And that doesn't exist. Yeah.  Think about that. That does not exist.

If we don't, not every meal is Blue Apron, but we do.  I think we do three a week.  Often we give one away.  But the idea is that they deliver to you all the ingredients.

You can get the family plan, which is four.  You can get the couple plan.  And now, which is nice, you can mix and match.  So you can get one meal as a family meal, one meal is just the two of you.

And there is this kind of feeling of I'm doing something for people I love.  I'm making a meal that they're going to love.  And it's incredible.  We have been so happy with Blue Apron.  Our 15 year old, who is very picky.  The other day, I made a steak with caper butter sauce.  And it was so incredible.  What was the side on that?  It was something unusual.  It was really phenomenal.  Yeah, capers are great, right?  This caper butter thing was so good.  Oh, it's mashed potatoes with.  I wish I could remember the right.  Anyway, it was fabulous.

Yeah, I forgot the guy's name, but it will come to me in a minute.  But anyway, it was a guy who brought the office to America, like really smart cat.  And then I think he kind of just did this like threw it together because when they talked  to me, it was kind of like very rushed.  Yeah.  And it seemed like they were taping in a couple of months and it was just being all thrown  together.  And they didn't know what they were doing.  They really didn't do a lot of research.  And so I think that's exactly what it was.  Apple was so embarrassed by it, but they had to put it out that it was like, let's just  not market it.  But it does show how hard it is.  What Netflix does, Hulu does.  Making hit shows is hard.

The watch was kind of like the only exception I can think of where they maybe rushed that  product a little too much because Wall Street was pushing them hard on a new product category  and look what happened there.  But they're so reserved in what they put out there.  They have a small number of skews, very small number of items.  It's the opposite of what Netflix does.  Netflix is like, what's your idea?  Go for it.  We'll buy two seasons.  What's your idea?  We'll buy three seasons.  No, we won't pilot it.  No, we don't do pilots.  We'll just buy the whole season.

So for 20 bucks, this is my idea, 20 bucks gets you music, their TV shows, Apple Care  and 1 terabyte.  Nobody's going to use the 1 terabyte obviously.  That's a very good idea.

If I buy HBO directly from their website or I buy the NBA League pass directly from the  NBA, I can log in on Apple TV now.  So it makes it like you feel more in control with the seven, eight subscriptions.  I believe everybody will have seven or eight subscriptions, not one or two.  And you'll just a la carte.

Transcript:  So the Time Warner, the Time Warner charter merger in New York happened in 2016 as a contingency  on that.  New York State says, all right, but you have to provide high speed internet in underserved  rural areas.  You're going to make so much money on Manhattan that you can afford to do this.  This is our price.  Syracuse, Albany.  Yeah, they agreed to do it, but they didn't do it.  They said there's in their statement, they said, well, wait a minute.  We provided our, we extended the reach of our broadband network to more than 86,000  new homes and businesses, but they had agreed to at least 145,000.  So they're even admitting they didn't do what they said they were going to do.  Now here's the thing.  I don't think they care because do you want to be the legislator or the regulator who  cut off internet access and television access for millions of customers in New York State?  They just find them.  Well, they did.  They find them three million.  They'll probably get the three million.

Start time: 3066.06
End time: 3088.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They got to make it like three million a day until they start showing improvement.  In other countries, they take it kind of seriously, this sort of internet divide.  And so the cable companies will lose money getting it to rural areas and then make it  in profits.  But low internet earth orbit satellites and zeppelins, like balloons.  I know it sounds crazy.  I've been waiting for the return of the zeppelin.

That you're spreading.  That has more money than he knows what to do with.  I've been at the table when he talks about it.  He's got an airship company.  He's got it going, but he doesn't like to talk about it.  So I was at a dinner party where people were talking about it with him and he was, he was  demurred.  He didn't want to talk about it.  But yes, he believes he's going to down at NASA Ames.  Because he has the old blimp shelters.  He redid them.

Transcript:  Well his position was self-driving cars need regulatory approval in local, state, federal.  It's a nightmare of interlocking regulations.  And edge cases.  With flying cars, you just need the FAA to say okay.

Start time: 3175.82
End time: 3180.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  We're getting there.  Yeah.  The Kitty Hawk ones, you can see the videos of them flying over a lake.  It's pretty impressive.  Casey Neistat, the YouTuber actually took a flight in it.  Here, let's show it.  There it is.  So it's the real deal.  They actually led a civilian in there, a high profile YouTuber, which if you think about  a PR, you're not going to let him go in there and get killed.  So they had to feel very secure about this.

Start time: 3339.10
End time: 3350.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I see why you have to take off because unlike other VTOL aircraft, which have like  helicopter wings, this one has regular propellers.  So you have to point them up, take off and then you can fly once you've got airborne.  So it's going to work.

End time: 3401.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The way these will work is they'll be you'll fly them.  The land, the batteries will come out and they'll swap and fresh batteries.  Again, like the Tesla cars can do but they never deployed because it's completely unnecessary.  They showed that, the right that you would drive over a thing and they'd swap the battery.  They literally are made to do it but they don't because superchargers become so fast  that the idea of like, I'm going to give you my battery and get a loaner and then I'm going  to come back and get mine somehow.  That whole logistical question they never got around to answer.

I mean, if you're driving a Volt or a Leaf or one of those pieces of junk, like you're  going to get 15 miles an hour added, 12 miles.  So you have to overnight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's nuts.  Listen, you don't have a bunch of dials around this monitor, right?  You give up a bunch of dials, but you gain over the air updates, which are insane.  Yeah, that is nice.  So they can change the interface as they go.  So as an example, when it first came out, they had like on the map, you had to reach  all the way over to the other end to turn on the traffic.  And they're like, oh, well, that should just be on the left side.  And then I think they'll have them.  I think that screen is going to be movable in the future.  I don't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They fixed that.  Yeah.  There was something called panel gaps where when they were putting them on, there was  just a little bit of like imperfection.  So the thing that Elon made a mistake on was he made it too automated.  And so then they took out some of the automation that humans do it and it worked better.  Because humans can say, oh, that doesn't line up.  So they're slowly going to add the automation back over time.  But he was really going for this like almost lights out facility, like really automated.  People couldn't believe the level of automation.  Honestly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He has that at SpaceX.  There's a woman who's his number two there who really does, I think, contribute that way.  They need to find somebody.

Transcript:  Right. Never mind.  Elgin.com.  And I really want to plug gastronomad.net  where you can find out about those amazing...  Join us.  Experiences.  Our show today brought to you by Betterment.  Now, I don't have anywhere near the kind of money that these cats have to invest,  but I want to make the most of it, right?  Now, unfortunately, SEC regulations prevent me  from doing an ad for something I use.  Right. Nuts, right?  So one product we do that I can't use it.  It's the largest independent online financial advisor  designed to help customers build wealth, plan for retirement,  achieve their financial goals.  They have two different levels.  Twenty five basis points, point two five percent.  That's a huge deal.  And you get all this great investment advice.  There is no hidden cost no matter how much you invest, no matter who you are.  The one low transparent management fee point two five percent.  That's it. No transaction fees.  Actually, that's good because Betterment's trading on your behalf all the time.  That's the other thing these systems can do because they're computerized.  They are making trades daily.  Things like now, by the way, this is something real now that  the interest rates are going up.  Tax is changing. The market is volatile.  Tax loss harvesting.  When the when the market goes down, you don't have to go, oh, God, it went down.  No, you can take advantage of that to save you money on your taxes.  And they do this automatically every minute of every day.  They're always rebalancing.  You're never over invested in any category,  which is really I know enough to know that's important.  Look at this stuff can be confusing and difficult.  Also, I know you geeks, you're saying, oh, no, I can do this.  I read a book. And I'm not saying you can't, but you're not going to spend  the energy and attention.  You might rebalance if you're lucky quarterly or maybe more likely like me.  Once a year, they do it every minute of every day.  Set and forget it. Set it and forget it.  Plus, they're a fiduciary.  They make recommendations and that means they cannot trade in their own behalf.  They are not incentivized to recommend any particular fund.  They don't have their own products.  They will work in your best interest at all times.  This is what you want.  Investing involves risk.  Investing involves time and it falls in tension.  Set it and forget it. Betterment.  By the way, this is a great deal right now.  You get up to one year managed free, not even point to five percent.  Go to betterment.com slash to find out all the details.  You might want to just roll everything over to it.  Betterment dot com slash twit.  And if you're young and just starting out,  that's awesome.  That's great. This is the time you the difference between somebody  who starts putting money away for retirement in their 20s  versus somebody like me who didn't start to my 40s is millions of dollars.  Yeah, millions of dollars.  Same amount of money. Yeah, it's huge.  Do it betterment dot com slash twit.  All right. Where's my key?  I have a key and I'm not afraid to use it.  This is a Yuba key.  I love these things.  The Yuba keys are hardware keys  that you use as your second factor of authentication.  So when I log into Google, I wish my bank did this.  My bank is still sending me SMS messages, which are easily spoofed.  The worst, right? Yeah.

Transcript:  So did this, by the way, all of those hacks you saw of people  who lost cryptocurrency on Coinbase and some other sites.  They what they basically did was they looked for people on social media  talking about cryptocurrency.  Then they found their emails, they spoofed them.  Then they just basically stole their crypto right out of their accounts.  Oh, my God. Untraceable.  And they did it specifically by spoofing SMS to fact.  They're like, well, I have two factor on.  I can't get hurt. Yes, you can.

Start time: 4127.18
End time: 4186.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And by the way, if anything falls back to SMS, that's as bad as SMS.  This is the really bugs me.  There's a number of things that will use an authenticator or YubiKey.  But then they say, don't have your YubiKey, we can send you a text.  Well, guess what? That's what the hacker does.  Yes. Oh, no, I don't have my YubiKey.  I'm a hacker. I don't want to lie on that question.  I'm going to tell you the truth.  No, don't have it. Send me a text.  So make sure.  But this is what Google did for eighty five thousand plus employees.  Since early 2017, they gave them a YubiKey,  a security key, hardware security key, and said, you will now from now on  in your accounts, use this zero since they did that zero phishing attacks,  zero hacks. They it was a hundred percent security. Right.  A hundred percent secure. So much so.  And this kind of makes me mad that Google's decided to make their own.  The Titan, which if I were YubiKey, I'd be both happy at this news  and sad at this news.

Start time: 4186.58
End time: 4202.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, they announced it and YubiKey was at the event where they announced it.  I guess they had found out about earlier.  But this is what happens.  Like, you know, a company like Google will study you or Facebook.  They'll partner with you and then you'll wake up and your throat will be slit.  So you're going to always be paranoid.

Start time: 4202.74
End time: 4212.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if they mainstream this idea, it's good for everyone because every right now.  In terms of all the users out there, the number of people using that key  is like less than one percent.

Start time: 4212.14
End time: 4214.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Probably you would think, but I don't know what YubiKey is going to be able to do

Start time: 4215.34
End time: 4284.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to differentiate themselves. Well, I can tell you one thing.  Tell me the Google Titan.  If you if you ever set the Google Advanced Protection on,  yeah, they say you need two keys.  You need a hardware key like a YubiKey.  There are others. And you need a Bluetooth key.  And the reason is the iPhone, frankly,  because there's no way to use a hardware USB key.  There's no NFC. And the NFC is not.  So you have to use Bluetooth.  So you have to buy both to use Google's Advanced Protection.  And so Google is building NFC, hardware and Bluetooth into this one Titan.  That's a mistake because Bluetooth and NFC are not nearly as secure as this.  That's right. YubiKey.  So maybe there's a little air in there for Yubico.  I'd be sad if if Stina and company kind of failed because of this.  On the other hand, you're right.  I'm happy because everybody should be using hardware authentication.  I have to point out that somebody called me on the radio show and said,  well, which is better, hardware or an authenticator?  And I said, well, hardware is better marginally.  I mean, authenticators are still pretty good,  because if you lose the phone or somebody gets your secret key, the authenticator,  this they'd actually have to physically have access to the you.

Start time: 4284.12
End time: 4286.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's also you can lose that.  But you can lose this.

Start time: 4287.54
End time: 4302.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's why Google, when you use a hardware authentication,  also has a button that said, did you lose your YubiKey  and will fall back to the authenticator?  So in that case, it is exactly as secure as the software authenticator.  No more because you have a fallback.

Start time: 4302.62
End time: 4319.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the same similar thing when  fingerprint authentication started coming out on phones.  It doesn't make your phone more secure, makes it less secure,  because you can still get in with it with a with a passcode.  Passcode. So it's now a passcode or a fingerprint.  So it's multi multi factor.  The hackers have one more option.

Apparently, Samsung's having an event with the Note 9 in a week on August 9th.  And then there's going to be the S10.  I'm not sure. I think it'll be the S10, not the Note 9.  But apparently, Samsung has solved that problem of  fingerprint through the screen.  So you don't need a fingerprint reader.  You just. How is that possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to say that the fingerprint reader, do you use your fingerprint  reader on your MacBook Pro?  I do.  And it will unlock your password vault, right?  I guess it does. Yeah.  That's because, of course, with your password vault,  you're using a very long passcode, you know, 40 character passcode.  It's a pain to have to type that and I have to type it a lot.  Having the fingerprint reader now, maybe that makes it a lot less secure.  I don't know.  Fingerprints are maybe not the best security possible, but still.  Anyway, good news.  Good news. We'll all be using hardware keys, although, frankly,  somebody's got to figure out a way to get rid of passwords entirely.

End time: 4691.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So here's a here's a probably a stupid question that maybe you guys can answer.  I think Apple should have authentication.  They should have deals with companies that offer two factor authentication  where it all goes through iMessage.  Because I was very secure.  That's more secure. Yes, it's very secure.  I mean, if you go iMessage to iMessage, it's highly secure.  So why aren't they working with companies that offer two factor?  Because that would be a secure way to get it through SMS,  but it would be through iMessage.

Better to have it in the US.  I agree.  Better to have it in the US.  And also if you look at the EU, they're finding these companies and they could change the  tax rules and have retroactively.  So they retroactively changed Apple's tax bill.  Is that ridiculous?  And they're just like, yeah, by the way, the tax bill is now this and Apple had to negotiate  with them.  So you want to get that money out of there.

Start time: 4954.58
End time: 4987.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The plan is to have one.  They only need one.  We get one more Android.  I mean, if you look at the pillars of Google, the search franchise, then you have Gmail,  Chrome, and Android, which don't make any money, but drive the search franchise.  And you have YouTube, which in and of itself is an incredible revenue generator.  There's really only two revenue generators, Google, Search, and YouTube.  All the other ones serve those other masters with over a billion users in each one.  So they have Chrome, Android, and I guess apps.  They make a little bit of money off apps.

Start time: 4987.76
End time: 4999.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's really something like 80% ads on Search.  I mean, that's really...  And that's the problem.  But you do have Gmail, Chrome.  But that's the problem.  They've got to find the next pillar.  They should try Social Network.  They did that, yeah.

Start time: 4999.58
End time: 5029.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I mean, they're printing money.  If you look at the gains in online advertising last year, 90% went to two companies, Facebook  and Google, of the gain.  So they're actually taking more market share, Google and Facebook now.  So they've become juggernauts.  And when you look at advertisers, they really are picking one of two things.  If they want to do really granular stuff, they pick Facebook and Google.  And then if they want to do something with...  Targeted.  Yeah, like hyper-targeted to the individual level.  Especially Facebook.  Yeah.  Right?

Start time: 5030.70
End time: 5036.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Google does a pretty good job.  See, Facebook does probably know more about you, but...  Facebook knows your graph better.  Google's pretty efficient, I think.

Start time: 5037.41
End time: 5103.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google knows his intent a lot more.  So they see what's in your Gmail.  That's a very good point.  They know your search.  That may be more valuable than your graph.  It is more valuable in the moment.  So when you type in Tesla or IJAG or Volvo, they know you're in the market for a car.  That's very powerful.  What Facebook can infer with something called audiences is...  And it's called look-alike.  If you were looking for cars, and I was looking for cars, and we're all friends with Mike,  maybe Mike's looking for a car.  So what they will do is they'll say, expand...  Give us a bunch of email addresses.  You give them 10,000 email addresses of people who are on the IJAG or mailing list.  Then it says, give me people like that.  And then it goes and uses an algorithm to try to find similar people.  And it's so effective.  So that's like psychographic weirdness.  But the other thing they're buying is podcasts and sponsorship.  So that actually...  And this is the part where Jason and I...  No, but it's amazing because...  Thank the Lord.  People do want influencers.  And so influencer marketing, whether it's Instagram or podcasts, it kind of falls into the same thing.  There's nothing better than your friend or a friend of a friend saying, hey, I use this product.  BlueWhipers...

Start time: 5105.14
End time: 5139.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can't pretend to have known this, but it really has made it possible to make a living as a podcast.  There's an extra part.  It's not just your friend.  People, I think, want to support the podcast they like.  And so they will actively go out and use those codes.  And boy, you can't get better than that.  So thank you.  I really appreciate those of you who do that.  It is one of the ways we can continue to monetize.  It's been difficult, though.  I have to say, I don't know what your experience has been, but the last two years, so many new podcasts out,  so much attention going to political stuff, away from stuff that we do.  Yeah, but we've been sold out for five years.

Start time: 5139.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's been sold out for a number of years.  It's like, I think there's more choice out there, but people, it's always a flight to quality  and to the host who can really read the ads and who have that loyal audience.  So the thing that's troubling is...

Start time: 5151.42
End time: 5161.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do worry, though, sometimes that Facebook and Google are so efficient  that advertisers are going to say, why would you spare money, spend money anywhere else?  Actually, the real people should worry are network television, people like that.

The thing is, Facebook and Google know you're a New York Times reader.  So they're bundling the New York Times and Wall Street Journal and selling that as affluent newsreaders.  Because they know you have it on your phone.  They know you have it on Chrome.  Completely stealing all the revenue from...  They steal out from underneath the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, Engadget, whatever,  and they tag those people and then they resell them as news and...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, this is a good question. Are they human beings?  This is a conversation we have a lot on here.  Can you blame somebody like Mark Zuckerberg for what Facebook has become?  I've always said no. He's just optimizing for engagement.  He's an engineer and his team are engineers solving a problem.  Incorrect.  You don't think so?

Start time: 5251.70
End time: 5307.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I disagree wholeheartedly.  Me too.  Good.  Finally. Here we go.  No, I mean, Zuckerberg never met a decision where he didn't want to take the route that made the most money for Facebook without thinking about the implication of ...  He's well aware of the consequences?  100%. I mean, you cannot be that good at building a business and recruiting that level of talent without being aware.  And they specifically said their credo has been move fast, break things.  So if you look at it, we've talked about it here before, but in every instance where they could take out friction that is necessary to maintain quality, they would remove the friction.  So reviewing ads and checking that people buying with rubles are not running racist ads is something they could have easily done.  They have no desire to do that.  They have no desire to review ads. Now that they've been caught, now they're reviewing ads.  With groups, how many groups are you a member of that you didn't sign up for on Facebook?

Start time: 5307.66
End time: 5309.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know. I actually deactivated my account.

Start time: 5310.39
End time: 5311.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. But if you go, you can ...

Start time: 5312.58
End time: 5317.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that what happens? So you get signed up for groups you didn't want to be ...  Yes.  They sign you up to groups?

Start time: 5318.20
End time: 5321.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no. Your friends can sign you up to different groups.  Your friends can do it?  Yes.

Start time: 5327.72
End time: 5335.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But doesn't that muddy the signal? Because that's a valuable signal. The groups I join, the things I like, that's a signal about me. Why would they let somebody else modify that?

Start time: 5335.60
End time: 5351.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because once you're in the group, that may happen in 10% of the cases, but the other 90%, it's accurate.  So some mom starts a mom's group or a dad starts a dad group and they add all their dad friends. It's going to be accurate most of the time.  And then all of a sudden you're like, well, I didn't join this dad group. But okay, it's pretty dope.

Start time: 5352.28
End time: 5358.56

Transcript:  So you both believe that Mark Zuckerberg understands the implications of this and is not in any way interested ...

Start time: 5360.44
End time: 5384.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I believe that the culture of Facebook is more than most other companies, heavily influenced by Mark Zuckerberg's own perspective.  And I believe, this is just my belief, that Mark Zuckerberg is completely amoral.  Correct.  What he sees instead of morality, he sees can we get away with this? Will we get complaints?  If we don't get complaints, then it's the right thing to do. If we get complaints, we'll apologize.

Start time: 5385.44
End time: 5391.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  He's learned Chinese. He's begged the Chinese government to allow him in there, knowing full well that one of the rules of the road for going into China would be you have to turn over dissonance, journalists, etc.  Sergey Brin also had the opportunity to bring Google into China a decade ago and he said, no, we're going to put everything outside.  It's not worth it for us. We're not going to give it up.  So you can just look at the character of Sergey Brin versus Zuckerberg.

Transcript:  What I say is that Apple and Facebook don't have to make trillions and trillions and trillions of dollars. They don't have to do that.  And just because they're doing it for the money doesn't make it righter.  You know what I'm saying?  Exactly.  It's like, you know, Facebook is way too big. They make way too much money as it is now.  I have no interest in excusing Facebook's behavior by saying, oh, well, you know, they have to do that because that's the way you do X, Y, Z.  You know, you don't have to do X, Y or Z. You can be a somewhat ethical company and still...

Start time: 5510.60
End time: 5538.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and also he has super control of that company. It's a super voting chair.  So unlike the old days where he could get ousted, he can't be ousted. So he could actually even take a more principled stand.  Right.  And because of the super founder design and the architecture of these companies now, someone like Sergey Abramovich says, yeah, we're not going to go to China.  If you don't like that, don't buy our stock.  Right.  You know, and if you don't, Facebook would say we're not going to operate in China. We don't believe in, you know, handing people over to the government to be tortured.  And that's it.

Start time: 5538.62
End time: 5546.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Well, I have to say I agree with you. I'm thrilled to hear you say that.  But I'm surprised a little bit because as I mean, you're obviously a capitalist.

Start time: 5546.58
End time: 5609.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm a capitalist, but I believe in human rights.  I don't think these two things, you know, cannot coexist.  You know, we if you look at our democracy, capitalism and democracy have not always gone together, but they have done a wonderful job in our country.  And if you look at other countries like China, they have this quasi capitalism, crooked capitalism that's going on with, you know, authority, authoritarian control.  And we have to say that's not the best model.  And this is why it's very important for us to have leadership that and to aspire to be honest, you know, really high quality and moral and ethical leaders.  That's why I was so upset by when we tortured people after 9-11 where we put people in Guantanamo, wouldn't give them a trial because that gives evidence to other countries that hey, maybe it's OK.  That democracy like, yeah, they're hypocritical.  They have the death penalty.  They have Guantanamo and they waterboard people.  We have to maintain a very high standard in terms of human rights.  So we can be an example.  Obviously, that hasn't worked out so well in the last couple of years.  Well said.

But Thiel did.  Thiel did at the Republican convention.  Yeah, I'm going to go there.  I'm going to tell everybody my opinion.  But they can't.  Why?  Well, I think the reason they didn't, the executives there didn't publicly support Hillary Clinton.  They were playing both sides.  Was they were playing both sides.

Transcript:  I think we should do the technology of winemaking.  We should do.  That would be great.  They may have a robotic foot for pressing the grapes.  It's all sorts of stuff that could be in there.  Our show today brought to you by Moogsoft.  If you are the IT person who gets the alerts, who gets the tickets,  I don't have to tell you.  It's nuts, right?  It's crazy.  And a lot of those alerts that come in are meaningless.  They're the cascade effect from the causal error.  And then you have to kind of go, well, okay, and dig through that  and find the real problem so you can fix it.  You need Moogsoft AIOps, artificial intelligence,  for IT operations, reduces those IT alerts and tickets by up to 90%,  turns that pinball machine that you're in into a Zen garden.  All you get is actionable work items.  They call them situations.  So they cluster the events.  They do this, by the way, you don't have to teach it anything.  No rules, no filters, no models.  It learns.  It's already learned a lot from previous users,  and then it will learn more from your situation.  So they can say, oh, yeah, when all those things happen,  it's because this is going on.  So you get a situation.  All the events are clustered into a situation,  and then you solve that problem.  And you are a hero.  Moogsoft AIOps has your back.  I didn't replace you.  It was created by IT professionals to make them support heroes.  Heroes in the business, you want this.  Now, if you're a CIO or a CTO, trust me,  you don't get those alerts, but your IT team will thank you,  and they will be more effective, a lot more effective.  HCL Technologies is a global IT managed service provider.  They put Moogsoft AIOps into their dry ice platform.  This is an amazing dry ice platform.  It's amazing for managed service providers.  It's the event management layer in there.  It's helped their clients streamline operational workflows.  They've actually reduced the time that takes to detect the correct  life cycle of incident tickets by a huge amount,  33% reduction in the meantime to restore.  That means you're going to get that server back up and running.  You're going to solve that problem 33% faster,  which means you can support more customers with high quality service,  and you can keep the operational costs low, the efficiency up.  This is a win for everybody.  With Moogsoft AIOps, you can reduce your IT alerts and tickets by up to 90%,  guaranteed, be more effective, be more efficient.  You've got to check it out.

Moogsoft.com.  We use HipChat, as you know.  Me too.  Sold.  You used to use HipChat.  I used to.  I know.  Who's bigger, Atlassian or Slack?

Start time: 6144.54
End time: 6175.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Slack is bigger, for sure, and they're making more money and they're growing faster.  Atlassian has a bunch of different businesses,  and they're I think worth maybe $2 billion in the stock market.  Right now, Slack is probably worth $8 billion.  Wow.  Maybe the HipChat business is 10% of Atlassian, maybe $200 million.  If they were to get even 1% or 2% or 3% of Slack for this,  this would be Slack blocks a potential competitor acquirer.  They get all those users, and they defend against Microsoft.

Start time: 6175.82
End time: 6194.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could see somebody like Microsoft.  Well, Microsoft's got Teams, which they're giving away.  Which they just made free.  Teams are 300 or less.  It's not as good.  We've been looking, because we have to solve this question about,  okay, where do we go now?  I bet you Google was hot on the heels of HipChat,  because if you're Google, this is something you lack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For cloud computing, but this is obviously consumer enterprise  is the new category of things that kind of work bottom-up inside an enterprise.  So I could just see Amazon being willing to jump the fence  and pay a large number for this.  Interesting.  I could see Google building it and including it in Google Docs.  They don't have anything like that for Docs.

Start time: 6226.58

Transcript:  They could easily add it.  They have Hangouts. That's terrible.

Start time: 6230.31
End time: 6239.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hangouts are good for...  I know a lot of developer teams love that Hangouts product  for when they do their stand-up calls and video calls.  They're addicted to it, but it's not good for persistent chat.

Start time: 6240.40
End time: 6258.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the key with Slack and with HipChat, is you can go back in time.  You can see everything you ever said.  The API integration is the biggest.  For us, that's the big deal. That's where Teams falls flat.  I asked our team, if we're going to move, we could move to Teams for free.  Because Slack is not cheap.  $7 a person per month?  To me, that's not cheap.

Start time: 6259.08
End time: 6262.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know. If you have 20 people, all of a sudden you're paying a couple thousand a year.  You've got to think about this.

Start time: 6263.41
End time: 6273.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then you have a free tier.  I said, do you use integrations?  And they gave me, yeah. We've got Jira, we've got Confluence.  We have a bunch of things we integrate in.  And Teams doesn't do that.

Start time: 6274.26
End time: 6292.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not yet. They need to get Zapier.  I like Zapier a lot.  And if this, then that.  I don't know if they support Microsoft Teams yet.  When they do that, it would unlock a lot.  Yeah, because you could just integrate that way.  But it really is a problem.  It is the defensibility of Slack is predicated on all these edge cases where people who are making other products.

Start time: 6292.84
End time: 6302.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just works with everything you already use.  It's got a great API. It's very easy to write Slack bots.  So anyway, Slack acquired.  Big win.

Start time: 6302.58
End time: 6307.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really like they acquired the users.  So HipChat is going away.

Start time: 6307.60
End time: 6308.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, they're going to sunset it in February.

Start time: 6308.90
End time: 6323.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it was really a deal, a partnership between the two companies.  Slack is going to use, integrate with some Atlassian services in exchange for this transfer of users.  Now, how many Slack users are going to keep, how many HipChat users are going to keep using Slack?

Start time: 6323.92
End time: 6351.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So what we've been looking at, and I'm sure we're a perfect example of what people are going to do, is how easy is it going to be to move?  And I was hoping and expecting that, well, it would just happen.  You won't have to do anything.  It'll just suddenly be using Slack.  It's not going to be that easy.  We have to export.  We have to import.  They're going to lose some people.  That's not good.  Now, I imagine they're working as quickly as they can on a transparent switch over.  But that little difficulty gives an opening to Microsoft Teams.  Yes.  And that and the price.

Start time: 6352.37
End time: 6362.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One footnote in all this.  I heard somewhere that Microsoft Teams actually has more paid users than Slack.  Slack has three million paid users.  Really?  How do they count that?

Start time: 6362.58
End time: 6370.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it like all the people who had out looked for something for Teams?  They just don't know.  But they didn't have teams.  Wasn't free.  They didn't have a free tier.

Start time: 6371.16
End time: 6373.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So basically 100% of their users until recently paid users.

Start time: 6376.26
End time: 6404.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Microsoft claims that 200,000 organizations use Teams.  Slack says it has half a million.  Eight million people use the service.  Three million paid.  What we don't know is how many people are paying for Teams.  But some of that is not paying for Teams as part of their Office 365 subscription.  It's muddy.  In fact, most of them.  Yeah.  So we're not an office house.  We're kind of a Google G Suite house.  So that's one of the reasons I thought, well, why didn't Google buy this?  That would have been nice.

Start time: 6404.88
End time: 6407.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Google could really use another communications product.

Start time: 6407.58
End time: 6409.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they have G-Chat.

Start time: 6409.58
End time: 6430.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You could say that about Microsoft too.  They got Yammer.  They got Skype.  And now they have Teams.  Teams is nice.  It looks good.  I asked our team.  I said, look, we wouldn't have to pay for it.  By the way, there are a lot of other kind of smaller open source alternatives.  There's Flock, which is not free.  There's Mattermost.  There's Riot.

Start time: 6430.58
End time: 6438.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What's the difference between Skype and their chat?  Skype had their own Slack chat thing for groups.  It's true.

Start time: 6438.58
End time: 6450.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's very confusing.  Microsoft's kind of like Google in that regard where they have a number of different solutions.  Yeah, just bring back AIM.  In fact, in a way, Slack succeeds because it's so monolithic.  It's Slack.  It's one thing.  There's nothing else.

Start time: 6451.19
End time: 6454.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's Slack.  There's a lot of third party integrations and things like that that make it appealing.

Start time: 6454.82
End time: 6466.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It works with everything, including Google Docs and everything.  But the free version of Slack only allows 10 integrations.  You can only keep 10,000 messages of history.  That might be fine for us.  Actually, we may end up doing that.

Start time: 6466.58

Transcript:  That's actually an interesting question.

Start time: 6473.80
End time: 6487.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a big thing going around a couple of years ago that they might have been hacked  and everything was going to be released at some point.  They really need to encrypt that stuff.  I believe that after that happened, they added encryption.

Start time: 6488.88
End time: 6505.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They added encryption fairly recently.  You certainly would want to use that.  I actually use Keybase.  Keybase?  Yeah, but see, it's free.  It's really encrypted.  It's using PGP encryption for everything, including encrypted Git and encrypted team messaging.

Start time: 6505.76
End time: 6520.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some people are using Telegram for this because Telegram has a desktop app.  Telegram would work.  You sync it.  You take your app and then you put it into your camera and it does a QR code.  Yeah, I like it.  And it authenticates that your phone is who you are.

Start time: 6521.02
End time: 6533.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Unfortunately, Telegram does roll your own encryption, which is never a good thing.  They claim, oh no, we're absolutely secure.  We've got a bounty.  Anybody breaks our encryption?

Start time: 6537.76
End time: 6568.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's an interesting thing because, of course, for a long time, the creator of  Telegram was Pavel Durov, who was the Zuckerberg of Russia.  He had the number one social network in Russia until Putin basically stole it.  And Durov is now outside of Russia and he claims to hate Putin.  Sounds like a good cover to me.  But you can never be sure, right?  I watch The Americans.  I don't buy it.  I trust no one.  After Maria Butina, now I'm thinking Red Sparrow was a true story, right?  Of course.

Transcript:  Ecuador has decided to...  Who is?  Julian Assange.  Ecuador has decided to withdraw his status, his protected status.  He's been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for ages.  They're going to throw him from the window.  As soon as he walks out that door, he'll be arrested immediately and extradited to the  United States.  And that will be very interesting because, well, for a long time I thought good things  about Julian and WikiLeaks.  I thought they are telling truth to power.  It was because of them that we learned about some of the drone usage in the United States.  I thought that was very good.  But now I wonder if he is not, in fact, an agent.  They're telling lies for power.

Start time: 6681.72
End time: 6689.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 6710.44
End time: 6737.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  He wanted everybody to talk about him and mission accomplished.  But he convinced Chelsea Manning to give up all this stuff.  Chelsea Manning was just like...  She just got screwed.  She got screwed and she went to jail for all this time and he just gets away with it.  And I think the Russians were giving him all this hacked stuff.  He was happy to get it to become famous, but he just released it without looking at it.  It's completely...

Start time: 6737.80
End time: 6766.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't it possible though that Julian Assange is on the side of the angels and that governments  are so upset by WikiLeaks that they're doing anything they can?  The Swedes tried, that failed.  Now the US is working with Ecuador.  Clearly, the US is putting a lot of pressure on Ecuador.  They were able to get Ecuador to withdraw their breast milk resolution by threatening  them economically.  I'm sure that's what's going on with Assange.  Isn't it possible that he's just an enemy of all governments?

Start time: 6821.40
End time: 6868.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They went conservative.  They did have a point of view, but they didn't accuse them of having an affair.  They didn't...  None of that stuff.  But they showed...  They showed the best part of the movie to me was all the power players saying, okay,  how are we going to spin this?  How are we going to do this?  Call this guy and turn his arm...  It's like, why is the dog?  We know that stuff happens.  But then at the end of the movie, I hope this isn't a spoiler.  It's not a spoiler.  They show actual footage of people in Massachusetts being interviewed after Kennedy gave the speech  supposedly coming clean after you've gotten all this information about what really happened,  how they spun it.  They were interviewing people on the streets going, yeah, I think...  You could see the public just completely buying Hook, Line, and Sinker this concocted fabrication  about...

And so they have completely divergent positions of party affiliation, but they're both intellectually  honest and then in the middle you have this sort of intellectual dark web that's been growing.

Start time: 6925.72
End time: 6956.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't call them intellectually honest.  They're both really, they both artificially tar the left, the right, because that's how  you juice up viewers.  You know what I'm really liking a lot these days is National Review for the right.  They are intellectually honest.  I like Reason magazine.  Reason magazine is great too.  They're not exactly all the way to the right.  It's like weed smoking capitalists basically.  But actually check out the National Review for solid, intellectually rigorous, honest,  like right wing.  I do think so.

And it's a lot of it is because Linkbait, if you want to succeed as a publication on  the web or anywhere, you want to generate hits, you want to generate clicks.  And the way we do it is getting people wound up.  And it seems to me everything, everything that's happening right now, nobody's, nobody  who doesn't get people wound up is going to have a voice.

In a lot of them.  Now, we've known this has been going on for a long time, that the hackers, they did this  in the Ukraine, sorry, not the Ukraine.  They did this in Ukraine, an independent nation called Ukraine, not a region of the  Soviet Union called the Ukraine.  And they brought the grid down just for four hours.  It was clearly a test.

Transcript:  Maybe. Although this, as you said, this has been going on for a long time.  We've known about it and it's still happening.  According to the journal, the Russian hackers who worked for a shadowy state sponsored  group previously identified as Dragonfly or energetic bear.  There's also Fancy Bear.  Fancy, he's very fancy.  There's a lot of bears broke into a supposedly secure air gapped or isolated networks  owned by utilities with relative ease by first penetrating the networks of key vendors.  This is how Target was broken into.  It was the HVAC vendor who had trusted relationships with the power companies.  According to the Department of Homeland Security, they got to the point where they  could have thrown switches and disrupted power flows.  But here's the point. DHS has been warning utilities since 2014.

Transcript:  They're going to have to create some controls and fines for these and this critical  infrastructure. I think people would consider it an act of war if they did this kind of stuff.  And they should.  Most people don't consider it an act of war to what they did with Hillary's Clinton's  email and hacking into the DNC and hacking our election.  They don't consider that an act of war.  That's why they do it.  And that's why they do it.  So I think this might be a line they don't want to cross.  But I do think we need to take it much more seriously.

Our credit cards don't work.  They don't. Well, I'll just use a check.  Our show is brought to you.  This portion of it is brought to you by Uber.  I use Uber all the time.  And in fact, even in the elite Uber movement, I I I I I struggle.  And I said, no, this is a great service.  I and when especially when you travel and you know, there's an Uber  and you've got the app and they are really moving forward.  That's the message they wanted me to tell you that under new management,  they are doing a lot to improve your experience and your trust.  A lot of new features for riders designed to take the stress out of the pickup.  You've got pick up notes in the Uber app, which lets you share a note  with your driver on what you look like, how to spot you, which I love.  You could choose a color to light up your phone screen.  So you can say, OK, my phone's going to light up red.  Look for that. And you hold it up.  The driver goes right to you. That is huge. Brilliant. Yeah.  They've also, of course, let you tell somebody that you're on your way  so they know what car you're in when you're coming.  Uber is really committed to improving the ride sharing experience  for both riders and drivers.  Recently, my daughter, Abby, I use her as a lot as an example.  I had bought her a car.  She had four accidents in a row.  And I said, OK, Abby, guess what?  You're not driving anymore.  But it's cheaper for me to pay for your Uber.  It's safer. I know.  I know she's not going to get in an accident.  She could text her a little hard out.  And it's less expensive for me to let her Uber everywhere.  In fact, it's been a huge savings when you add in gas and insurance  to the cost of the car. Huge savings. Yep.  And I feel better. I know she's safer.  I know she my mom. Same thing.  Eighty five. And I use her as an example all the time, too.  She's not driving anymore.  We got to give up her car a few years ago.  My sister, who lives nearby, was driving around.  But she had to wait till Eva could do it.  I said, Mom, here, I put Uber on her phone.  I said, I'm going to put my credit card in so you don't have to think about it.  She says, oh, I don't know.  She loves it now.  She's Ubering everywhere.  And for an 85 year old, that's given her real freedom.  Yeah, it's really huge.  She can go to the doctor, she can go shopping.  And the Uber drivers are great. She loves them.

Transcript:  As a nomad, can I put in a pitch for taking Ubers when you're in a foreign city?  So like in cities like Mexico City, where almost nobody speaks English  for some reason, I have no idea why this is the only city in the world  where nobody speaks English, where there are a lot of dangerous neighborhoods  and you don't as a visitor don't know where they are, where the city  is the size of a country, essentially like the twenty twenty two million,  Uber is an absolute godsend in Mexico City and places like that cost almost nothing.  You get the person rolls up not in a Volkswagen Beetle,  but in a brand new car that take you right through the worst areas safely.  They pick you up with the app.  They pick you up. You can be.  We we actually got lost in Mexico City at night.  It was like midnight.  We're like, oh, this is not good.  Just they came right to us.  And it was fantastic. So when you travel.

Start time: 7738.84

Transcript:  So I think it's a new Uber, and I think that's the communication  they want to give you. They're moving forward.  This is a company that is changing the way we we get around that.  And and and so please just consider it.  I I still use it all the time and I trust my mom and my sister with it.  I just think it's the right thing to do.  If you want to find out more about what they're doing,  the improvements they've made to the app, their commitment to you as customers,  go to Uber dot com slash moving forward, Uber dot com slash moving forward.  Here's what I'm sad about, because we did do ads for this.  This is the Bosch funded a company called Mayfield Robotics.  I remember this. And remember this cute little curry robot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Bosch, I thought it was really cool. Bosch put money into it.  But I guess I gather what's happened is that Bosch is startup platform.  The money's run out.  Mayfield says we're not going to go anywhere.  They've got these genius guys and gals working there.  I think they've got a really interesting product.  But if you did put down money on a curry as I did,  maybe because of our ads, you will be getting a refund,  which at least I respect that.  Sure. A lot of kickstarters.  You put the money down, you get nothing.  This one you consider all kickstarters a donation.

Like the number of use cases that need a public decentralized,  a public decentralized ledger, like it's a fun thing to be like,  yeah, we'll put Uber and eBay on that.  But it's like, but that makes no sense.  It doesn't provide any value.  I don't need every ride on a public ledger that creates more problems.  That's right.  So I think it's one of those things where people got very excited  about a technology like VR.  It reminds me of the early days of VR in the 90s, where people were like,  oh, my God, can you imagine you're going to float through the Yahoo catalog?  You know, you're going to be pulling out photos and you open up a folder  of photos and you can all walk around the photo and then jump into the photos.  Like, OK, but that doesn't sound actually that cool.  Why? Like I can hit the next button and go through a gallery on my computer.  And so sometimes he's and I always can tell when like when the Los Angeles  scene gets obsessed with the technology, you know, because they're all just  unemployed producers with nothing to do.  So this is my L.A. producer test.  When all the L.A. producers start calling me, I'm like, oh, I get it.  So with VR, they were like, oh, yeah, creating virtual worlds.  And then they came back again.  Yeah, creating Oculus, Vargas, where, oh, no, AR.  We're creating our experiences.  And they're not doing any work.  They're just writing proposals and trying to get consulting agreements.  So it's nonsense.
