Transcript:  We actually are having you on for one reason only, because we want an Olympic update.  So what is the Olympic update?

Start time: 167.75
End time: 210.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Olympic update is disaster zone.  It's all going to be awful.  As far as we can tell, or certainly as far as the papers over here say,  I'm unfortunate enough to have my office next to one of the big event centres in London where they're doing the horse riding.  And because of the lottery system where they allocated tickets,  I sort of have all the inconvenience of everybody coming to where I am to come and watch the Olympics,  but none of the tickets or any niceness to actually make up for it.  So for me, it's a complete Olympic disaster.  And, you know, there's been all the stories that the bus drivers don't know how to drive from the airport to the Olympic Village.

Start time: 211.42
End time: 218.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Four hours, one of the Olympians was locked.  This is going to be the most tweeted Olympics ever, right?  We're going to know everything that happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the border patrol people here, like the people that police the airports to check immigration status,  are going on strike the day before the opening ceremony.  So that's nice.  So it's just basically going to be...  I mean, we Brits are a cynical bunch at the best of times.  If this isn't the most cynical thing in history, I'm surprised.

And we are now drinking a little Trephathan from Napa County, a little Cabernet Sauvignon.  It's all right.  It's okay.  That's okay.  It's okay.  John's an enophile.  Also with us...

Transcript:  That's right. That's something else.  Anyway, welcome to This Week in Tech.  We have a nice audience, about 25 people who have come from all over, including New Zealand, Atlanta, Philadelphia.  They beat our Giants this afternoon and points elsewhere.  Texas.  So I guess the big story, and it must have been a bit of a shocker to y'all, is Marissa Meyer is now the CEO at Yahoo.  They announced it Monday. She walked into her office on Tuesday.  There you have it.  The company is completely transformed.  Yeah.  What do you think? You must have been surprised.

Start time: 326.09
End time: 331.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, I think...  I wasn't that surprised. I mean, the Yahoo board has been making idiotic decisions since the beginning.

Start time: 332.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think this is an idiotic decision?

Start time: 334.78
End time: 337.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What experience does she have? I mean, just tell me what it is.

Start time: 337.72
End time: 342.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thirteen years at Google, 20th engineer. She was in charge of Search at Google during the heyday of Google Search.

Start time: 342.74
End time: 350.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm talking about management experience. What management experience does she have to run a multi-billion dollar company as a CEO?  If she has some, tell me what it is.

Start time: 351.78
End time: 378.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's 37. She's got a lot of energy, young woman.  She's certainly going to attract engineers.  Yeah, you nailed it. You nailed it.  She's going to attract engineers because they're going to be excited about having somebody high profile like that.  Michael Arrington wrote Marissa Meyer, a new hope for Yahoo.  He said she's so good that it's very likely that Yahoo didn't even have the guts to call her.  She probably called them looking for a new challenge.  She's worth $300 million. She's not doing it for the money.

Start time: 379.06
End time: 382.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No. Well, she's going to get $100 million more, so maybe she's going to get some money.  She's going to get some money, yeah.

Start time: 383.78
End time: 392.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mark Andreessen says he's shocked Yahoo was able to hire someone of Meyer's caliber.  Fred Wilson says Yahoo is no longer dead to him.

Start time: 393.02
End time: 400.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, this just shows you the psychophantic nature of the entire Silicon Valley.  Seriously, it's almost pathetic how pandering they are.

Start time: 401.97
End time: 419.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the other hand, according to – and I loved this.  This was Nicholas Carlson writing in Business Insider who just dished the dirt.  He said he called – he spoke at length on the phone with a former Google executive who worked with Meyer  and said, twice, this is a great day for Google and a nail in the coffin for Yahoo.  Wow.

Start time: 421.70
End time: 436.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm not going to go that far. I mean, she won't do – I mean, she's just going to –  I wrote a column in PCMag about this and saying she's actually going in –  and I don't wish her ill, but she's going into a snake pit  and she's just going to be eaten up and spit out.  She'll be – if she lasts a year, I'll be stunned.

Start time: 437.32
End time: 456.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, this is their fifth CEO in just a couple of years.  They keep going – I mean, they had Terry Semel who was the Hollywood guy.  Then he left. Jerry Yang took over. They had an interim CEO.  Then they had Carol Bartz who lasted less than a year.  Right. And Thompson.  Then Scott Thompson who lasted less – a few months because of his resume inaccuracies.

Start time: 456.74
End time: 467.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. No, this is, again, the board.  What's changed that all of a sudden this is a genius hire?  They screw up and screw up and screw up and screw up and screw up and screw up.

Start time: 467.76
End time: 482.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're saying just another one. Well, here's one thing that's maybe changed.  I think this was from Kara Swisher who seems to have great sources.  She thinks it's activist investor Dan Loeb, a guy who's been an outsider.  There's no evidence of this.  You may be right. I don't know. I'm just saying.

Start time: 483.36
End time: 538.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's kind of interesting that they've gone with Marissa rather than Ross  because that makes kind of a pretty distinct statement about what Yahoo wants to be, right?  We're always saying what is Yahoo and what does it want to be?  Ross Levinson was the media guy, the ad guy, the guy that was set up to take Yahoo  into the big media business, right, to be the next big media brand.  Marissa Mayer is completely not that. She is product. She is engineering. She is tech.  I think that says that Yahoo wants to be a business that's focused on product and technology  and startups and building sort of user experiences rather than focused on advertising.  I think this is a pretty interesting choice that a lot of people I talk to inside Yahoo  thought that Levinson was the right guy for the job because internally everyone's kind of moving  in this advertising direction, but it seems like the board and Marissa have probably got other ideas.

Start time: 538.82
End time: 552.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that is the question. In fact, I think we posed this on this week in Google.  Yahoo seems to have a choice, and Mayer acknowledges this, between being a media company  and a web services company, web services like Flickr, media like OMG and a lot of other...

Start time: 552.96
End time: 555.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What was your conclusion on the show, the Google show?

Start time: 556.22
End time: 578.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We felt that she would take... Terry Semel started it down this content company direction,  this portal company, and that she would take them in the opposite direction of the web services company,  abandon a lot of the content plays. Now, I don't know, what is the strong suit for Yahoo?  Is it Yahoo Finance, Yahoo Sports?  Yahoo, you named the two. Flickr's certainly not.

Start time: 578.76
End time: 596.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Yahoo Sports, they've actually developed reporters. They're very famous amongst the...  if you listen to sports talk shows, Yahoo guys are really famous.  They have a great team.  They have a great team. They've got good editors. I don't know who they are.  I mentioned in my PCMag column that nobody knows who these people are that are actually running a lot of the stuff.  Yahoo is kind of unfathomable.

Start time: 598.24
End time: 604.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you make that decision to be a content company, you're right. Marissa Mayer is absolutely the wrong person.  She's an engineer. She's a web services person, right?

Start time: 606.43
End time: 612.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You never know what somebody's really like until they get a job like this.  She might be very content oriented, for all we know. I'm not concerned about that.

Start time: 612.72
End time: 622.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But John, if you're saying that she's got very little management creds, she's got even fewer media creds, right?  I mean, the only reason you would bring her in was if Yahoo was deciding web services company, not media company.

Start time: 624.14
End time: 631.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or, as John is saying, flailing and just picking the biggest name they could get and say,  Hey, you, you save us.

Start time: 632.36
End time: 663.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that may all be true, but what Marissa gives Yahoo is a detachment from a list of failures in content creation.  Yahoo has been trying to build up this content empire.  They've been trying to recreate their own little walled garden, and they've been doing very poorly at it, aside from sports and finance.  So what Marissa can do is she can give them a clean break.  She can go in and be the super micromanaging bee boss that kills off the products that don't fit her vision of the future.  And that's not a bad thing. It's just an unknown quantity.

Start time: 664.50
End time: 670.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, here's another thing. In fact, you always have to consider the fact that she's also been she was marginalized at Google, which is one of the reasons she quit.

Start time: 671.20
End time: 673.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. That's that's the only real piece of evidence we have.

Start time: 674.05
End time: 674.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that's not a good thing.

Start time: 674.72
End time: 720.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. That her own Google keepers didn't want her.  But in fact, there's a quote. This is another quote from the Business Insider article, which is, you know, could be completely wrong, but it's fun to read because it's so dishy.  Yes. This is a quote from an executive, a Google executive.  Marissa is a nightmare of a human being, but she gets things done.  If being a good person were necessary to be a CEO, we wouldn't have Apple and a lot of other CEO roles were empty.  I think the real problem is we don't know anything about Marissa Meyer.  I have watched every speech.  I've seen her interviewed by Mike Harrington on the stage, and she's so well media trained.  She says nothing.  Yes, that's true.  Nothing. And I don't think we even know who Marissa Meyer is.  We have to use these gossipy articles to try to understand who she is as a person.  I don't think we know.

Start time: 721.48
End time: 729.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've always thought, by the way, that Yahoo should have brought in, even though it would never happen, Steve Case, former AOL founder, because he's essentially they're trying to be AOL.

Start time: 730.83
End time: 735.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But isn't that a failed strategy?  I mean, isn't that I mean, isn't that the problem?  I don't know, is it?  It's an old strategy.

Start time: 735.72
End time: 756.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't know what this failed strategy is because you can't figure out what they're up to.  They're still making money. It's not like a losing operation.  No, no.  But it's it's it's fading.  And you don't know if it's because they don't know what they're doing, which is a possibility.  Right.  Or if it's because of the infighting or it reminds me of when Hearst took over the Examiner.  They put him in there and then I went over to work for a while.

Start time: 756.72
End time: 761.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  William Randolph Hearst III.  The third, your friend.  Grandson of the original William Randolph Hearst.

Start time: 761.72
End time: 794.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He put him in and the place was a nightmare.  It had been all these little empires have been created.  You were a columnist.  Yeah. Yeah.  And I went in there a lot and I'd see that this was this is never going to get fixed because there's all these little mini empires that have been created and established, firmly established.  Like Microsoft.  Well, Microsoft has other issues with their stack ranking and they get they turn people over.  But Yahoo, I think, is filled with this sort of thing.  And I don't think you're going to budge them at all.  She's going to go in there.  Nothing's going to get done.  They're going to submarine her efforts.  They're going to get frustrated.  The numbers aren't going to come in that they're looking for.  And she's done.

Start time: 795.78
End time: 802.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing that if they were looking for a kind of this sort of a well connection that John Miller would have been a good person to go for.

Start time: 802.88
End time: 815.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there's like a half a dozen people that have been a good person to go for.  But I think whoever said this, I think there's some truth to it.  They wanted to get it and make a big splash.  And this made a big splash.  I give them credit for that.

Start time: 815.72
End time: 827.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're getting what they want.  They've got buzz.  I mean, whether or not you like her or you hate her, there's people who say she's brilliant.  There's people who say she's a nightmare of a human being.  People are paying attention to Yahoo again.  And that hasn't happened for a while.

Start time: 827.88
End time: 843.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, I mean, no, we love Yahoo.  This has been a great soap opera for the last three years.  It's been really fun.  Microsoft tried to buy them for what, sixty billion dollars?  I mean, the whole thing has been a stare.  Thirty one.  Another botch.  Well, I wonder at this point, if Steve Ballmer is still saying dodge that bullet.  I bet he is.

Start time: 846.24
End time: 849.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Actually, from the sounds of some of these Steve Ballmer articles, he's probably not saying that.

Start time: 849.96
End time: 894.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who knows what he's saying?  He's saying developers, developers, developers.  This is the other view.  This is again from the Nicholas Carlson article at Business Insider.  The other view, more common amongst longtime Googlers.  And I have to say, given my experience, this is the one I would kind of say seems accurate, is that Meyer is a publicity-craving, lucky, early Googler whose public persona outstripped her actual authority and power at the company.  Where she was once a rising star, thanks to a bullying managerial style, but had become marginalized over the past couple of years.  I mean, that's for sure true.  We don't know why, because I don't know why, but she was definitely marginalized over the last couple of years.  She wasn't selected by Larry Page to be part of his five executives who run Google.  I thought that was interesting.  They moved her to local.

Start time: 895.39
End time: 898.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, she might not get along with Page.  Maybe it's just that.  It could be a personality thing.

Start time: 898.86
End time: 904.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could just be that.  You're absolutely right.  It's really, we don't know, I guess.  We know that she was a dragon lady.

Start time: 904.96
End time: 912.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we know that?  Well, we know that she used to do things like make executives.  Her colleagues sit outside of her office and take these little five-minute appointments to find out what was going on.

Start time: 913.12
End time: 934.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is how you can spin it.  So, you know, Gina Trapani said, hey, this is great.  She was open to people.  She had office hours and people, anybody from anywhere in the company could come and talk to her.  Sure, they had a lineup because everybody wanted to talk to her.  You could spin it like she was very open.  My doctor's the same way.  Right.  She's just, everybody wanted to talk to her.  Everybody wanted to talk to her.  I don't know.  I have to say.

Start time: 934.76
End time: 935.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll find out.

Start time: 935.72
End time: 986.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The proof's in the pudding.  We'll see what happens.  It's really fun to watch mainstream media like People magazine cover this because, of course,  Marissa Meyer is six months pregnant.  She posed for a Glamour magazine photo shoot.  And that's, of course, the picture that People magazine used of her and her red designer dress on her red yoga ball.  And these are the five.  The kind of ball you used to sit on?  I still sit on.  These are the, but I don't have that red dress.  These are the, and I definitely don't have the legs.  These are the five things that People magazine wants people to know about Marissa Meyer.  Are you ready?  Oh, this is going to be deep.  She made history.  She was the first female engineer at Google.  She's glamorous.  And so is her apartment.  Her cupcake recipe is better than yours.  And she's going to be a mom.  Isn't that all we really need to know about Marissa Meyer?  And you wondered what kind of management experience she had.  That's right.

Start time: 986.80
End time: 992.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People magazine.  Thank you.  She looks a lot better in that dress than I would.  I just say that.

Start time: 993.49
End time: 1047.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, there really isn't much to say.  She is getting an interesting salary structure.  They're giving her a million dollars, but the potential for doubling that if she performs, maybe even tripling that.  They're also making a whole 14 million.  We know this because it's a public company, so they had to file this information.  14 million dollars in Google stock she left on the table.  She's worth 300 million.  I don't think she did this for money.  She's getting potential bonuses worth, I think, another 31 million dollars.  Sounds like money to me.  But it's all vested over two and a half to three years.  Oh, big deal.  It is a big deal if you look at the average term of CEO at Yahoo!  She's going to have a hard time staying that long.  Yeah, that's true.  She's already put out a memo.  Of course, Kara Schwisher has it.  She seems to have some sort of inside pipeline at Yahoo!  We asked Kara to join us.  She couldn't do it today.  But she says, the first memo to Yahoo!  which said very clearly, do not forward.

Start time: 1049.29
End time: 1050.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do not forward and she forwarded it right away?

Start time: 1050.76
End time: 1073.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Immediately forwarded it to Kara Schwisher.  I couldn't be more excited to be here.  Thank you for the warm welcome.  And her main point of this is don't stop, move forward.  Please don't stop working.  That's a bad situation.  When you're in a company, they got a new CEO.  And what she has to tell them is, whatever you do, keep doing what you've been doing until I can figure out what it is.

Start time: 1073.72
End time: 1083.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's actually kind of naive for her to even say that because people do not necessarily stop because a new CEO's got in.  Where does she get that idea that they would?  They're all just going to stop and wait and see what Marissa does.

Start time: 1083.74
End time: 1085.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That is kind of a good point.  But that's her style.

Start time: 1085.98
End time: 1100.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's probably all sitting and having the same conversation that we are, which is Marissa's come in.  Does that mean all this product stuff that I've been working on is out the door?  Or does this mean all this media stuff I've been working on is out the door?  Maybe I'll just kick back for a few weeks while she works it out.

Transcript:  But then there was a response, which is great, from the Flickr team.  Let me see if I can find that.  I don't sure.  Flickr responds.  That was Sean Bonner who did the original single serving site.  And Flickr has responded.  Let me see if I can find it.  Dear internet, come help us make Flickr awesomer.  Flickr.com slash jobs.  I like that.  I don't know.  This is the modern form of corporate communication.  But single serving internets.  Sites they call these.  Single serving websites.  Have you heard that phrase before?

Transcript:  Will that make you happy, John C. DeVorek?  No.  I think I'd like to talk about this.  I find it fascinating.  But the main thing I'm still fascinated about is that they do have a clue about certain  things at Yahoo!  And it's never been exploited properly.  They've got that sports thing going, which is amazing.  And their finance site is the one I use.  I use it all the time.  It's very easy.  It's very logical.  It has a uniqueness to it.  I checked it out against the Google one.  It's better than the Google one.

Transcript:  Now, it's interesting because if you enter into a Google search, you enter in a stock  ticker symbol, you're going to get, of course, Google Finance.  But it's interesting because they do have a link to Yahoo Finance on the search result.  It's usually the second one.  It's the second one, of course, not the first.  And then MSN Money, Daily Finance, CNN Money.  But you know what we should do is let me just click on both of them here.  Let me see here.  Let me see here.  Let me do this.  This is this will be interesting.  So here's Google Finance and here's Yahoo Finance.  So on the Google Finance, you get, you know, everybody's got the charts.  You got the historic information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's the left hand side that's weak on the Google one.  Where you have summary news options.  There's nothing to drill down that's really logical.  If you look in the Yahoo!

You can drill down.  And some of the stuff you run into on this is like, wow.  How did they what kind of a deal did they get to even have this information?  Right.

Transcript:  Now, John, you would know this more than I.  I've got a couple of geek friends who are no longer with Yahoo!  And one of the things that they emailed me as soon as they heard about this was,  she's going to be challenged by how talent poor Yahoo! has gotten.  That they've let go a lot of their most imaginative engineers.  Well, people like Stuart Butterfield and Katerina Fake, who started Flickr,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, see, this is the problem again.  Yahoo is somewhat impenetrable when it comes to figuring out what's going on behind the curtain.  And people do go into it like a Lutterback was going to work there for a while.  Really?  Yeah. And then he came out and he says, I wouldn't touch this place with the 10-foot pole.  It's a mess.  There's nobody that...  Nobody knows what they're doing there.  The command lines are all skewed.  There are people reporting that they don't know who.  Which again, I think is why you'd have these little empires built within.  And I think it's probably part true that you'd have a bunch of, you know,  incompetence in one group.  But then you again, like I said, the finance group, the sports group,  and some of these other subcategories probably don't have this problem.  So I think it's...  I think Lutterback probably was right.  It's a mess. We don't know.

Transcript:  All right. I'm going to throw one more idea out.  Somebody said to me, oh, this is great because maybe because of Marissa Meyer's  connections at Google, Yahoo could maybe merge or do a deal with Google  to share some content, maybe say we'll use Google search instead of Bing search.  Which would be smart.  Could be a rebirth.  I have the other idea.  What if Yahoo joined this axis of evil against Google?  Yahoo, Facebook, they just buried the hatchet and became buddies.  Apple and Microsoft together against Google.  They all for hate Google.

Start time: 1405.54
End time: 1419.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would take your side on this because it's more logical if Marissa left Google angrily.  Right.  Because she was pushed to the side, she would have a grudge.  And this would be the first. I think you nailed it.  I think I would be all in on that.

Start time: 1450.77
End time: 1465.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's pretty hard to decipher at this point.  I guess they're the axis on the basis that there's only one of them.  And the allies, there are multiple of them.  So I guess by default that makes them the axis.  The axis had a couple, right?  Because they had Russia as well.

But if you think about it, you've got Churchill, you've got Roosevelt, you've got Stalin.  I think that's Yahoo, that's Facebook, and that's Microsoft.  No, wait a minute.  Stalin is Facebook.

But first, a visit to GoToMeeting and GoToMeeting.com is the meeting software we use all the time.  It's, you know, we've been using it for years as a great way to share screens with somebody you're meeting with.  If you've got a PowerPoint presentation showing a client, it's easy for them to use, easy for you to use, completely secure Mac and PC compatible.  But the folks at Citrix have this great philosophy.  They're just going to keep making this stuff better.  Same price.  You know, you're a customer, you continue to use it, but they just add features.  So then they add the ability to use your iPhone or your iPad to attend a meeting.  Then they add HD faces.  So now you've got video.  If you visit GoToMeeting.com, you could see this in action.  Actually, the really the best thing to do is to try it.  There's a 30 day free trial because until you see how good this video is, better than Skype, better than anything, we should start probably using it for the show.  Visit GoToMeeting.com.  I click the try free button.  But before you do that, watch this video because you can see it in action.  You can use an iPad and the camera and the mic and the speakers built into the iPad to attend a meeting.  And the video is great.  The ability to see somebody as you meet with them, especially in the summertime, people on vacation, they're traveling, they're all over the place.  Nowadays, companies are distributed everywhere.  It's just fantastic.  You can shrink or expand using the iPads, you know, built in gestures, rearrange the photos, you know, the video of people.  It's just really neat.  A great way to meet.  So here's the deal.  Don't believe me.  Don't believe a video.  Go to the website.  GoToMeeting.com.  Click the try it free button.  The promo code for our show is TWIT.  So click promo code and enter TWIT.  30 days free.  Have as many meetings you want as long as you want.  Really, you know, knock yourself out.  Get a sense of what this can do.  And I think you'll be very impressed.  You will never do another conference call again without GoToMeeting.  I can tell you that.  GoToMeeting.com.  Trial code.  Promo code is TWIT.  Please give it a try.  Story two.  Russian hacker discovers problem with in-app purchasing.  Sets up server in Russia.  And apparently hijacks 30,000 in-app purchases in games.  Apple says, no.  So they quickly get the Russian server folks to shut down the guy's server.  He takes it offshore, keeps running it.  He says, I'm not trying to make money.  I am just trying to demonstrate problems.  Apple will fix this.  They say it won't be really fully fixed until iOS 6, which won't be out for a few months.  Apple says we have a method for validating receipts for in-app purchases.  And it's just that most apps don't do it.  Alex says...

Transcript:  I'll let you explain this, Mr.

Start time: 1783.26
End time: 1818.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the way that Apple runs iTunes is iTunes just acts as the authentication server.  So when you buy something from iTunes, you get a receipt saying you've purchased it, you've paid your money.  Then you go to the server of whoever has actually made the app, and you get to download it.  What they've done is they've been able to create a fraudulent certificate.  So it looks as if you've bought the product.  Your device receives the receipt.  Then when you go to the server of the manufacturer, they let you download it.  And then when that manufacturer tries to redeem their money with iTunes,  iTunes has no record of the purchase.

Well, this is a good test.  Because it's bearing a bunch of repeaters and crap all over the place.  This is such a nightmare RF zone here.  Why is this?  I don't know, actually.

I can see I loaded some movies on it even though it's only got six or eight gigabytes  of storage.  Sucks.  Yeah, it's not got a lot of storage.  So I put about five movies on here.  When I go on an airplane, I'll watch these movies and probably play a little Solitaire  and then I'll go to the movies and I'll go to the movies and I'll play a little Solitaire  and then I'll go to the movies and I'll play a little Solitaire and then I'll play a little  Solitaire and then maybe a little Angry Birds and then I'm coming home.

Transcript:  How important could that be?  Apple glues that stuff in.  It's a nice looking unit from the...  I think it's very nicely designed.  ASUS makes good stuff, but also the price is really what's compelling.  And in fact, according to sources speaking to the Guardian, Charles Arthur there, the  company severely underestimated demand for the device.  The Guardian says that they've run out.  They have run out.  The 8GB version is still available.  It ships within three to five days.  But everybody wants to spend the 50 bucks extra, get 16 gigs, because it's not a lot  of storage.  You can't add an SD card.  And they say there are no more.

They launched it July 18th, completely updated set of code, 50 plus new or improved features.  If you want to know more about it, go to new.squarespace.com.  You know we've been talking about Squarespace for a long time.  It's the best hosting and the best software for running your website, whether it's a blog, a photo gallery, your e-commerce site, whatever you're up to.  But I want you to go to new.squarespace.com right now and take a look at Squarespace 6.  Pricing is the same.  Features are what's changed.  And the offer code for Twit is still Twit 7.  I'll tell you what you get on all of that.  Let's just watch the demo video here.  I've been playing with it now for a few months and it's just so impressive what they've done.  Some of the best, I guess, developers out there working, best designers.  It's making great templates.  Every Squarespace site is unique and I really like that.  And secure too because you're running on their servers with their software.  They keep it up to date for you.  They keep it locked down.  Look at this.  This is when you upload an image.  They make thumbnails at every possible size.  So no matter, this is called responsive design, no matter what kind of device people come to your site on, mobile or big screen, it looks good.  I just think they've done a great job.  Squarespace.com.  You can try Squarespace 6 right now absolutely free.  Absolutely free.  And all you have to do is go to Squarespace.com, click the try it free button.  You don't need to give them a credit card or anything.  I invite you to try the template designs, the responsive design.  Reorder images, drag them around.  It's very fast, very snappy.  They've got sharing in the social media accounts.  They've got great ways, by the way, of updating your site from iPhone or iPad or Android.  The new Squarespace, new content management system.  Faster, easier than ever.  50 new features and you can get 10% off.  So try it free at Squarespace.com.  Click the try it free button.  And then after you've played with it for a couple of weeks and you really get a sense of all that you can do with it, go on over and buy.  And if you use the offer code twit, you'll save 10% off your first purchase, which is a good reason to make that a year long package.  Prices are as low as $16 when you buy a year.  And they throw in the registration for you and they do all the wiries and everything like that.  Squarespace.com.  The new Squarespace.  We're not calling it Squarespace 6, by the way.

It's like five bucks.  Yeah.  So $15.  I bought every version you could get.  Yeah.  Why?  Because I love it.  It really is better.  It's on the iPhone, on the desktop.

Transcript:  It's easy.  So on the desktop, the search is so much faster than normal Apple Mail search.  Like when you're trying to get to people, it makes it a lot quicker to sift through your  messages.  On the iPhone, it's so much easier to navigate multiple accounts.  It also has this amazing left-right swipe view, which the standard Apple Mail on the  iPhone doesn't have, where you can scroll up and down to go through your inbox, but  then you can swipe left and right to get your priority inbox or just your red S's.

We're excited to announce Sparrow has been acquired by Google.  Now, they're still selling it, but they say no more updates.  And basically, this is what we call now an acquire.

End time: 2777.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're hiring these guys.  So wait a minute.  You're telling me they just bought them to close them down?  This is a conflict.  This is against the antitrust.  That's what you're not supposed to do.  You buy a competition, and then you shut them down because they're ...  I don't think it's because it's competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they wanted the team, and this is what they did with Milk.  This is what they do with Time and Time Again.  But I think what's happened ... Facebook does this all the time.  Drop.io was put out of business because they got Sam Lessin who created it, but they said,  no, but you're going to do timelines so we don't need this startup.  I always wonder about this.  Don't you think ... I'm mad.

End time: 2814.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or consider this possibility.  You've got a company, whatever it is, let's say XYZ, and you want the team.  So there's a team of maybe three or four key guys, right?  And so you buy the company for $100 million, and the money gets ...  Exactly, what happens?  Why don't you just give the guys $50 million each or $20 million each and ...  And just come on over.  And leave the company there.  Leave the company alone.

End time: 2831.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John, in most cases, if they're moving to something that would be like a similar field,  the reason you wouldn't do it is because if they were key people,  they'd have non-compete clauses in their contracts.

Start time: 2832.46
End time: 2842.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not if they were the guys that were running the place and drew out the contracts.  You can't non-compete with yourself.  I'm the CEO.  I'm going to write a contract that's going to be amenable to me.  There's not going to be a non-compete in there.

Start time: 2851.72
End time: 2868.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just seems weird to me.  Some people say, get over it.  That's what happens.  A company does well.  They sell a product.  They get sold.  They make some money.  They get over it.  And then there are those who say, like this, you shall know Google by its trail of dead.  A Sparrow user's lament.  Trail of dead.  Trail of dead.

Start time: 2868.84
End time: 2885.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, see, this could be seen as anti-competitive, except for one thing.  And that is Google can honestly say, no, we wanted the Sparrow team because the Google  email client sucks.  I think they're right.  It sucks.  It's horrible.  It's hard to set up.  It's hard to use.  This is so much more elegant.  So they actually have a reason for buying an email company.

Start time: 2885.78
End time: 2901.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think Sparrow intended this because, for instance, it first only worked with Gmail.  It uses all the Gmail keystrokes.  So if you're used to Gmail, you just use this client and it's very familiar.  And I think they intended this.  But I just feel like it's kind of a bait and switch.  They got me to give them 15.  It's only 15 bucks.

Start time: 2901.72

Start time: 2905.76
End time: 2921.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it sucks that even though it's not like they couldn't have got a second team  to continue on.  It's like you're buying the Sparrow A-grade team.  They're going into Gmail.  But hey, hire another couple of people to at least push out some feature updates, right?  Because as good as it is, Sparrow needs some feature updates.

Start time: 2921.78
End time: 2937.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree.  And they've been very good.  That's one of the things I liked about Sparrow is they've been making it better and better  and doing lots of updates.  Not anymore.

So I love this whole thing that then happened, which was a guy claimed that he was writing  Sparrow for Windows.  He put up on his blog post, we were this close, five days away from Sparrows or weeks away  from Sparrow for Windows.  And good for the verge, Ellis Hamburger, who calls Sparrow and says, hey, this Panos guy,  was he writing for you?  CEO Sparrow says, no, he was never hired, never officially associated with our brand.  Sparrow for Windows didn't use our mail engine.  It was just a prototype, and we never agreed to do it.  Well, good.

But I think this is good reporting on the part of the verge who said, you know what,  we checked.  This was never an official Sparrow client, not even close to weeks away.  The guy's just blowing smoke.  OK, what is wrong with Larry Page?  I think you probably have some speculation, John C. DePauw.  No, I don't.  He does not speak.  He was not at Google I.O.  They said apologies.  He's not going to be at Google I.O.  He's lost his voice.  He still has lost his voice.  Weeks later, he still cannot speak.  I don't know what the deal is.

Transcript:  You know, there's an obvious comparison you got to make, and that is comparing his illness or whatever it is.  Steve Jobs.  Steve Jobs.  The rumors were spreading about Steve Jobs.  Apple stock went up and down depending on what illness he had that particular week.  That's right.  I think this is actually it shows how well he's done as CEO that he he's made the company stable enough that even if there's a potential for him to step away.  I like that stocks not tanking.

Start time: 3158.76
End time: 3171.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like that.  Well, the stocks not going to tank until the earnings get screwed up.  And, you know, the company will ran fine under Schmidt and would run fine under Schmidt again.  So, I mean, you don't like Schmidt.  I like Schmidt.

Start time: 3171.96
End time: 3185.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's the difference, though, isn't it?  Like Steve Jobs was sort of widely considered the only person that could run Google could run Apple.  And if he was gone, you know, they were screwed.  That's a good point.  As you say, Schmidt ran Google perfectly well for many years.

We showed you how to root jailbreak. We showed you how to create, roll your own cloud.  So and that shows doing very well. And this shows doing very well.  I have a feeling this is what people want. They want us to do, you know, technical stuff, get geeky.  So we're going to oblige.  Let's check in with Tom Merritt actually speaking of see back there today.  Yeah, let's see what's going on.

Transcript:  Office 365. So this is, I tell you, the most interesting... Or not 365. Office 2013.  This is the next version of Microsoft Office. We'll come out later. We don't know how much it's going to be.  We'll be a subscription, right, Robert?  It's a monthly subscription. It is not... You don't buy the software outright, but what you get for the subscription is you can put it on five different computers.  It installs... This is interesting. At least it installs enough for you to run it in 90 seconds.  So that means I can come to an office or a library and I could sit down, log into my live account, say, yeah, put it on here.  I'm going to use Word for a while. And then when I leave, take it off, right?  Right. Right.  And here's the interesting thing. By default...

Start time: 3734.16

Start time: 3747.64
End time: 3759.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What they were going for is it's a Google Docs feel.  But with all the features of Office.  With all the features, right. Because what they realized is they couldn't have people wait there for 20 minutes while Office downloaded.

Start time: 3760.00
End time: 3773.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Although if you install the whole thing, it still is, you know, five, six, 10, 20 minutes, depending on your speed.  Right. Right.  Once it's installed, it boots pretty quickly.  Yeah. But that's the point is that they want to kind of give you the impression that in 90 seconds you'll be using Word.

Start time: 3774.02
End time: 3779.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  90 seconds is a long time. I think my regular Word boots in less time. That's a long, long time.  That's the first time you install it.

Transcript:  The other thing I thought was really telling is that by default it saves not to your hard drive, but to the cloud, to the SkyDrive.  That stinks.

Start time: 3790.97
End time: 3791.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's crazy.

Start time: 3791.94
End time: 3796.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you lose the cloud.  I think it's great.  Why is it great? What if you're in your Air... what if you're in a 747?

Start time: 3797.72
End time: 3799.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it automatically has offline access.

Start time: 3799.78
End time: 3821.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. It's SkyDrive. So SkyDrive saves that copy locally and copies it up to the cloud.  So you always have that local... you will always have access to your documents.  You can see this as it's a long term thread for Microsoft.  What they would love to be able to do is rather than selling you software, they want to sell you a desktop.  We've heard this before.  But they're getting much closer.  I mean, now that we've more or less figured out services.

Start time: 3821.72
End time: 3839.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Especially since they're selling Windows 8 for $40. Microsoft's really changing its tune.  They're not trying to gouge you on software.  We don't know what the cost will be. So if it's $5 a month, this is awesome.  If it's $25 a month, not so hot.  How about enterprise, Robert? Is this going to be something that business will like?

Start time: 3840.00
End time: 3842.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It won't be $5 a month, let me say right now.

Start time: 3842.88
End time: 3849.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm predicting $7.99. I think it's going to be the Hulu Netflix price.  Yeah, it might be $10. $10 to the Hulu. It can't be higher than $10.

Start time: 3850.47
End time: 3879.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Enterprise will not do this.  Oh, interesting.  Not immediately. You could see enterprise moving to it in say, office 2015.  Because the enterprise is still very distrustful of public cloud.  Enterprise likes private cloud.  As is John C. Dvorak.  As is John C. Dvorak. And for that very reason.  If you lose your connectivity, which happens, you lose productivity.  Right.  You can't do anything.  Right.  And even with the local cached version of the files, you're going to have to...  Well, you can work on that, right?

Start time: 3879.76
End time: 3881.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then when you get back online, it'll update it, right?

Start time: 3882.32
End time: 3884.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But try explaining that to an office building of 10,000 people.  Right.

Start time: 3886.32
End time: 3905.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Robert, isn't it possible that what will happen is that the sort of server part of it,  that Microsoft will make some kind of semi-local SkyDrive that integrates with your exchange server,  so that if you're a business running an exchange,  you can run a sort of office services platform as well that will then serve the 10,000 people.  Run your own cloud.

Start time: 3906.16
End time: 3914.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what actually enterprise is waiting for.  We're waiting for the enterprise version of SkyDrive.  So give me my private server, my data center.  I think they've started to do that with Azure.

Start time: 3915.38
End time: 3925.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they're moving in that direction to give you all of...  Basically, you can run your own version of Azure on your own servers,  so you have some, at least some control of your uptime.  Right.

Start time: 3925.78
End time: 3931.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It gives you failover.  So if you're running your own local server, you lose your externals, it switches over,  people don't even notice.

Start time: 3932.61
End time: 3935.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But Microsoft is really running a chance, because I know...  Hold on.

Start time: 3935.74
End time: 3963.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you're sitting on a 10 gigabit connection in the office and you're going to the server,  yeah, you're not going to notice anything.  You might as well... It's probably going to be faster than most machines.  But the cloud goes over the internet, and the internet slows down and disappears and comes back  and has all these issues, and this is never fast.  It's never fast.  I would just say, get a PayPal account and load it up with a bunch of stuff,  and then every once in a while, just go to it.  PayPal is really slow.  It is beyond slow.

Start time: 3964.03
End time: 3973.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Painfully slow.  Which is why we've got a professional coming on to This Week in Enterprise Tech,  who's going to explain to us how Microsoft policy controls will allow all that stuff to happen in the background.

Start time: 3974.77
End time: 3992.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's doable.  It's a very doable.  It's an implementation question.  But I do think that Microsoft is taking a big chance with business.  Already Windows 8 is something business is looking askance at because of all the new training,  and now you've got, well, we've got this new office and it's very cloud-centric.  Isn't Microsoft taking a big chance?  I mean, most of their revenue comes from business.  They're taking a big chance with business.

Start time: 3992.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They have two cash cows.  Office and Windows.

Start time: 3996.80
End time: 4013.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And why are they screwing with them?  Right.  Because they want to be in the future.  They don't want to be left behind.  By who?  What's the threat?  Google. Google Docs.  I don't know what the numbers are, but maybe you do, Robert.  I mean, aren't they losing business to Google Docs at this point?

Start time: 4014.61
End time: 4037.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not so much Google Docs as BYOD.  So the bring-your-own-device phenomenon is that scares Microsoft because they used to own the server and the client.  And they're looking at what happened to RIM.  Right.  And so they're saying, yeah, we could sit on this cash cow and milk it, or we can start adjusting.  Now, they may make a horrible miscalculation, but at least from the enterprise side, it looks like they're making the right moves.

Start time: 4038.56
End time: 4066.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and also in terms of the BYOD, if Microsoft moves to a services kind of model rather than a software or ownership of a platform model,  that makes it a lot easier to integrate with people that do want to bring your own devices.  Because in the scenario where you want to use Microsoft for 2013, you can just load it up and you get it in 90 seconds.  Right.  But that could all be controlled by a central server.

Is that a sign of problems at Microsoft?  Or we'll talk.  Hold that thought, John C. DeVorek.

It allows you to print postage with your computer and your printer.  You never have to go to the post office again.  You never have to go to the post office to buy postage.  You never have to go to the post office to get them to mail a package for you.  You don't have to go to buy international money orders.  You could do everything that you do at a post office.  You could do it at your desk with Stamps.com.  I'll give you an example.  International post office.  If I want to send something to Will...  Will, you probably send stuff to the states all the time.  It's a pain.  You got to go to the...  What do you guys call it?  The jolly old post office?  What do you call that?

Transcript:  We've been doing this ad for some time now because I've been 10 years, I've been using  Stamps.com.  And one of the most common responses is from people in the UK saying, why do we not have  something like this?  We really need something like this.  If you're going to do international mailing, it actually fills out the forms for you.  If you're an Amazon or eBay seller, this makes fulfillment so easy.  It actually takes the information about the person you're shipping to from the webpage  and prints out the mailing label, prints out the postage.  You get a USB scale, so you're always paying exactly the right amount.  You don't have to put extra postage on to make sure it gets delivered.  It really is efficient.  And you even get discounts you cannot get at the post office.  Up to 21% on express mail, up to 15% on priority mail.  You're going to save money.  You're going to love your life.  It's so much easier.  And it prints right on the envelope if you want so that you have this very professional  look.  Give it a try.  Stamps.com.  Here's the deal.  If you go to Stamps.com right now, click the radio microphone, that silver microphone on  there, and use the offer code TWIT.  Normally, the $80 bonus offer is going to be $110 value.  They'll increase the number of postage coupons they give you.  $55 in free postage for you to use over, I think it's a few months at Stamps.com.  You get a free digital scale.  You only pay the shipping and handling.  You get a $5 supply kit and a four-week trial of Stamps.com.  This is a great offer that you must try.  I literally, we've been using, I used it for years for myself, and now we have two different  accounts here at the Brickhouse.  It's so useful.  They'll even, you don't have to go to the post office to mail the stuff.  They'll come and get it.  What do you need two accounts for?  You really want to know?  They were fighting over this USB scale.  I want this scale.  I want this scale.  I mean, it's scale.  We just, you know, it's just going to be a pain.  So we just got another account.  Stamps.com is worth it.  It really is.  Is this a big deal or not?  Microsoft first ever lost $192 million.  That sounds like a big deal.  Are you getting a cold?  Is that why you're using emergency?  No, I just thought it was on back there.

Start time: 4358.72
End time: 4375.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The story here is that we finally have the answer for why did they take the loss now?  We were talking about that a while back.  Why did they?  Because they had an otherwise stellar quarter, which means that the loss actually doesn't look that bad.  It didn't look as bad as it could have.  Right.  It could have looked like several billion.  Right.

Start time: 4383.72
End time: 4399.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what you're doing.  You're taking a write down.  It's funny because the Brit knows more about the US tax law than we do.  You're taking the write down on this loss to offset income.  And so you don't have to pay taxes.  They're also deferring.

Start time: 4400.90
End time: 4420.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, but what they're actually doing in terms of the write down, they're not losing actual money, right?  It's a write down on a balance sheet.  And so what you're doing is offsetting notional balance sheet value, which is actually mostly goodwill, using that to offset your income, which is real money.  And so you probably just made a ton of real money.

That wasn't clear, but this is what Paul Thuratt and Mary Jo Foley told me on Windows Weekly, that they're going to bundle a copy of the most recent Mac Office.  Mac Office is still not up to 2013, but this is hardware independent.  It's Mac or PC.  In fact, now we're still waiting to hear it.  Looks like they'll have tablet versions.

Or they bought something and they put it in the play like the whatever our first forethought or whatever it would be called.  PowerPoint.  And then they just let it languish.  They really don't do much with it.  But all these companies do that.  I mean, Apple's done that.  Adobe does it.  Facebook does it.  Adobe does not do it.  They crank these new versions out like there's no tomorrow.  They don't buy new stuff.  No, whatever they do, though, they're always updating.  It's like somebody's chasing them.

As soon as the quarterly earnings came out, all these people tweeted, see, Leo was right.  And I actually wanted to tweet, no, no, no, that's not what that means.  You won't be right for a while.  It's going to take a couple of years.  It's going to take a while.  Inertia goes on a long way.  Speaking of inertia, you must have an opinion on this, Will.  Rupert Murdoch steps down from the NI boards.  He's resigned as a director of The Sun, The Times, The Sunday Times, The Times, Newspaper Holdings, News Corp's investments in the UK.  He is loosening finger by finger as he resigns a string of directorships.  Is that his age?  Or did he think he was on Twitter and just unfriending people?

Start time: 4702.96
End time: 4768.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I don't have any information on this whatsoever apart from what you read in the papers, which sort of suggests that the structure of the...  Because News Corp has decided it's going to split, right?  Isn't this because of the scandal over wiretapping?  So I think the decision to split the company has been made because of the negative press over the phone hacking.  Because what's sort of happening is that the papers and the media, which is sort of, I think, up less than 5% of News Corp's business,  has sort of massively had a really bad sort of PR image effect on the other 95% of the company.  So it sort of makes no sense to cause problems for 95% because of the 5%, right?  So I think what we're seeing is just that playing out now.  They're going to split the company up, and I think that's why they're changing the corporate structure of the two.

Start time: 4768.80
End time: 4791.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Telegraph says it perfectly in their headline.  News Corp's split would help draw the poison.  And they're talking specifically about kind of trying to save the television assets by dumping the print assets.  Who wants to be in print anymore anyway?  So I think it looks like even though he's 81, Rupert Murdoch is not really divesting himself of this stuff.  This is prior to a split.

All the money's made in service.  Yeah, and so you'll probably get...  Again, if you look at the Dell and the actually HPs the same way,  you go to their stores,  and you look at what you get for your money,  because I build machines,  I can't even come close to building a machine that's powerful  for like $900.

Transcript:  But that's why I have to ask,  has Dell ever really been in the PC business?  I mean, their model was based on the fact that  they pay their suppliers net 90,  they get paid upfront,  and then Dell Financial has all this money to invest,  to earn interest off of.  So they can sell things at margin...  Razor thin margins.  So you mean the profit is in the VIG.

Transcript:  I think it must be.  I have to think forward and the other automotive manufacturers kind of kind of mean the biggest  fear that these companies have.  And I'm not saying this because of any insider knowledge of Ford, but I have to think the  biggest fear these companies have is that consumers want all these technologies in there  and governments are saying, you know, it's causing distractive driving.  Ford has always contended that if you do speech, if you do voice that we know they say that's  safe.  But as soon as you're starting to twiddle a knob or look down, that's a problem.  I don't know.  Just a thought.  Appeals court will not stay the injunction on Galaxy Tab sales.  This is the victory Apple had in court preventing the Samsung company from selling the Galaxy  Tab 10 in the U.S.  They cannot make or sell the tablet computer or any similar device in the U.S.  On Thursday, U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit rejected Samsung's request  for a stay.  So it's in effect.  So I hope you got your 10, your Galaxy Tab 10, because you can't get it now.  Thank you, Apple.

Start time: 5730.90
End time: 5747.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, the few angles on the story.  The first thing is it's not the Samsung Galaxy Tab that would have done really well.  It's the Nexus 7 that is just eating Apple's lunch right now.  Right.  The second thing is this is a ridiculous lawsuit.  I mean, basically, Apple is claiming the thinness and the rounded corners belong to them.

Transcript:  There's that picture circulating on the Internet.  I'll put it in again.  Of the original iPad?  Well, no, the Samsung, the Samsung rounded corner iPhone looking device that came out  a year before the iPhone.  Right.  So if you're looking at that design type, Samsung actually came up with it first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been in a couple of these lawsuits.  You've been an expert with this, right?  Yes.  And the way these come out, it's like, holy crap, whether it's the judge or not.  I mean, I remember the old, old one where one of the modem companies was suing everybody  over the dot commands.  It was Hayes.  Hayes commands.  And they won.  And it turns out when they deconstructed what the jury decided, it was because somebody  said, well, on the plastic box it says patented, so therefore it must be legal.

Start time: 5810.46
End time: 5835.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The real question is why are these patents being granted in the first place?  And there was a great story, I think it was the New York Times not too long ago, that  was essentially saying anyone who can do this well, anyone who can do patent law well, works  for a company that gets patents.  So the people in the patent office are your second and third stringers, not to offend  anyone who actually works for the patent office.  I mean, the examiner just did.  You're not very good.  You suck.

And tying it to, and this is the deposition, to this image here, a mock-up, the 035 mock-up  from, get this, 2000, I think it was 2001, 2002.  This is crazy.

Start time: 5871.20
End time: 5889.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it turns out, if you follow it, that Apple was working on the iPad before they started  working on the iPhone.  We've talked about this before.  And they were like, and so they went back to making the iPhone, having made it, they  were then like, now we can take the iPad back off the shelf and make that.  We have the technology.

Yeah, a lot of companies use this technique.  This was the technique that was very controversial,  written about in the Vanity Fair article about Microsoft,  and posited that that was one of the reasons Microsoft was so poorly run.

Start time: 5986.78
End time: 6032.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what it is.  You have, depending on the model, Microsoft uses a five-step model,  and you are forced, because it's also called forced ranking.  There's about three names for this thing.  And you have a team of 10 people,  and you have to rank two of them a certain number.  They have to get the top number, which should be a one.  And then you have to, in your group, depending on what the HR people want,  you have to at least rank one of them a five,  which means if they get ranked five twice at Microsoft, they're fired.  If they're ranked five once, they're put on probation.  They don't get a raise and all the rest of it.  Wow.  And then you fire them, and then you bring in a new person.  You keep doing this, so you essentially get rid of everybody.  And it's like, so you lose all your talent if you keep this up.  It's very effective in the first few years of its use.

Transcript:  I think we did, actually.  This was the thing, and I have to talk to Lisa about this,  that I knew that Tech TV was going under when they eliminated oatmeal from the snacks.  Well, they took the milk out, too. Remember that?  They took the milk out.  And I think we just did the same thing here,  so I'm a little nervous that I might be out of a job soon.

Transcript:  The thing that always got me about Tech TV is that they had all these women that were,  when you put them in a chair for two hours,  they were some of the most beautiful women in the world,  which is classic broadcasting.  Television, yeah.  So when they started their layoffs, the first people they fired were the makeup people.  Did you find that peculiar? I was like, what? Why do you do that?  This is television.  It's television.  There's the last people you find.  Yeah, exactly.

Transcript:  I don't know.  Google says, some Apple inventions are so great, they ought to be shared.  Ooh.  I think that's an interesting point of view.  This is in a letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee.  Google General Counsel Kent Walker says that because a proprietary or de facto standards  can have just as important effects on consumer welfare,  the committee should, I don't know how to say this in anything that doesn't sound acronym,  regarding the abuse of SEPs should encompass them as well.  I think a lawyer wrote that. I'm sorry, I don't understand that.  I'm going to go back to the headline.  Google says, some Apple inventions are so great, they ought to be shared.  I agree with that.  Apparently, John Pekowski can read lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But Google...  Where something is like that, you've got to be able to share it.  I guess things like FaceTime, if FaceTime were to kick off and become the entire dominant  standard for video communication, then they would say, well, you should probably share that.  This is...

Transcript:  Pekowski writes, standardized technologies facilitate interoperability among disparate  devices by giving them the same core functionality.  They create a platform for competition.  Non-standardized technologies differentiate those devices, create competition, and drive  innovation in the marketplace.  Subjecting non-standard essential patents to the same rules as those governing standard  essential ones will hamper innovation and harm consumers.  Is this another way of saying what we've been saying all along?

Transcript:  Google has experience with this, though.  They had to do this themselves because when they became the de facto standard for search,  remember all those lawsuits about, well, we think they're toying with the search rankings  or they're pushing their own results.  And Google had to show that they were playing it cleaner than everyone else so everyone  had a level playing field.  Basically, they're asking the same thing of Apple.  They're saying, look, you have a responsibility now.  Now that you've been a trendsetter, now that you've actually set the standards for the  industry, you can't claim.  Let those standards free.

Transcript:  Robert Ballester, the new host of This Week in Enterprise Tech tomorrow, noon Pacific,  3 p.m. Eastern time.  Can't wait.  Absolutely.  It's going to be a lot of fun.  1900 UTC, if you'd like to watch live.  We will make on-demand versions available after.  Thanks.

Transcript:  About an hour.  About an hour.  And so what you want to do is you want to watch it live because we do some interactive  features with the show where you get to learn a bit more about the enterprise world.  But if you do watch it live, what I suggest is because a lot of the material is dense,  download it later.  In fact, download it a couple of times.  You need the audio version, the video version, and the high-def version.  So just go to twit.tv forward slash twiatt.
