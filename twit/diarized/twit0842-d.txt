Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's 30 years now, isn't it more more that book was out in 1985. Holy cow. Wow  And I got introduced to hackers  An assignment I got in 1981 which resulted in a 1982 story for Rolling Stone about  called hackers in paradise  so  Very early 80s is when I started Wow uncle Steve. That's pretty much when computers started  Yeah  At that time most called computer journalists were hobbyists. Yeah, the end of the story they would put  a little thing with their address and phone number in case you wanted to connect with them and  Call them up and ask them to type in a few lines of code or something

Start time: 285.58
End time: 313.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That that was me actually I was writing invite magazine in the early 80s as a hobbyist and the reason I was doing it is  Because I was trying to get free software  Software and hardware  In fact, I wrote so when was your first tech tech piece me. Yeah  probably around 80  It was pre IBM PC so it would have been 80 79 or 80 and we're around that tan when did you start?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, there is a I always use an analogy  Talking about tech because when we were in the early days of tech when it was hobbyist  It was a lot about speeds and feeds and what your processor was and how much RAM you had and I always likened that to  the early days of  stereo  Magazines like hi-fi. Yes, where that's it wasn't even about the music  It was like you listen to 1812 overture because there was cannons and ringing bells and that really tested your subwoofers  And it wasn't until rolling roughly around when Rolling Stone happened that suddenly it went from being about the  Equipment to being about the content and I think we had a kind of an analogous transition in technology where nobody  Apple and Microsoft both announced new computers this week  Microsoft mentioned  Microsoft mentioned, you know processors and ram it Apple Apple barely does anymore. Oh, I don't know about that

Start time: 391.16
End time: 405.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have a whole lot of crazy made-up buzzwords that describe  The technology and their chips and I think you know, we could talk about this  I think the big shift in Apple is its move from a design company to a silicon company to a chip company

Start time: 406.40
End time: 419.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's certainly that I mean the design is still premier, but you're right  But now that they're doing they replaced Intel with their own silicon  You're actually that's a good point. They are talking much more about speeds and feeds that has suddenly become a differentiator

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, when they bought Palo Alto semiconductor some years back  Almost nobody  Picked up on what that meant for where they were heading and I certainly didn't and it was  In retrospect that was quite the break from the past and boy have they made  some strides with

Start time: 446.18
End time: 477.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Semiconductors I think it was always Steve Jobs idea that you make both the whole the full stack you make software and you make hardware  Going back to I think Alan Kay saying, you know, if you want to control  Technology, you've got to make it all you can't you know outsource the software. You can't outsource the hardware it took them  30 plus years 40 years to do it  But they now and they're still not doing it. They still have what Tim Cook calls legacy nodes old chips  they have to put in their stuff, but  They're rapidly moving in that direction

Start time: 477.78
End time: 505.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think it's also where you're headed here  It's the clay Shirky argument not not that he's the only one who makes it  But the interesting thing starts out starts happening when the technology becomes boring. Yes  I think that and I think we may be at that point because you know, you've complained Oh Google didn't do anything this year  What the hell and and I think that that's that's actually a good sign is when we because that democratizes it, too  It means we we don't feel as intimidated by it. We we have more power over it  Yeah, it's just a pretty impressive

Start time: 507.36
End time: 534.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seems to me we have less power over it every year because control is  accruing into the set into these companies more and more and  That's a separate issue, but  The more Apple locks down everything  More  control it asserts over its entire ecosystem, even if the  Judge will push them a little bit in one direction. I'm not sure that Congress ever will

End time: 556.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That'd be a good conversation for the three of you  Big tech and the threat big chip big tech poses or does not pose to our polity  They all certainly  We talked about on this week in Google and Jeff  I think I'd safe to characterize you as on the side of big tech a little more than on the side of government

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did we did Stephen when?  And this is for everybody, but I'll start with you Stephen. I  was certainly  An internet optimist I was I was of the you know, the what is it people people of the Internet?  You know we  John Perry Barlow's fabulous manifesto. I thought this was kind of democratize. Everybody's gonna get a voice  It was gonna change the world. It was gonna  Disintermediate the incumbents would tumble  And in fact some of that happened, but I think we I didn't really anticipate the negative consequences of it  Stephen were you were you an optimist back there in the 80s about what technology would bring?

Start time: 629.28
End time: 661.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why I tilted towards the optimistic side. I always had an eye out for  Abuses and things like that. You know, I had a skepticism to anything big  Look I I thought it was way to smash the  olioarchy of  Telecom and yeah sorts of other  Nodes of control that this could take it down and you could would amplify  individual voices  Facebook's proved that amplifying individual voices could be the most dangerous thing that could ever happen

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that you know the  You know the  I've always used the term, you know among the among many people using the term about this being a double-edged sword, but I  Didn't realize how sharp that bottom edge was

Start time: 682.22
End time: 685.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Had we known better? Is there something we could have done? Oh

Start time: 690.38
End time: 770.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Lots but each of those things we imagine now could have had other consequences, right?  The folks who argue that anonymity is bad and that's what caused the the evils  Well if we had if we had created a system from the beginning of verified identity, then it'd be even better for the authoritarians  It'd be even worse for vulnerable populations. So the problem yes, I mean, I think the thing I would say Leo is it ain't done yet  It's not the Internet is not baked. The point is that we've got to figure out how to take it back  This is my friend Doug Rushkoff argues often right or do it take and and see if I'm about enough that we come at this from  Different ends. I was talking to Doug the other day because we're gonna teach a course together in the future of the Internet designing the Internet and  Doug who wrote throwing rocks at the Google bus and I wrote what would Google do and Doug laughed at some point  And he said, you know, we end up at the same place, but we get there differently. He said I Doug said I want less evil  You want more good?  But we end up at the same place where we want we want we want to take charge of the Internet again  We want we want to own it again. We want to imagine what it can be again  And and I think that the question is is that possible if you think that it's done and that Google and Facebook and company are the forever  Proprietors of it. Yes, and that's cause for for suicide. I don't think it's I think there's time it's different  I don't think it's done. But I think the time for us to

Transcript:  Dan when you talk to your students  Who grew up in the middle of this they're like the fish in the ocean that doesn't know about water  Are they aware of how things have changed?

Start time: 820.66
End time: 870.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're a little bit aware they're not  What what I'm heartened by is  When I show students things about  the control and  centralization and what  What's actually going on?  They get alarmed. They don't want to be controlled by  Huge enterprises and governments they want to be able to do things themselves  Going back to your question a minute ago, though  If one thing we could have been done we could have been doing all the way through this is to be a little more  active in helping people  Understand basic civics as we used to call it and we threw that away

Start time: 871.72
End time: 911.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  With STEM education and we better bring it back. Oh, that's an interesting point. I mean, I've always considered my mandate  to to teach people about technology  So that they are empowered in the face of  That in the early days, I thought it would be a government that would use technology against them  And now I think it's you know, it's industry that uses technology against them  But in both cases people need to take back the power by  Learning how to use technology and learning how it can be used against them and learning what to do to defend and that kind of thing  And that's not changed over the last 30 years at all. I mean, that's still a mandate  And I think it's still a something but why civics what I mean

Start time: 915.97
End time: 953.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What part of civics do they need to learn? Well, I'm talking about in a very broad way. I'm talking about participation  I mean this let's stick to the US for the moment, but  We talk about democratization of things that if  Participation is the duty we have in a democracy. It's not just voting. It's participating in  Developing our future and  Technology is giving us incredible tools. That's true to do that if we choose  But we have to do it better and so Dan, I'm sorry. Can I ask you a question then?

Start time: 954.52
End time: 967.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So civics is normally tied with the nation and government  Right. So let me ask you to spread that out and say what does internet civics look like?  What does internet governance in your vision then look like what's the difference between  What's the civics of the net?

Start time: 970.66
End time: 1039.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's something we're still trying to understand and figure out but it does start with recognizing that  We are all part of it we're not  We're not these end points  of  consumption  Where all we do is sit in front of a screen and go  Of a screen and go  Like that we're doing it's something much more interesting which is that we're  instead of consumers and this goes we've known this for 20 years, but we're starting to  Maybe do something about it, but we're consumers are participants and creators and their collaborators  If we help them do it and we're not we're not doing enough of that and we're not helping people understand what  they can do  themselves  uh, they I go nuts hearing the  Constant cries to the platforms do something do something do something well  What?  Exactly, and what can we do? What can we do about some of this ourselves?

Start time: 1040.54

End time: 1072.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2004 I I would point out that there are three chapters about what could go wrong  and  I confess I did not anticipate  How badly things might go wrong and it proceeded?  Social media except for what was then social media, which was blogs

Start time: 1074.72
End time: 1076.08

End time: 1104.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well it  You can't you can't anticipate what's going to happen at least i'm not very good at it. I think  steven here is the only one who's got the  Cred for having done that for a long time and and leo is is there too, but we're not i'm not  I'm not a good predictor  Of technology. I just know it's going to get faster and  more connected

Start time: 1105.10
End time: 1146.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let me let me take advantage of the  People on this panel they ask this question everyone bemoans the loss of blogs but if blogs were so important  Wouldn't have they continued to find that audience?  You know couldn't have been that you know, there wasn't some giant hand to say, you know, we've changed into platforms  There's no more blogs  uh, you know, maybe now what we thought of everyone mentions what we thought of blogs is now part of a  sub-stack rising or things like that, but  You know, I question  This golden age of blogs maybe wasn't something that people would love so dearly if we'd let it go away

Start time: 1147.86
End time: 1195.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not I wasn't saying that at all. I think people I think blogs ended up it's a question. It wasn't moving  blogs ended up on twitter and  facebook to a degree because  For people who wanted to reach a lot of people a lot of other people  That was more likely that they would the  When you know google killed off or tried to kill off rss  That was a big blow to blogs. That was again a centralization thing, but  You know blogs took a lot of work and  They're they're still good in there. There's people are still  Doing it. It's just that there's now other outlets that are easier to do

Start time: 1195.88
End time: 1225.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's there's also podcasts twitter twitter ruined me for blogging. Yeah, uh there you could also make a point that uh  Blogs lost the ability to monetize and that might have also not not helped a little bit  But and the blog was never great. It's gonna be a hobby. Yeah  Yeah, I think the other thing happening to podcasting, uh right now which is uh, you know  It's going to be hobbyists and big companies and that's there's nothing in between  So I asked dave whiner the blogs

Start time: 1226.16
End time: 1244.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I asked dave whiner who you know was one of the one of the parents blogging actually never stopped blogging and I said  and I was I was  Lamenting the loss of some of the wonderful days  We had blog roles and we loved each other and we you know, we talked to each other and he said jeff  He said everything is great when it starts. Yeah, that's true

Start time: 1247.16
End time: 1252.52

End time: 1260.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1260.26
End time: 1270.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think blogs went away  I think people have found more and have varied ways of expressing themselves and and blogs are still part of that  But not maybe as dominant because there's other other ways to do it

Start time: 1270.84
End time: 1311.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well media took them over for a while, right?  So the new york times first mock blogs and they were awful and then they started doing blogs and started changing the voice of the  New york times and then they rejected blogs, right? Then it was then it was yesterday's tissue  Um, there's a book by charlton knucklewane who's the deputy provost at nyu?  uh called black software that goes through the parallel creation of  black  cultures  Online the various efforts to do this and and a similar  Kind of of arc happened where they got some got co-opted by big companies like aol  And then other other flashy things came along  And and it just kind of a lot of it went away

Start time: 1311.30
End time: 1345.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What if we instead of saying blogs what if we say the ability of the average person to have a voice in a way to publish?  which is part of this promise that we thought of the internet which  Was that everybody'd have a voice to be a democratization?  You wouldn't have to have a publisher or a radio station or a tv station. You could do that yourself  That all has blossomed. Has it not everybody has a voice  In fact, really that's the problem now is that everybody has a voice  Uh  It was  Right, it was the cult of the amateur is that's that oh no. Oh no

Start time: 1348.30
End time: 1370.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know when it wasn't  When there wasn't  Many people on the internet and you didn't have that power the platforms  That was more true. You can still speak up, but I feel the  Google I mean really is effectively the only search engine we have is not going to rise you up  Like it used to but it doesn't need to if you were a tick tock star

Start time: 1371.20
End time: 1377.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 1377.84
End time: 1402.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the content you do really isn't what we're talking about. You look at what goes viral on tick tock  It's not the same kind of thing. It's an entertainment channel. I know there's satire and other things in there but  um  It's a different kind of  Giving voice you see on tick tock that you used to have on blogs or even that you do have on twitter

Start time: 1402.94
End time: 1437.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But but this notion of going viral is a vestige of mass media fake that the only things that matter are the things that are big  And at scale  And what we saw in the blogging world is when you know tech bloggers got together it was tiny  But they mattered to each other. They it was enough for them  and then  After 9 11 the war bloggers came along of which I was one the political bloggers of that time  And when we had our communities and I think the same could be said of black twitter today for example  Where you don't need to have everybody and scale matters in the business model  It doesn't necessarily matter for the good of the communities involved

Start time: 1440.36
End time: 1542.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The the formation of  community  of various kinds in in all of these spaces is kind of the  Most for me the most interesting where it's a large community small community middle but  uh  The as bad as some of them are  uh, the facebook group has had a huge impact in a lot of places  and  I'm thinking about geographically  The small town we live in next to san francisco  So, uh, there's no journalism ever done by traditional media about our town unless something bad happens  Or there is something that they find annoying and want to write about or cute  and  Yet in the facebook group for our little town  That's where the news is and it's very useful  It's not like we're uh  People are posting  Just stupid things. It's a well moderated place where we tell each other what's going on  And people research and find out  uh  this is  I'd rather that it wasn't on facebook. I'd rather that it was  not on some centralized platform  but it's the best we have at the moment and  It's things like that that make me always step back and say this  Overall technology what we're talking about is incredibly important for the voice that it's giving to people who did not have  Voices in the way we need them  to live better civic lives and

Transcript:  No, I mean well mark zuckerman didn't anticipate that either  I looked into uh, some of the people, uh, who were helping set up facebook live worried about um  People killing themselves or committing acts of violence on it, which also happened. That's right and uh,  But you know facebook blew past them and came up with the product  um, it's  You know when you have that critical mass of people that network affected people all kinds of things can happen  And the question of facebook is you know mark zuckerberg. He'd love to hear  You know that this discussion so far with what dan's saying because he feels his meaningful groups is really a core  Value of facebook and proves that it's worth it. The question is what's the cost of the things that aren't so good?  Uh that we see on the the the things that happen that their moderators can't get on time in time or  Um, or let pass for political reasons  Uh, the these that's what the wall street journal piece essentially was about facebook researchers saying hey, this is intolerable  one fifth  the teenage girls who use instagram, um  Are feel bad about themselves and we're making it worse  Um, is that worth the trade-off there? Is it?  Something that's like a fender bender in you know, this  You know, uh  Accumulation of good stuff or is it like a plane crash?  And a lot of people feel it's the plane crash that you have to greatly minimize that kind of stuff  You know one fifth the teenage girls on instagram are millions of teenage girls  And you know to have one company making millions of teenage girls feel bad and some percentage of that feel  Really bad and have mental health issues is something that people find tough to swallow  So steven

Transcript:  Go ahead, dan, sorry, go ahead. I know that's I know that's tough squall. I would like to know  What percentage of teenage girls?  who watch  popular television  Or read 17 magazine or yes, or or basically who participate  as consumers in  more traditional forms of media  which uh  For you know, as long as I can remember have been  exploiting images of women and girls and have been  touting certain  body shapes, etc  uh and fashion and makeup and all these things and and  sexualizing girls and women at very young ages  uh  Did they feel worse about themselves? I don't know the answer but I bet you there's research that would  Tell us whether this is a whole new thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or something i'm sure i'm sure there's been research in those things, but um  you know, I think  The stuff we saw come out in the journal was researched by the super  experienced expert phd  Level social scientists people who can get a job at any great university these people at facebook  That did studies that showed you know  And then  All that other stuff aside, you know the impact of instagram, you know  Alone isolated was worse, you know that people who watch tv and read magazines and did all the other things  With instagram on one hand and without instagram on the other hand. That was the difference. So presumably they isolated instagram in making their conclusions

Transcript:  so leo can I address that directly because I had a bit of an epiphany this week and I and when during a session that  Was put together by someone at the behest of the facebook oversight board  Uh, and it was it was a chattanoff's rule and so i'll talk about what I said and thought  uh, and the question was facebook has asked the oversight board to give them judgments about whether and what  exceptions to have about facebook's rule  That you shouldn't have any identifying addresses or images of homes  um on facebook  And whether there's a journalistic rule public policy rule or protest, I mean exceptions to those rules  um  and and what occurred to me during that was that  I think we in media  have a role here and having  Set the terms of the discussion in media terms around content and bad content and erasing content getting rid of things  As opposed to a service model  so facebook hired 40 000 people now 40 000 people to try to kill bad content like whack-a-mole  And and they created this rule about no address so that people wouldn't get harassed and wouldn't get um, uh,  You know threatening things happening their address fine  But at the same time people put up their pictures of their christmas tree lights outside their house or I put up pictures of my house  After sandy or there's other reasons to do it  But the the desire to have a rule that an algorithm could enforce and 40 000 people could enforce  In a content-based world was any address bad and it occurred to me  Two things one if george floyd had been murdered on the driveway to his home the algorithm might have killed the video before we saw it  Because you're trying to make a generalized rule about something and second  What if instead of 40 000 content moderators facebook had 40 000 customer service people?  And if someone felt that they were being harassed they had someone who they could actually reach  Uh, but that's not that's not the ethos that they have you can't get any customer service at any of these companies  And so it's not about the problems it's about we must create a rule that gets rid of all this stuff  So we won't be in trouble anymore  And that is broken

Start time: 1974.46
End time: 2113.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A point there's not 40 000 content moderators. I think the facebook says there's 40 000 people involved in safety and security  Includes those moderators most of them were on contract  The last figure they gave for the moderators was 15 000 and if they were customer service people  Um  They couldn't handle a fraction of what they handle now  They have about 40 seconds to make a content decision  On average on the things they say I I actually visited for my book. Um facebook the inside story in case you're wondering  A version perfect. There we go. Uh, and  They you know, um  And these people, you know check into the office or they used to check into the office  Um, I think they're some of them are back in the office and they just make a lot of decisions a lot of them are  Really clear cut other ones aren't clear cut. Generally they make them anyway though and the difficult ones they kind of kick  To a level upstairs. They're really super super difficult ones go all the way up to mark zuckerberg, but there are so many decisions that  That's the problem. They can't sit there and make nuanced judgments and they understand this, you know  And facebook feels that ultimately the answer is well, we'll have an artificial intelligence  to make zillions of these  Decisions and a lot of stuff matter of fact is adjudicated. Uh, sometimes even before it appears by artificial intelligence, but  Still that's just a fraction. And when I asked the moderators I said do you ever feel that an ai can do your job?  They just burst out laughing  That's just ridiculous and the fact is it's hard for a human to do let alone exactly exactly  It's one of those things that humans find it difficult to do and it's particularly difficult  When you don't have enough people in the different cultures and languages that facebook  Covers, you know in the world to make those decisions. It was patting itself on the back recently for saying  Oh, we got you know, these things solved in or you know, we were addressed in  50 languages of the like 200 whatever it is languages that facebook is in right?  So, you know, wait a minute  What about the people in the languages you don't cover you don't get to pat yourself in the back because you're cover some

I don't think he's a bond villain  necessarily, but he when decisions come to him and he looks at it and says  You know  We could do a better job of this problem if we adopt this course that's going to  Cut down the time to spend on facebook.

It's it's a  it goes into the  category that um  Cory doctorow and the eff have been calling adversarial  Interoperability, uh, which means basically that  companies that  Oppose each other in lots of ways still be required to  Make the data  um  In in put it in formats that can be used in a variety of ways and interoperate with each other  That they can't lock down everything  So that users would have much more and better choices, I think this is a really great concept, although  I'm not sure i'm looking forward to the uh federal department of interoperability

Uh is a great partner for any business  Looking to use the latest technology  Uh, and the advanced technology center is worldwide tech's way of trying the technologies  piloting programs  Researching testing compatibility. It's a research and testing lab that brings together technologies from leading oems like cisco  There's more than half a billion dollars in equipment invested in the lab. It started 10 years ago in one building  It's it's in four or five now rack of rack on rack of amazing technology  By the way, I want to point out you can use the atc  You can test out do the same thing that worldwide techs engineers do products and solutions before you go to market you get access  There to technical articles expert insights demonstration videos white papers hands-on labs all the tools  A modern business needs to stay up to date with the latest technology the thing about worldwide technology in cisco. They're partners. They are  They work with you and because worldwide technology  Understands that your strategy your business  Goals have to be the informing your  Technology purchases. They're a great partner. They will work with you all the way through implementation  to training and and and  Forward i'll give you some examples some case studies you can find these on the worldwide tech page  There was a large design. I want to name names just mention a large design and construction firm  Pandemic hit they wanted to continue critical operations, but they also  Wanted to make sure their staff was safe and when the staff was started returning to office. They wanted a safe return  WWT came in the consultants used expert knowledge the advanced technology center in-depth analysis to maximize existing it investments  To improve the employee experience. How about that? They said well, you know, you've already got some technology here. Why don't we  Do some customized training?  With the company's diverse employee base to help them use  The existing technology and the new technology and that training made a huge  Difference they worked with a state university to create new opportunities for students to connect with faculty  online  WWT helped the university test and compare virtual collaboration solutions  That's what they use the atc for for instance and then train and engage faculty and students to ensure strong adoption  This is what worldwide technology is famous for their personal approach  They can not only identify the technologies you need to safely reopen  They can architect and implement a variety of solutions things like, you know  Fever screening and occupancy monitoring and contact free conference rooms  See how WWT and Cisco can help bring clarity  To your reopening plans and implement solutions that enable flexible working go to  WWT.com slash twit to get started and gain access to all their valuable resources  WWT.com  slash  twit worldwide technology make a new world happen.

End time: 3218.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there was just one other thing on the clamp down on  cryptocurrencies  I'm not sure that there's  Reverse I think there's probably  another motive there in addition to  just general control freakery, uh, and related to that because  the uh  economy and in particular real estate, uh  is  grossly overheated in china and  they're in a major bubble on property values and  uh have  totally overbuilt  And have had companies that are wildly over leveraged going, you know hundreds of billions  and  It may be that on in banning  cryptocurrencies, they're trying to  control  Uh, or at least slow down the flight of capital that tends to happen from countries that are  perhaps  heading toward economic  really serious trouble and  Of course the whole world would be caught in that if it does happen, but  That seemed pretty plausible to me and I I don't remember where I read that but it  that struck a chord as  Maybe that is part of the motivation to just prevent too much  Money from fleeing the country

Start time: 3218.88
End time: 3245.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but isn't it more cultural than that too, isn't it isn't it, you know a matter of control and  Uh, if if the regime could stay popular by everybody getting more money and and and growing  And having bigger homes and buying more stuff fine for the long that lasted but then when trouble comes  they have to  Put the hammer down  And and we're almost headed to a an economic cultural revolution  Is that going overboard?

Start time: 3247.38
End time: 3294.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, that makes sense and I think it's these are intertwined the the  Uh  It just if we're looking for some specific thing because I thought this  Cryptocurrency ban was very sudden  And I had not  There were there were some things that happened that were  perhaps in retrospect leading up to it, but  this is uh  This is a surprise to me and and you know when we look in our own country and other countries about  Uh cryptocurrencies  I think people who are  Speculating in those areas who are not the insiders who are already profited and will stand to profit even more  Be careful

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there's a couple things going on then you know  These are great points about you know  This these real estate companies that people say this could be another subprime that affects the rest of the world  But in the last year i've been really surprised to see how hard china is coming down  Against the entrepreneurs like jack ma who were once  celebrated as you know, uh successes of the whole chinese system, so it's almost reminiscent of what putin did to  slam down the oligarchs in in russia, um, and  So  Maybe that's not the greatest way to build a global internet business to you know, take your most gloried entrepreneurs and founders and  Charging with crimes or you know remove them. Um, I think certainly it it shows that  The control in china shows it just can't be trusted as a global brand and you see  Obviously, we don't trust huawei  and tiktok is  You know was sort of teetering in the in the the trump era but now  Still it's still the most popular  download among social network apps  More engagement than youtube longer longer viewing times.

Wow  Uh  Here's an interesting story from uh our federal government protecting us once again turns out  the rival ransomware remember, uh  kaseya the company that  The it was an it support company that ended up hacking or being the pathway to hacking many of its customers  for the rival, um  Ransomware gang it turns out the fbi  Had the key that could unlock  These computers for three weeks but told no one that they had it  According to the this story came out this week from the washington post  The key was obtained through access to the servers of the gang  And the fbi held it close to their vest because they were hoping  With the agreement of other agencies to carry out an operation to disrupt reeval  The bureau didn't want them to know that they had the key so they couldn't tell these companies  Oh, don't pay the ransomware. We can help you decrypt  the data  They said a government assessment found the harm was not as severe as initially feared  The plan the planned takedown never occurred because reeval shut down before the feds could shut them down  And the hackers disappeared  I have to feel like if you were one of the companies that had been ransomed, uh, and you knew the fbi  And you knew the fbi had the keys but didn't tell you you might feel a little  Reasonably a little bit miffed at this point

I'm not saying  You know, I I have a great sympathy for the victims that were not told  but uh, I I think there's a  This is a trade-off.

Unfortunately  Somehow reeval got uh, by the way, they're back they left but they're back. They're they're at it again. Oh, no. Yeah, so  You know  Maybe they'll get another another chance  Yeah, there's a long I guess there's a long-standing  History of knowing this information but not being able to use it because it would give up your informants or that kind of thing  Uh, i'm not going to bring up the new there's a new iphone  Actually, it's it's an interesting story and steven steven. You wrote a great book on the the ipod  I think right then the new new next news. Yeah, I did a book on the macintosh and then the ipod. Yeah apple seems now I  I'll quote brian x chen. I this my opinion as well  But brian x chen's review of the iphone 13 was pretty scathing in the new york times  Let me see if I can get the the exact the most incremental upgrade ever he said  The new iphone is 10 faster than the last one and the photos are slightly better in a word  huh  Uh, I will i'll agree with him. My my wife insisted on getting it. I said i'm not going to buy it  I'm happy with an iphone 12 and I took it out and I said this is this  There's no there's very little improvement in this  Except that I can't use the old case because they moved the camera over about a millimeter  Maybe the pictures are a little bit better apple's  Kind of got a problem, which is the iphone is pretty close to the peak  They're not it isn't the next new thing by any means. It's the old thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't think that apple expects everyone with an iphone 12 to go to an iphone 13  If you have an iphone 6  And you know, we're wondering gee, you know, um, should I upgrade? You know, you might figure  well  This is a good time as any because there's a big leap between an iphone 6 and an iphone 13  Particularly in battery life the battery life is actually better than 10. Yeah. No, it's huge. Yes. That's right  You know and you know, uh and a lot of the phone companies, you know the the uh, verizon atnt  You know  They're offering deals and a lot of people have deals where the upgrades come  Automatically that people just like like to have new ones like some people just wanted to drive a new car every year  so  Apple will sell a lot of these, you know, they seem to have the chip supplies which no one else has but uh,  and  But it's true that it's not an earth-shattering thing and maybe we've reached, you know  The point where incremental  Upgrades are all you can do with that and the next giant thing at apple is not going to be  You know like a phone which shatters our expectations of what a phone is but something else

Transcript:  I'm not sure i'm gonna stop and and I  I differ with corey on a couple of points he made in his piece. In fact, i'm gonna write something up about it  but  this is uh  This is the cutting edge of something that I think we should encourage like crazy, which is the notion of  making hardware  less  Uh of a thing that you have to throw away or give away  Um that  We don't have to use as much materials as we used to just  drop in a new processor and you know at some point even a new motherboard if that's what it takes but  Everything is modular in this thing.

I don't know frameworks published the schematics. That would be the way to do it  Um make to make something that would fit and be compatible, but I that's exciting  I don't know the answer to that. 10 out of 10.

He's a real connoisseur of fast food  and uh  But but it's interesting, you know not just teal but these other  People who say that they're like super patriotic these other people in the trump sphere and in teal's thing  He really is disdainful of the people at google for bouncing, you know the contract the government  um  on on ai  But it seems to me that these people are so patriotic. Why don't they pay their taxes?  Why do they keep thinking of imaginative ways to avoid paying the taxes that would help the united states defend itself  And pay for this technology they're selling to the united states teal is famous and the book gets into this for having this  multi-billion dollar roth ira  Right, and this is something that was like done to help people, you know of modest means  There was little retirement accounts for their own use and he figured out a way to twist it legally, I guess  Um, but to make it worth billions and billions of dollars, which was not being changed right now right now  Untaxable, you know what?

They bought this giant headquarters that they've been building  In mountain view which is going to take a lot longer to fill but they have utter confidence  That in a few years, they'll be in that situation again and they can drop two billion dollars on a building  in new york city and  Sometime during this decade maybe not until 2026 2027  We'll be saying that building's packed.
