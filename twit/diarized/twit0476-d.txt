I'm still sleep deprived, waiting in line at the iPhone store for hours and hours.  Fortunately, all I have to do is sit back, because we have one of those panels where,  if I get a word in Edgewise, I'll be damn lucky.  We're going to start off with Jason Snell, Lately Detached.  Yes.  From Macworld Magazine and IDG.  I am a free agent, baby.  He's a free agent at SixColors.com, cleverly named.  Thank you.  I like it. I know what the Six Colors are.  Yes, that's the old Apple rainbow.

Transcript:  I'm really happy for you.  I think this is good for you.  And we'll talk about what happened to Macworld, because I'm curious.  John C. Dvorak is also here.  He still writes for print magazines.  Yeah, of course.  Are there some left?  No.  I still turn them in, though.  I think PC Magazine Brazil is still in paper.

End time: 183.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No.  No?  No, that's been long gone, actually.  I got to turn this.  How did I get...  I'm sorry, let me get this.  John likes to watch the show.  He's watching his own live stream.  That's nice.  Oh, good.  Anyway, it's good to be here.  Nice to have you.  Yeah, and you have your...  You've got two of these iPhones.  Actually, we have four, because Jason brought his too.  Four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, I have tried, played with the big one, and it's just too big.  I carry my phone in my shirt pocket around, and the big one would be like this, right?  So I need to...  I'm trying real hard to get myself breast cancer.  So far, I haven't done it, but this baby ought to do it.

Start time: 213.14
End time: 216.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  Actually, I was very...  I thought you were going to get the black.

Start time: 233.65
End time: 257.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is no black.  That's black front and space gray back.  Space gray.  I thought that was the only goal.  I actually thought the goal was nice.  There were very constrained supplies.  I was 41st in line at our local Apple store.  Got up at 3 in the morning, shocked to see there were people there since 8 in the evening or earlier.  There were hundreds in line.  It was the longest line I'd seen in quite some time.  I think there was a lot of demand for this iPhone.

Start time: 258.02
End time: 275.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and you could also order it online if you wanted to.  I got mine delivered the next...  Now you talk.  Well, I had to wait until 4.30 in the afternoon.  Oh, no.  Like a monster, like an animal.  What did you do between the morning and 4.30?  Set up a webcam so I could just monitor my front door so I could be there the moment it arrived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually got up at midnight on Friday morning, last Friday, and I couldn't get into the Apple store.  I kept pounding it.  The Apple store was crowded, but I gave up at midnight.  I went from midnight to 1, and I did finally go to Verizon.  I got one on Verizon.  I got one for my mom on Sprint that night.  And you know, it's fun to get in the Apple line, and you meet interesting people.  Oh, yeah.  It's a very diverse line these days.

Start time: 302.04
End time: 311.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't imagine anyone more interesting than someone who'd be in a line since Tuesday waiting to buy a phone.  You're a little groggy.  That has got to be the most interesting people you've ever run across.

End time: 319.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, I'll give you an example.  I'm here.  I'm standing there.  I'm talking to a guy.  We find out we're Yale classmates, class of 1977.

Start time: 320.04
End time: 321.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That tells you everything you need to know about Yale.

Start time: 322.00
End time: 363.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The guy works at MIT Media Lab.  His mentors were Marvin Minsky.  Yeah, I met Marvin.  Yeah, brilliant guy, and Seymour Papert, and Timothy Leary.  And I mean, it was fascinating.  But there's a variety of people now in the lineups.  Apparently, he spent a lot of time with Leary.  That'd be my guess.  Anyway, he actually showed me his app.  He's working on a very interesting AR app, which we'll probably have him on once it comes out.  So I agree with you, Dwight.  Believe it or not, I thought I was going to want the 6 Plus because I'd used giant Android phones for the last few years.  And I kind of like the little one.  What do you think, Jason?

Start time: 363.04
End time: 461.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've got the review unit of the 6 Plus, but this is the one I bought.  And it's the Knowing Full Well.  Having used both of them, I bought the 6.  Smaller one.  Yeah, I think there are people for whom the 6 Plus is going to be perfect because it's got longer battery life, because it's got a bigger screen.  Anybody who has vision problems, there's basically a large print mode that'll scale everything up so everything's bigger.  Instead of there being more, it's just bigger.  The camera is a little bit bigger.  Like I said, the battery life is a lot bigger.  And for some people, two-handed use, which is really what it's for, is fine.  They don't use their phone one-handed and they can get by.  It's not for me.  It's not for me.  My understanding is that there are parts of the world, especially in Asia, where there are a lot of people who only have one computing device, and it's their phone.  They don't have a tablet.  They don't have a laptop.  They just have their phone.  And for them, they want that battery and they want that big screen.  But it's not...  The thing that shocked me is that I was kind of hoping it would be a mini, like a nano iPad, and it's not.  It's a big phone.  Most of...  There are a couple iPad features.  What's the difference?  Well, it doesn't do a bunch of stuff that the iPad does.  It doesn't have any of those kind of like the finger gestures or things like that.  It's 16 by 9 instead of 4 by 3, which means you use it in landscape mode and it'll give you something that sort of looks like an iPad interface, except above the keyboard, there's almost no space for anything.  Whereas on the iPad, it goes a lot...  It's a lot wider in that dimension.  So, I don't know.  It's a big phone.  It's just a big phone.  If you want a big phone and want it to be an iPhone, you can do that now.  I think some people are...  It's going to be their favorite iPhone ever, but I think it's going to be a niche thing and not for most people.  It is kind of funny.

Start time: 461.06
End time: 469.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, they went from the smallest phones in the market today to one of the biggest.  I mean, that's a big jump from 4 inches to 5 and a half inches.

Start time: 469.04
End time: 492.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, they saw how the Samsung Galaxy Note sells, especially in Asia, and they wanted to be there.  I mean, from Apple's perspective, I think Apple really believes that the only part of the high-end phone market that they don't rule on are these phones in sizes where they don't have competitors.  And so, I think from their perspective, they're like, we're going to sweep in there and take those customers back from Samsung.  So, we'll see if that happens.

Start time: 493.20
End time: 501.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason, does the keyboard on the 6 Plus do the thing that the iPad keyboard does where you can split it into two sides?

Start time: 501.14
End time: 516.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's another one of those features that just isn't... It's an iPad feature and it's not in there.  They added some keys to the sides of the 6 Plus in landscape mode, but you can't do a split keyboard, which I think is a mistake because you've got to really stretch your thumbs if you're thumb typing on the 6 Plus.

Start time: 517.68
End time: 544.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Even on the 6, I wound up having to rearrange my icons so that all of the most used apps were at the bottom of the screen.  I did that with folders on the second screen.  And I actually, although when I hold the 5 now, it seems small, when I'm working with this, I kind of miss the smaller size.  I mean, I almost wish they made a 6 that was the standard 4-inch size, I think. I think there still would be people buying that.

Start time: 545.34
End time: 579.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, I have a theory. I mean, this year they came out with these two new phones, the 6 and the 6 Plus.  I'm not 100% convinced that the 5 and that size is just going to fade away into oblivion.  There's nothing stopping Apple from updating that size in the future, maybe next year with something they might call a 5, they might call a 6C, who knows what they'll do.  But I don't know if Apple's going to abandon that. They didn't update it this year, but I don't know if they're going to abandon the 4-inch size.  If you think about it this way, yeah, it's not new, but they have three sizes in their iPhone line.  They still sell the 5S and the 5C. So those phones are still available. They just didn't do new versions of them this year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Molly Wood in the New York Times said that the iPhone 6 is too small and the iPhone 6 Plus is too big.  She wishes there was something in the middle.  What did she use it for?  I don't know.

Start time: 594.10
End time: 611.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know. I think the 6 feels pretty good. It takes a little getting used to if you're used to an iPhone 5.  But I think because it's thinner and because the edges are rounded, including the screen, the actual glass on the top is rounded.  It wraps a little bit, yeah.  It doesn't feel enormous. It feels different, but not enormous compared to the 5.

Start time: 612.00
End time: 623.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually think 4-7 is a sweet spot. I used a Moto X for a long time and that was 4-7.  Ergonomically, I think that's just about the right. It's as big as you can get without feeling kind of big.  Right.

Start time: 624.12
End time: 630.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think this thing feels that big.  This feels like a jewel. This feels like a little jewel box.  No, I don't think so.

Start time: 631.00
End time: 655.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Dwight's absolutely right. I've heard a lot of iPhone users...  I thought the 5S or the 5 was more jewel-y.  A lot of iPhone users used to put their favorite steps in the dock and then their second favorite steps up at the very top.  And now the strategy I'm hearing from everyone is you want your favorite stuff down at the bottom because that's where your thumb is going to hit them and put the less interesting stuff at the top.  Of course, you can't place things arbitrarily on an iPhone home screen, so you've got to load a bunch of junk up into the top in order to push your things down to the bottom.  Oh.  I know.

Start time: 656.66
End time: 663.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you can play the chase around thing. You can kind of chase your icons around and get them where you want them, but it's a real pain.  Take things out of a folder.

Start time: 664.16
End time: 678.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Four million phones sold on Friday last, in 24 hours, in pre-order.  The estimates I saw were 10 million phones on day one this Friday. 10 million phones. Is that unprecedented?  That's a lot.

Start time: 679.14
End time: 688.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a record breaker. Literally, this thing's shaking. See them shaking?  Yeah. You never use an iPhone?  I don't care about these phones.  I have to say, a lot of people feel the same way you do.

Start time: 690.66
End time: 696.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When you're in the Apple news cycle, that's all you hear about.  Yeah.  That's all you hear about.

Start time: 696.51
End time: 699.00

Transcript:  It seems obsessive.  It's very obsessive.

Start time: 699.29
End time: 699.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is obsessive.

Start time: 700.68
End time: 706.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is the single most popular technology product.  Is it?  I think the iPhone?  I think it is.  I think it is.

Start time: 707.00
End time: 716.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that rightly so or not rightly so?  Obsessively so.  Who am I to judge?  You've got to admire Apple's marketing ability. I mean, just, they're impressive.  You know, they're still today.  Well, they've always been good at it.

Start time: 717.08
End time: 738.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they treat those bull crap lines. There's no reason for that.  There's still lines at Apple stores. Saturday there was a line.  There were lines at Apple stores.  There's no reason for that. That's just to get attention.  I'm surprised the media keeps playing it up.  But those are real lines. They're real lines.  Yeah, they're real. There's no doubt about it.  There are real lines, but it's not as though Apple couldn't have planned it, had all these phones ready to go,  shipped them overnight and had everyone have their phone ready.  They'd much rather have a line.

Start time: 739.00
End time: 762.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's true. Had their store worked on Friday morning at midnight, I wouldn't have had to get in line at all.  I could have just ordered it.  Anyway, what about this? Bloomberg Businessweek Tim Cook cover.  Andy Bio of Waxylinks says it's the ugliest cover he has ever seen.  He thinks Businessweek is slamming Tim Cook by using this.  It's a free font you can download on the Internet.  Tim Cook's Apple.

Start time: 763.02
End time: 766.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's done with...  Comic Sans, too classy for this cover.

Start time: 770.27
End time: 771.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty lame.

Start time: 771.38
End time: 786.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty bad. Tim Cook's Apple.  So it's in this kind of schoolish script, and they've used an inner bezel or inner glow and a gradient from blue to yellow.  Some said this was a slam at Tim Cook.

Start time: 786.00
End time: 786.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd say so.

Start time: 787.18
End time: 792.90

Transcript:  A backhand and slam from Bloomberg Businessweek.  I'm in on that.  It's a very positive cover story interview.

Start time: 793.00
End time: 802.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody didn't like him when they put that cover up like that.  Figured no one was going to read it.  It's become a meme.  And look at this picture of him out in front with the V for Victory hippie sign. That's bull crap.

Start time: 802.02
End time: 814.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People were saying after the Apple event that this is now Tim Cook's Apple, that the ghost of Steve Jobs has left the building, and that Tim...  Actually, it hasn't, because Tim hasn't touched Steve Jobs' office, apparently.  It's still the same as it was.  Because there's a ghost in there.

Start time: 815.14
End time: 816.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't want to let it out.

Start time: 817.08
End time: 819.96

Transcript:  It's going to haunt everybody if they let it out of there.

Start time: 820.16
End time: 829.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's without a doubt the iPhone 6 is...  And more importantly, perhaps Apple Pay and the Watch are Tim Cook's first products.  Their first new product category.

Start time: 830.72
End time: 870.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Since he took over, Tim Cook has been the MC at these Apple events, and yet the September 9th event, he gave the bulk of the presentation about the Apple Watch, and then he handed it off to Kevin Lynch for a demo.  But that's the first time he's ever done that with a product.  And that's because that's his product.  He wants to be the one to usher that into the world.  Is it his product or Johnny Ives' product?  Well, I would say it's the product that he was...  I mean, look, is it anybody's product?  It's a huge team's product.  But I think Tim Cook feels an attachment to this product in a way that he didn't to the other products that he was rolling out, because they were in the pipeline, and there were continuations of products that Steve Jobs had worked on.  And I think this one is much more personal to him.

Start time: 870.00
End time: 883.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here is Andy Bio's take on Tim Cook's Apple.  He rethought some other magazine covers using this crap font.  And here's the famous National Geographic...  That's what they call his crap font.  ...picture with the hashtag war is hell.

Start time: 885.00
End time: 887.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it was really an homage to the National Geographic.

Transcript:  Zombo.com.  This is Johnny Ive design.  Craig Grinnell did this one for Bloomberg Business Week.  Here's one.  Pickety mania. Why America has wealth inequality fever.  Something like one of those teenage magazines.  Karl Marx's new crush.  Sorry, Dr. Doom.  I like these. Some jabs at the design.  So Tim Cook was actually giddy at the end of that event.

Start time: 930.08
End time: 933.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he was only giddy because he got to touch Bono.  Let's do it. It's Bono, by the way.

End time: 944.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That hurts.  That was another meme is of the two touching.  Oh, yes.  Like that.  But no, I think he was truly giddy.

Start time: 945.08
End time: 951.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he was giddy because of Bono. I'm telling you.  Really?  Oh, you could tell as soon as he introduced him. He was all shaky.  He was like a fan. He's a fanboy.

Start time: 952.22
End time: 965.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In all the photos after Beats where he was shown with all these musicians and so forth,  he just has this glow on his face like he just got backstage.  I think he is a music fanboy.  All right. Okay.

Start time: 967.54
End time: 971.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 972.20
End time: 974.68

Transcript:  This happened before with Apple, if you remember, when Scully took over.  And what you have to remember when Scully took over is that even though everyone blames him for all sorts of things,  he took the company 10X bigger than it was.  Went from $800 million a year to $8 billion a year.  And then the board was irked about one quarter or something, and they basically rousted,  need to use that word, they rousted Scully and put in a bunch of boneheads,  and the company was starting going down. That's what's going to happen again.  This guy will probably be able to carry the company for a while.  He's going to irk someone. He's going to get rousted.  And that's when you sell the company.

Transcript:  Maybe if you have so much money to spend on the Apple Watch edition, maybe that comes,  I mean it comes with lots of things.  It comes with a box.  Special box.  A leather box.  It's a charging box.  With a lightning plug on the back that you can plug in and charge.  Now how much would you pay?  And charge.  And I think it comes with multiple bands.  And so who's to say it doesn't come with a replacement plan or a swap?  They could swap it out.  It better, for five to ten grand.  Or something else.  Because I think the obsolescence thing is actually the biggest argument about why you wouldn't want to pay $5,000 for a watch.

And I thought that was the most, I talked to a guy who works with metallurgists afterward, and he was like, well, you know, this is what happens in this industry.

Transcript:  And yet when we were talking about this the last time I was up here, that there are these companies that will, all of the parts leaks come from these companies that are, they replace the backplate with gold or wood or something like that.  And I do think Apple looks at that and says, well, why don't we eliminate the middleman?  Why don't we just make a gold whatever?  I mean, the next step, will they make a gold iPhone at some point and eliminate those guys too?  I don't know.  But they risk people really rejecting them as being some, you know, just for the super rich.  I feel like a $5,000 watch would.  Nobody's going to buy it.  I can't imagine.

Or the reason that Apple sells cases now is because it used to be they sold other people's cases when they sold an iPhone and now they sell their own and they get to make that money too.

His quote was,  they have to take us out in a box.

Start time: 1546.47
End time: 1568.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's...  Well, you know, I've been telling Tim,  and thank God he listens to me,  for years that the Apple's best market position is to say,  we're the privacy company.  We don't have to make money on your information.  We make money on our hardware.  That's what he says.  You can trust us.  That's what he says.  Well, they've just now started to really pursue that as a marketing angle.  I think it's a good angle for them.  Yeah, then the canary disappears, so that tells you something.

Transcript:  Well, and there's a long queue of law enforcement officials  asking for decryption of iPhones.  There's a whole process.  You would send an iPhone to Apple.  It was a several-month wait because it took a while to do it,  but they would crack the iPhone and send you the contents.  That, Apple now is proud to say, is no longer possible.  We no longer can do that.  We've made these secure, and I think that's smart of them.  And by the way, it's very clear that the jab is at Facebook and Google.  He says, told Charlie Rose, we don't have to sell your information.  We don't sell advertising.  Of course, they do, but...

Transcript:  So one of the things Apple did in their transparency report last year  is they put a line in that said,  we have never received a Section 215 request.  That's the secret request authorized by the Patriot Act for information  that comes with a gag order.

Start time: 1643.02
End time: 1644.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1645.44
End time: 1685.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It says, we're going to ask you for information.  You must give us that information, and you may not tell anyone.  That's only if it comes with a national security letter.  It's in NSL.  Apple put in their transparency report covering January 1st through 30th of 2014,  we've never received one.  And we, at the time, said, that looks like a warranty canary.  You don't say we've never received one  unless you expect to receive one at some point,  and what you'll do is you'll take that out,  because obviously you now cannot say it anymore.  So, yep, it's happened.  There is no warranty canary anymore in their transparency report.  So apparently they have, I don't know what that means, big deal.

Start time: 1687.01
End time: 1693.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  Fascinating to see that Yahoo was threatened with a quarter of a million day fine  for not cooperating with the government a couple of years ago.  That's coming out now.  It's kind of an expensive fine.  Quarter of a million dollars a day.  Yeah, that's high.  Over a refusal to give the data to the NSA, or should it refuse,  I think one can assume that Yahoo did.  The company released 1,500 documents from a failed suit against the NSA  over user data requests and cooperation with PRISM Compliance.  In those documents, the information that they had been threatened  with a quarter of a million dollars a day fine.  Of course the threat is one thing.

Transcript:  So Leo, do you think that if the feds came to Apple with a phone  and said, here, we want this decrypted, and Apple said to the feds,  we don't have the keys, we can't do it,  do you think the feds would just walk away and say, okay, you can't do it?

Start time: 1752.67
End time: 1757.90

And that was in the sitcom, it was a drama where the exact same scenario took place,  and we think it's the exact same.  The whole thing was from this Turkish broadcast.

Start time: 1934.22
End time: 1984.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The defense he's taking is that he has the right to veto because he's the governor.  Right.  The prosecutor says yes, but when combined with the threat, it becomes something else.  And so that's it's all right now.  It's all just posturing.  It feels like a lot of politics, frankly.  It is a lot of politics.  But if he threatened somebody with a veto and his own friends, the appointees were being  investigated by this group, you know, there's probably enough smoke there for an indictment.  At least that's what the prosecutor thinks.  Special prosecutor thinks.  The other thing, but there was a reason I brought up Rick Perry is, you know, Rick Perry has  implied that ISIS is coming across the Texas border and there's even a sheriff in West  Texas who says that they found Muslim clothing and Korans in the desert.

Transcript:  Actually, interesting story coming out of a company that specializes in teardowns and  understanding how the processors work in these things.  Chipworks is their name.  They've taken a look at the A8 processor in the new iPhones and they say this is not a  Samsung part.  iPhones have had Samsung parts in them since day one.

Start time: 2035.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or Samsung was, yeah.

Start time: 2038.14
End time: 2047.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chipworks says the A8 processor was fabbed at TSMC.  It's kind of amazing.  It has two billion transistors in it.

Start time: 2047.00
End time: 2050.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is a smaller process than the A7.  It's a 20 nanometer process.

Start time: 2052.10
End time: 2075.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's 89 square millimeters with two billion transistors.  That actually was more interesting than anything else.  That just blows my mind.  Obviously, Apple would like to have at least a second source for chips if not get out of  Samsung's pockets entirely.  Samsung is a big company.  The fact that they make cell phones to compete with iPhones in one division and the processor  in another, that doesn't mean much.  It does.

Start time: 2076.18
End time: 2084.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't?  Don't you think?  You don't want your vendor, you're competing with making your chip?  You think they'll put a bug in it?  Oh, gee.  I never thought of that, but that's not a bad idea.

Start time: 2085.48
End time: 2101.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Apple hates being reliant on anybody.  Especially a competitor.  But Apple doesn't own fabs.  Right.  They don't own.  There are lots of different parts that they don't own, but I'm sure that they're also  talking to Intel because Intel's now said that they're willing to make other chips for  other people too.  Armchips.

Start time: 2102.00
End time: 2108.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're willing to make armchips.  Well, they got those big, they got huge fabs.  Huge fabs, right.  Would Apple build, so a fab is the plant in which you build these chips.  Right.

Start time: 2110.08
End time: 2114.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Short for fabrication.  They design the chips, but they don't own the factories where they make them.  They contract with somebody.

Start time: 2115.08
End time: 2117.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then they're very expensive to build.  They're billion-dollar factories.  Right.

Start time: 2118.18
End time: 2128.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Apple is, this is why all those assembly plants in Asia, mostly in China that Apple  uses, those aren't owned by Apple either.  Apple owns some factories, but others they just rent out, essentially.

Start time: 2129.50
End time: 2147.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Obviously, Apple would like to own from beginning to end.  They want to control it.  They want to control it.  I think they'd like to own it.  I remember Henry Ford, the big plant he built in Dearborn, the box cars would come in with  wood.  The Rouge.  The Rouge factory, the box cars would come in with wood and iron ore and out would come  a Model T.  Yep.

Start time: 2148.14
End time: 2157.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes sense.  Very similar to Foxconn, by the way.  Iron ore would come in.  They have their own smelters.  They smelt it.  They do.  Right.  Out the end comes, there's an iPhone comes out of it.

End time: 2178.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now that we know, well, there is the Touch ID is sapphire and the camera on the back.  And the camera's always been sapphire.  Not when we heard that the iWatch or Apple Watch, two of the three models are going to  be sapphire screens.

Start time: 2179.18
End time: 2187.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what was it that makes such a big deal about the sapphire?  Why?  Because on your show, everyone goes, oh, the sapphire is going to be sapphire.  Well, people are excited.  It's a new material.

Start time: 2188.20

Start time: 2210.02
End time: 2236.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In fact, it was, I didn't know this until I read the Walter Isaacson biography, but Corning  had shut down the Gorilla Glass factories.  There was no market for it.  Steve Jobs came to them and said, I've got this thing I'm making and I would really like  some very hard glass for it.  So it was really Apple that made Gorilla Glass happen.  And what were a third version, which I think is a pretty strong glass.  What do they call this?  Ion exchange?  Ion, some ion exchange, yeah.  Yeah, it's pretty cool.  It must be good.

Start time: 2236.12
End time: 2240.86

Start time: 2262.00
End time: 2264.41

Start time: 2269.00
End time: 2311.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a blog that goes out and gets some of the first iPhones in Australia and they  always drop them as a drop test.  Yeah, I hate that.  Well, except when they dropped it, yes, it broke, but it was the way it broke that was  interesting.  The glass part separated from the case.  It cracked, but it looked almost like something popped up from within, like the way a battery  and a battery expands.  Like a delaminated or something?  So it broke differently than past iPhones, which I found.  That's why I immediately went to the case.  Is that their new motto?  Break differently?  Break differently.  That's a good one.  But if you haven't seen that, look for that video.  It's really the way it breaks.

Transcript:  So you can get them replaced.  I tell people this tip.  This is a tip for everybody who has one of these old phones.  If it's broken and you want to get it, you can take it in.  Just lick it, right?  You can try it if you want to bleed.  You can take it in to get it replaced, and they'll tell you, no, they usually won't tell you.  But if you go in with band-aids on, as though you've been cutting yourself on the glass,  they immediately see it as a liability issue, and they give you a brand new phone on the spot.  I know two guys who've done this.  OK, kids.  You'll have band-aids.  And if you want to really get cool, you have blood on your face.  Or your tongue.

Transcript:  Let's see.  iOS.  Apple confirms that the NFC chip in this does nothing, so that's nice.  Well, it's an only old word for Apple Pay.  Oh.  And Apple Pay is not available until October.  Well, for now.  So you've got an NFC chip.

Start time: 2375.00
End time: 2376.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're all in on Apple Pay, I bet you.  Me?

Start time: 2377.02
End time: 2394.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, no.  I like the...  Look, OK, I love the idea of not carrying a wallet.  Just like the Queen of England.  I want to be like the Queen.  But I don't think that just because Apple does it, it's going to suddenly emerge into the world fully formed.  We've been trying to do this for years.  I think that's the wrong order, though.

Start time: 2395.20
End time: 2410.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think one of the reasons Apple's doing it now is because it thinks that this is a good time, because they're also replacing normal swipes with chip and pin in the US.  That's true.  By the end of next year, everything has to be chip and pin.  And so this stuff is all going to turn over, and it's going to have NFC built into it, and it's going to have this built into it.

Start time: 2411.32
End time: 2415.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The timing is right, because they have to buy new terminals for chip and pin.  Right.

Start time: 2416.02
End time: 2426.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And they've got enough clout, too, as a very large phone maker that can control the hardware.  I buy that.  But I think it's timing more than it's like Apple's making it happen.  That makes sense.  Apple's helping it happen, maybe, but it's also good timing.

Start time: 2426.08
End time: 2454.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if I'm a merchant, I know I'm going to have to get a new terminal for chip and pin by the end of this next coming year.  And it'll have an NFC scanner.  And I'm for sure going to make sure that it supports every form of tap and pay I can get, which means Google Wallet, Apple Pay, whatever else there is.  Exactly.  Walmart and CVS have already said, we're going to buy new terminals, but it isn't going to have Apple Pay in it.  That's not good.  But I think that's because they've already done a deal with somebody else.  Probably so.  But they're early on it.  I think there are plenty of merchants.

Start time: 2455.00
End time: 2458.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These other guys have had this years and years NFC has been on these other phones.

Start time: 2459.24
End time: 2465.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But you see what Jason's saying is because chip and pin is coming, everybody has to buy new terminals.  I'm agreeing with this basic thesis.

Start time: 2466.26
End time: 2467.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this is not early.

Start time: 2468.00
End time: 2479.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And Google had a hard time because Google doesn't control their hardware partners and not all the phones that had the NFC.  And I think Apple will push it along a little bit.  And everybody who's got one of those NFC Android phones will benefit too.

Transcript:  So prediction, by the end of 2015, will we all be tapping and paying, whether it's with our Apple Watch, Apple Phone, or Google Phone?

Start time: 2486.29
End time: 2495.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No.  I think it's going to be more of a convenience because there are going to be places that don't take it, right?  I mean, it's just like now.  There are places that only take cash and maybe now they're starting to have Square.  So you still have to carry your wallet.

Start time: 2496.00
End time: 2506.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think at some point they developed the bump and steal.  But if I'm going to...  When you got the phone on, somebody bumps you and they boom, next thing you know, you've got a payment.  Yeah, but you can't do that because you've got to do the Touch ID and stuff.  That's going to be cracked.

Transcript:  But when I run to Whole Foods to buy some beer and peanut butter or whatever, I might just take my phone for that.  Whole Foods will do it.  Because I know I can pay them.  They already said they're going to do it.  And if I forget my wallet and I have my phone, I'll actually be able to buy something, which is nice.  Other than like scanning my card at Starbucks or something.

Start time: 2521.32
End time: 2543.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I have to say already just...  It's purely psychological, I'm sure, John.  You're right that it's probably not super secure.  But already just the notion that I can touch my finger to this and my bank, for instance, is using it to unlock the banking app makes me feel better.  LastPass is using it.  It makes me feel better.  I feel like that's better than a PIN.  Yeah.  Right?  It's harder to reproduce.  Yeah.

Especially when the people you work with aren't in the same office.  Yeah, what do you do when they're not in the same office?  Miscommunication can happen.  Oh, yeah, it can.  And there could be misunderstandings.  In fact, I find when people are in different offices, sometimes they hate each other because  they don't understand each other.  That's where GoToMeeting is bridging the gap.  Bringing people together.  Oh, I'm going off script.  It's all yours now.  I dropped the script.  Bringing people together.  You're going to let me take this, huh?  Actually, millions of people rely on Citrix GoToMeeting.  It's probably the number one way to meet online.  It is great.  Not only, you know, they've always had screen sharing, so you're on the same, literally  on the same page when you're reviewing documents or presentations, but they now have HD video  conferencing, so it is a full video conference.  I feel so sorry for the people, and I know lots of them, who spent $50,000, $100,000  on big conference rooms with video conferencing.  Yeah, I know.  I've seen it.  Those big commercial Cisco systems.  And they're not even as good as GoToMeeting.  It's like, God, I feel bad.  I feel bad for them.  It's expensive.  It's really expensive.  GoToMeeting is so affordable.  You pay once a month, I think it's 49 bucks, for as many meetings as you want, as often  as you want.  You present, you demonstrate, you meet.  It's so inexpensive.  They don't, you know, time you.  So, I know plenty of remote offices that just keep it running all the time, and they're  like working together.  It's really great.

It also has a Netflix app.  But the picture on it is, when your connection is good, is better, I think, than the picture  on the Apple TV and certainly on what I've seen on even the highest end Roku.  It's a really good streaming box.  And Amazon ... This is version 1.0 for both for Amazon, and I would not discount them  at all because, as we've seen with the release of these new Kindles, they keep coming back  and coming back until they get it right.

Transcript:  So I was writing about these new Kindles and somebody pointed out to me that they actually  changed the branding and only the e-reader is now called Kindle.  All the rest of them are just called Fire.  Oh, there's no Kindle Fire.  It's just Fire.  It's Fire HD, yeah.

Start time: 2968.00
End time: 2996.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the new rubber encased Fire.  Now what I love about this is there's two, first of all, it's $149.  Six or seven inch Amazon tablet.  Free unlimited all-you-can-eat kids content and a two-year guarantee that means they'll  replace it even if the kid breaks it.  I believe so.  That's a pretty big selling point for any parent who's kids, now it is encased in rubber  like this.  Yeah, it's ruggedized.

Start time: 2996.70
End time: 3001.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 3004.00
End time: 3035.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But still there's always a glass front that could be broken with a determined child.  Yeah, that's what kids are for.  So that got my attention.  My kids are 20 and 19 and I don't expect them to want this.  I feel like this is something if you had a two-year-old you'd be very excited about,  two parents and four kids.  There's a family library feature that means two parents and four kids can share movies,  books.  This is kind of what Apple's done with their family sharing.

Transcript:  They've got all their content deals and it's smart.  One of the things I like about Amazon and these products is they're defiantly Amazon  products.  They're not Android devices even though Android is powering them and they're using their ecosystem  and their library of content that they've got to power this stuff.  It's a really interesting idea.  And for two years.  And then there's the $99 tablet too.  It doesn't look like a cheap tablet.  It's actually a decent...  I'm impressed.

Transcript:  Our buddy Andy Anotko went to the launch event in New York and he said he did a double take  because it's one thing to see a backlit screen that's at this retina quality where you can't  see the pixels but to see a reflective screen like an e-ink screen at 300 DPI.  He said his brain kind of couldn't wrap itself around what he was seeing.  It's essentially the same as a paper.  It looks like you're looking at paper except then you tap it and now it doesn't have a  button.  It's got a pressure sensitive haptic.  It's a button that doesn't move is what it is.  So you can turn the page just by pressing the sides.

Transcript:  Higher contrast than before.  Now $199 means with special offers you're going to get ads.  If you want it without special offers add $20.  If you want free 3G, the WhisperSync over 3G which I think is great.  You're at an airport or you're driving around and you want to get a book you can do that.  That's another $50.  I think this is a pretty compelling product.  Whenever I go someplace.  Even though it is the highest most expensive E Ink Amazon Kindle in a long time.

Start time: 3185.64
End time: 3205.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's an audience for it.  They're still selling the cheaper E Ink Kindles.  In fact, there's one below the paper white now.  It doesn't light itself but it's sort of based on the paper white.  It's got a touch screen.  I went on a beach vacation with my wife this summer and everybody had these E Ink Kindles.

It was in the story of Jeff Bezos and Amazon.  They priced Prime just randomly basically.  People came to Bezos and said, we don't know how much it's going to cost because you can't  tell how much people are going to use it.  He's got a sense of these things.  And he said, we're going to make it 75 bucks.  He just buy Fiat.  Yeah, that would be right.  And it turned out to be about right.  Yeah, that's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're doing anything?  There is a little concern in the Android world.  A cross website flaw, browser flaw.  It's not in the Chrome browser that currently comes with Android distributions.  But so many Android users, about half, still use pretty old versions of Android  that they're vulnerable to this.  You have to be using the original Android browser that used to come with Android phones.  They call it the AOSP, Android Open Source Platform Browser.  And it allows malicious sites to inject JavaScript into other sites,  which means that they could read cookies, password fields, submit forms,  grab keyboard input.  It's a very bad bug.

Transcript:  What burst of Android are we talking about here?

Start time: 3919.45
End time: 3940.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was changed in 4.2.  So that's pretty recent.  That's very recent.  Anything prior to 4.2...  I don't even think my phone's...  Now you can fix it very simply by just not using the AOSP browser and starting to use Chrome.  However, I think there are still parts of the browser embedded into web views in other applications.  So you have to be careful about what applications you use.

Transcript:  Can you delete that browser in the older version of Android?

Start time: 3943.32
End time: 3963.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't. Well, you need the functionality.  So it's just like Internet Explorer and Windows.  It's used to render web pages and email and other programs.  So I don't think you can just kill it.  I've never heard this.  Android browser is actually around half of all Android users are still in pre-4.2.  Yeah, well, if I'm on 4.3, which is a...

This is very old. It's 4.3.  Look, there's not a scratch on it.  I keep my keys in the same pocket.  This phone is built to last.  This was the last great Nexus phone.  I love the Nexus 1, which was its predecessor.  I agree with you.  The Nexus 1? What do you mean the Nexus?

Start time: 4027.93
End time: 4076.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's better black.  Anyway, now you have a Fire Phone too.  You live it up.  Users of Android 4.0 and up can switch to Chrome, Firefox, or Opera.  You want to be careful about other third-party browsers  because they may be using that AOSP code.  Google has offered the following statement to Peter Brede at Ars Technica.  We have reviewed this report and Android users running Chrome as their browser  or those who are on Android 4.4 Plus are not affected.  For earlier versions of Android, we've released patches.  So you'll want to make sure you've got those patches.  It's a serious flaw.  I'd say.  Speaking of Android, the new Moto X is...  Well, pre-orders began last week.  I'm getting my leather-bound Moto X on Friday.

And the Apple guys, and I talked to several of them,  said, no, no, that's locked to T-Mobile.  It's not, right?  No, it's not.  They were lying.  They were lying to you.

Start time: 4364.80
End time: 4376.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

I ain't talking counterfeiting here.  And I ain't talking a postage meter with special expense special, in quotes, special ink that's  very expensive.  It's just your regular thing.  In fact, Stamps.com is so great.  Sometimes postage meters, I think they charge you when the postage rates change, you have  to bring it to the post office and they go.

If you are in the business where you're mailing stuff, even if it's brochures or bills, but  especially if it's packages, if you're selling on Etsy or eBay or Amazon, if you need Stamps.com,  it turns your mail fulfillment into something that's professional, works well and looks  great.  In fact, you can even print those right on the envelope if you're presenting something  in a mail envelope with your company logo, the return address, print for any size package,  print for any style of mail.  You even get discounts you cannot get at the post office.  And unlike the post office, Stamps.com never closes.  So at 24-7, you're able to do your stuff.  Important addresses from your address book, use cost codes to track postage by spending  by customer, automatic address verification.  And discounted package insurance all in one click.  Plus, you don't have to handwrite forms ever.  And I always think that looks a little amateurish.  It's all printed out, including the customs forms for international mailing, the certified  mail and return receipts.  They'll send an email out to your recipient saying, here's the code.  It is great.  You save up to 80% compared to a postage meter and no more time-consuming trips to the post  office.  A uniformed representative of the federal government will come to your door, aka your  mail carrier, and take your mail away.  Right now, use my promo code TWIT.  We've got a special offer for you.  Just click that microphone in the upper right hand corner and fill in the offer code TWIT.  It's a $110 bonus offer.  You get the digital scale, so you always have exactly the right postage.

Go to Stamps.com before you do anything else.  Click the microphone.  Type in TWIT STAMPS.COM.  You no longer have to create a Google Plus profile when you sign up for Gmail.  Google's really backing down on Google Plus.  I don't understand why.  I like Google Plus.  Why would they, I don't understand why they would go to all this trouble and then just  pfft.

They just assumed everything in Google was going to run through there.  I don't like Google Plus at all.  People haven't embraced it like that.  You don't?  Well, it's crippled some of their other features.  Like Hangouts is actually a really great feature and yet it was extremely confusing on how  to use it because it was so intertwined with Google Plus.  And since keeping them, pushing them apart a little bit, it's improved Hangouts.  So I bet there are people inside Google saying, why do we have to do it this way?  And finally they backed off a little.

The way they sold the cab medallions, it was all this kind of artificial constraint.  Nobody wanted to change.  The fact is, San Franciscans were just tired.  You could never rely on a taxi in San Francisco.  Their tech savvy people, Uber and Lyft, came in and people just embraced it because now they could get a car.

Transcript:  Our show today is brought to you by Audible.  Love Audible books.  Of course, the first thing I put on the new iPhone, the Audible app.  Put it on every phone.  Sign in all the books I've ever listened to on Audible since the year 2000.  Mike Yelgin and I were having a battle over who joined Audible first.  It's very close.  We both joined in the year 2000, but I think I joined in February 2000 and he joined in  March or April.  It was that close.  Audible has over 100,000, 150,000 books in its library.  I just finished Graham Nash's biography, autobiography, Wild Tales about his rock and  roll life.  I quite enjoyed that.  My next one, and everybody's been saying, get to it soon, is WTF at Whiskey Tango Foxtrot.  Have you read that yet?  Because I hear really good things about it.  The story of Whiskey Tango Foxtrot sounds like something ripped from today's headlines.  I'll tell you what.  This is David Schaeffer's new novel.  The committee, an international cabal of industrialists and media barons, is on the verge of privatizing  all information.  Dear Diary, in an idealistic online underground, stands in the way of that takeover using radical  politics, classic spycraft, and technology that makes big data look like dial-up.  Sounds really good.  It's a techno thriller.  It's a techno thriller.  Now, here's the deal.  The reason I mention these books is because you can get two books free right now.  A lot of us have been raving about the great new novel from Mark Krasinovich.  He is at Microsoft.  In fact, he's kind of the guy who is responsible for Azure at Microsoft.  He did the incredible sys internals.  Microsoft bought them, hired him, and got him writing his books.  Zero Day, Trojan Horse, and Rogue Code are great because they, again, are ripped from  the headlines.  They're about hackers.  In Rogue Code, Mark Krasinovich talks actually about high frequency trading and hackers who  get code into the stock market.  It's just, I can't wait to read it.  Are you an audible listener, right?  Yeah.

Nexus, since you mentioned Microsoft, Ramesh Nam, who used to work at Microsoft, I believe,  and he's got a great series that starts with a book called Nexus, which is about what if  you could implant, basically code your brain to be an operating system and what would happen  when you can start hacking your brain and other people's brains.  Wouldn't that be cool?  It's a pretty awesome book.  Great speculation.  You liked it.  Yeah, very good.  You've got some great sci-fi recommendations.  It's got the ups and the downs of that technology and how it would affect people and the government  wants to control it and really good stuff from somebody who is from the tech industry  and is also very marvelous.  Well, that's why I like Krasinovich's books.

Classics like The Heart of Darkness, read by Kenneth Branagh, The Legends of King Arthur  and His Knights, Robert Louis Stevenson.  There's all sorts of great stuff.  And of course, modern novels.  All the big novelists' novels come out in audiobooks, same day and date as the books  come out on the bookstore shelves.  The new Jonathan Kellerman novel is coming soon, The Golem of Hollywood.  I think the thing to do is to go to audible.com.  Oh, Peter Thiel has a new book.  Actually, I've been reading excerpts of this.  It's his speeches from Stanford.  It's his speeches, okay.

To ship your order on time or order or offer a refund.  Online sellers are going to be required to ship merchandise within 30 days of...  I didn't know that they weren't.  30 days?  Within 30 days of purchase or else give you the option for a refund.  That's nothing new.  Apparently not.  The rule prohibits sellers from soliciting mail, internet or telephone order sales unless  they have a reasonable basis to expect they can ship the ordered merchandise within the  time stated.  You know that this affects is somebody like Coin who raised a lot of money at $55 a pop  for that charge card that you could pre-program and they still haven't shipped it.  They were supposed to ship it this summer and if they say no it's probably going to  be next year.  That's not merchandise.  That's raising money.

Transcript:  Oh well a bunch of us...  I've been thinking of leaving for a while and it turns out that there was a... the timing  was such that I left along with many of my colleagues.  They laid off a bunch of people.  IDG actually in general laid off a bunch of people.  Why?  You'd have to ask them.  I'm not sure...  Oh come on there's gossip.  He doesn't want to speak for them.  Well I mean I don't...  Well he's not working for them anymore.  Why?  I don't know if I can profess to understand the reason this time.  This is the latest in a series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's more complicated than any one reason.  And honestly the founder and owner of IDG passed away earlier this year and he had a  really soft spot for the media.  Is that Pat McGovern?  Pat McGovern, yeah.  I didn't know he passed away.  Yeah, yeah.  It was six months ago.  And so the people in charge now do not have the same priorities.  They have different priorities and I think they're funding his foundation.  And so ultimately...  What happens to Macworld Expo?  I don't know the answer.  That's run by a separate part of IDG and I haven't heard whether they're continuing  that or not.  They haven't announced that they're not.  PCworld has stopped publishing.  So what happened to Macworld magazine is that it went out of print just like PCworld did  last year.  They're still going to do a digital edition on the iPad.  So if I go to Macworld.com...  Oh, there'll be an iPad.  Yeah, and Macworld.com and PCworld.com are still there and TechHive and GreenBot, they're  all still there.  But the staff is much smaller than it used to be, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  People have portrayed that as being sort of a calculated thing about Macworld.  Cold blooded is the way it was seen.  Laying people off, you can judge that however you like.  I'd say those layoffs happened across IDG everywhere in the US and that's the date they  picked.  It wasn't tied to just Macworld.  Well, no.
