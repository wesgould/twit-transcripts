Transcript:  got any leaks or stories actually I'm curious what you think about this for Katka in my opinion Reuters story that Apple's getting to self driving cars. Yeah. Yeah. Well you know that was a business insider rumor that they just spun and spun and spun and that Reuters picked it up. Just doesn't speak very well for Reuters Reuters says according to an anonymous source which always makes me a little bit nervous the source who declined to be named.  Said that Apple is interested in making cars not individual components or automotive software but they want to build cars probably self driving cars. This sounds like a hoax. It sounds like it sounds like the Apple TV rumor. Well you know it was funny because some

Transcript:  Because Munster Jean Munster you know who who has been pushed you know he's been saying that the Apple TV is just a year away. It was his fabrication. Seven years. Right. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I was all in. So he so he he said you know well we're going to get an Apple TV before we get it and a self driving car. Someone pointed out to me that and I think he's right. Someone pointed out that in testimony Eddie Q said that there are no.  It was Schiller said that they they were working on a car before they decided to make the phone which makes which makes the Apple car idea what eight years old or nine years old already. And you know you have to know how to make cars first and you have to know how before you can make a self driving car.

Transcript:  miles from Apple's headquarters in Cupertino and apparently they've met with contract manufacturers. Patrick you're a car guy. You know the name Magnus Steyer in Austria a unit of Magna International. I've heard it at least once. They make cars. I have no idea what they make. So autonomous vehicles are coming. Autonomous vehicles at the luxury level will probably be here in 2020. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Magnum by the way makes automotive systems. Yeah. I mean we already have assisted driving some really cool assisted driving stuff is going to hit like 2016 2017.  You know depending on who you're asking like 2018 to 2080 like 2020 you're talking about a fairly sophisticated level of autonomous vehicle.  I'd like to take a moment to point out that you know everybody thought Tesla was going to fall on its face. Everybody thought you know oh yeah the PayPal guy is going to start a car company.  You know nobody really I mean who would have thought that Apple could have pulled together.  You know the iPhone and judging from the stories there's a beautiful story in the New York Times where they talked about sort of behind the scenes at the debut of the original I was not a great story. Yeah.  That was from a book called Dogfight. Yeah. The Apple Google battle and you could just smell you could just smell the bailing liar in that story.  They were just keeping it together and then they should.

Transcript:  While Steve Jobs is demonstrating the first iPhone in 2007 are sitting in the front rows at Moscone West taking a shot every time a bit of the demo works because they know that there's a distinct path that jobs could follow.  And if he deviates in the least the iPhones will crash. Yeah. They just won't do it. And then they will be finding new jobs. Right. So they're taking a shot. He said by the end of the demo we were drunk but we were ecstatic because it worked.  This is a good thing. Isn't it great. It's a great story.

Start time: 488.94
End time: 520.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  It would just interrupt. Is it possible because it's always been Apple's contention that because of Eric being on the board that  Apple should have owned the whole iPhone or the smartphone market a little longer than it did. But the Google guys steal the product essentially make a copy come up with their own operations that this is a.  It's kind of a get back needle them and make it look because Google's the head of the driver of this car so that's that Apple come in there and mess with them. Just a mess with them.

Transcript:  I mean just for fun let's tie in the whole like what's Uber worth now more than you know the EU at this point in terms of its market value some insane number.  I am not particularly an Uber enthusiast. I am probably alone in the panel on that. But if Apple thinks Uber is going to give Google a metric ton of money if for no other reason than jerking around stock prices would they start rumors on a.

Transcript:  I don't think autonomous car. I don't think Apple would do it just to make it. Why not.  I don't know. I don't. That's kind of childish.  Philip Elmer do it. You're the apple apple apple.  Apple be childish like that.

Start time: 557.66
End time: 593.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I assume Apple is going to look at every possible product that they could monetize if there's a product that they could make better than anybody else makes it. They're going to look at trying to do it and it's perfectly.  I believe the Wall Street Journal and the Financial Times who have actually put automotive reporters on the store which is why we're starting to get some detail and some names and some numbers of people.  So they're working on it. They could be doing any number of things they could be building Apple Apple's version of Google's Street View. You know that car that we saw driving around with all those.

Start time: 593.94
End time: 598.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What was that car. Yeah. Was it an autonomous vehicle was a street view car. What was.

Start time: 598.28
End time: 622.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well you know Apple doesn't have a permit to drive autonomous vehicles so it's unlikely that it was.  There's a number of things that could have been doing one of them is making really good maps to compete with Google Maps. It could have been making really good maps to try out an autonomous vehicle.  They're going to look at it. They've got smart people. They're going to hire smart people. Maybe it'll be a product. Maybe it won't. They're going to do that kind of stuff.

Start time: 623.06
End time: 627.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah. Google does that too. They've got enough cash to say let's see what happens here.

Start time: 627.58
End time: 673.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  A couple sort of going a little bit macro though.  Munster points out that that investors are always looking for. Is it possible that Apple has another winner.  You know somewhere in the in a that they're working on in a secret lab. And so it doesn't hurt. Right. For the stocks value to float this kind of rumor.  And then it also someone else pointed out that you've got a lot of really smart engineers at Apple who are must be getting sick of doing the you know the iPhone 5 the iPhone 5S the iPhone 6 the iPhone 6S.  You know that's pretty boring for a real smart engineer. So to have a new project that's that's completely different. That's not another iPhone could keep these guys around because otherwise they're going to leave.

Start time: 673.76
End time: 698.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's a question for you. Would an Apple car have a break and accelerator pedal or wouldn't they just want to combine the two into one one button or maybe.  No button. No button. That's what I'm saying. You wave at it. No. So maybe you go like this and the car goes forward. You go like this and it slows down. You swipe left to turn left swipe right to turn right.  Well I think the I think. Yeah. That's exactly what I want.

Start time: 700.76
End time: 738.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well there's there's no reason in terms of like low or high speed maneuvering you couldn't use a joystick to do it right. There's there's adaptive driving systems a lot of people.  Just lean in the direction you want the car to go and you'll never have an accident right because people don't figure out ways to have accidents with superior technology.  Someone in the chat says take the drugs off Leo someone.  2016 is I'm pretty sure 2016 it is as of 2016 it will be legal to test for the drugs.  Sorry.  I think as of 2016 will be legal in the state of California to test vehicles without steering wheels or pedals. I don't know if that's a Wikipedia hack.

Start time: 738.74
End time: 769.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No I believe it because if you look at the Google self the current Google self driving car doesn't have any controls you get in and it goes and you don't.  It's a little. I think consumers are not going to want that because they're going to want the feeling that well I could override this if I want a while.  Yeah eventually they're just going to do. They saw that Mercedes Benz it basically was a living room on wheels. The concept car from CES. Sure I read about that in the William Gibson novel.  25 years ago it looked like it also you could turn off the windows so you wouldn't have to see what's going on outside which I would need.

Start time: 770.68
End time: 773.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 775.86
End time: 782.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right so you're giving some credibility to the and I guess you're right since it's the Journal of Financial Times. It's a lot of sources now at this point.

Start time: 782.80
End time: 795.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah they've hired people.  They. But you know Apple doesn't usually come out with products until other people have sort of perfected the idea and the public's ready for it and then they'll make the best.

Start time: 796.64
End time: 810.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Car or whatever kind of car they're making. But seriously this is a new Apple you got to acknowledge that it's not necessarily good. That's how they've always done in the past but I don't think there's any reason to think Tim Cook wouldn't.  Want to break some new ground to write.

The I love the story that Billboard did about the Grammys because it gave you a feeling for what's going on.  You've got they describe this scene where Clive Davis is pre Grammy gala where Tim Cook shows up and 80 Q and Robert Condick who runs iTunes and Jimmy I've been an Al Gore and Nancy Pelosi.  And it's like this is the white hot center of this party.  And there's a line a single file line of record industry executives you know lined up to see these guys and there's Q you know playing sort of you know it's like a scene out of the sweet smell of success and he's playing Sydney Falco.  JJ.  And everybody you know wants to wants to kiss the the ring and and what clearly they're making deals.  And according to Billboard they've been you know I've been talking to one record label after another.  According to Apple Insider they've been signing up exclusive deals with artists so that when an artist comes out with a new CD it gets played first and exclusively on whatever they're going to call iTunes beats streaming service.  So it's going to be very hard for Spotify and what's the other one Pandora to compete with this new streaming service if Apple gets everybody first.  So and then and then the other thing is that they hire the most popular DJ in England you know they take them off the radio and they put them in Cupertino and and probably he's going to be.  Part of what of what Jimmy Ivine calls deciding what song comes next this this idea of curating music you're going to get a streaming service and someone is going to decide what song comes next who you trust.  And you know like FM radio works only it's now doesn't go over the radio.

It's become a great place for people to make money as a as almost like as a business like eBay is a business for people with two in particular two affiliate companies who have.  Just been kicked off.  Just been kicked off.  And I have a feeling there's going to be a bit of a outcry.  In fact I'm surprised there hasn't been a bit of an outcry Pinterest which has been looking to monetize.  I was already considering if they claim this has nothing to do with monetization but they are doing some interesting things to monetize.  One is they're going to do promoted pins kind of like promoted tweets.  But they but these two companies reward style and hello society.  All their links as of Friday or I'm sorry Thursday are being pulled.  So if you were making affiliate money and pretty good affiliate money too as people clicked on your links and buy.  But the other thing Pinterest is going to do is maybe put a buy button there.  So an affiliate link is a bad thing right.  If they're going to start selling direct.

Start time: 1987.46

And remember, there were a lot of those meetups.  Whatever happened to those have a tweet up.  You can have a look. I don't want to meet people.  I don't like people.  Everyone go out.  No, but I think that he makes an interesting point.

One day, 103,000 units.  So, I mean, 720,000 for a whole year is not a lot of smartwatches.  I don't know what to conclude from that.  I actually like the Moto 360 and find it pretty useful.  Well, they basically came out.

Start time: 3880.80
End time: 3886.76

So, you know, it's going to we're talking about a different scale.

Start time: 3927.20
End time: 3933.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

End time: 3940.29

They launched six devices in 14 months and but they sold the most.  I've tried all the Samsung devices and we're underwhelmed.  I like Android Wear.  Samsung does make an Android Wear.  I like Android Wear, although they're all the same.  I mean, you can read that is what you just said.  Says three days ago, Samsung launched six devices.  And how how did you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then found the story and then a search for the story.  It does everything. It's amazing.  I don't. So what you're saying, I think, is that the sales of Android Wear  are not an indicator of how well the Apple watch will do.

Start time: 4001.00
End time: 4012.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right. I think I mean, I don't know.  It feels like a lot of product got put out in advance of the product.  It's probably going to set.  I would agree with you, especially with that Samsung stuff.

In other words, it isn't these Android Wear watches are not the first smart  watches, and I think they learned a lot from the first ones.  And frankly, I think they're very the utilities high on.

So if I get a text message, I can quickly indicate a response  by just tapping it and saying, yeah, and tell her I'll be right there.  I think those things are all fairly useful.  I don't have a big problem taking a phone out of my pocket.  So I think these are still a luxury device.  I think nobody's going to say I have to have a smart.

Her genes, the Hila genes are used by scientists to this day.  She was a poor southern tobacco farmer.  And what her cells are continue to be grown in culture.

I would guess too.  But you can get this for free.  There is a lot of biographies and stories by people.  Neil Patrick Harris.  Yeah, that just came out, didn't it?  Choose your own autobiography.  He wrote it and read it.  Because it's an autobiography, but he reads it too.  I would say a lot of times you don't want the author to read them, but when it's  performers like Sarah Silverman, you do.  Or Martin Short.  Because they really bring it to life.  Look, there's a lot of choices here.  You've got two books free.  And by the way, when you get the subscription, you're going to get the platinum subscription,  two books a month.  You also get the Daily Digest of the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal.  So that's a great way to keep up on what's going on.

For a long time, you and I talked about how boring Microsoft had become.  Their stock was stagnant.  There was nothing to say.  They looked like they were going the way of IBM.  And with the advent of such in Adela and the new Windows 10, I think at HoloLens,  I just wrote a column about this.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Just the opposite.  You think they're a boring company still?  No, I think they should be a boring company.  Go back to being boring?  They got those cash cows.  They throw money away left and right.  Nothing works.  They're no good at anything except what they do best, which is office and Windows.  And that's about it.  Why don't they just, instead of throwing all this money at these stupid things,  they keep buying for 400 million, a half a million, a billion.  Give it to the shareholders.  They're the ones, it's their money.  They should have big dividends and become just a kind of a staid, steady company.  Just fade off into the sunset.  There's nothing to fade off.  There's tons of PCs being sold every year.  They do have new operating systems that come out.  And you have to have office because there's nothing else that-  Instead, they're giving away Windows 10.  Yeah, well, this all seems like an idiocy to me.

I have nothing I'm going to do with it.  And you get Office for a year.  But it's just it tells you Microsoft is up to something.  They have more than 100 apps.  If you search for Microsoft on the Apple iPad store, more than 100 apps.  What?  What?  It doesn't seem possible.  Why are they there?  Because I think that this is a new Microsoft.  The rumor is, and this is what stimulated the conversation, that the Galaxy S6,  which will be announced in March at Mobile World Congress,  instead of having Google apps on it, it's going to have Microsoft apps on it.

I mean, here we've got IBM going to their clients and hocking and making iOS apps for them.  That was Microsoft's.  Those are Microsoft's clients.

Transcript:  I think it's really smart to give away Windows 10 in a lot of ways  because they had such a misfire with the launch of Windows 8.  Is it kind of an apology?  I think it's just a way to try to get corporations and enterprises,  enterprise users to move to Windows 10.  You got the licenses, we'll make it cheap.

They got rid of the charms bar, which was really strange,  and they replaced it with a notification center that actually works really well,  allows you to customize it with quick launch items.  It does look a little bit almost exactly like what Apple's done with OS X.  I think they brought back the start menu, which was a big silly,  but a pain point for a lot of people, and the start menu works quite well.  We like it.  And they put Cortana on it, which I think is very interesting.  You can talk to it.

I did not buy the Pixel.  But you cannot get because it's a weird aspect ratio.  It's a 4.3.  And Chrome OS does not let us put out anything that our video capture stuff will use.

You were the one who introduced me to Kaspersky.  Probably.  That was years ago.  Years ago was your favorite antivirus.  It was started by a Russian guy named Kaspersky.  Eugene.  Eugene Kaspersky.  You know him.  Do you?  No.  So Kiev, Kiev.  See, that's how you can tell if somebody's Russian.

Transcript:  The Kaspersky says we can't tell you.  It's NDA.  And the bank, of course, ain't going to tell you.  But they said the weirdest thing's happening because the ATM will go...  All this money comes out.  And exactly at that time, some guy comes by, swoops it up in the bag and goes away.  Coincidence.  Coincidence?  I think not.  What happened is Kaspersky got in there, discovered that the bank had been co-opted  by spear phishing attacks, emails sent specifically to employees of the bank,  containing malware coming from colleagues saying, oh, you ought to see this video.  The malware infected the bank, particularly with a rat, a remote access trojan,  which allowed the bad guys to turn on the cameras.  You're the one who says tape them over, right?  Turn on the cameras on all the computers in the bank, get screenshots.  They sat quietly for several months observing bank employees,  finding out exactly how the operations worked.  It turns out the hackers have been active doing this, not just in this bank,  but since the end of 2013 in more than 100 banks in 30 countries.  And they have scored as much as a billion dollars.  What they'll do is they'll send in people pretending to be from the bank.  They'll co-opt the software and the ATMs.  This is going to come out Monday, a security conference in Cancun.  New York Times had the article this Sunday, and I was reading it on Sunday.  You know I get the print Sunday Times?  I used to.  I love it.  It stacks up.  It does.

All these Russians look alike to me.  Have you noticed that?  Not really.  They all look alike.  I'm being silly, obviously.  It was in the Ukraine.  Of all places.  That's where the bank was.  This is where I came in.  This is a circle.  But the criminal group includes Russians, Chinese, and Europeans.  The group impersonated bank officers not only turning on various cash machines,  but they also transferred money directly from banks in Russia, Japan, Switzerland,  the US, and the Netherlands into dummy accounts.  Just, I mean, mind-boggling.  Kaspersky says,  We've seen evidence of $300 million in thefts through clients,  but we believe the total could be three times that.  You know why it wasn't more?  Banks did one thing smart.  They limited transactions to $10 million each.

We remember we talked to the Secret Service and they said, oh, this happens all the time,  but banks just don't say it because they don't want to.  No, it's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  The Financial Services Information Sharing and Analysis Center,  which is a consortium that alerts banks to suspicious activity,  said, quote, our members are aware of this activity.  We have disseminated intelligence on this attack to the members  and some briefings were also provided to law enforcement entities, by law enforcement entities.

And since we are here at the gateway to the marijuana growing area, which is north of us  in Mendocino, they said, we thought we would be there.

It's going to be legalized for 20, 30 years.  We get the opportunity.  We vote no.  I know what's wrong with California.  Meanwhile, Washington votes yes.  It's right up there in Colorado.

He moved out of the dorms into a house.  And he was up three flights.  They couldn't get a mattress up to three flights.  We sent him the box.  It's beautiful.  Very comfy.  He loves it.  And affordable.  You're getting premium mattresses made in the U.S. for $500 for a twin.  950 for the king size.  And I'm going to give you 50 bucks off if you use the promo code TWIT at Casper.  C-A-S-P-E-R Casper.com slash TWIT.  Use the promo code TWIT to get 50 bucks off.  And again, no risk at all.  You have a hundred days.  They'll come and get it if you don't like it.  Casper is fantastic.  They're cool in the summer.  They're warm in the winter.  I don't know how they do it.  It's like a thermos bottle.  It's just brilliant.  It's just really well designed and very comfy.  Casper.  In fact, if you go to the website, you can see how they make it and all sorts of stuff.

My new hero, Laxman Mutia, figured out how any photo album that he could view,  whether because it was a friend or because it was public,  and a lot of stuff on Facebook is public, he could delete.  He could delete billions of images.  Facebook is now the most popular photo sharing site in the world.  Get this, 350 million photos.  350 million photos are uploaded to Facebook every single day.  Aren't they backed up?  Yes.  Facebook blows me away because the scale of Facebook is mind-boggling.

Transcript:  Facebook is to the point where they're building data warehouses  for images that are not accessed on a regular basis.  They actually archive that data on servers that are powered down  in new warehouses they've built.  So literally, if you go to a photo book from two years ago  and there's a half-second delay in the photo...  It's because it's causing a line for it.  It's because they're literally pulling it off of the lowest power storage  that they can dump it on.  Wow.  It's amazing.  It is amazing.  It is amazing.  Because their energy bills are outrageous.

So 350 million photos a day go to Facebook.  Laxman Mutia, who is a security researcher, here's his post on Facebook.  OMG!  The album got deleted.  So I got the key to delete all of your Facebook photos.  LOL.  Various emoticons.  Immediately reported this bug to Facebook's security team.  Good on you, Laxman.  They were too fast in identifying this issue  and there was a fix in place in less than two hours  from the acknowledgement of the report.  That is impressive.

And then in most cases, people can continue to post on your timeline,  but usually it's memorials to you.  Not things like, hey Leo, you want to go party?

So its price line has been doing the same thing and it's now pretty much the two of them.  So Orbitz, remember, bought Travelocity and they're going to buy the rest of Travelocity  as part of this transaction.  And then Orbitz was created initially by the airlines, wasn't it?  I think that was the idea.  There was a consortium of a few different airlines that created Orbitz.  I don't know who owns Orbitz as it's being sold.
