Transcript:  I worked with him  our careers crossed  a couple times  he was one of the giants  he was a student  of Jean Piaget  the French psychologist  who first  mapped how children learned  how the brain developed  when children were ready  for certain ideas and when they weren't  and Piaget  said that Pappert was the only  student who really understood the theory  and then Pappert came  he was a South African he came to  Harvard  or no he came to MIT  and was very influential  in  helping Marvin Minsky  develop the  early ideas about AI  and he and Marvin started  the MIT AI lab  by the time I  was just a kid  basically a paid intern  at Boat Brandeke Newman  when Pappert was there  developing logo  and he had this very idealistic  idea that  this computer language which was basically  a baby version of Lisp  with a lot of powerful tools  recursion  and that was the main thing  it was a recursive language  and everything was done recursively  and it would have been  and he had this idea that  if you give kids logo  and they just play with it they learn by playing  by  he compared it to  how an art class  how kids play with clay  and work it and work it until  they get something that they really like  and he says that's how mathematicians  enjoy mathematics  but it's not at all  like how math is taught in school  anyway logo  was a great idea of  he tried  to push it in the schools  but basic which was  a pretty ugly ugly language  full of problems  and that's the one that got taught  it was a very sad story to watch  it was kind of like  maybe I shouldn't say it  it was kind of like watching the PC  take over the computer industry  and the Mac  hi I'm just a math teacher from Red

Transcript:  more it's true for the first  thirty years of the personal computer  revolution hardware was desperately trying to  keep up with these massively  overloaded graphical operating systems  but it's caught up  and it's fast enough it's been fast  enough for years  so you make a good point it's not like  it's not like we have to have a new computer  maybe we just want a new computer

Start time: 1117.86
End time: 1128.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i like groover's theory is  that there's something apple  is doing  no one can figure out why they're doing it this year  why are they taking the jack off this year  and his theory is that there's something they're doing  for this ten year  anniversary  it is the tenth anniversary iphone isn't it  that's next year not this one  and that  and for some reason that one  doesn't want to have the usual jack  so they're warming  people up for it  as he put it they're going to eat the  burger  with this phone and then  clean up with the one afterwards

Transcript:  our friend steve gibson who hosts security now  came up with a really interesting  theory  if you're going to take away the iphone  apple on september  is going to have to say something  more than just  it makes it thinner or gives us  more room for a battery  it's going to have to give us some value  in return for losing the iphone jack steve says  well because you're now connecting  your headphones to the lightning  adapter  you can now do more with that  headphone for instance what if apple  started selling noise cancelling headphones  what if all the  all the earbuds that came with  your iphone did noise  cancelling sophisticated noise cancelling  because you've got a very sophisticated  processor and you've got a data port  as well as a headphone port  not a bad theory  that'd be value add  they did that they announced look how much  boze gets for those quiet comfort headphones  if they announced that and they said hey this is part of it  and there's another thing  headphones are going to be or earphones  are going to be the ultimate wearable i think  when you wear we don't want to get rid of them  when you wear them what this thing in your ear can do  a lot more than just give you sound  it can measure your blood pressure  your oxygen level  of course it can measure your heart rate  the ear canal is a really good place  for medical wearables  might be another additional feature apple could add

Start time: 1403.57
End time: 1414.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah they're  they're all going to cost more though  and they're all going to need  to be recharged overnight  i think  i guess it depends on what apple gives us

Start time: 1414.84
End time: 1437.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but that's the point you don't have to recharge them  because you've got the lightning port  the phone is the battery right  no i'm thinking of the wireless ones  i don't think wireless is where we're going  i interviewed david hannemeyer hansen who created ruby on rails  on monday and he said oh no this is great  who wears wired headphones  i want all those years back that i spent untangling my headphones  i don't know  is the world ready is that where we're going  wireless

Start time: 1438.80
End time: 1445.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  funny enough that I'm writing  a piece about this  for the New Yorker  hopefully tomorrow or day after it will go out  but what I'm talking about is  essentially if you look at the top  five companies by market cap right now  they are Apple  Google, Microsoft  Amazon  and Facebook  that's like five largest  companies by market cap so what  stock market is saying that they believe  in the potential of these companies  they believe in the  growth these companies will have  actually despite their  mega sizes  with the exception of Apple  which is having a down year  you see the other like  Google, Amazon and  Facebook are having high  double digit growth in their most  recent quarter both in revenue  terms and you know from a  profit standpoint too so  there is much less  of an issue around these  companies the reason I was actually  talking about Apple trying to you know need to  focus and like need to  focus more on using data  and being smart about where their  opportunities are instead of doing  things like planet of the apps  is  from that standpoint I think these  companies have mega platforms  like Apple also has  you know like Apple  has services business which is growing really  really fast you know it's almost  $6 billion a quarter business now  so they have a lot of opportunities  to capture but they need  to be focused on where they're going  to capture those opportunities  Google you think people will not  search less  they'll search less next year  or the year after or they'll look for  less information next year  probably not will people  be less social next year  probably not so  you know Facebook, Google, Amazon  Apple, Microsoft none of these companies  get less valuable  I think their big growth  curve is actually in  front of them as long as they  are focused and I think this  is why companies like Apple need to  get more focused Microsoft  has decided to focus on  cloud and cloud related services  and you're going to start to see  them transition their old enterprising  businesses onto Azure  and make money off it  they're taking productivity and  turning it into like how does  the world work in the future so they  have clearly figured out  what's the way forward like it may  take them some time to get there  but they're moving in the right direction  so you start to see these big five  companies have a lot  of growth ahead of them as long as  they're not distracted by penny  ante stuff that's my  that's my analysis of the situation

Transcript:  I think there I would disagree in one respect  I think there is a significant difference between Microsoft  and Apple and Google  Facebook and  Amazon the other  member of the five horsemen of the apocalypse  is that Apple  and Microsoft have significant  strong competition  you could argue that Android is actually stronger  than iPhone  I think it's pretty clear Facebook has  no competition  Google has very little  competition  Amazon just ate the competition  so that's  a significant difference Apple's in a  tougher much tougher position aren't they  I mean you don't have to buy a computer a phone  or a tablet from Apple there are plenty of good  alternatives  and their services suck

Transcript:  yeah I mean I think there is there is a lot  more opportunity for Apple  if this company decided  it needed to zero in on services  more effectively  Apple pay is a great business I think  it's going to do really well I think  you have to stop thinking of  Apple just from a from a  like a hardware perspective  but you have to think of them from a  services perspective I mean if I  was them I am seriously thinking about  maybe we should buy Netflix  right like that  adds a big  services component to their business  it's a big acquisition but they have  the stock and the money  to make this happen like  and they have like it also  fits into their bigger agenda  of like having an iTunes  like another entity  which can create a lot  of revenue for them so  I think the most important thing  is they need to be kind of looking  at how do you  make acquisitions which are like you know more  than three hundred million dollars how  do they figure out what are the new things people  will keep buying from them and  what are the new services and if they can't  build those services how do you  bring those services in house by  buying other people like Netflix  I think they need to build up  their you know big data  and internet chops which they don't  so that you know iCloud  doesn't keel over every so often  so they have to do all those things  you know what they don't want to do  the planet of the apps  can I

Transcript:  no no no no  well you know it's gone up  10% in the last two weeks  there were  analysts telling their clients to  sell Apple two weeks ago and  they've got a lot of mud on their face right now  I the services I  think is a bit of a distraction  Apple  in my opinion  will remain a hardware company primarily  and services  is in support of the hardware  it's part of the  walled garden that keeps people in  and they have to be competitive  in services but they don't have to make  money at it and they don't actually have to  be the best  I think Apple  is looking at  what the I believe they're making a  car I know Jason  Kalkanis last week  floated the rumor  that Apple is not building  a car they're just going to go  and make the software  that felt like  disinformation to me  the and  if you think of Apple as  the company that made a lot of money on  computers and phones  and is working on a car  that will probably do what the  others did which is  skim off the most  profitable part of the  every market it enters  and have a great  business a great profitable  business as opposed to say  Android nobody makes money  making Android machines  and Samsung  Samsung had a great  they have  but then they'll have  because they come out with that  phone in the quarter when Apple  doesn't have a new phone  and then Apple leapfrogs it happens  it's happened so many years in a row you can kind  of count on it  then looking at the other  companies I think what  people may continue to  search Google but  I think Google has a structural  problem in that most of its revenue  comes from the US  in Europe and most  of the growth of the internet  is in  Asia and Africa and places that don't  people don't spend a lot of money

Transcript:  to be honest and you and you look at  Google Google has  so many data streams and they have the  compute power and the brain  power to mash up all those  data streams and build the  future of home  build the future of connected car  build the future of you know  advertising build the future of  information retrieval all those  things that are pretty fairly  uniquely positioned  company they still need to figure out  what are the revenue streams of the  future but from  a from a technology standpoint  they have a lot of things going for them  I think same goes for Amazon  Amazon is the infrastructure  of modern society whether you  look at their cloud services or their  e-commerce services they are sucking  the middle you know  retail dry  by their operations so  you know Microsoft like you know may  not be in the best of  conditions right now but they're on the right  track I think the Apple  too I am  mixed on Apple for  one simple reason that they're  starting to do a lot of foolish things  but as a platform  they are very strong you know  as a brand they're very strong they still  make more money for app  developers than Android does  and they make you know a lot  of great products and I think  if in all  reality they too have  a future if they can do  services right they can bring  in resources into the company  which can skew them into forward  thinking areas which involve  software and data and  internet you know infrastructure capabilities  so I don't think  these five actually have  a lot going for them you know  who else do you see out there  you think Oracle is going to be  the driver of the future or  IBM or you know  ExxonMobil or like you know  Monsanto I don't think  so like you have companies  like the five big tech  companies more importantly they  have scale they build their own hardware  they can hire whoever they want  they can they have so much cash that  they actually skew the  the salary  situation in Silicon Valley  to their own advantage  I mean they have a lot going  for them this the big five are the  big five and they're going to get bigger and bigger  at least for near foreseeable  future I mean you know I'm not talking  from a stock standpoint I'm just talking  from you know who is their competition  we talk about  you know big data and artificial  intelligence and forget how  much of that  depends on compute power  how much of that depends on  ability to get multiple data  streams from multiple different  resources to make sense  of right so I think there is  a lot which these companies  can do which other people their  competitors can't do you're starting  to see like you know some of the middle  level networking companies  can't can't can't find  scale anymore because people  like Facebook decide they want  to build their own switches and then open  source them and so now  you know Taiwanese can make those switches  and so software is open  source so there is a big  big you know  you know  change which is happening in the way  things are so  I would actually look at these five and just  like wow there is something bigger  going on here would you add a sixth

Transcript:  right so if you really think about it  what they are doing and I wrote about  this on Pico in a conversation with  one of my  people I interviewed  Liam Casey I think  we all like to think of  the commerce  and retail in the old  terms in which goods  come they sit on the dry docks  they go to warehouses  they sit in warehouses then they go to  distribution centers and from there they go  into the corner stores  what Amazon is doing  is building an end to  end always moving supply chain  so you are never  squeezing out every single  inefficiency out of the  logistics chain and then making  that work for you from  a profit standpoint so when  being a guy that  Walmart and  Jet.com talk about  merging that's an interesting idea  that's an interesting bandaid  but what they have to do is  think about how these guys are  thinking end to end same  day delivery so that you don't even  have to think about going to  your neighborhood retail store  and that is only possible  when the goods are constantly  moving in the supply chain  and how do you do that by building  the most awesome kick ass  logistics chain in the world and that's  what these guys are trying to do  I mean you know in like  the audacity of Amazon  is what I am most impressed by  you know am I scared by them  of course I'm scared of every big company  controlling every part of our  life I don't even  for one second  do I  think twice about  like Amazon as  a giant  monster which is going to gobble up  everything they will

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  so that's it  so we  agree  it's scary only in the sense that  once there's no competition  Amazon  just you know eats the world  right I mean  who needs the corner store anymore and by the  way I'm all in on Amazon  I buy everything from Amazon I just bought  a giant TV  and you know that doesn't make  any sense to ship that across the country but  I bought it on Amazon instead of going  down to the local electronics store  by the way I don't even think there is a best  buy in town anymore  so  is that good that's not good for consumers  but well maybe it is I don't  know I'm happy

Transcript:  I've been watching some of the Olympics  and the thing that impressed me was  this story that says there's  6800 hours on  11 channels and God only  knows how many  individual feeds they've reprogrammed  cable boxes to make them  Olympics boxes because  the cable company owns  the content. Comcast

Start time: 5277.34

Start time: 5281.50
End time: 5322.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and they are betting the company sort of  on the Olympics and the future of television  as expressed through  these Olympic Games. Wow.  That's just wrong.  I have said for a zillion years that a company  that provides carriage should  not be allowed to be in the content  business and we're really finding out  why that is.  That all of our content is now  being owned by people who do carriage  are significant parts of it  and that's  you know if we talk about net neutrality  you know what is that?  I mean it's just  evil bad and I'll just stop there.  Comcast is an evil bad company  and they are. If you ever do business  with them you know that.

Transcript:  Well you know I tried to watch the  Olympics on TV.  This is not to your point and maybe  it's not cranky enough but  it was terrible. It was all interviews  with  what's his name? The swimmer.  And you know building  up the usual thing. They focus  on the Americans and choose  a hero and do a lot of  interviews and try to build up some drama.  The good  news is that you can watch what you  want to watch on the app which is  actually pretty good. The NBC sports app  shows you what's  playing and you know if  you're into table  tennis.  Have I frozen? No, you're good.  Or you know I  wanted to watch Serena  Williams beat this Australian  woman and it's all there in high  def and without  commentary and it's actually  quite good. I don't  spend a lot of time watching sports  but it was  striking how bad the television  was and how good the  web version was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To be fair NBC every two years  does this. Ruins the  Olympics. They time shift  it. They jam in more commercials than  you can eat. At least  they've got an internet strategy that gives you  a chance to see some less  watch stuff without interruption.

Transcript:  Comcast, of course, being  sued by the  state of Washington.  A hundred million  dollar lawsuit  against Comcast  accusing the company of 1.8  million violations  of the state's Consumer Protection Act.  That is overachieving really.  That is quite impressive.  The state isn't saying  the customer service was bad  but for misleading practices  and anybody  who's gone to Comcast  and been offered various weird packages  like the $4.99 per person  service protection plan  which Comcast  that's per month by the way  $4.99 per month per person service  protection plan which is  according to the Washington Attorney General  near worthless.  Comcast promoted the plan as  a single fee program to cover all service  calls including those involved in wall wiring.  However, any work on wires  conceded within the walls requiring  wall phishing was excluded  which means in fact you have  to pay for in wall service calls.  If we have to get the wire  no that's going to cost you.  And on and on and on.  Anybody's ever dealt with Comcast  especially over the phone.  I have to say when you go into the Comcast  store where there's actual people  this underscores really  what I've been realizing  when people are face to face  or they have to use their real name  in the real persona, they're almost  always unfailingly nice.  It's when they're hiding behind the phone  or  you know, or behind  a handle that they can be the  jerks that I think we all have deep  with inside.  Comcast also  now this is a new story just came out  wants to sell your web  history.  Comcast  is telling the FCC  that they like AT&T  I didn't know this, want to offer  reduced cost plans  for customers who say hey you can  track our web history, search activity  and other online  behaviors and  sell them to the highest bidder for  which I will get a lower  fee for my service.

Transcript:  Well that's the dodgy  definition that everybody  uses. And it turns out  that a lot of companies are being dodgy.  I saw a study, I'm going to do  a blog post on it, that says  lots and lots of native content  which is also that  content recommendations. All  that garbage at the bottom of an average web  page. All of that is the  tabula, the outbrain, neither  my client. That's all  what we're talking about. But  you know, they and the  newspapers particularly are just  recoiling at the rise in  ad blockers. Supposedly 20% of  mobile users have an ad  blocker on and the New York Times  and some other sites are starting to trap  ad blockers and say  no, if you're going to block our ads you're not going to see  our content because we got to make  money off the content.

Transcript:  Well and Facebook  and the Federal  Trade Commission now are being very  clear that you  have to be over and above,  you have to really tag  stuff as an  advertisement. It's getting more  and more difficult to pose as content.  Facebook says you have  to have information  in the  post that says this is an  ad. The FTC just announced  today that they're going to start cracking  down on people  on Instagram and other social feeds  who don't sufficiently  disclaim the fact that it's an ad. For instance,  a very common practice is to  put the hashtag ad in there  but to put it in a big  tag cloud at the end of your post so nobody  sees it or  to instead of using the word sponsor  use the word sp, hashtag sp  or hashtag spon  which is not widely understood I think to be  a sponsored post. So the FTC  recognizes that some of this native  content is really just  tricking people into believing  it's real. It's a big problem on  social media.

Eventually,  I mean we are rats. Eventually,  you don't get any cheese. You're going to stop pressing the lever.  So  it's not something you do as a  long-term strategy.

Samsung announced this week  its Galaxy Note 7  with an Iris  scanner. So you can just  look at your phone and it'll go  I see you. I know  you.  Unclear how well it will work, although  my colleagues who were at the event said it  worked very well and very fast. We've seen Iris  scanners and phones before, most notably  the Windows phone, the 950 and the 950  XL from Microsoft, which was terrible.  Today on the radio  show is like your dad taking a picture.  A little closer, not a little farther.  Look up, look down.  Left, left, left,  right, right.  Nobody wants to do that, but apparently  the Iris scanner, the Galaxy Note 7  will pick up your Iris  even if you're not looking directly at it.  But I tell you, this is just another  example of how we are really at  peak computing. I mean,  hard to come up with something new, isn't it?

I just feel  you know, we will never  be peak human  intelligence. We will never  you know, despite what people say  about artificial intelligence,  the human brain  is still not understood  what it's capable of.  I think it is  an amazing, amazing  time to be in technology.  I wake up every day and I'm still  excited about it. I am still  excited about the idea that some  kid somewhere is going to blow  our socks off and we will  rethink the future again.  I think that is  what makes this industry  what it is. It's like you know, we  started off with a guy like Blake  who decided that he wanted  to watch his  favorite basketball game  and baseball game while  he was in Japan. So he invented  place shifting and I think  there will be some guy who will come up with  another new thing or  a gal or you know,  whether it is in US, it's in China,  who the hell knows, but the future  is you know, yet to be invented.

And apparently, just by active  chance and Niantic,  there are, I think,  three or four Poke  stops at a Poke Gym in one  small area.  And in fact, every time we drove by it, we noticed there were  lures on the Poke Gym.  On Thursday night, it must have been  10 p.m. We'd gone to see a  play and we came out of the play,  took an Uber home.  There are, it's like  Woodstock. There are,  it is,  I'm looking at Lisa, what's going on?  And then we realized, oh, they're all going like this.  They're all swiping up with their finger.

Transcript:  Well, maybe that's the next  big thing. Anyway, your next big thing  when we come back. First, let's just  briefly say, you gotta back  up your data. I get calls  so often for people who say,  you know, there's something on my phone  or on my hard drive. I have pictures.  The drive died. What do I  do? And I have to say,  do you not have a backup?  How could you not in this day and age have a backup?  And really, the best backup  should be cloud backup, right?  I mean, it's great to have a local backup. I do it all the time.  But  ideally, you have a backup that's  stored off site. So if the worst  happens, a fire, a flood, somebody comes, steals your stuff.  The easiest  way to do this is  Carbonite. Carbonite Online  Backup. This was created by  a David friend, a good friend of mine.  I really like this guy.  He had a, you know, he  was, I think he created the ARP synthesizer.  He'd kind of semi-retired.  He had a daughter in college. He called  him up and said, daddy, I just lost  my term paper. I don't have a backup. What do  I do? And he thought, with all the things  we've solved  in personal computing, we haven't really figured  out a good solution for this. So he  founded Carbonite.  Automatic, continuous,  off site backup, cloud  backup. And he did it right, too.  He made it flat pricing, flat  fee pricing, so you don't have to worry about how much  have I backed up, how much am I storing, what's the bill  going to be next month. You pay once a  year, $59.99  for everything on a single  computer. That's less than five bucks a month  for your Mac or your PC. But  they have server backup. They do small  business, big business.  They have a plan for  everyone. This stat  just depresses the heck out of me. From the  Carbonite website, 30% of people  have never backed up anything ever.  And I'd say twice that number are backing  up in a way that's not going to work.  They're not going to get their data back.  You've got to try Carbonite. And with  ransomware all over the  place in the Windows space,  Carbonite is the solution because it does versioning  on Windows, which means you will never  have to worry about ransomware.  Over 500 billion  files backed up and counting, one and a half  million homes and businesses. You've  got to try it, and you could try it for free.  You don't even need to give them a credit card.  Just go to carbonite.com  and use the offer code TWIT. The only reason I want  you to do that is that way you get two months  free if you decide to buy.  Automatic cloud backup. You can check in  with your data any time you want  using the Carbonite apps  on your smartphone. You can even download and  email data. So it's kind of like cloud storage  too. Or you log on to your  Carbonite account on any computer. There's your stuff  so you always know it's safe.  Carbonite.com. Use the  offer code TWIT.  Do you play Pokemon Go?  For some reason I feel like David Corsi, you do not play  Pokemon Go.

It was really  like kind of Woodstock in the middle  of just this, and the same thing in parks  all around here. Golden Gate  Park in San Francisco.  Central Park in New York.  People are walking and they're talking.  I'm all  for it. It is  clearly a phenomenon.  Here's a graph from Sensor  Tower, estimates, of course,  because nobody's talking,  on the  top grossing mobile games.  Whoops, let me scroll down so fast.  The good news  is Candy Crush Soda,  which you thought was doing pretty well.  That's the baseline there. That's the pink line.  There's a Clash  of Clans even better.  Here's Pokemon Go, which matched Clash of  Clans in the first two weeks  of its release, but then they launched in  Japan, and  after Burners came on, and now, according  to Sensor Tower,  $225 million  in revenue.

Transcript:  Although, small businesses have really  benefited from this because you can put a  lure up, and a lure attracts Pokemon.  And so, if you're a small business, like  we are, we have a pokie stop right across  the street here, I could put a lure on it.  If you're a coffee shop, you put a lure.  In fact, I've seen bookstores in town,  our local independent book store, say,  we're going to have a lure at 2 p.m., come by, have a cup of  coffee, read a book, and catch some Pokemon.  So individuals could do that, too?  Yeah, anybody could buy a lure, it's a  buck. Oh, you buy them?  Now you know where the $220  million is going to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Facebook will last  longer.  Facebook did it, I don't know, who knows? No one  knows. Facebook did an interesting thing that might  have been kind of controversial. They just  imitated Snapchat,  one of Snapchat's interesting  features that was added more recently.  You know, Snapchat allows you to do video  and pictures and message people, and the pictures  and video disappear  after people look at it, so it's kind of a way  for young people to send messages  to each other more privately. They don't last  forever. Young people love Snapchat.  Instagram,  which is, you know, part of Facebook's  problem is its audience is aging.  Kids think it's mom's social network.  They don't want to be on it.  Although I think everybody uses it anyway.  They may not be thrilled about it. Instagram has a little  bit of a younger skew, a lot smaller  market. So they've added a feature  of Snapchat called Stories. Stories allow  you to do Snapchat videos and pictures  that last longer  and can be viewed again and again.  Facebook, I mean, Snapchat's  Stories disappear after  24 hours, so Instagram did pretty much  exactly the same thing.  Copycats?  Or good move?

Transcript:  Well, it's good for  Facebook. I'll tell you what.  And by the way, Kevin Systrom, who created  Instagram and sold it to Facebook, said,  look, yeah, we're copying them. We're really  impressed with what Snapchat has been able to do  and we'd like to do a little of the same thing.  I think the only risk is that Instagram works so well  that you use it all the time. I see your  wonderful pictures all the time. Works great  as a photo album that you share with friends.  You have a risk of making it too complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree. I think they're taking a big  risk, but that's what Facebook  does. They take a lot of  risk. They do things which  are not very appealing to  their customers and  they will push you. And a lot of it's

Transcript:  to invent a single new internet  behavior. Right.  So it doesn't matter whether  you copy or not. That's  the power of being a big platform  is that you can copy and  hope that it will work. So  actually, they did a pretty decent  job of this new app.  I'm not a big fan of  having  two different things at the same  time, like Snapchat  and Instagram at the same time,  but it's still a pretty decent job of  producing an app.  And, you know, let's see how  it goes. I still like to use  Snapchat because it  only has a few of my  friends and I'm happy to  share with them all  my personal stuff  and not just randomly  share it with all these  20,000 plus people  who follow me on  Instagram. So for  me, that's definitely an  added advantage. Privacy  is an added advantage on

Transcript:  Snapchat. Last week,  we talked about the fact that Theranos  founder and CEO Elizabeth Holmes  was going to go into the  lion's den, present  at the American Association for Clinical  Chemistry's annual convention in Philadelphia.  People thought, what's  she going to do? Defend Theranos, which is  being investigated now for fraud.  And  instead, she pulled a little click  bait-y kind of bait  and switch.  She didn't talk about Theranos' diagnostics,  their blood drop diagnostics at all.  They pitched a new technology  called the Mini Lab,  a device the company says will be able  to perform blood diagnostics remotely.  It's the next  phase of our company, said Elizabeth  Holmes. Wow.  That's ballsy.

I mean, I'm not a fan.  I wouldn't invest in Theranos, but  interesting.  Any thoughts? No.  How about the company that just got  approval from the Federal  Aeronautics Administration  to  go to the moon?  Moon Express  just got approval. Mission approved,  they say,  to send a unmanned  rover to the  moon. The first  private company to venture beyond Earth's

It's easier to get them back than it is  to go there in the first place.  Yeah, the gravity is less.  Right. The real cost  is launching, right?  They got mission approval  from the Secretary of Transportation  and the  Federal Government will help provide  supervisory obligations  under the Outer Space Treaty.  I don't know, it's going to be  in 2017, the first commercial  lunar mission.

Transcript:  I think we might  all say the same thing. I think the self-driving  car, as far  off as it is, and the resistance  that we're going to experience  getting there, has the potential  to disrupt  so many things, starting with  truck drivers.  Out of job, and work trip drivers.  Yeah, I mean, more people  may be displaced out of work  by this than  anything, if it happens. And on  the other hand, a lot fewer people are going to  end up roadkill.  Good point. So, there you go.

Transcript:  Oh, you know,  I think you're absolutely right. And actually  I do believe that  the Republican campaign  is setting the stage  for...  If it doesn't actually happen, we're  using a lot of voting machines, which are horrifically  insecure. And I think  we're going to see a drumbeat from  Mr. Trump's campaign  that the election will be  thrown because of it.  So...

Start time: 7819.58
End time: 7835.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Especially if he doesn't win that election.  Yeah, well, if he wins, I don't think he'll raise the issue.  Oh, he's raising it now.  We'll have about 40% of the vote  that's going to believe that the  election was stolen from them.  And that is the kind of thing that undermines  a democracy. Really badly.

Transcript:  Who was it? Was it Bruce Schneier?  One of our greats, maybe Brian Krebs,  I think it was Schneier who said,  we must today  eliminate electronic voting,  you know, the computerized voting machines.  There's far too many in use  and they have far too few security  protections.  Computerized voting, and this is  interesting from a technologist, but a security  expert, is a terrible  idea. And we've got...  Yeah, there it is, Bruce Schneier, the security  of our election systems. He called for basically  eliminating them now  before this becomes an issue.  That's not going to happen, unfortunately.  I think when Trump said the election  was rigged, I think he was talking about the

Start time: 7903.62
End time: 7941.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know about that. I think there is  still so much  more  which can be done with software  and all the new  emergent data  streams in our planet. I think  we've only started to digitize  inanimate objects. We've just started  to index the real world.  Things, we don't even  know what will be the next  big thing. All I know is  that everything  which is in the future  offers a massive potential.  Yeah.  I'm talking about potential, not  making predictions, I think.

Start time: 7941.22

This has been a fun series of  like Liam is the guy who taught me  a lot about logistics  and Chris Young,  which is the latest interview,  he taught me a lot about  the future of food and  kitchen and what  connected kitchen looks like in the future  and sous vide and stuff  like that. He's a chef.  He's also an inventor and he wrote a book  called The Modernist Cuisine.  It's just like great,  great people I get to interview and  have smart conversations with.  There is no  real agenda behind it. I just like  doing these conversations  with smart people. This is not  a web, you know,  it's not my publication.

We do Twitter every  Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific,  6 p.m. Eastern time.  That's 2200 UTC.  If you want to watch live, you certainly are  invited to. We have a live stream on our  website, www.twit.tv slash live.  We have a secondary stream with a different  player for people who have trouble with that one.  It's live.twit.tv.  You can also watch  live on, there are a lot of platforms  for watching live  on Apple TV,  on Roku,  pretty much anywhere you want to be. Just look for the  twit app. There are many, many twit apps  out there. We didn't write any of them. I just thank  our great community  for writing those. If you're watching  live, you should join us in the chat room too,  www.twit.tv.  Be part of the conversation. It's always  great to have you there. You can even be in  studio. We have a live studio audience,  a nice studio audience this week.  Just email tickets at twit.tv. Make sure  we get a chair out for you. And you do want  to do that because  we only have  how many more weeks  here? One more week in the studio?  Yesterday, we had  a couple come by. They said, we're sorry we're late.  We went to the new studio.  That was a little premature, but we are moving.  Our first show from the new studio will be  August 21st.  The new studio is still in Petaluma. It's just a few  miles from here. It's not far.  We can give you directions if you email tickets at  twit.tv. We can make sure you get here  and that we have  a place for you to sit. I don't yet  really know how big it will be. I think my sense  is we could easily get the same size audience  in there. But we don't  know yet. We have to  see.  Again, we're going to be here on the  14th. And that's going to be  next week, the last twit in the  Brickhouse Studios. We will be in  the Eastside Studios, the new Eastside Studios  starting on the 21st of August  Huh?  This is the penultimate show, ladies  and gentlemen.  We're just looking for ways  to use that word in an English  sentence.  Thank you all for being here. Of course,  if you can't be here and you get confused about  the time or where we are, it doesn't really matter.  We're on the internet. Just subscribe. Make sure you  get every episode. You'll find more at  twit.tv, our website, or wherever you  get your podcasts from. Thanks for joining us.  And we'll see you next time. Another  twit. This is amazing. It's in the can.
