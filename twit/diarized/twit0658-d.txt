Transcript:  It's time for twit this week in tech. Greg Farrow from the Packet Pushers Network is here along with Georgia Dow, Jason Heiner.  We'll talk about those AMD security flaws. Are they genuine or just a stock manipulation attempt?  We'll also talk about Qualcomm and Broadcom and why the US government killed the deal and whether it was a good idea  and why I'm quitting Facebook. This time for the last time. It's all coming up next on twit.

Transcript:  Yeah, well, part of being an IT expert, when you're an IT professional, you get a lot of certifications.  We all go out and study and learn stuff and then some people go on to pass exams to qualify them.  And it's time for me to move on and to walk away.  So I just published a little post saying, letting my certification status go in this area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's complicated. Something like that.  Yeah, you have to maintain touch and status and lodge some stuff to say that you're still working in the industry and you're in touch.  You haven't just walked away and done nothing for the last five years and losing your company.

Transcript:  I was.  That's no joke though. It's like the PhD of certifications.  So I see why people were probably like, oh my gosh, why would you do that?  I did way back in the day. This is like 20 years ago.  I did it at CCNA, which is sort of the entry level.  I remember that.  Cisco certification.

Start time: 351.64

Transcript:  Of course. Absolutely.  I mean, I think when I entered the room and everything.

Start time: 363.69
End time: 406.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that there's a substantial change going on in technology.  So for people who are IT professionals, we're seeing a change away from certifications and basic knowledge as a path, as a career path to people building portfolios, career portfolios in the same way that artists have a portfolio.  I think that IT professionals must have a GitHub site with code and a blog showing that they know about these things and writing stories.  And that shows you can communicate. It shows what you know.  It demonstrates your capabilities rather than, you know, I passed this exam.  Therefore, I must know what I'm doing.  I think employers are looking for much more interesting capabilities in the old days of certificates as being the Beal and Indol has passed.  That's my logic.  No doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Since you guys are both here and you too, George, although I think you and I will have less to say about this.  Let's talk about Risenfall, which is a wonderful name for an exploit.  Actually, there are four critical flaws, 13 critical flaws, four basic ideas that are affecting AMD processors.  We learned about it on Tuesday.  In fact, Steve Gibson took this so seriously.  He kind of rebuilt security now to talk about this.  But I haven't heard a word since.  And there was some concern because the group that found this wasn't super well known, CTS Labs, and they did something that is considered anathema to the security industry.  They discovered it and revealed it pretty much at the same time without giving AMD the requisite 90 days to patch.  Have you heard anything about Risenfall since then as AMD stepped forward?  What do we know?

Start time: 469.68
End time: 478.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think my favorite part about this story is that apparently they're monetizing the bug by short-selling AMD stock.  That's what worried me.

Start time: 479.20
End time: 501.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was kind of the there was this undercurrent of concern that maybe this company really first of all, they didn't put out proof of concept code, although some say they've seen it.  So it's hard to demonstrate that this is an actual flaw.  And yeah, that was some concern.  Maybe they're short sellers just trying to get AMD stock to dump and they can make some money on that.

Start time: 503.18
End time: 554.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The story that I've heard about the rise in vulnerabilities is it's pretty hard to understand the scale of this without the code showing the vulnerabilities and without AMD admitting to what's happening.  And they haven't had enough time to examine this and to see and to make a public, you know, literally they announced it on one gave them 24 hours notice, which isn't enough time to see.  So it's hard to criticize AMD for not reacting already.  The theory is, is that increasingly the security researchers aren't releasing bugs without making money out of them.  So the downside of the bug bounty programs that we've seen start all of the bug bounty programs that are going on is that security researchers reasonably, in my opinion, expect to get paid for finding these vulnerabilities because the companies who get the benefit of these bugs are for profit.  Like sometimes billions of dollars worth of profit.  Yet, here's the argument against that.

Start time: 555.50
End time: 597.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It then becomes, and Apple refused to do this for the longest time.  They've only recently started paying bug bounties.  Their concern was, and I think it's legitimate, that then you create a market for bugs and it's hard to outbid governments that will pay millions of dollars for these bugs if they're usable for exploits.  And so suddenly you have this auction that goes through the roof.  And really, I think it's not unreasonable to expect security firms to notify the company that created the software or hardware and give them a fair amount of time to fix it.  And I don't think necessarily saying, but you have to give us $100,000 first.  I don't, it makes me feel a little queasy.

Start time: 598.39
End time: 602.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think AMD even has a bug bounty program.  So how else were they going to monetize it?

Start time: 602.84
End time: 604.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By short selling the stock?

Start time: 605.26
End time: 636.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why not?  It's as good a way as any, and it's virtually untraceable.  Good Lord.  And if AMD is not going to play ball, is not going to own up to its responsibilities and offer a bug bounty for people who report them, then this is the sort of thing that you're going to get.  And these researchers are doing it for money.  And they, the bug bounty programs love them or hate them.  Yes, you're right.  Some security researchers will only work white hat.  And increasingly, they'll only work inside of the bug bounty programs because they get legal protection and corporate protection when they're inside the bug bounty companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux, did raise this specter that maybe these are short sellers.  CTS Labs, which isn't well known.  He said, when was the last time you saw a security advisory that was basically, quote, if you replace the bios of the CPU microcode with an evil version, you might have a security problem.  He says, you know, it isn't really a flaw.  And the idea of publicizing this so quickly was really to make money off a short sell.  Dan Guido has a great name.  He is the CEO of Trail of Bits, which is a security company that at least is somewhat known, tweeted and I'll show you his Guido's tweet.  He said, yeah, no, I've seen the proof of code, by the way.  Here's proof of Chrome being sucky on Windows 10.  Come on, Chrome. Come on.  You can do it. Show that tweet.  I don't know why it has so much trouble rendering Twitter.  You see what it's doing here? It's just going crazy.  Anyway, Dan Guido's response on Twitter came up briefly on Twitter was, regardless of the hype around the release, the bugs are real, accurately described in the technical report, which is not available to public and their exploit code works.  Now, the flaws do require admin privileges, but they are all flaws, not expected functionality.  So the fact that you can read more about it at the CTS custom crafted website, AMDFlaws.com.  Which, by the way, good vulnerabilities.

End time: 753.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They clearly spent some time. They've got a clever name, Risenfall, Masterkey, Fallout and Chimera.  They've got logos. They've got a YouTube video.  I mean, they've been working on this a lot harder for the last, I would say, month.

Start time: 754.60
End time: 784.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See what I mean about a portfolio? Now you've got a portfolio. You've built your brand.  You've got your bark out there. So next time you go for a job, you can say, yeah, I was, you know, Risenfall. That was me.  You know, demonstrate proof of work.  I think it's right for these researchers to expect to get paid for the work.  They're fundamentally doing work that these companies have failed to do themselves.  That's a good point.  Intel knew about the vulnerability in their CPUs and actively ignored it is the message that I've been seeing.

Start time: 784.56
End time: 788.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They ignored it for 20 some years. They ignored speculation.

Start time: 788.56
End time: 790.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it's been found several times, I believe.

Start time: 791.60
End time: 808.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speculative execution. We saw a white paper written in 1995 that said, you know, this is going to leak information.  Everybody just blindly ignored it. So Jason, what do you tell your enterprise readers that they should do about this?  Is this something they should worry about? I mean, this was a tough one, right?

Start time: 809.32
End time: 883.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you don't really know yet what the, you know, potential damage.  Now, a lot of companies aren't using servers run in AMD processors, right?  That's that's the things that they care a lot about is is the data.  It's on servers, you know, AMD is not in a whole lot of servers.  Intel has an even bigger share of that market.  But, you know, obviously you have devices out there that have this that is going to put some of your most important data at risk potentially.  And so, you know, until we know what a better have a better idea what some of the risks are, you know, what you have to do is just sort of be on, you know, is have your radar up, which they always do anyway, of course.  But, you know, when you're looking at which devices to put out there and which devices are most vulnerable, which devices might have some of your most valuable data, most sensitive stuff on it, you may want to be careful if you've got devices that have AMD CPUs that might have some super, super sensitive, you know, IP or other kinds of data.  And you may want to move it away from, you know, some of those devices.  Those are the kinds of things that, you know, the enterprises and think about from a risk management.

Start time: 884.36
End time: 903.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  T.S. Labs, when asked by Tom's hardware, well, why didn't you give AMD the normal 90 day courtesy?  They said, well, we consider these so severe we didn't think AMD would be able to fix this for many, many months or even a year.  So we decided to give them 24 hours.  Interesting.

Start time: 905.68
End time: 943.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't fly.  I mean, just to go back to what Jason was saying, I just to draw some specifics out of that, a lot of firewalls, routers, storage arrays, a lot of custom appliances run AMD CPUs.  Most Intel's most people who buy servers from the traditional vendors, they're not AMDs.  But the vendors who make hard appliances are often running AMD.  Now, they're not off. Yeah, that's a good point. Accessible code.  So if you're looking at your firewalls, it's hard to get an injection point or to get a get through the attack surface.  But they're the devices that rise and fall is much more likely to affect because AMD is much stronger in the appliance market.

Start time: 944.02
End time: 992.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, other people like Alex Ionescu, who's well known in the security community, have said I've seen the technical details.  They're a legit design and implementation issues worth discussing as part of a coordinated disclosure effort.  The media storm and handling around that is sadly distracting from a real conversation around security boundaries.  And so his his his takeaway from this is is really the issue is people shouldn't have admin level access to this hardware.  There's another issue, though, that's interesting.  One of the reasons AMD was bit by some of these flaws is that they in their system on a chip, they use chips created by a third company that apparently left a back door in the hardware.  And whether intentionally or by accident, that's a big issue as well. Right.

Start time: 994.03
End time: 1046.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And like, obviously, this is something they're all doing because Intel had that problem a while back as well.  Right. With their onboard management chip running Minix.  Right.  Which has got so many vulnerabilities, it's basically, you know, unsafe for anybody to use, much less to put it inside a world class CPU.  So I think what we're seeing here is all of the silicon makers have sort of been caught out here.  But with the increasing focus on security, you're going to see more of this.  I think we're going to see more in baseband modems.  There's the iPhone vulnerability, which is on the list to talk about tonight.  Same sort of thing.  There's a lot more money on the table.  These bug bounty programs, places to sell these compromises means there's more work being done on security.  You're going to see much more of this type of stuff come out in the short term because it's worthwhile doing.  It's now actually a financial basis.  People can spend their lives making a living out of just finding these vulnerabilities.

Start time: 1046.88
End time: 1063.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And again, that's that's both good and bad.  That's one of the reasons bug bounties are both good because they encourage people to find them, but bad because they encourage people to find them.  So, you know, I have mixed feelings, obviously security by security obscurity is not a good kind of security.  So it is better to get these out.

Start time: 1063.72
End time: 1105.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, they call this Matador defense.  You know, you just wave, lift the cape and let them right on through.  You know, so unfortunately, it's showing up.  We're finding so much more than we have before, which is a good thing.  That's the one counter argument to this is by them making it public, people that to Greg's point, they might have a storage array with some of their most sensitive data that has AMD chip in it.  You know that they're going to likely move that data off of there because they don't know because of the unknown.  And so it's better to know than to have nation states or or other bad guys, you know, on the black market that do know and are going to compromise.  Bottom line from Motherboard.

Start time: 1106.10
End time: 1131.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of these new AMD flaws will be hard to patch and malicious hackers with a certain level of skill might be able to find ways to exploit them before they're patched, according to Guido.  But this is, I guess, the message for our audience.  Regular consumers shouldn't worry about them.  Probably the real problems are more for cloud providers and big enterprises.  And now that they know about them, they can do the Matador defense.  Is that a bowl and a red cape?  I'm not sure.

Start time: 1131.94
End time: 1137.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the Matador defense, you hold the cape up and then you just let them right over here.  Right on through.

Start time: 1138.14
End time: 1162.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and, you know, making sure people don't get admin access, things like that.  Yeah.  You know, if you have to have admin access to take advantage of these.  Well, that's that's something that enterprises can address and servers can address.  And they shouldn't be allowing admin access anyway.  I guess you maybe have a this would be a cascaded tech.  You have a malware that gets you escalated access and then you can apply these.

Start time: 1163.70
End time: 1184.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is where the impact of this is fairly unknown at this point in time.  The exploit code is not published.  That doesn't mean that people aren't out there actively trying to write code as we speak.  Right.  But at this point in time, there doesn't seem to be anything in the wild.  Whereas with Spectre and Meltdown, people were publishing exploit code within a few hours of that coming live.  You know, proof of concept exploit code, not a working exploit.

Start time: 1185.72
End time: 1195.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And by the way, there's a little bit of karma in this because remember when Spectre and Meltdown were revealed, AMD immediately put out a press release saying, not us.  And then we have that.  Well, as a matter of fact, you.

Start time: 1196.54
End time: 1200.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  Poor Georgia.  We're sitting here going.  Actually, I want to take a break when we come back and talk to you about why I deleted my Facebook account last night.  And I'm pretty head up.  I'm pretty mad about what Facebook's been up to.  So maybe maybe we can get into that in a second.  First, let's talk about making your Wi-Fi work.  The worst thing in the world is the shout.  And I hear it from time to time.  I did anyway, from your spouse saying, honey, the Wi-Fi is down or worse.  You're watching, you know, the last season of the last episode of the last season of Game of Thrones.  And all of a sudden.  The buffering and the buffering and you go, she walked in the fire.  And then. But what?  That's why we got an euro.  And I haven't had the problem since I'm happy to say euro.  Is enterprise grade Wi-Fi in your home.  That's easy to set up, easy to use and solves.  Those problems. It's designed to solve the problems.  Modern Wi-Fi. Unfortunately, you know, we live in an environment where everything we've got.  We went from one or two or three devices on your Wi-Fi network.  I have 45 on my Wi-Fi network.  And that's pretty common between your lights and your echoes, your TVs, your laptops, your phones.  Wi-Fi is doing a lot of work.  Plus, your neighbors got Wi-Fi.  And sometimes your neighbor has one of those Wi-Fi routers with 18 antennas that's designed to knock you off.  Eero solves this problem.  We started to play with Eero when it first came out two years ago, early 2016.  And here's one of the things that's great about Eero.  They've learned over the last two years from hundreds of thousands of systems.  And they've been making them smarter, faster, more reliable.  Couple of things you want in a router.  And any IoT device.  Number one, you want it to be over the air, firmware upgradeable.  And Eero does exactly that.  Upgrades come automatically.  They're automatically applied.  Not just security, but they're improving the system all the time.  In fact, the new second generation Eero and the Eero Beacon, those are great.  The Eero Beacon, you just plug into the wall, are more perfectly tailored to fit your needs in your home than ever before.  More speed and range.  They're tri-band now.  Same beautiful design people love.  I don't mind people seeing the router in the hall or in the living room because it's unobtrusive.  It's gorgeous.  And because they're now tri-band, they have that third 5 GHz radio, the second generation Eero is twice as fast as its predecessor.  And that means you can do more in every room of your home.  They have a thread radio now, which means you can connect to low-power devices like locks and doorbells and other sensors.  It's easy to expand your coverage.  We started with the basic kit, which was a base unit and two beacons.  I've added a couple of beacons because then I put a camera outside and I wanted to make sure it could get to the Wi-Fi from the garage.  So I put an Eero in the garage.  It's easy to do.  If there's an outlet, there's Wi-Fi.  Free overnight shipping to the US or Canada.  Visit Eero.com and at checkout, select overnight shipping, then enter the offer code TWIT to make it free.  I love also Eero has the new Eero Plus, which gives me much more control.  I can do things like with my Amazon Echo.  I can say, what you do is I've assigned all the devices in the house to different users.  And I, our 15 year old, I assigned his computer, his phone, his tablet to Michael.  And now I can tell Amazon Echo, pause Michael's internet.  And it's so much fun.  You wait for the scream.  And it's one, two, three.  Hey!  He can't unpause it, by the way.  With the Echo, he has to use the app and he doesn't have access to the app.  We also are able to filter for safe sites, for violence, for sex, all sorts of things.  And malware too.  In fact, I have the whole house filtered through Eero Plus for malware.  It's just a great system.  Try it at Eero.com.  And again, the offer code TWIT gets you free overnight shipping to the US or Canada.  I thank you Eero for making a Wi-Fi that really works.  No more, I hear screams, but it's a different kind.  Hey, I'm playing here.  Yeah, go to bed.  Go to bed.  We are such a techie household.  Now Lisa will text Michael, brush your teeth and go to bed.  She sends him a text.  It's crazy.  I did wire up the house.  You know, when the Amazon added the intercom feature to the Echo, where you could have,  you could say Michael, go to bed through the Echo.  But he's smart.  He immediately unplugged his Echo.  We've had to find other means.  Your kids aren't old enough yet, Georgia.  Are they going to have to do that?  I don't.  They're not really old enough.

We've got, of course, Greg Farrow here and the wonderful Georgia Dow.  And Georgia, I think you'd be proud of me.  Maybe not.  Last night, I finally had it.  I read the story.  There's a by the way, we've reported on this.  We've been reporting on this for over a year.  Facebook.  I've told people for more than a year, don't do Facebook quizzes because Facebook allows you to do it.  Because Facebook allows a quiz designer not only to get all the information about you because you took the quiz,  but, and this is incredibly infuriating,  they also allow the quiz designer to get information about your friends.  Facebook says, well, wait a minute.  No, we only allow that to improve.  Let me see if I can find the stupid quote.  We're only allowing collection of friends data to improve user experience in the app.  It can't be sold or used for advertising, except that's exactly what Cambridge Analytica did.  And now we know for a fact, even though we've known this for a while,  we now have a whistleblower who has told the story of how Cambridge Analytica basically stole 50 million Facebook profiles,  got all the information they need.  Cambridge Analytica is owned by the Robert Mercer family and was run at the time by Steve Bannon.  And of course, the information was intended to be used by a Trump during the campaign.  Although I don't blame Cambridge Analytica as much as I blame Facebook for even allowing this to happen.  And you probably could say that other campaigns have done the same thing.  The whistleblower said that they, since early 2014,  they built a system that would profile user, US voters in order to target them with personalized political advertisements.  We exploited Facebook to harvest millions of people's profiles and built models to exploit what we knew about them and target their inner demons.  This was the basis the entire company was built on.

And he was on it from when Ted Cruz's campaign was using Cambridge Analytica.  And he was saying that there's just something fishy about this and it doesn't smell right.

And this was confirmed by a Facebook statement that said that by late 2015,  Facebook knew that this information had been harvested on an unprecedented scale.  It did not alert users.  It took only limited steps to recover and secure the private information.  And in fact, this really frustrates me.  When Facebook was told by the Observer that we have this information,  we're going to go live with this story tomorrow, then and only then they kicked Cambridge Analytica off the platform.

We've already seen accusations leveled at Facebook saying that they are actively supporting the regime of Duerte over there.  Horrible.  Quite.  You know, I don't want to get too carried away, but carrying out terrible things against the citizens.  So Facebook could just up from Silicon Valley and relocate to the Philippines to continue on and the U.S.  government has vectorly zero control, right?

Transcript:  Yeah, it's true.  Like, the thing is, there are three companies right now that are disrupting markets that are turning society upside down in so many ways.  And it's because they are five to 10 years ahead of everybody else on data and they know more about us than we know about ourselves.  And they're using that data to monetize the living crap out of everything that they have.  And they are incented to keep that as private and proprietary as possible because it's a gold mine.  Right. It's an absolute gold mine.

And the thing that frustrates me is I don't take Facebook quizzes because I know that that gives them your information.  That's you know, you see these quiz, which Game of Thrones character are you?  Are you smarter than a fifth grader?  How's your spelling?  And I see so many people on my timeline saying, see how smart I am.  I'm in the 99th percentile in spelling.  I'm saying you're not smart.  You're a moron.  You just took that quiz.  That was a dopey quiz.  That was made up quiz.  They just wanted your personal information.  But you know what really frosts me is I don't take the quiz.  Doesn't matter.  My friends did.  They got my information.  And that's infuriating.  It's true.

And you're still because you're part of the ecosystem.  In the end, the only thing that matters to Facebook is if you delete Facebook and ask them to delete all the data that they have on you because they're going to keep it anyways.  And in the end, the amount of media literacy that we teach to our children and to ourselves, like we really we are so easily sucked into these applications for Internet points that it's pretty sad.

Transcript:  The good news is thanks.  Thanks to the EU and the GDPR.  Facebook now has a way to actually permanently delete your information in the past.  When you got off of Facebook, they would deactivate your account for six months, hoping that you would at some point accidentally log in and they go, oh, welcome back.  By the way, when you leave Facebook, I should have done this on the air because it's hysterical.  They put pictures of all your friends and they look sad.  And they say it literally said Georgia Dow is so sorry you're leaving Facebook.  Do you want to send her a note telling her why it's the most offensive emotional blackmail?  Oh, yeah.  Yeah.  So now you can do a complete delete of your Facebook data.  And I really think this is because coming in May, they were going to get in trouble with the EU if they didn't offer this.  So it's not just deactivating.  It does still take two weeks.  So last night, and I see here Facebook saying it'll take 90 days to delete all the things you've posted.  Well, we'll see.  Why would it take 90 days?  Aren't computers a little faster?  Because they're hoping you're going to come back.  Right.

Yes, you know, Mark Warner's honest ads bill should go through and that should require that just as on radio and TV, political ads have to be identified.  You have to say this ad was paid for by so-and-so.  That's not a requirement in digital advertising.  It should be.  That, I hope, happens.  But it's still not going to...

But those three companies are and because they're in, you know, they are they have very,  very close relationships with their government.  They're a bit protected for the moment.  But those three companies that I mentioned, they have really been able to run roughshod  over the entire globe with the exception of the EU and and basically be able to do whatever  they want with all this data and be have no transparency about what they're doing.  And that's the problem.  Cambridge Analytica, you know, is is just like a Nat that's that, you know, was able  to use this platform to siphon a little bit off.  Right.  The real problem, the real issue is the data and the fact that we have no regulation about  it.  And it's getting we're getting later and later in the game.  And the EU and GDPR is making a difference because these companies, as well as a lot  of others, you know, they essentially are making that their baseline.  If they're going to have to do that there, then, you know, in Europe to be in that market,  then then it is having an effect on what they're doing in other markets as well, because it's  just less expensive for them to get back to fiduciary responsibility.  But, you know, we still have this huge problem that we just haven't woken up to the fact  that, you know, that data is the new oil and we can't let it be a wild, wild west.  Yeah.

So then they'll end up like, you know, falling into line.  And we need to in the end, what we need, though, is like media literacy.  We need to teach our kids how to deal with social media, what's happening with it and  why.  And I think that, you know, old data is worth nothing.  And old is like a really short period of time when we talk about the technological age.  So if a lot of people, there's an exodus from Facebook, which, you know, in my I don't use  Facebook, so I think that would be great.  But most of the young kids, they're still using other sets of social media and our brains  are primed for wanting to get those clicks on social media.  That validation is going less and less with real people and more and more with Internet  clicks.  And we're primed for that.

Transcript:  Yeah, but Amazon, I think the elephant in the room here is the political angle and we  haven't touched on that.  The simple fact is that the data that Facebook let their partners, because these were signed  up legally obligated partners who promised not to steal the data, but they stole the  data anyway, highlights the fact that Facebook has very little control over its data, had  very little control.  And even now, once you order a Facebook employee, you can basically do anything you like.  And the only reason we haven't seen more of this is just sheer blind luck.

But the real issue here is that Cambridge Analytica was a UK company funded by Alt-Right  run by Steve Bannon, which is in Trump's government.  The whole Alt-Right got involved in the Brexit thing here in the UK.  We've now got the Information Commissioners Office in the UK announcing that they will  open an investigation into this whole issue.  So Facebook is now under fire.  You're talking about the right wing of the American government is now looking at Facebook  going, are you with us or are you against us?  Then you've got Cambridge Analytica getting onto the right wing over here and they're using it.  Do you see what I'm saying?

Transcript:  And that's exactly what they've done in the Philippines under Duerte.  Same thing in Myanmar.  Same thing's happening in many other countries.  Facebook has been co-opted by governments, strongman governments, to control the population  and to control the flow of information.  And there's no reason for Facebook to stay in the US.  It could just bunk out at any time, except for the fact that the US is the market which  generates the most revenue for them.  But they could probably just scoot off if they needed to, if they thought the pressure.  And they're childish enough.  I mean, your average Silicon Valley executive has the mental brain power of a 16-year-old  with a lot of hormones.  They're so competitive.  They're so inwardly looking.  They're so focused on winning.  They're not focused on the money as much as they are on the winning.  They're socially incompetent to the level where I'm winning if I'm making more money.  And so they're not actually following capitalism.  They're not following any rules of society.  They're just trying to win blindly, aggressively, over and over and over, win, win, win.  And the way that I keep score about winning is to make more money.  And at some point, that's going to come off the rails because there's no more money to make, I suspect.  Or something else happens.

And I think you've seen him the last couple of years in pretty clear some statements,  knowing that this thing has gotten out of control and he knows there's some serious problems.  I mean, his number one, like his New Year's resolution for this year was fix Facebook.  That's pretty bold statement.

Transcript:  He says fix it, but I'd be interested to see what he's actually doing to fix it.  The latest thing is Facebook told CNN, oh, it was a rogue employee.  We figured out it was a rogue employee that gave up all that information.  So it wasn't our fault.  My real problem is that if you're a normal person using Facebook, it's a very attractive thing.  It's how you stay in touch with family and friends.  You discover your high school sweetheart and what she's been up to.  It's very attractive.  Facebook acts as if you're giving them information, but they're keeping it private.  You have control of it.  You have control of it.  You say who's a friend, who's an acquaintance, who is not to see your stuff.  They really act as if, you know, you are controlling that information.  They don't tell people that when you take a quiz, you're giving all your information to that company and you're giving up all your friends.  I mean, you're a little bit.

Transcript:  You can check it on or off if you choose.  But people usually don't even read that or know what they're doing.  I think that, you know, I would love to think that Zuckerberg is actually, you know, wants to fix Facebook because who knows what that means.  But the best way to tell if someone's behavior in the future is by their behavior in the past.  And they waited two years to be able to deal with this.  They were not transparent about it.  They only deleted them from their system when they found out and the information was still there anyways.  So we know that in the end, their their most important thing was Facebook and keep saving face and making the most amount of money.  So, no, I don't think that they really want to make a difference in the world or try to do the right thing.  I think that they'll only do that if they have to or if it ends up hurting their bottom line by people deleting Facebook.  And in the end, that's really like legislation, I think is important.  But I think that you're right, Leo, that, you know, deleting Facebook is the biggest message that you could send to them.  And if there's a huge exodus, they'll start to listen.

Or maybe you just want to keep your hands off.  Men's health is a topic that men, we're not good.  Men are not good about talking about health issues, right?  And there's one issue that we will just not bring up at all.  You don't want to tell your doctor.  You don't want to tell your friends.  You definitely don't want to tell your wife erectile dysfunction, right?  This is something that people are just nervous about.  But you don't have to live with it because there's Roman, a men's health company  that will do remote online completely private diagnosis for ED  and then offer convenient monthly delivery of medication.  Now, don't be embarrassed, guys.  It's okay.  This is going to help you.  Guys don't like talking about this, but there's no reason to ignore it.  All it takes is five minutes.  You'll do an online survey about your medical history.  You can give your preferences of medication, too, if you've got a preference.  Roman handles everything from online diagnosis to prescription delivery for ED meds.  U.S. licensed physicians will review the treatment requests within two hours.  And if appropriate, if it's not a harmful situation, they will write a prescription for you.  And then the medication is delivered free to your door.  This is not one of those phony online pharmacies.  This is a real pharmacy, Roman Pharmacy, discreetly packaged with RHP on the front.  Refills happen automatically every month or every quarter.  I know you don't want to talk about this to your buddies.  You don't want to talk about it to your doctor.  But Roman's a place to start.  Fifty dollars off your first month.  Try it. Look at there.

And erectile dysfunction is a horrible thing to have happen, especially you have a love person in your life and you want to be functional.  This is a good thing. That's all.  Thank you, Puritans, for making this all messy.  Screwing it up for all of us.  All right, let's talk. So, Qualcomm, San Diego company, US founded, US run.  Of course, they own pretty much every patent for CDMA. They own many LTE patents.  That's a very profitable part of their business.  They also do chip designs and Qualcomm chips are in almost every smartphone made.  Recently, Apple's been trying to pull back from Qualcomm by using Intel chips, but they weren't as good.  So, this is a good business. Broadcom, also chip manufacturer, used to be in the US. They went to Singapore, right?  It sounds like, Greg, you're up on this. So, I'm going to let you take it from here.  They made an offer to buy Qualcomm. Was it a hostile takeover?

Start time: 3484.84
End time: 3523.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, it was hostile. Qualcomm doesn't want to be acquired. They're looking for a much higher price.  Broadcom offered $60. Qualcomm wants $90, which is kind of like a big, you know, two fingers telling you that you're really going to.  That's a way. 50% up is a very big ask. The game's been going backwards and forwards.  If you go back a little bit, let's get some history here. Broadcom was originally, a substantial part of Broadcom was the old Bell Labs.  So, there's a business called Fargo, which is the silicon part of HP and before that, Compaq and Dell and blah, blah, blah.  And so, a substantial part of Broadcom's portfolio is a US business that then moved to Singapore.

Start time: 3528.68
End time: 3543.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. So, Avago and the Progenesis or the core of the Avago acquisition that was part of a merger just a couple of years ago is still a US business.  So, the bulk of Broadcom's revenue and business still exists in the US, although the company is now domiciled in Singapore.

Transcript:  They've wanted to repatriate though. They want to come back, right?

Start time: 3548.20
End time: 3697.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they went and spoke to President Trump. They did a deal, got some great press and then announced that they're relocating back to the US.  President Trump, you know, used that to say his grade is going to be great for jobs, you know, US businesses and all that sort of thing.  I remember that press conference.  And so, part of it that is the logic here is that Broadcom then took that opportunity to make another acquisition. So, to take over Qualcomm.  So, what we're looking at here is the market for chips is starting to stagnate.  There's the innovation pace is slowing down.  So, one way to make the to keep your profits growing is to start acquiring your competitors and get big, go into scale, get large as quickly as possible so that you own the most market share.  And you can potentially grab a dominant market and then control the market to your benefit.  So, Broadcom wants to buy Qualcomm.  Qualcomm doesn't want to be acquired.  Qualcomm goes to the long and short of it is that Qualcomm did a whole bunch of moves.  Broadcom made moves to be appointed to the Qualcomm board.  And then all of a sudden we see President Trump come out and say he's decided to kill the Qualcomm announcement.  Now, in the meantime, Qualcomm is spent over 100 million in Washington in lobbyist fees over the last 12 months.  Qualcomm has a long history of buying lobbyists in Washington to support its business.  So, a big part about what it spends its money on isn't is just related to protecting its patents.  So, if you have a large patent portfolio, you need politicians and political support to make sure that your portfolio doesn't get scuppered in some way to make sure the legal protections are in place.  Broadcom failed to recognize that Qualcomm has a number of supporters in government, literally due to how much money it pays politicians.  And Qualcomm has had a long history, a 20 or 30 year history of being using the U.S. government to prop up its profits.  That is, it might get the U.S. government to mandate the use of U.S. technology, which just so happens to be Qualcomm only technology like CDMA.  Right. So, the reason that Qualcomm CDMA was forced onto Verizon was that the U.S. government said we want one carrier to be using 3G and we want one carrier to be using CDMA, two technologies.  So, if one fails and the CDMA must be from Qualcomm because that's a UK company, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.  And in the end, of course, Verizon got stung. They went out. They wasted tens of billions of dollars going down a technology path that nobody wanted because the only country in the world to deploy CDMA was, but Qualcomm made out like bandits.  Right. They made billions and billions out of licensing.

Start time: 3732.50
End time: 3748.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my understanding. Qualcomm spent a lot of money and has had a long history of getting political decisions to go its way.  It was able to go to Cepheus, as you say, get it. And then that went to President Trump, who was then able to claim the victory as his own, protecting U.S. jobs.  I think there are some valid national security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's my real question. I include Jason in this as well.  And I've seen a number of articles saying, well, we don't like how it went down, but you know what? It wasn't a bad thing to prevent Broadcom from buying Qualcomm.

Start time: 3762.08
End time: 3791.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it wasn't a great hostile takeover. Broadcom is one of those weird companies. Greg characterized it perfectly.  There is much of like almost like a standards organization, a portfolio company, then really somebody that makes something.  They're one of those companies that has a lot of IP.  Is this Qualcomm or Broadcom?  Sorry, Broadcom.  Broadcom actually makes things.  Actually has really.  I think the other way around. Don't I have Broadcom chips and all of my stuff?

Start time: 3791.80

Transcript:  So I guess I'm splitting hairs, but I think of it more the other way around on everything that I know of the two companies.  But the point is that what the White House is talking about is all optics.  I don't think there's not going to change any job from being in Singapore, which is the one place in the world.  Was that the issue jobs or security?  Well, it's both.

Transcript:  100% UK protectorate for a long time.  Right. All that.  It's very confusing.  So the point is it's optics.  It's one of those things.  It was easy to go to the president for the organization, right?  To go to the president for CFIUS and say, we're not going to do this.  We shouldn't do this because it looks like a hostile takeover of a US company by an international company in Asia.  And so that's why they did it from optics.  They're both very well positioned in Washington.  They both are, you know, are companies that make chips, but really they more make more money off the licensing of patents that they own.  They're not companies that are, you know, big employers necessarily.  And somebody like, you know, Intel and Samsung that are, you know, employing lots and lots of people that are, you know, building the next generation.

Start time: 3907.16

End time: 3955.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the other part about this is the rise of Huawei and ZTE as networking makers.  And they're pushing very hard into the telco market.  So the US market is largely closed to these Chinese companies and Broadcom makes the chips that companies like Huawei and ZTE and others can use to put in.  And the US security apparatus is very concerned that they may end up where all the chips are designed by an international company, probably based in.  They don't see Broadcom necessarily as a viable owner of that.  And they would also feel that they may end up beholden to Huawei providing the technology that would run the mobile phone networks in the US.

Start time: 3977.78
End time: 3981.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  But there's a difference between like using an iPhone, which is manufactured in China, but under the, I would hope, tight control of Apple.  I'm sure they test chips before they use them in the phone and so forth.  And a Chinese company like Huawei or ZTE or Xiaomi, where it's at least partially owned by the Chinese military.  So there is a difference there.  I think you could trust an iPhone where you may not trust a Xiaomi phone.  I don't know.  I want a Xiaomi phone, so I don't know.  I don't know.

Transcript:  I think it's rational to ask the question.  It's practically silly because we are not in a position to rationally evaluate that because chips are so expensive.  We can't really evaluate that because chips are so phenomenally complicated.  But I think let's assume that for whatever reason, Qualcomm has decided to take a position to oppose the Broadcom board.  And if you believe the proposition that I've put forward, which is that they've politically been able to work faster than Broadcom and outclass them.

Transcript:  You have to kind of hope not.  Even though, like we said, Qualcomm and Broadcom, I know they do make chips.  It's the smaller chips.  It's the networking chips.  Yeah, but it's critical infrastructure.

Transcript:  It has been for years.  Well, I think that what we have to worry about is the fact that these companies,  like with Intel buying Qualcomm, if we get that kind of vertical integration,  then that's almost always a bad thing for consumers.  It almost always means higher prices.  It almost always is something, whether it was Broadcom or Intel buying them,  the friction between x86 and the ARM processors has been a good thing for consumers.  It's been a good thing for processors.  Now, it could be that every company and every technology runs its course.  And so it could be that Qualcomm is a target because they've kind of run their course.  And Broadcom, Intel, maybe it wouldn't matter.  But I do worry that that competitive pressure is what's helping keep technology,  the cost of it, lower.  And so we'll see.

Transcript:  So I'm curious if anybody knows.  Georgia and I were, I think, referring to the SS7 hack that we learned about two years ago.  As far as I know, it has not been mitigated.  Greg, do you know if this is the software that's used in the radios in all of our phones, right?

Start time: 4238.60
End time: 4282.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It can't be mitigated.  So it's there, and there's nothing you could do about it.  No, that's why people are saying, you know how we get reaching the SMS messages that they send us,  are all triggered over SS7 signaling.  And this is why people are calling for the end of SMS messages with the, you know,  the how you get PayPal and they'll send you a text message with a PIN number.  Yeah, that's a terrible, terrible way to do it.  Because SS7 is inherently insecure.  It's a 30-year-old technology. It was never designed to be secure.  It was always assumed that the network was secure.  And therefore the protocol didn't need to be encrypted or safe.  And there's nothing they can do about it short of replacing it.  But there's no momentum to replace it because there's no money in voice.

Start time: 4282.68
End time: 4304.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So SS7 would allow a hacker to send, read, forward, intercept text messages.  But apparently you could do the same with calls as well, right?  You could track the location of a phone.  You can't. I mean, this is, and this has been around, we've known about this for you.  So what are we worried about Broadcom freaking Qualcomm?

Start time: 4304.66
End time: 4341.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The trick is to usually to get into the SS7 signaling,  you've got to be attached to a network where the signaling is.  And normally those networks are secured and safe.  And what we're finding increasingly is that the telcos who are in charge of those networks  are no longer being safe.  They're no longer spending money on security or maintaining those  because the voice network, it doesn't generate revenue for them.  So they're pushing it away to go and work on data or, you know, or like Verizon,  they go and buy Yahoo and media companies and so forth to try and make money.  And the voice network is fundamentally being abandoned because it's not a profit center for them.

Transcript:  I mean, Firefox and X in the chat room said it best.  SS7 is a feature. It's not a bug.  Like it's been around forever.  And it's until you replace that, you know, that infrastructure, the protocol, right.  Then it's not.  I almost get the feeling that there's no momentum for that.

So that a battery operated like a, in like a CR2032 battery, the size of a 50 cent piece, 50 pence piece.

You could tell he was kind of a jerk even back then asked if he had any skills typing.  No machines.  No key punch.  No computer and calculator.  Yes, design and tech.  He he's got a special ability.  He wants to be electronics tech or design engineer for digital products.  This went this this job application from a teenage Steve Jobs.

We'll stream live 8 a.m.  My time and then go right in IOS today.  What do you think Georgia what do you think Apple is going to announce.  Well I think it's I think it's a wonderful thing of how to use Apple products in the  classroom how to use the products in the classroom how to use the products in the classroom.

Start time: 4695.50

Transcript:  I think it's I think it's a wonderful thing of how to use Apple products in the classroom  how to deal with accessibility how to help students be able to learn better and to be  able to use Apple products because in the end if you you know you end up once you learn  a certain ecosphere you end up staying on that because you feel comfortable with it.  So I think that Apple is famous for doing that.  I mean yeah well that's what really brought back right is being in the classroom.  So I think that they're going back to that and I think that there's a lot of push that  we need to have our kids understand media and be able to handle it.  And I think Apple wants to make sure that they're there at the forefront of it and don't  lose ground to Google.

Transcript:  Yeah schools can't afford Apple products so Apple has to figure out how can they get  them back into the school system because if you use that at school then you're going to  want to get that at home.  It makes sense to that.  And even though my kids don't use technology they have.  Wait a minute what.  They use technology they have to pay for their own technology.  They don't just get to run rampant on video games and have computers and pay them.  They end up paying by using good marks getting good marks in classes doing homework doing  things like that.  So we end up you know they do well in the school stuff and then they end up getting  to be able to use technology and play VR and do whatever else they want for it.

That's that's what the design the class is designed to teach you how to read people.  Not in a negative bad way but so that you can see if somebody's if you're getting cues  from somebody that they're upset or they're happy because.  Yeah it's great.  Because like most kids he's like they don't they don't.

Transcript:  And it's weird it's not implicit.  We actually learn that through mimicry.  So if we're our heads are stuck into a computer or your parents heads are stuck in their computers  or on VR then you're not learning how to read other people's cues.  And I do that a lot in session of helping people be able to read what does someone mean  because I do have kids come in and they have no clue if someone's upset or annoyed or they've  insulted someone and most of body language 80 percent of language sorry is through body  language and so you need to be able to do both.  I think it's a great idea to have a class to that but also we need to do that through  personal interactions.

So sure I did go out and do more of the hunting and the fighting for things and women usually  and again this is a little bit of bias.  People don't get angry to me but it's true.  Women did work in larger social groups where they were watching over the kids and they  had to foretell what these children were going to do wrong before they did it so that they  would survive and be able to read other women that they were working with and so that was  a we're usually by and large better at it but still I notice men and women right now young  young adults that are having difficulty with being able to read people and because of that  having a lot of social anxiety when they go into new events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it actually is true for even radio.  It is actually true for radio and TV and for other things.  We are not as good at too much TV.  But we're not as good at delaying gratification as we used to.  Kids are now no longer ever able to be bored.  It causes them a lot of distress and dealing with that as with time now that we have a  more instantaneous reward system our brains become more inclined to get more rewards more  quickly and we actually feel a sense of pain.  It's not true pain but a feeling of longing and sadness when we're not getting rewarded  immediately and we have a lot of overly reactive young adults now because they're kind of  used to getting things immediately.  And so yes even though it's a smaller difference in between that now that we do things that  are instantaneous I get upset if I can't like I used to have to get up and actually turn  the channels of the TV.  Now I don't even want to reach over if I can't find the Apple remote.  I want to try to talk to my TV to be able to do it and I get annoyed for that.

They they have been through all of that and they end up just building coping mechanisms  just like I had to go through coping because of the era.  I think that generally the challenge that we have at the moment is that people just  haven't adapted to the new environment.  So I don't subscribe to this apocalyptic you know world ending view that you know we're  rewiring our brains.  Yes we're rewiring our brains but it's no different to the industrial age in the 18th  century when people came off the land to work in factories.  It's no different to when people started printing Bibles and the priest was saying you can't  give ordinary people Bibles.  They have no way to interpret it.

And if you're not going to learn a skill you're not going to get better at it.  If we never allowed our children to walk they wouldn't learn how to.  This is not something that doesn't happen without practice.  So you want to be able to be knowledgeable to it.

I don't I don't spend all my life attached to my phone.  But you know what I also don't have to put up with all that stuff you used to work with  because some of those people were really.

And the thing is the thing is in time like we're going to have to learn how to deal with  whether it's Facebook whether it's screen time mobile devices all of these things are  inherently just tools.  And but but we can also use those tools in the same way that humans can do everything  for good or ill.  Right.  We are still figuring out what those things are and creating the boundaries which I think  is what ultimately George is getting at is you know we understanding those things and  then figuring out where the boundaries are so that we can you know manage them to the  best effect is the challenge that we're going through now because things are are moving  so quickly that we're not having a whole lot of time to process it and to you know  put up the kind of guidelines that we need to you know manage these things effectively.

She's really really good at that.  She called me up and said Dad I need to get an electric toothbrush.  I feel I'm not brushing my teeth well enough.  And I thought hallelujah.  How long have I been telling you that.  So I ordered her this.  I got her quip.  This is the and I'm not kidding.  I actually said honey I'll take care of it.  I know exactly what to get you.  This is the best electric toothbrush.  I said first of all it doesn't plug in.  You don't have to have a charger.  She said oh I like that.  It has a it comes with it has a triple A battery in it.  And so that means it you you it runs for I don't know how long it's been running.  It runs for I don't know how long.  I haven't had to put a new battery in for a while.

They like brushing with this.  Yeah they like it.  And by the way I should mention that the different colors are helpful because you can have four different people in your bathroom at the same time.  And you'll all know which toothbrush is whose by the quip color.  I really like my quip.  Getquip.com  So this Apple event.  Here's what I think.  And Ming-Chi Kuo who is one of the Apple rumor guys.  He's one with a real supply side bent because he's an analyst in China.  And he says according to Ming that Apple is going to do yes for education as you said Georgia.  Finally an inexpensive because I don't think Apple sells anything less than a thousand maybe even more than that.  Not a laptop.  Not a laptop.  Finally an inexpensive MacBook Air.  And by the way I'm just thrilled they're going to keep selling the MacBook Air because that's great.  With a retina display which is something that they needed to do.  He says $799 to $899 which would be kind of necessary for a school.  The current MacBook Air starts at $999.  It's still too expensive but yeah.  I wish it were less.  I mean you're competing against $300 Chromebooks.  It's funny Microsoft is...  Apple already was out of the classroom.  They weren't even competitive.  It was Windows, cheap Windows machines and even they have been losing ground to Chromebooks.  And one of the things I got this week I'll show you is I think Microsoft's kind of trying to answer this Chromebook threat with something called Windows 10S.  And less expensive computers.  This is the first Windows computer based on the ARM processors.  Not Windows RT.  This is Windows 10S running on a Snapdragon Qualcomm chip 835.  This is now it's a little pricey.  It's $1000 but it does include the keyboard and the pen.  It comes from HP.  It's called the NVX2.  I got it because I'm very curious what these are like given that they're running not on desktop processors but on mobile processors.  They're claiming 22 hours battery life.  It sure is the longest battery life I've ever gotten.  I doubt it will be 22 hours.  I haven't really been able to completely test it.  But I would say fairly heavy use over a 24 hour period.  So maybe 12, 15 hours.  The only negative is it is slow.  It's not slow if you only do Windows 10S in Microsoft's Edge browser.  That feels pretty snappy.  But put Chrome on it, you'll be sorry.  And you can because you can upgrade to Windows 10 Pro with all of these Windows 10s.

It's secure.  And then they're so cheap.  Yeah, you're not saving data in it.  Google Docs is huge in education for obvious reasons.  And Google Classroom as well.  Google Classroom?  They've now made that much more widely available.  And Google is just absolutely crushing Microsoft and Apple in the classroom.  And I don't think that this thing that they're doing, I think it's good that they're having a cheaper MacBook Air.  I think that's smart just in general.  I think there's lots of regular workers that could use that device and be happy with it.  We have some old, we have a lot of MacBook Airs in our company.  People love MacBook Airs.  People are holding on to them.  They're holding on to them for a long time.  A new MacBook Air will do great.

And they went, it works and it's secure.  Yeah, I don't think Microsoft's Microsoft will never win in the education market.  Yeah, yeah, because it's not safe.  It's not secure and it's not actually easy to operate.  To install the operating system on that device is a massive pain in the butt.  Whereas a Chromebook is trivial.  Every time you turn it on, it basically loads the operating system from scratch.  It's got.

Transcript:  Can Apple succeed in this environment?  Can an iPad, for instance?

Start time: 5740.19
End time: 5799.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that the iPads could.  I think that the problem is, is that once a school has invested one of teaching teachers how to be able to use a certain set of technology, it's really hard to teach them something else.  I think that iPads, they're not that expensive.  They're kind of pricey, but they're not that expensive.  They're definitely safe and secure.  They're very easy to use.  But the teachers are already proved to be able to use it.  And there's already probably Chromebooks in the school.  And so what they're going to do is they're not going to throw all these Chromebooks out if they're going to invest in others.  They're not going to then train teachers to be able to use iPads and the different systems that are there because all of the schools in our area are set up to Google Classroom.  And so I think that it's going to be an uphill battle for Apple.  And they really need to give something that's going to cause a push and make it affordable.  Because in the end, schools work on the bottom line.  Like unless you're a private school, you're working on how much money can you save?  Because if you take from one area, if you give to one area, you're taking from another.  And so I think it's going to be hard for Apple to crack through.

Transcript:  They're doing well in like the K through about three.  The iPads, right?  iPads are still pretty simple for those kids.  And they are still doing well in a lot of schools that are using that.  But once you get a kid to where they have to write something, they have to do a response paper,  they have to maybe work some basic software on their own by software being usually websites.  Right. Then almost all of them that we see and all the schools that we talk to and administrators  and CIOs of schools and school systems, I should say, their Chromebook is almost 100 percent of what we see.

Transcript:  There's no incentive to go to Apple.  Apple's got no incentive to introduce a low cost device because if they do, they undercut everything.  So if they introduced a $500 MacBook, people are going to stop buying a $1000 MacBook.  And Apple is all about ARPU.  It's all about increasing the average revenue per user.  Its share price is going to get slammed if they suddenly introduce something cheap.  So no, they're done with the education market.

They're unsafe to use, they're constantly insecure, and they're too hard to administer.  Down on the ground, even if they could match the price of the Chromebook,  even if Microsoft could squeeze its corporate soul to do something right for a change,  it still couldn't make it so that the administration, the people who actually put the computers in front of the kids,  need something that just works every time they take it off the rack.

And besides, you don't just get iPads.  Now you have to get charging stations, you have to get curriculum, you have to teach the teachers.  Lightning cables, Power Jacks.  Yeah, it's completely...

Transcript:  If Apple decided to donate and to be able to give to a certain set of schools,  and they were going to be able to train all of the teachers,  I think that that would be a big push for them.  They may do, that's a good point.  It's going to take that.  To build refurbished systems, or if they even said they would do a free fix,  and if you break something, we're going to fix it for free.  I think that Apple has the...  They could be able to do that, and that would start a system.  And then once people are kind of stuck in the ecosphere, odds are they're going to continue to.  And so if Apple was willing to support the school systems,  I think that that would be a really big deal for Apple.

They're likely to partner with some schools,  especially ones that don't have access to good technology,  and they're likely to either donate or give them at a massive discount.  But to Greg's point, you still have to support it.  And so that's its own challenge.  And so Apple is probably going to have to have a larger program in place there.  And then these other things, the MacBook and other, it's going to support, again,  the same percent of the market that Apple already owns, which is that like top 10%.  They cherry pick the best part of the market where the biggest margins are,  where the people that can afford it typically want to invest in a Mac versus a PC.  And they will want to keep that in education in the same way they do in a larger market.

Transcript:  There is something going on at Apple, though.  I'm going to refer to Neil Cybart's Above Avalon blog he published a couple of days ago.  He's observed that Apple's R&D spend has jumped hugely.  They're going to spend more in fiscal year 2018 than they spent from 1998 to 2011 together.  And that, by the way, that decade or more saw the launch of the iPod, the iPhone, and the iPad.  So they're spending something a lot.  Traditionally, Apple's not known for their R&D expenditure.

Transcript:  But they have to. They know that they're not on to the next big thing, right?  And so they're trying everything. They're trying cars. They're trying health care.  They're trying education. They're trying...  I think you're probably seeing a lot of that is in health care.  They really think that they've got a good thing going there.  And they think, you know, with 11.3, iOS 11.3, the biggest thing in there, ClassKit is in there,  but the new health record is in there.  And that has the potential. We've done some coverage of this.  That has the potential to be a potential winner for them, at least in the U.S. market,  where it's so bifurcated, not bifurcated, but, you know, not fragmented.  Thank you. Where, you know, in terms of health records and these health systems not being able to share records  and then people not being able to carry their own records with them.  So they have a great opportunity there. They see it.  And I think you see them working more and more with companies that are doing health,  not just health care, but proactive health kind of things from folks like SleepNumber  to other companies that are making health devices.  They're working really closely with a lot of them.  So you have to think that they're making some of these bets where their kind of next sort of big market push could be.

Transcript:  Actually, you know, it's interesting because I'm sure, Georgia, you're doing this too.  Apple has with their Apple Watch a heart health thing.  It's a heart study that they're doing where they're collecting information about heart rate and a fib relation.  What a fib. And I've done this and you can sign up for it.  But Samsung has just announced a new phone that does something very interesting that competes directly with this.  And they're doing a study with UCSF. And I did not realize that Samsung has not touted this.  But the new Samsung Galaxy S9 has apparently not just a heart rate monitor,  which Samsung phones have had for a while where you can put your finger on a little sensor right under the flash and it will tell you what your heart rate is.  But apparently that sensor can also now measure blood pressure.  And that's a big first, something the Apple Watch and the iPhone do not do.  They are partnering with UCSF. They've launched an app which I've been using called My BP Lab,  which apparently allows them to measure blood pressure by the smartphone without any external hardware.  I signed up for it. I need to measure my BP using this phone three times a day.  And then they do questionnaires like, were you in the room with a loved one while you were getting your blood pressure?  Have you had sex lately? Have you called Get Roman? No, they didn't ask me that.  But it was interesting that this is going to be a study.  I don't know if you know anything about this, but this is going to be a study.  It's a three-week study for you.  It would be part of a three-week study that measures not just blood pressure, but sleep, exercise, diet.  And I guess they're trying to look for some sort of correlation, as Apple is doing with the heart rate.

Transcript:  No, I think it's wonderful. I always wonder.  Apple, I maybe perhaps naively trust with my data, and I feel very comfortable with that because we pay a premium for that kind of thing.  And if you're not paying a premium, then you probably are what's making the company money.  I worry about people putting in a lot of information to Samsung because in the end, then, if the government gets their jobs  or your company finds out that you have a heart issue, they may say, you know what?  You're going to be really expensive to us, and we don't want to hire you.  And so I would just read through all of the privacy information before you sign up for something that I did.  I feel like it's OK. Did you actually read through?  Do you read through all of the ULAs and privacy? No.

Transcript:  No, I mean it like no, it's OK. I give you credit to you.  Thank you. And Jason Heiner, who is always welcome on our network.  We love having a monitor. Actually, all of you are editor in chief at Tech Republic.  Great to have you back as well at Jason Heiner on Twitter.  A show today brought to you by Quicken Loans.  We should set off some fireworks, light a candle or something, because Quicken Loans, as of a couple of months ago, became the number one lender in the country.  We've always said number one in your hearts, number one in the JD Power customer satisfaction polls for eight years running for mortgage origination, four years running for mortgage servicing.  I mean, they really are good.  Now they're also the number one lender overall in the country.  And I think I'm going to take some credit for that.  We've been telling you about Quicken Loans for some time.  You know, they're revitalizing Detroit. They've done a great job.  And they also understand that we geeks are a little different.  Maybe it's because we don't understand emotional cues.  I don't know. But we don't.  When we want to buy a house, the last thing you want to do, go to a bank, say, please, sir, can I have a loan?  A loan? Well, fill out this 30 page application and we'll get back to you.  So you fill out the application and then you're not done.  You got to go to the attic, find pay stubs, balance, check statements, all the paperwork, fax it.  Who has a fax machine? Fax it into? I don't have a fax machine.  This was very 18th century, 19th century maybe.  I mean, this is not so Quicken Loans. Look, we can do better.  Dan said we could do. We got computers now.  What if we had a loan approval process you did all online?  You didn't have to go to a bank. You don't have to fill out an application.  You didn't have to go to the attic. You could do it all on your phone or on a computer.  That's when Rocket Mortgage was born.  Good bye paperwork. Do it all at rocketmortgage.com slash twit2.  And what I love about this is completely simple.  Just answer a few questions you already know the answer to.  They have financial, they have partnerships with all the financial institutions.  So with your permission, they get your information and then they crunch the numbers based on your income, your assets, your credit.  They will say, here's the loans you qualify for.  You choose the rate, the term, the down payment, completely transparent, and you've got a loan.  And all of this beginning to end, not including the time it took to put on your pants, eight minutes.  Because you don't have to put on your pants. Eight minutes.  Apply simply, understand fully, mortgage confidently with Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  To get started, in fact, even if you're not in the midst of buying a house right now,  maybe tomorrow you're going to go to an open house or maybe you're going to see something you really like or maybe you want to refi because rates aren't going up.  This would be a good time to refi. To get started, create that account right now.  Rocketmortgage.com slash twit2. Rocketmortgage.com slash twit and the number two.

A couple of stories to wrap things up.  Oh, I had a good one. Oh, this is not a good one, but it's a sad one.  But I should mention, of course, Stephen Hawking passed away this week at the age of 76. Show of hands.  How many of you own a brief history of time? How many of you have actually read it?  Oh, you read it. You read it. Very nice. You read it.  I don't know if I understood everything in it.  I got the illustrated version. So I looked at the pictures. Does that count?  That counts. That counts. 100%. 100%.  I saw the movie, The Theory of Everything. I saw that. I saw. No, it's a, you know, we played a little video on the new screensavers.  I won't do it today. I don't want if you saw that already.  It's beautiful video is put together in honor of Professor Hawking's 75th birthday.  But he was very important, not just to physicists for his theories about black hole and information, but also to all of us because he was such an inspiration.  Here's a guy with a great mind whose body completely failed him. He got ALS in his 20s, lived another 50 years basically unable unable to move.  He could speak only with the help of a computer. In fact, he's very famous for beginning all of his talks with Can You Hear Me in his synthesized voice.  And it became kind of his trademark. Here's a guy whose mind shown so brightly that his body transcended his body.  And I think he was a great inspiration to all of us.  It's a great way to say it.  Yeah, I am. I actually I quoted the poet Wordsworth's words about Isaac Newton.  And I think that they completely appropriately described Stephen Hawking, a mind forever, voyaging through strange worlds alone.  A great man, Stephen Hawking. Sorry to lose him. Not the only person the tech community lost this week.  Adrian Lamo passed away as well. We knew Adrian fairly well. He'd been on. You're not logged into Facebook either, huh, Karsten?  I can't read. This is what happens. You can't read it if you're not on Facebook.  But his father, Mario Lamo, posted these words on on Friday with great sadness and a broken heart after it.  All of Adrian's friends and acquaintances know he is dead. A bright mind and compassionate soul is gone.  He was my beloved song. Lamo was a controversial figure, a hacker who was we often call him the homeless hacker.  Even when we had interviewed him on the new screensavers and the old screensavers, he was always on the road, always peripatetic.  He actually ended his days in Kansas. He had lived in the San Francisco Bay Area for a while and was quite famous for having hacked a number of companies, including Yahoo, The New York Times and Microsoft, not to get in, but merely to show that their security.  In effect, he considered himself a pen tester, that their security was inadequate, although he kind of raised the ire of The New York Times when he added himself to the New York Times editorial board.  That was that was a line too far. The Times went after him and in 2004 he was indicted, turned himself in.  We actually had a conversation with him right before he turned himself in to the FBI. He received a home detention sentence.  He wasn't in prison. And of course, then afterwards was very outspoken activist for hackers, for rights.  And I think a really great guy. Don't know what happened. The Kansas police say it was not foul play.  I fear to learn more. I hope I don't know what his mental state was towards the end.  He had been hospitalized for Asperger's in the past, and he was most controversial because he was the hacker who turned turned in then Bradley Manning, now Chelsea Manning, when she was exfiltrated a bunch of information and put it on WikiLeaks about the US government, some memos and so forth.  I think he I don't know if he regretted it. I think he felt like he didn't have any choice.  He had been talking to Manning on chat rooms, found out what Manning had done and ended up turning her in.  Manning, of course, served seven years in prison and was later her sentence was commuted by President Obama about a year ago or more than a year ago.  So sorry to lose Adrian as well. You know, he's kind of a mixed bag. Yep. Like all of us.

Transcript:  That's that could be a problem down the road as well.  Elizabeth Holmes, CEO of Theranos and Theranos is Theranos is former president.  Sunny Balwani are now being charged by the Securities and Exchange Commission for fraud.  They raised more than seven hundred million dollars, you know, for Theranos.  The SEC alleges they exaggerated and made false statements about the company's technology.  They were supposedly developing a technology for blood testing.  They required just a pinprick, a little dot of blood.  It never did work. And there's some evidence that they knew that for years.  Nevertheless, you know, there will be an investigation at this point.  SEC has filed complaints against Theranos, Elizabeth Holmes and Sunny Balwani,  claiming that Theranos' products were deployed by the US Department of Defense  in the battlefield in Afghanistan on Medevac helicopters.  The company generated more than one hundred million dollars in revenue in 2014.  Oh, they claimed it. I'm sorry. Theranos claimed that they never were deployed  and generated less than one hundred thousand dollars in revenue from operations.

Transcript:  There's a whole bunch of questions here about the viability of Silicon Valley investors.  These people have given this person seven hundred million dollars on the theory.  And you would imagine that they had done some due diligence and actually validated that the claims  were made reasonable. And it's it's obviously clear that any cursory inspection of the technology  would have shown up that they were lying through their teeth.  Yeah, it does really question the validity of the Silicon Valley investment community.  If they cannot actually detect someone who's just flat out lying, exaggerating and then dissembling  for years on years and then to be caught out like this is incredibly embarrassing, I think.

But I go on the other hand, you could look at both Theranos and Uber and say, well, if they succeed, this is going to be a windfall.  And the problem is, you're right, that due diligence.

Transcript:  So the interesting part about this story, I think, Leo, is we're also seeing the same thing happen in Iceland.  So this isn't unique to America.  What is unique about the American story is the lack of infrastructure.  So there's a lot of talk in the press, particularly if you're into data centers like I am.  I get very excited about data centers and discussing them.  But the problem with data centers is that there's not enough.  The American US grid where they distribute electricity across the backbone of the country at megawatts is in such poor condition that they generating the electricity there, but they can't transport it to where it's being consumed.  And that's why it's the cheapest electricity, because it's literally just the hydro plants are producing more electricity than they can put into the grid.  Right.  Because nobody's building the power lines to take the power to where it needs to be.

Start time: 7623.50
End time: 7630.02

Transcript:  There is good news.  I think the Russians are about to take over our grid, and I'm sure one of the first things they'll do is make it more efficient.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure that that's exactly what we're also seeing the same thing happen in Iceland.  So Iceland also because they have the geothermal capability.  So I dropped a link into the chat room.  Have a look at that same story.  The interesting part about this is there's electricity, but these things are also placed in places where there's no networking.  So normal data centers like Amazon or Google can't build data centers there because there's no data infrastructure in place.  Bitcoin doesn't need vast amounts of bandwidth like Google and AWS and Microsoft Azure and those types of people do.  So these are great places to put bit like mining centers because they don't need the high bandwidth, but they do need the power.  So it is actually an interesting infrastructural play.  If you look at the technology of it.

Transcript:  The U.S. is the U.S. is you know, it's funny that the power grid thing hasn't come up in a while in the U.S.  It is still a huge problem.  It's been about five years ago since I went to a big press conference at the White House where their big announcement was, OK, we're making real progress on this power grid stuff.  And they rolled out this huge plan, massive, you know, multi decade plan to upgrade the power grid.  But it's like it's extremely difficult to get updates and not before change the administration even to get updates on like how how is that coming?  How are we doing? Let me guess.  Exactly. But I'm just saying it's a known problem and you it's fallen off the radar.  Even though it's so critical to the future of of our of our infrastructure, infrastructure is melting down.

Start time: 7726.56

Transcript:  It's very difficult, actually, because they're now already predicting the end of the rise that the adoption of new light bulbs, LED bulbs, the low powered devices.  We're seeing computers replaced with smartphones.  You're seeing efficient appliances. So electricity demand is going down.  It's actually flat and declining slightly.  It's flat. Yeah. Yeah.  No, that's interesting.  And increasingly with the arrival of electric vehicles and the tail off of demand, we're actually seeing there's a possibility that CO2 is going to be a happy story.  We're actually seeing drops in the production of CO2.  So if you follow the blue blue energy, they're talking about how the predictions for CO2 production may actually be overly aggressive.  We may actually have some hope to survive climate change if the trends to electric cars and power efficient houses and so forth.

End time: 7831.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, at least here in California, over our power company's dead bodies, they hate the idea of a distributed grid.  Even though they're quasi not for profit organizations, they are ultimately for profit organizations and they don't want to see consumers generating their own power.  So they make it as hard as it possibly could be.

Transcript:  These things will change over time.  They have to.  Yeah.  But the point is that we're talking about in the technology space where I operate, we're talking about this edge computing thing about how today we're moving everything into the data center.  Now we're talking about going out to the edge.  Well, if you start to do the math around edge computing and how everything's going to have computers at the edge, there's not enough power in the world.  But you can generate two kilowatts to run a good sized edge data center just from a couple of solar panels and a couple of bags of batteries.  Right.  If you can run a car.

Everybody will do some generation locally and I think we'll see the emergence of some sort of storage technology where your house will store.  That's the key, isn't it?  Or cities will have a local storage array, whether it's air pumped into an underground reservoir or water pumped up into a tower and then it drops down and acts like a pseudo hydra.  There'll be some sort of, there's dozens of different ways this could work out.  We'll see how it works out over time.

Transcript:  To that effect, one of the coolest things that I learned about recently in the last six months was a company, well-heeled company that's doing some research on floors that actually take the energy of people walking around in the floors and convert that into usable energy.  It's the same process through which the Prius breaks, right?  And it takes that energy and converts it into usable energy.  Well, this takes a battery system similar to like Powerwall, but it takes the floors in your, so they put these into normal floors in the same way that Elon Musk wants to put it into regular shingles.  And so your floors actually can take that energy of people walking, not just in houses, but you can imagine it somewhere like Grand Central Station, right?  And you convert that energy into usable energy.  Super, super cool stuff.

It's loads of fun.

Transcript:  You're the greatest.  Thank you, Greg.  Thank you, everybody, for being here.  We had a great studio audience.  Thank you for joining us.  If you want to be in the studio, just email tickets at twit.tv.  There's no charge.  We'd love to have you.  And we'd like to know you're coming so we don't get surprised.  We thought there were going to be 12 people.  Burke was putting out chairs for 12 people.  I don't know.  We thought there'd be more.  So thank you, you few, you hearty, you brave souls who braved the snow to get here.  I don't know.  Shout out to the Hoosiers, too.  The Hoosiers.  We've got a lot of Hoosiers in the house.
