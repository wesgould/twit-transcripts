Transcript:  This is Twit, This Week in Tech, Episode 44 for March 5th, 2006.  Thank you all so much for being here. We are at the Apple Store in San Francisco, California.  No, we had no idea that Apple was going to make this announcement this week. It's just coincidental.  But we're glad to be here and we've got a great Twit lineup with us.  Starting off to my right with Mr. Roger Chang.  Hey Roger, welcome back to the Apple Store.  Do you wear your Twit hoodie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, it's in the washing machine.  Oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Those will shrink, you know.  To my left, ladies and gentlemen, Steve Wozniak, without whom there would be no Apple Store or Apple Computer at all.  Steve, we're so glad to have you back on the panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Leo, I admire you so much. I always love being with you on these things.  And I promise to try to hold down my toys and jokes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We asked Steve, no laser jokes, although I was wearing the glowing green earring for St. Patrick's Day.  You like that?  Patrick says it's going to destroy the compression algorithms. They're going to go crazy.  I can't do it. I can't do it.  Patrick Dorton is here, my good buddy from the screensavers in DL.TV, where he's bringing it back to life.  And we'll talk about a new show I just saw a pilot for on DLTV.  That's great. Very excited about that.  I hope so.  Also, we're very glad to welcome from CNET's Buzz Out Loud. Is it Buzz Out Loud or Out Loud?  Buzz Out Loud.  Molly Wood, ladies and gentlemen. So glad to have her here.  You may applaud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, stop. You should applaud what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the women are applauding. Finally, they've got some estrogen in them.  It's a darn panel. It's about time.  That's what I thought.  And Roman Loyola is also here, former producer at Tech TV and now at MacAdix Magazine. Great to have you.  That's a cool Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I got it at the mothership store at Apple. But it shouldn't be any indication of my thoughts and feelings about Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you don't necessarily like Apple because you paid $60 for a switch?  I know I love Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, there are about 100 people in the audience with twit toothbrushes. I don't think we can see.  So that's what this is.  Yeah, this we can tech, toothbrushes. It's a twit brush. So I don't think any of them, that would be no implied endorsement just because they brushed their teeth with a twit brush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it an implication about how often they brush their teeth?  It might be.  Are those parts of our computer that we clean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  With a toothbrush.  Yes, so that's what the kind of a brush is.  It could be a computer brush. A keyboard brush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's a good point.  So of course the big story of the week, or at least one of them, there's many.  Actually, maybe not the big story of the week, but it is the story we're going to lead off with is the Apple product announcement.  Molly was down there, I was down there. Were you there? I saw you, that's right, Roman Loyola was down there.  Well, let's start with you, Roman. You're covering it for a Mac publication.  I guess really the story is how the press made such a big deal out of what Apple clearly wanted to be just a little announcement, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean the predictions of what was going to be...  It went crazy.  It was crazy. And, you know, a severe letdown, I believe, is an understatement about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we were guilty of it too. I mean, you know, all Apple said was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Apple just wanted it to be a small little gathering with four or five friends.  So they sent invitations to everyone and every major media outlet in North America.  But it was like, hey, cut big!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sometimes these announcements are, get ready to get your socks blown off.  This time it said, come join us for a few, you know, fun new products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the rumors were not exciting enough to not expect too much anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean everybody...  Added to expectation?  What did people think? It was going to be a video iPod, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think people thought it would be everything from a video iPod to a standalone DVR to the Apple HD TV.  I mean, it doesn't really matter what the invitation says.  It matters that you got an invitation and it's at Apple.  And it said it's going to be a thing. There's going to be a thing. And that's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually did not get our invitation at first.  My man.  Oh, me neither.  I've never gotten an Apple invitation.  And so I felt really left out of, you know, everyone was going to the party.  Oh, he's got the mic.  Ladies and gentlemen, he's here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He brought beer.  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think? Is this Dignation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you ring enough for everyone, Mr. Rose?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It wouldn't be a Kevin Rose show without some beer.  Can we get a mic on Mr. Rose? We do have a mic.  You don't have the fancy mics we do.  I'm so glad to see you.  We thought you weren't going to be here, so we just got started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, this event at Apple, I normally get invited to all the Big Apple events, and I wasn't invited to this one.  Usually I hear from Steve, but I may have actually turned it down  because of a conflict in schedule, and then the conflict erased itself, but I know I wasn't there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, okay, so they announced two new minis, I think overpriced, right?  I mean, by like a couple hundred bucks, this mini, don't you think?  And then, what do you think? I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I like to go to these events, and when they come to the pricing point, I like to try and guess the price.  Yeah.  And my guesses were way under what they actually have the prices at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they actually raised the price of the mini from $4.99 to $5.99.  Why? Because it's Intel? Because it's got a remote control?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they felt they were undercharging for Airport Express and Bluetooth?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Maybe they just didn't want the people who bought the previous versions like me to feel like heels.  Kevin's lawyer is asking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They said the Wi-Fi was hacked, so I guess we can't get on.  Oh yeah, you can't get on. I have something for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Plus, you don't want to. I heard a dirty picture comes up.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  Watch out, everyone.  It's not even dirty. It's so far beyond dirty that you don't even...  Dirty is the coin. It's innocent.  Put your hands in there.  I'm giving Kevin an ethernet wire so that he can plug in.  Yeah, well that was a weird situation.  It was actually kind of cute. There was some guy in the audience, right?  Yeah.  And we were all...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I walked over and looked over his shoulder because there's like 18 people here with computers,  but only one is running 17 command line windows and three in Vi and watching traffic go by.  Two seconds later, the Apple guys are certainly like whispering at him,  and he's like packing up his notebook, disappearing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We could have you arrested, but if you leave now, we won't press charges.  Don't make us look at any more pictures like that.  Oh, it was a nasty picture.  So, okay, so the Mini... I mean, I think this is a good product.  It's a media center, and it really clearly shows that Apple wants to be in the living room  right there next to the high-def TV.  You know, it's good for that. That's a little expensive.  You sound excited about it.  You know, that was the thing. All the press was like depressed afterwards.  It was like, oh, that's all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you forgot the $99 iPod case.  That was hot.  And the $349 portable blue box.  We are in the Apple store.  As somebody who owns like seven iPods, I can look at an iPod case and be like, woo, $99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think you can blame Apple for this. I think they can blame the press for just getting their expectations so high.  I think you can blame Apple for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really? How so?  Well, and I'm not actually even saying that I'm that disappointed with what they announced.  I think the Mac Minis are a pretty good incremental step toward the home media integration.  That is going to be great when it all comes together.  And I guess there's going to be like eventually maybe one piece of hardware or software that ties it all together,  and then we'll all be thrilled.  But I definitely blame Apple for historically creating that kind of expectation and that kind of hype.  Should they not announce it? Should they just slip it out?  Yeah. Why not? Issue a press release.  Don't have Steve do a speech.  Don't have Steve do a speech. Don't say like journalists converge on Cupertino.  We did. I converged.  Create your own traffic jam. Of course we converged.  It hurt so bad when I get an invitation until the second day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But a little bit, it's like a comedian who makes jokes.  You might have ten lousy dud jokes for one good one.  So every once in a while Apple's going to maybe have one.  Something's not too exciting to most of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did think it was exciting.  Was this front row with Ronda, I'm sorry, Bonjour. Even Steve Jobs can't pronounce Bonjour.  By the way, you notice he said PowerBook twice in his speech?  Yes.  So I'm not the only one who can't say MacBook.  Because PowerBook is such a good name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It'll take a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Bonjour that's enabled now in front row means that if I walk into somebody's house  with iTunes running on a Mac or a PC and Wi-Fi,  that any videos or music or photos on there can be displayed in there.  What are you laughing at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just thinking of like, you know, we have the thing.  What we just had happen?  The pictures.  Maybe not that picture.  You know, you walk into the wrong section of the dorms at school and be like, oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have to specifically ask for it.  But I think that that's kind of a neat technology.  Any computer in the house.  Wouldn't you want this as a PC user?  That any computer in the house that has content on it, on the wireless network,  can be seen on the HDTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, I've spent so many years closing off the network  from people who come in and do nefarious things on it.  And I have a public IP address open, Steve.  Don't look at me with horror like that.  I love sharing my internet connection, but I don't particularly need, you know,  my tax information or my banking information floating out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just got a great OS 10 app called Connect 360.  You heard about that?  No, what's that?  It allows you to share all of your pictures and any songs that you have on your Mac  with an Xbox 360.  Really?  Wireless.  Yeah, so it's great.  So I just turn it on and it connects right to my Xbox 360 wirelessly.  Do you have to modify the 360?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's only the Mac.  Yeah, it emulates, it acts like it's a Windows box.  And it works great.  That's very cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that free or is that a commission?  I think it's shareware, but...  That's a great idea.  I think that's the idea, right?  The idea, right, is we have media all over our house and if we can get it where we want  it, that's what everybody wants.  That's the holy grail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So anything better than Elgato for running TV over the Mac Mini?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, because it's DVI.  Now, it's not HDTV, is it, Roman?  No, it's not.  It's DVI, though.  No HDCP, no copy protection.  We'll talk about that a little bit later on.  I think that's a huge scandal.  It's brewing.  We've talked about it a couple of times on Twitter, but I want to bring it up again.  What about these speakers?  Steve Jobs says, this is where I went a little overboard.  I spent a lot of money.  I don't want to tell you how much money on a stereo.  I'm getting rid of my expensive stereo for these speakers.  I'm going to wait outside when that happens.  Where's the back door, Steve?  I'm ready for that old stereo.  Somehow I don't think the rebel speakers are coming flying out the window.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At any time soon.  The only statement he made that might be more unlikely than that was the comment that  people would buy several of them at $350.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It won't bother because they won't like two, so it does really look like a stereo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  So it looks like a real stereo.  I feel like the iPod Hi-Fi, I actually have been wanting a good kind of an iPod speaker  for a long time.  That one I probably won't buy because it is $350, but I also almost felt like that was  kind of a Steve Vanity product a little bit because he is such an audiophile.  I think people do want good sounding iPod speakers, but the people who have been waiting  for that possibly already bought it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to judge the sound quality.  If he said you have to listen to them at high volume to judge it, I'm sorry.  People that know you listen to it at low volume with your eyes shut, does it sound like the  real thing to judge speakers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  The classical did not sound particularly good.  The rock and pop was fine.  I think you told me that.  Yeah.  I learned up and listened and I agree with you.  It was not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Everything, we listened to a bunch of classical music in the demo rooms, and I'm sure these  classical songs were at 128-bit.  Well, that's the other thing.  I'm an audiophile.  Let me put my 128-bit song up and see what it sounds like.  All the classicals sounded crunch.  It just didn't sound good.  So they even bothered trying to put in a line input or nothing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, there is a line input.  There is a line input.  But no, no, I mean like to demo, to say how great it is.  Well, that was the thing.  They had these demo rooms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One was set up as a dorm room that actually had pants on the floor.  You know what it had?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It had an autographed flogging Molly t-shirt.  Yeah, they did.  Now, I think that made it pretty authentic, right?  That's a beautiful thing.  I almost stole it for you, Patrick.  I appreciate that.  I tried to, but they stopped me.  So I asked Jaws, who is the worldwide product manager for iPod, if they had the in-house  engineering, I mean, designing speakers is a specialty.  And he said, no, we design this in-house.  Do you think that, Waws, that these guys are good enough to design high-end stereo speakers  in-house?  No, I absolutely believe so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I believe that normally the quality control driven by Steve himself would be there unless  he was too busy with the Pixar Disney deal.  But the trouble is the first thing comes to speakers and the second is your environment.  So to get really good quality sound somewhere like at home takes a lot more than just good  speakers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no separation either.  I mean, they're in a shoebox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the most plausible scenarios for those were definitely the upstairs rooms were an  office and a living room and the dorm room and the kitchen.  And the most plausible scenarios were the dorm room and the kitchen by far.  I mean, if you're going to put that thing anywhere, it's not going to replace your own stereo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boombox runs on the DCels.  I mean, I'm mobile, but that's just a little more than me, my size.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's hard to pass it as a really high-end unit, though, when it runs off batteries as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's something weird about that.  It turns around and it works on DCels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Some people like DC-powered systems because it allows them more control over the actual  voltage flowing into the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But those people would use car batteries, right?  They would use bigger ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I see what you're saying because it also has handles.  High-end stereo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's got to be able to carry it on your shoulder.  What's this like?  It's a nice chest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That'll hurt you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does the iPod get secured into the top so if you do kind of swing?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want that, you know what you should get, and I think they even sound better and  they're cheaper, is the Altic Lansing IM7s.  The iPod goes right into it.  It's a great sounding Boombox with a handle.  It even comes with kind of an S&M strap, leather strap.  Have you seen that?  Not the S&M part.  I brought it home.  My wife said, honey, you got something to share with me?  It looks like it's got two little collars, little leather collars that go on either end  of the strap, and it turns it into a carry.  But that Altic Lansing is a nice...  That is a nice speaker system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds great.  I've seen it on a lot of television shows as well.  Really?  Yeah.  I think I saw it recently on Las Vegas.  Now, we wanted to get you on Steve Last week.  Just a little aside.  Just a little something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You see a lot of Macs on TV shows.  Yes.  I think a lot of TV screenwriters and producers are Mac fans, and they just do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's partly product placement, though, because a lot of times you'll see a little  courtesy of Apple at the end of the show.  Is it still...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On 24, all the good guys used Macs and all the bad guys used PCs.  Is that still that way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This season, it's all over the map.  I think Jack Bowers had a different cell phone every episode.  Courtesy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not that I watch a lot of TV.  You know.  I wanted to get Steve on last week to talk about this.  You were down in New Zealand and got interviewed in the New Zealand Herald by a guy named Peter  Nowak, who quoted you, and it made headlines everywhere.  Steve Wozniak, Apple's other Steve, says the Intel move was a bad idea.  Apple's going in the wrong direction.  Big headlines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know what?  I take phone calls.  I talk to reporters whenever I have time.  I'm real accessible and open.  I read those headlines, and I was just shocked.  It's 180 degrees.  There were at least two categories of headlines that were 180 degrees different than how I  think, how I speak to other people, how everyone close to me knows.  On my Macintosh forums, what I type and say, it's like they got it all wrong.  So I racially accused the reporter of being a jerk with his own agenda.  He kept wanting to try to push.  Steve Wozniak is against Apple doing this.  Steve Wozniak, they're not Apple.  There's been a lot of press over all the years that want to find these things, and sometimes  I will discuss subjects.  Unfortunately, I talk in like 30-second complex thoughts sometimes, and everybody wants their  five-second headline.  I explained to him, for example, that he said I wanted to, yeah, I'm against the move to  Intel.  I've always been for the move to Intel.  It makes sense for good reasons.  The most negative thing I've said is I was hoping it would be something like a new technology,  like IBM's copper technology was once, so it will extend through the generations.  That's the most negative thing I've ever said.  Then he said, well, isn't there sort of a thing with Mac users that is against Big Brother,  against the big bad evil empire?  I said, yes, because I'm on forums, and I know there's a lot of Mac zealots, and I'm  not one of them.  I used the word we to try to explain to him how there's a lot of thinking like this, but  I am not one of them.  I even said nice things, very nice things about Microsoft in the article.  Figure that out.  It doesn't match a headline saying Steve thinks Apple's move to Intel is wrong.  That's totally inaccurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've interviewed you a lot, and I know that one of the reasons I like to interview you  is you're not guarded in your statements.  You're very open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I got lucky.  In this case, I got lucky.  Sometimes you don't really have a recourse through the press, and somehow a few of my  comments got reported by other reporters, and this reporter printed verbatim the whole  transcript of what I'd said to him.  And I read it.  And yes, it's very intelligent, it's logical, and it makes sense.  So you stand by the transcript.  And I stand by the transcript, and he says the transcript proves him right.  It proves him wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You just have to read more than five seconds.  We'll put a link and let other people be the judge.  I mean, it wouldn't be the first time that the press has mispronounced something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As a matter of fact, I don't hold it against the reporter, really, because reporters have  to make mistakes, and they're in a hurry, and they have a business, and sometimes they  don't realize that their question has sort of led into a comment that never would have  been made, and they print part of your words.  But it's not necessarily deliberate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So for the record, what do you think of Apple's direction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  As far as, oh, I think that, what do you mean?  I think the computers are great, and I think the iPod is great.  And I think the move to Intel is a good smart move for the right reasons.  I've even said it and explained what the reasons are from the start, from the very start.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was freaking out with the move to Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are some big Macintoshes.  Hell, it's everywhere I go.  I'm around strong Macintosh people.  Oh, no, this must be bad.  We're getting in line with Microsoft somehow.  Microsoft's not even a bad guy.  They even want to be more like Apple and be creative, and they want to...  There's no evil.  I know some people in Microsoft.  There's no evil anywhere.  I don't like to say bad things about people, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Before the show, we were watching a video on YouTube that purports to be a leaked video of the Origami project,  which Microsoft has been...  There's something new.  It's very cryptic.  I saw that.  What do you think the Origami is?  Have you seen the movie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, it might be this little device that they're showing off.  I mean, you're talking about that same one.  It looks kind of like a PSP slash...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a little bigger, though, and that's the problem, at least in the concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know, man.  I have the Trio 700 with the pocket, whatever they're calling it now, 2006 or whatever it is.  I'm not a huge fan of miniaturized Microsoft OSes.  What about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at this.  This is Mobile 5.  This is a Sprint PCS.  This is the 6700.  And what OS is it running?  It's Mobile 5, Windows Mobile 5.  Yeah, that's what mine is, too.  The power is...  It's not charged, but the keyboard's nice.  How do you like the screen?  The keyboard is nice.  I thought I charged it before I came down here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's Sprint, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then you're stuck with Sprint.  Yeah, and it's got a little antenna sticking out.  Well, there's another one I'm going to get to from T-Mobile that doesn't have an antenna sticking out.  Very similar form back there.  Nice.  I think that's...  Do you like the keyboard as it is in the 700?  I think that's about the right size, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you're talking about a small device that you can check email on and pull up the occasional web page.  But anything more than that, and I think these devices are really lacking in a lot of areas.  You really can't do a whole lot with them.  You can listen to music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know why I got this is because the Slingbox at home, right?  Hooked up to the TiVo and the cable.  Right.  And they now have a Windows Mobile client.  How does it work?  Is it choppy or is it...  Sling Media Mobile?  No, it's pretty...  Well, if you're in an Edge or an EVDO area where you're getting 400 or 500 kilobits, it's good.  Looks good.  You can watch your home...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you still have to pay...  I mean, there's an unlimited plan now, right?  Data-wise?  Yeah, that's the key.  It's got to be with a company.  It's like 600 bucks a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, T-Mobile has unlimited, and Sprint does.  Verizon still doesn't and all the things.  So that's the key.  You've got to find a carrier.  Otherwise, yeah, you'd be paying by the minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Verizon has unlimited, but it's really expensive.  Sprint, actually, for whatever else you can say about them, their unlimited data plan,  I think, is the cheapest.  It's the cheapest.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  T-Mobile's like 49.  Verizon's 60 or something like that.  Yeah, it was 80, and it came all the way down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And this is also on top of your regular cell phone bill.  Yeah.  Unless you have an Edge card that you use in your notebook.  Well, then that's 60 and 5.  Yeah.  $500, 120, 150 to 200.  What's the most you ever paid to get a contract canceled, Kevin?  Because at one point, you were like jumping providers every three weeks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm hooked on cell phones.  I like the cool cell phones.  And sometimes, I've seen the actual pictures of the new sidekicks.  Those look cool.  The three?  They're smaller.  They're slimmer.  Yeah.  I'm a big fan of the sidekick.  It's just too bulky for me right now.  Is that soon?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know when it's going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Will they still be tied to T-Mobile?  I don't know.  I haven't heard much about the new sidekick.  I'm waiting for the Motorola Q, which I hear they keep changing a lot, but it's based on  the Razr, and it's going to be a little smartphone.  That's very cool.  I am skeptical, though, about Windows Mobile.  I have the Trio 600.  I haven't upgraded to the 650, but I'm pretty happy with the Palm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see that there's a log posting somebody did on how to get out of a contract?  Now you tell me.  Well, I don't know if you want to do it.  roaming.  And I think that's the key.  I think that's the key.  I think that's the key.  I think that's the key.  I think that's the key.  I think that's the key.  So the key is to make it so painful for the company in roaming charges that they kick  you off.  In fact, the guy showed his singular bill or his contract, and it says very specifically,  if at any point we end up paying more in roaming charges than you're paying us, we have the  right to terminate your contract.  So he says what you do is you just make a point.  For every 400 minutes you spend on their network, you go spend on somebody else's network.  And eventually you're going to get a call saying, we don't really need you anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you for that.  That's funny.  That's like David Breger.  He's really cheap when it comes to this kind of stuff.  So he bought a phone in Rhode Island so that his nights and weekends start three hours  earlier.  That's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a great hack.  I know.  That's clever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I keep wondering, who's this guy calling me from 401?  It's him.  It's him.  Nights and weekends.  But what do people in Rhode Island do?  They buy a phone from London?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're doomed.  Then you end up paying $4 a minute.  Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, this is kind of interesting because this whole conversation shows what the biggest  problem is with Origami because we're so much more interested in talking about cell phones  and cell phone plans.  No phone.  If that thing is just a laptop replacement and I can't make calls from it, then I've  still got that one device.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks like a shrunk tablet PC, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you looked at Microsoft's sort of like viral advertising site they've put together  for it?  OrigamiProject.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's silly.  Now, week two is up, I think.  Or is week three up now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it shows you all of the places Origami will be, mountaintops and Ferris wheels.  I think they're trying to get that Apple kind of buzz going, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they had it for a second and then they couldn't maintain their own secrecy and they  just got all excited and then told the press, yes, it's a mini tablet.  Yay.  They did a fairly good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now you blew it.  They did a fairly good job, though, with the Xbox 360 and leaking pictures of that and  getting hype around that product.  But yeah, they blew it with this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they kind of blew it with the 360, too, really.  Oh, God, who would have decided over that?  Yes.  But then they couldn't buy it.  That's the part they blew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As long as it better fold in some fashion.  Yeah, otherwise, why origami?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe it's paper.  Maybe it's made out of paper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It folds all of your other portable devices into one lockdown Microsoft thing.  This is so anti-Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The title of the browser window is, hi there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hi there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hi.  The one thing that seems a little promising is if you watch the week two video, there's  a potential placement on the dashboard of a car, which indicates that it could have  GPS built in, which I might not mind seeing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's imminent.  I think you're going to see cell phones with GPS exposed and nav software, turn by turn  direction software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you're on certain cell phone carry nets, it'll be locked down into that cell  phone carry net so you can use their mapping system at $4 a minute.  But nobody else is.  Yeah, you're right.  You're so right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll figure out a way to cripple that Bluetooth functionality.  So do I have to touch this thing that says touch me to get the device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all about Howard forums.  Hack your cell phone.  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This has got to be the worst thing to do on a podcast is to look at something and go,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  ooh.  And for everyone to just stare at it and not talk.  Just stare at it and not talk.  Sorry, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's like Flash put together by somebody's pretentious little brother.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I bet you this was actually just a marketing exercise and someone came along and said,  maybe we should attach a product to it.  Yeah, more power to Microsoft.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We don't have a product, but we've got a great marketing campaign.  I think they did accomplish some pretty good buzz for a little while, for a brief moment

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in time.  I was asked to talk on CNBC about it.  Really?  When's the last time you gave a press interview about anything Microsoft was doing?  We just figured out the timing on the Apple announcement was because they wanted to just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  stomp on origami.  That's what I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really what I thought was going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Even underwhelmed.  We're more excited about that than we are about origami.  It's true, though.  We got a $99 leather case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Quick!

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's hot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do we got to see if you can talk about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Microsoft has announced that there will be six versions of Vista.  Two for business, three for residential users, one for emerging markets.  But here's the beauty of it.  If you buy one of them, you can upgrade online to any other version.  What if you don't like it?  For a nominal fee.  Oh.  Try before you buy?  Microsoft contended the Vista lineup will enable users to easily accomplish tasks.  I'm not kidding.  Find what they want.  Enjoy entertainment.  So thanks for you.  Stay connected at home or on the go.  And help ensure PCs run smoothly and securely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  All right.  It's funny, as I was reading Mary Jo Foley, who's at Microsoft Watch, she pointed out  there's currently six different...  I'm reading verbatim, so let me say that.  I like her a lot.  She's actually good.  She has insane connections at Microsoft.  But Microsoft currently offers six different versions of Windows XP.  XP Home, Professional, Media Center, Tablet PC, and Professional X64, and the Windows XP N edition.  So it's still four more versions than probably anybody really needs.  And you know what?  Nobody cares, including me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's really only four consumer versions, right?  Did you say one is Enterprise and one is N, which is the European market only?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Which is the get by the courts in Europe for bundling their browser with their OS.  Right, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's actually the same as XP, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pretty much.  So it sounds, I mean, once again, it's just their marketing problem, which sounds a lot  worse than it is.  There's no Windows Vista Tablet PC edition.  Maybe that's the Windows Vista Origami Tablet Browsing in the Toilet PC edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll take two.  Does this tablet have battery life?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not really offended by all the offerings, because any piece of hardware you buy, you  usually have a few variations, at least a computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think if there really only are four editions, that's not that different than XP.  For a while they were talking seven.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a little outrageous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that was actually another weird little Microsoft thing where the seven different  or eight different versions appeared on a website and then they were gone.  They were pulled down.  It was almost like a test.  Right.  Like the Origami video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See what people would say.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, if you break down what you said that Vista's going to be able to do, it just translates  to fun and new.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're shipping with all the bits, right?  All it is is just a quick little switch and it turns into a different version.  That's what they're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's been their policy in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So just buy the cheapest one and find the hack and done deal.  That's what people are going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what they say.  It'll be four operating systems in a single disk package.  Once installed, a quick trip to the control panel is all you'll need to visit the Windows  Anytime Upgrade Wizard.  Oh nice.  And then you can go from Home Basic all the way to Ultimate.  Ultimate.  Ultimate.  Ultimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Vista Ultimate.  Sounds like bloatware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's awesome.  But is the one below that the Penultimate?  I want Windows Vista Penultimate.  I don't know.  See the Pope got an iPod by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And taking a hard left turn in his own room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of the Pope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He got a two gigabyte nano.  He doesn't have a lot of musical.  Maybe not a lot of money.  Maybe, you know, maybe he has the sermons on him.  I think that's what it was.  He repeated verbatim.  Vatican Radio gave it to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Because there is a Vatican podcast, I think.  Yeah, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not the Catholic insider though.  The Popecast.  That's not an official.  I love the Catholic insider.  Does he subscribe to Twitch?  Possibly.  You know, let's send him a four gig nano with twit on it.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I'm going to choose between the two gig with some Catholic stuff on it or the four

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  gig with twit on it.  I'll take a twit.  Oh, he's not Italian.  I'm sorry.  He's German now.  But I think once you become the Pope, you start to talk like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do we get a planetary indulgence with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why is it this show?  We refer to the Pope more than maybe some computer operating systems.  I don't know what it is about this show.  So now Queen Elizabeth has an iPod.  President Bush has an iPod.  Pope Benedict has an iPod.  So that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  They're adopting technology.  Do you want them to be listening through a 20 year old Walkman or something?  Don't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Be careful.  The white headphones go very well with the Casic, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can hide it under the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who's going to be the first to do one of those iPod ads with the Pope?  SNL.  Yeah, you're right.  So good news, just as we go to press, because we're taping this on Friday, that the RIM  deal is done with NTP.  You must be happy as an inventor was to see that NTP got $617 million.  They got the license fee.  I don't know my own estimates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just the number of people I know that use BlackBerry is satisfied with them and how  much they sell for.  I thought that was a high settlement.  It seems high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's only, what, $1 million, $2 million?  It's not a whole lot of BlackBerry users in the U.S.  It's a small number.  Three?  So it's better than a billion, which is what some of the analysts said it was going to  do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not much more than the...  I think it was $450 million was the proposed settlement that fell apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  $160 million here or there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Does anyone here think that they were kind of...  They paid out that much because they were kind of, you know, well...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They would have settled for a few hundred million less if they'd done it, you know,  multiple years ago at the beginning of this debacle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they really thought those patents were going to be thrown out and that the judge  was going to wait for those to go all the way through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and I think that's the key, is that even though two days before the hearing, one  of the patents was invalidated, the judge still said, you shouldn't be here.  This should have been settled.  I want you to go settle it.  And I think they really realized we are at risk of being forced into a settlement here  regardless of the patent.  In fact, this settlement is regardless of the patents, even if the rest of them are overturned,  they still get the money.  So I think you're probably right.  This is going to happen.  At least the feds are happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bill Cosby.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know this story?  Waxie Links.  Do you ever go to Waxie Links?  I love Waxie Links.  I do.  It's a great site.  Waxie.org.  What is it?  It's just like great random links.  Pretty much.  The guy who does it, Andy Bio, no relation to Scott.  I don't think.  Farmer.  He is fighting the Cosby clan.  He runs, actually I think this is an interesting story.  He is running some Cosby parodies.  Was.  Was.  No, he still is.  They're called the House of Cosbys.  And Cosby, the Cosby whatever, the state, he's not dead.  What are they, the holders of the Cosby license.  The legal team.  The legal team has been writing letters to other websites and  has gotten to take it down.  But Bio said, no I'm not going to take it down.  And this is his point, and I think it's a good point.  He says, this is in a way discriminating against bloggers.  Because you know, Saturday Night Live does Cosby parodies.  Cosby parodies, this is parody.  It's protected.  There's plenty of parodies in mainstream media.  Why are they going after me?  And I think that's a very good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well what do they accuse them of?  First Amendment says if the person is well known, they can  do anything they want, say any lies they want about them.  And it's legal as long as their intent was not to hurt them.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a quote from Bio, more than anything that strikes me  as a special kind of discrimination against amateur  creators on the internet.  Mad Magazine, Saturday Night Live, South Park, The Simpsons,  Family Guy, and countless other mainstream media sources have  parodied Bill Cosby over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the key seems to be where he says it takes so little  effort to threaten a small web based artist.  And that was exactly the chilling effect of the DMCA too,  which is you can just come along and say this violates the DMCA  or it's, you know, here's a C&D.  And most websites don't have anywhere near the kind of  resources to put up a fight.  So they just pulled.  Or their ISP shuts them down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or their ISP, yeah, exactly.  Because a lot of, in the early days, a lot of people are  citing that you're in violation of the Digital Money and  Copyright Act and we can lock you up forever.  And it's like there was no copy protection on the thing  they're supposedly exploiting, which means that they're  exploiting, which means it has nothing to do with the DMCA.  But ISPs were still yanking people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's just that way in general.  If you have a company that pays for lawyers by the pound goes  after you, you've got to think twice about fighting it.  Is that tort reform?  What is that?  I mean, what do we need to do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, have you ever seen the chilling effects.org?  It's a great website.  I love that site.  And it just tracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And give them money is one way to start.  And EFF is good about defending people as well.  I think one of them will help somebody pay to fight it.  Because I think what you need is a couple of test cases,  a couple of precedent cases where somebody actually does  fight back and they win.  And then it's not as easy to basically just threaten them  out of existence.  Correct me if I'm wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I believe that Canada, certainly Canada is a less  litigious environment.  I think one of the reasons is that if you sue and you lose,  you owe court costs.  Yeah, I think that's British court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think that that's maybe one way to do that.  This is one that, Kevin, you may not like this.  If Kevin Mitnick were here, I know he wouldn't like this.  The FCC is investigating those caller spoofing sites.  I know a few friends.  Well, then we talked about this.  In fact, the last time you were on, I think we talked about  caller spoofing sites.  We probably did.  Yeah.  These are those sites you go and you can call from any phone  number you choose, the White House or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I've never done that because even though it's accessible  to me, it's too easy a prank.  My pranks have to be worthy.  And it's just anybody will think, oh, I'll give them a call  from the police or something.  And I've always thought about calling somebody at work from  their home phone.  That's the only one I would maybe go that far.  I got a call once from my home phone, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My husband was fooling around with Voice over IP.  I'm just saying if the FCC gets its way with those spoofing  sites, then VoIP is next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's actually pretty dangerous, though.  I mean, you can, a friend of mine actually tried to get into  his own voicemail by spoofing sites.  He's been spoofing voicemail by spoofing his own number.  And a lot of voicemail systems and providers won't check and  won't ask you for a password as long as you're calling from  your own line.  Right.  So when that happens, you can easily break into anybody  else's voicemail.  So it's...  Eww.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't think of that.  So put a password on and make sure that your provider  requires it.  Right.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What I'm told, there is real information on the line that  comes to every phone about what number it came from.  But that doesn't show.  It's not part of the voice, the ID system.  The caller ID system.  So they could tell.  There's a real one, so I don't know which one.  I would think they would use the real one.  Yeah, they need to patch that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I forget what it's called.  And the reason that this, this is what Kevin Mitnick told us  was that this is actually a feature.  It's intentional so that a large organization can have one  phone number as its outgoing number.  The New York Times, you know, will have one phone number as  its outgoing number no matter what the reporter is  calling from.  The FCC says they're investigating whether it violates  the Federal Communications Act by failing to send accurate  originating calling party telephone number information  on your state calls.  But then if that's the case, then when you get, when  Microsoft calls and it's all the same number, they'd be  violating the law too, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And telemarketers get to where they get a whole ton of area  codes in every state and they just assign a different area  code to the caller ID, different number every time  they call you.  Yeah.  Rather than paying attention to the do not call whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a case now, one of the sites is run by a 21-year-old  kid, Tela Spoof, and he says he's looking for a lawyer.  So poor kid.  He says, I'm not giving the FCC anything.  I don't know if this is one where I would donate to save  this.  Well, I think they've made a lot of money.  Most of them don't do it for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They'll charge you X number of cents per minute.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you see Senator Wyden's bill?  Has anybody taken a look at that?  He's my new hero.  I like this.  Ron Wyden of Oregon.  Yeah.  What's that?  Network operators will be barred from blocking or  degrading Internet connections and favoring those of companies  that pay for happier access.  In other words, no two tier Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right on, Ron.  Plus it doesn't have a really clever acronym.  You know what I mean?  Internet Non-Discrimination Act of 2006.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Except we've got two tiered Internet right now where people  don't get served by their local phone company with DSL because  they're too far from that.  Too far from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  But that's a technical reason, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but it could easily be.  I mean, you couldn't be denied a phone, but you can be denied DSL.  Right.  So there's a difference.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I'm more comfortable with them having issues with the  distance they can send DSL out over copper than I am with  somebody going, we'd like to charge the people who provide  you with content after we've charged you and spend lots of  money building a...  Right.  And after we've already charged them, the people are  providing the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But how different is this, though, than when I sign up for  DSL, I get different speed options at different prices?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I'm OK with it being different speed options at  different prices at my option to buy in.  However, if I'm saying, if I'm paying X number of dollars a  month for this service level, and I'm not even going to get  into the issue of package shaping, which is my new  personal favorite pain in the ass on the internet right now.  This is where they block BitTorrent because they don't  want you using them.  No, not even package shaping, or they degrade, they basically  look at it and say, if it's this set of packets, they slow it  down, or they take your IP address and they look at the  amount of traffic you use at a particular service or particular  application, and if it gets over to the level they decide,  it just tapers off your access.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick, that's always been the case where we signed up for  service without knowing how much we get a certain speed from our  home, but we don't know how much the ISP can handle, how many  homes they're handling, what data paths.  So we never really knew for sure what throughput you could get.  I think what's different about this is that they've already

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  charged the content providers and they've already charged the  consumers, and rather than raising the price of broadband,  rather than just saying to the content providers, OK,  unfortunately you have to pay more because broadband costs  more, they're saying you have to pay more to make sure that  you're delivered in a timely fashion, even though they've  already paid, and it raises the specter that they'll degrade the  service of people who don't pay, and on top of that, the reason  they want to do it partly is that they want to deliver their  own content, so there's sort of a huge conflict of interest  element there.  Verizon is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if it does cost more to deliver, you know, reliably,  rapidly, then the price should be higher.  Then raise the prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Raise it up in the upfront process of just charging them

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  on the back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Raise the prices of access.  Don't say, you know, you have to pay more to prioritize your  delivery when you're already paying for delivery.  Just raise the cost of delivery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It should be a bunch of R-box going, hey, we got the COPPA,  we got the last mile, you want to serve your customers?  Give us a little something on the side, you know what I mean?  And it's like, you know, they want to do exactly what they  said.  We built the network, we own the network.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody's got to go along with what we're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And what's disingenuous about it is that they're trying to say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that content providers are currently getting a free,  you hear that a lot, Google's getting a free ride and they're  just freeloading on our backbone, which is ridiculous.  They're paying.  No, the consumers built the network, the subscribers built

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the network.  They paid for the network.  They paid for the network.  Well, I think that you get paid.  The consumers pay and the content providers pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're getting paid on both ends and they just want to get  paid again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could get rid of spam if only the providers paid.  We're going to get to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually a good story.  Spammers pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Spammers pay for spam.  The whole AOL email thing is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, should we go to it now?  Have you seen the audio broadcast flag bill that was  introduced?  That's the other one.  All right, we'll get to that in a second since the AOL thing  is so closely related to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, I have to say, I'm on the side of AOL on this one, but  I'd like to hear what you guys think because there's some very  heavy people fighting against them.  AOL and Yahoo plans to do this eventually, but I think that  they're going to have to do it.  AOL has gone to a company called Good Mail and the idea is that  Good Mail certifies mass mailers.  So let's say you're the American Red Cross, one of the  companies that has signed up for this.  You send out a lot of mail.  It's legitimate mail, but it's often tagged as spam.  You want to make sure that it gets through to the people who  ask for this mail.  You also have a secondary problem in this case of people  posing as the American Red Cross, fishers, pretending  they're the American Red Cross.  So Good Mail, what Good Mail does is it certifies that this  mail came from the American Red Cross and that in fact it's  not spam.  Now, American Red Cross will pay a small fee, about a quarter  of a cent per email for this, or any mass mailer can do this.  AOL is saying, we want to use this system.  It's not going to replace spam filtering.  People don't have to pay to get mail through the AOL system,  but we think this is a way that we can let companies that want  to do mass mail, like Google, Google, Google, Google, Google,  Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google, Google,  companies that want to do legitimate mass mailing, not be  branded as spammers.  Well, I think you have to say, do you trust Good Mail to  certify this?  But the EFF is against it.  Michael Geist, who is a really great guy for these rights at  University of Toronto, we actually were, you're on to  Ottawa, we were going to get him on a triangulation on this  at some point.  Cory Doctorow, a lot of the people that we like and respect  say this is a terrible idea because this is the beginning of  a paid email system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like crack by crack.  Spammers are going to be legitimized.  We don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But what if it's, there are people who send legitimate  mass mailings who aren't spammers, right?  Who will then?  Is all mass mail spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I pretty much treat it that way.  It's, I mean, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what if it's your, for example, what if it's your bank  statement from your bank?  I mean, a bank potentially could be considered a mass mailer  because they send out a statement to millions of people  every week, every month.  Should they have to then pay extra to make sure  that that's delivered?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's good, but who's going to decide  who is exactly the man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's where it gets kind of messy.  And how many mails constitute mass mail?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good Mail says very clearly, we are going to only certify  people who are sending mail out that's been requested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the President can certify anyone he wants.  Well, yeah, I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I guess it comes down to do you trust Good Mail?  But let's say you do trust Good Mail.  Is there anything wrong with this?  Because I don't think people are attacking Good Mail, per se.  They're attacking the notion of paid email in general.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I mean, you can consider the slippery slope where it's,  you know, that point where, yeah, OK, these companies are  going to pay Good Mail to certify their mail.  Well, what's next?  I mean, eventually it's going to get to the point of, well,  maybe if you want your email to get there sometime  in the afternoon instead of tomorrow at the end of the week,  you can pay us and we'll guarantee a quality of service  for the email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's the same argument as the two-tiered internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the problem is that you have a lot of companies that  need to deliver this mail, but the spam filters are picking up  and blocking it.  I mean, we run into the same problem at Digg.  We send out so many new...  People request a new account.  We make them verify via email.  So we send out an email to that address that they've requested.  But sometimes it gets put into the spam bin because, you know,  there's all these services that have these advanced algorithms  now that will go in and flag it as spam and get rid of it,  even though the user requested that email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have that problem too, sending out approvals on  twit.tv.  And Pixelcore has a 250,000-person mailing list.  These are people who will ask to be contacted by Pixelcore.  It's not spam.  It's getting to the point where you can no longer send out  mass mailings.  Well, then what do you do if you're in the position of not

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  being able to afford or not wanting to pay a penny per email  to send that?  Then what happens is you find yourself in a situation where  the guaranteed mail that you're guaranteed to get is sent  all spam because they're the people who can afford to pay  to send out the emails.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Unless you use spam or rest or some other...  Well, and that's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this certified email, will they allow spam?  A good mail says, no, no, we're not going to allow  spammers access to this.  This is for legitimate mass mail.  And that's silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come on.  Spammers can get around anything.  Maybe.  They'll find a way to get themselves through.  The website...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not around spam or rest.  Not around the query response systems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If you want to...  Yeah, no, that's true.  But I think that's not...  You'd have to run that then on top of AOL and Yahoo.  And then you're sort of...  You're not going to send spammers to try to stop spam.  The website is dearaol.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you want to sign the petition, stop AOL's email tax.  This is the letter they write.  This system would create a two-tiered internet in which  affluent mass emailers...  Notice they don't say spammers, but affluent mass emailers  could pay AOL a fee that amounts to an email tax in return  for a guarantee that such messages would bypass spam  filters and go directly to the inboxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One interesting thing to note is that AOL today said  they would not charge nonprofits.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because that was the big...  They're going to support nonprofits.  But you look at...  I mean, it's interesting who's on this.  I mean, you've got EFF.  You've got Move On has been very active in this.  A lot of charities like Oxfam are involved.  A gun rights lobby, Chris Perillo.  He's a nonprofit.  Chris Perillo and the NRA.  And the NRA.  Together at last.  And Phyllis.  So it's an interesting mixed bag of people who are  on this petition.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What this is essentially is a business opportunity  for good mail systems.  I mean, if you look at the front page of good mail system,  it's really funny because it links to their  Get the Facts page.  And it's like, fact, AOL and Yahoo are not taxing email.  Well, that's in response to all this.  A tax is, yeah, something one is required to pay.  Taxes are uniformly imposed charges.  But it's like, okay, great.  So if I send out a whole lot of emails,  because I'm a corporate entity,  I can choose to pay a quarter of a cent to one cent  per email I send out to ensure that they will receive  AOL and Yahoo customers.  If we did AOL and Yahoo in Google,  we could have a really nice trifecta of a huge percentage  of the email accounts in North America.  And it's like, are you comfortable with the idea  that the people who have to...  You like that song?  Somebody's got the country going.  Yee-haw!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're closing up.  It's rock out time.  You know what I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it's like, it's a little, you know...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's legitimate, fine.  But at that price, it still makes profit for spammers.  It really, I think, does come down to  do you trust good mail, and do you trust AOL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I think the concern is that AOL,  this is one of the things they say,  well, as soon as AOL gets more money for some kinds of mail,  they're going to encourage that kind of mail  and not discourage the other kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it hurts the small businesses,  because if you think about it,  like, let's say they do a good job, you know,  and not a whole lot of spammers get access to the system  and it's working,  but then you have the small businesses that have,  you know, they want to send out 10,000 emails.  They don't make a whole lot of money.  Are they going to be able to afford to pay that tax?  I mean, it might be cheap enough,  but it's just another expense that they really don't need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think there's also the case to be made  that no spammer is going to pay  even a quarter of a cent per email,  because it's not so lucrative.  I don't know.  Spam's not so lucrative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not, but I think they would pay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it is, but in the masses, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, if you're sending a million,  which they routinely do, a million emails a day,  that's a significant amount.  25,000 a day to send these emails?  What is it?  No, maybe it's not quite that much.  A quarter of a...  I don't know.  You might be right.  I think that many people have said  if there were any costs to this,  spammers would fold up their tents.  The reason spam works is because it's essentially free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you've got to remember,  this is not stopping spam.  This is just guaranteeing a free ride through spam filters.  Right.  But that's my point,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  is that no spammer will pay for this.  That only a legitimate company will pay for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if you were a spammer, though,  consider that suddenly you would have free  and unrestricted access to inboxes  that were previously being filtered by spam filters.  It's possible that you might decide  that the opportunity for increased visibility  was actually worth the cost  and I don't want to be in a position  where I'm allowing spammers to pay  for a free ride right into my inbox.  Leave AOL and leave Yahoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This I understand,  but I do think that we need to solve this issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of how do you do mass mailings.  Steve Gibson's going to basically stop  sending out mass mailings.  He's going to send out one more  because it's so hard for him to get...  And these are all people who signed up  for his mailings.  It's tough if you are the American Red Cross,  a charity, or if you're a business person  with a mailing list.  They're no good anymore.  What do you do on DIG?  Well, we just continue to send out email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It works.  It's just a pain sometimes  because there's some people that it gets blocked  and we have to help them manually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get a dozen emails a day  from people who don't get their passwords  and I know it's spam filters  because most of them do get their passwords,  but I don't have time.  I have to go into PHP MyAdmin  and go into the database every time.  And DIG out there.  It's a real pain.  I don't have any system to do this.  It's just me.  So I'm kind of sympathetic to this issue.  The real problem is caused by spammers  and there's a lack of spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spam filters can't be perfect.  Right.  I have to look at all my spammers  to catch a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What about more severe laws for spammers?  Yeah.  I think what they need is...  You're off-shores.  Yeah, they will.  They will kill the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no.  We pay for the spammers' email, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, our rates are set by the local ISPs  who have a certain amount of equipment  that's paid for  and people maintaining salaries  and they figure out  what's the profit on spam.  We're going to charge our consumers  to pay for all our equipment.  Now, the spammer stuff just comes in free  and every bit that comes in free.  You've paid for the excess equipment at your ISP  for the incoming as well as the outgoing.  So you've paid for the spam.  And if everybody had to pay for sending mail  for every bit you send,  I think that would go a long way  to stop on the spam.  Just like 25 cents,  a quarter of a cent,  that might be enough  because they say that  one out of 200 spams  has to go through  to make it profitable for the spammer.  Somebody has to click on it  and it's going to be a lot of money.  Somebody has to click on it  and buy something.  One out of 200,  that means 200 spams at that rate  is what, is that 50 bucks or am I off?  Or is it five bucks?  I'm glad that you're not,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because I felt like an idiot  that I couldn't figure that out.  But that comes back to what  Kevin said though,  is that once you make it  cost prohibitive for the spammers,  you also make it  even more cost prohibitive  for small businesses,  for non-profits,  for anybody who's trying to  just get through.  So basically only banks  will be able to do this.  I still get mailbox spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I still get it  and I go down to the street  and get my mail  and they have to pay for it.  They pay for it.  It's definitely the question

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of how bad is spam really?  It's really bugging that much.  So what's the audio broadcaster flag story Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mike Ferguson,  representative from New Jersey  has filed proposed legislation  calling for a broadcast flag  to be added to satellite digital radio.  So that you can turn off Howard Stern

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  or Bubba the Love Sponge  when the kids get in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The RIA is basically pushing to  control access,  basically to lock down access.  This is very similar to a certain bill  that was involving video  that the FCC  You knew this would happen  the minute they put Howard Stern on satellite

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that there would be an attempt  to crack down on that.  Don't you think?  Or is it music?  What are they worried about?  People stealing their music?  I think they're worried  about anybody recording that signal  and making any kind of a high quality

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  recording of the satellite radio.  It's very useful  when you make a low quality recording  with a microphone.  You can't do it yourself  for you to memorialize  something you hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't do it yourself  for you to memorialize  something you hear.  When they get the  jack in your neck  it didn't eliminate the analog loophole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's locked down.  Well, you know,  I'm against all of it.  I'm against it.  You're against it?  I'm against it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I'm against all of these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's getting rougher for them  to propose that kind of stuff though  because senators are wising up  in Congress  and one of them got an iPod  and then that was kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a little bit of trouble.  That's what I mean.  People have not been watching  for the last four years  this broadcast program  that's been going on  for the last four years  and it's been going on  for the last four years  and it's been going on  for the last four years  and it's been going on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for the last four years  this broadcast flag thing  working its way  into our media  and what it's going to mean  in the future.  They don't know.  They don't even believe it  when I tell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We talked about this the other day  this is the infuriating thing  about HDCP.  I mean,  if you want to use  a high-def DVD player  you'll have to have  a DVI or HDMI input.  That leaves out  three million HDTV owners  in the United States  who in good faith  bought their HDTV  thinking, well,  someday I'll be able to play  high-def content on this thing.  Guess what?  You can't.  Surprise.  You can't.  You'll have to buy a new TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plus there's a device  you can buy out of  a small company in England.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Dan Sokols talking to us  who said there's a device  that you can buy out  of a small company in England  that'll do it without degrading it.  It'll give you...  Straight through.  Ah, so there's a hack already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a hack.  It's 300 and something dollars.  Even if HDCP  is on this thing  for 300 bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you can take it off.  There you go.  There are various hacks

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but why should you have  to pay 300 dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  for a good TV  that you already spent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a third of the cost  of the new HDTV.  We do have an auto.  Well, not if you spent  300 bucks is like a cheat.  Especially if it's not  sold next year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There was also a story

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this week about HDCP  on Mitsubishi TVs, I guess.  It essentially breaks them  so that if you're watching  it downgrades the signal  to 720p.  And then they said,  480p I think.  Or 480p.  Tom knows.  Tom Merritt knows.  480p I believe, yeah.  But anyway,  it's just a, you know,  it's a miss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's just a DRM screw up.  We're at the Apple store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do want to thank  the folks at the Apple store  for letting us be here.  We have a microphone

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that we can use  to get the sound out  of the TV.  For letting us be here.  We have a microphone  over there on my right.  If anybody wants to ask a question  or make a comment of the twits,  please just walk on over  to that red bozo nose over there.  We use that red microphone  wind screen so that it's  very easy to find.  You can ask a question  or make a comment  to the twits.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Don't all run.  They're shy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're trapped in their seats.  They're shy.  Yeah, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think there's going to be  a new market for  5.1 Dolby surround sound  quick time video,  HD and other formats?  I hope so.  Do you see the,  shall I say, a legal market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Ah.  And for high def stuff that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And regular def stuff.  Yeah, in fact I think  that when you see things  like these HDCP,  it just encourages people  to make devices  or figure out ways to crack it.  Or just get BitTorrent  and download a high def  copy of the movie.  I think that that's,  it's a completely opposite  the intended effect  that the end product  is going to be.  It's completely opposite  the intended effect  that the MPAA,  the Motion Picture  Association of America,  wants.  It just,  you know, people see this  they go,  first of all,  I can't play my Blu-ray  on an HD DVD  and I can't play my...  And now they've got this copy.  Screw it.  Where's the BitTorrent client?  I'm downloading it.  Don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and in most cases  I think we would pay  for what it is we want.  We'd be glad to.  We'd be happy to pay  but there's no one  that will take our money  because they've got  so many licensing hangups  and so many bearing hangups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They just want to take  your money for a download now  and a DVD  and a little thing  for your PSP  and later on for an HD.  They won't take my money

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for a high-def  online download of a movie.  Well, they will.  Online download?  That was redundant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, there is a new porn site  that does high-def downloads.  You can get it.  How do you always know

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  so much about this?  I swear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he looks at me  as though I've been asking  for this.  Well, I'm just saying  that that's, you know,  the adult industry

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  is the end product

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of the end product  and the end product  is the end product  of the end product  and the industry  is the industry  that leads always  in this technology.  They will lead us to salvation.  In fact, they are offering  streaming HD.  Not streaming probably  but they're offering HD.  And much like the adult industry  Macbreak is in 1080p.  So, there you go.  How big a file is that?  It's gigantic.  We killed Lipson.  Gaining.  We killed Gibson.  Lipson on the Gibson.  We killed Lipson  on that Tuesday.  We made a Macbreak  of the Apple announcement  which we posted  around 10am and 11am at night  on Lipson.  335 megabytes.  That was on Tuesday night.  On Wednesday, Lipson starts  in the blog.  You start seeing  in the Lipson blog  we're being DDoS.  We don't know what's going on.  There's packets flying everywhere.  All the humanity.  And eventually  then I got a note  3 in the morning  the next morning  saying we looked at our logs  it was you.  So, they pulled the file  and we've recompressed to 90 megs  and I hope that we don't bring it down.  Now, I'm a little concerned  because the video for this  is also going to be on Lipson.  I was hoping  We interviewed the two guys  Dave and David Lipson  on Inside the Net  and I said  we didn't put  Twitter on Lipson  we were very lucky  we have AOL  we don't have to  but we didn't put Twitter on Lipson  I think Lipson's a great service  from podcasters  but we didn't want to bring you guys down  they said bring it on  we can take it.  Oh well.  Oh well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who does Dignation's video?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do it?  No, we actually had to move  to Cashfly

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  because they couldn't handle it  and Cashfly does Trillian  and a few other folks  Your files are how big?  They're a little over 100 megs

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  something like that  but the problem is

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess when we release  because so many people  try and download  at the exact same time  we're bursting  a little over 3 gigs  That's the problem  and a 3 gig pipe is a fat pipe  I've been actually talking  with people about this  there's a real issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  with podcast clients  because they all  do the same behavior  the minute they check the feed  they check the feed  all the time  first of all  the minute they see it  they check the feed  they check the feed  the minute they see it  they say I'll get it  and so 10,000  that's what happened  10,000 clients  hit Libsyn  at the same time

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  for 300 gig of live feed  if you release at a certain time  everyone knows to come

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  at that time and download  so I have a scheme  I have a scheme  I want to propose

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is it a paper download scheme?  No  just a quarter of a second  podcast tax?  Yes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there will be two tiers  no three  no four  no I think the idea  really is to write  a little script  in the XML  that takes one quarter  of the requests  and gives them  the new feed  and then an hour later  again  so in other words  you have a smart RSS feed  that parses out the files  and spreads it out  since the podcast clients  aren't smart enough to do it  let's script our RSS  I have a feeling

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it's coming in the podcast  and clients

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it has to be  it may have to  but you know what  people are going to start  hacking around it  because I've gotten like

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just because they want it now?  I want it now  I mean BitTorrent has to be  coming in  it needs to be Torrent  because iTunes doesn't support  the minute iTunes supports  your own music  you people should

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  even ask  are we going to  use Windows 8  this is exciting  because good software  they just  are  tests  you can do  simple tests  you can build  Thunderbolt  here  USB  here  and in  OpenFS  or

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  PRE-szrt  from that

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  some of the outs

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we  burn through  14 terabytes  oh well you're doing  since March 1st

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but that's not  I mean as Kevin says  the amount of data  isn't as much  as the issue as the peak  load at any one time  that's where it really gets expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well the peak load is expensive  and the total bandwidth  at the end of the month  is expensive

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  what would the bill for twit be  that's 30 terabytes a month  there about something like that  so  it would be a lot  and if you've got

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it would be  thank you AOL

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a quarter per gigabyte  times a thousand  that's where that good mail money is going

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  they're supporting  AOL.com slash podcast

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the good mail guys must be excited  because they've got two of the largest  and biggest potential clients  for their market possible  they just must be thrilled  because you know  they're thrilled  they're more thrilled as their VC investors

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  like yes  they were thrilled until everybody  kind of started jumping down their throats  speaking of iTunes

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  did you see the  Department of Justice  open an antitrust probe today  into collusion  by the major record labels  price collusion  because they've been pushing so hard  for more than  for more than 99 cents  basically for song downloads  yeah  all right  it's about  and so they've been saying  different songs should cost different prices  and now apparently  DOJ is starting to think  thanks Ellie Spitzer  maybe they've been talking together  too much  about how much these songs should cost  why is it they sound so similar  yeah  they all think  Britney Spears should cost 2.99  and that's crazy  you know I've never understood that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  if you want to charge 2.99 for Britney Spears  go be my guest  you know  as long as Howlin' Wolf doesn't  right  who cares what Britney Spears costs  and then there was the allofmp3.com model  ah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  my favorite  really  use all of mp3  yeah  for public domain stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't use it

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  oh please  it's not  it's legal  all of mp3 maintains it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they're legal  it's legal in Russia  it's illegal  it's illegal  is it  yeah oh yeah  but says who  it's all unlicensed

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they've  well they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they've been saying  they've  they've  they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well they've  they claim  they've got a licensing service in Russia

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
