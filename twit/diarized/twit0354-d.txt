You don't have to actually what are you looking for? I'm curry  Because there is no agenda show on there. So you can add SoundCloud. So you can now there is you can add  shows by RSS  but they also have an audio entry and if you actually go back if you would go back to the  Go back to the audio. What's this split keyboard Robert? That's pretty bad. That's that's part of iOS  Whatever nobody knows about it.

End time: 520.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But but but well, here's what I wanted to make a point  So click click the twit or just go to audio and scroll down. It's an alphabetical order  So this is what our podcast looks like Oh  Board because  It's not a magazine. It's just audio. So you you you don't have to play it. I think

Start time: 522.82
End time: 525.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 526.74
End time: 540.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It it's playing in the background and you continue to surf or flip right?  So I can go to my usual so that's what I've been doing but now go to NPR  Because I want to show you what it should look like so you see ours is just icons with each show

Start time: 540.86
End time: 551.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and it's playing in the background now playing in the background, but if you go to NPR  Which is one of the featured audio podcast you get all this by this little red red ribbon. Yeah, red ribbon

Just cancel cancel cancel cancel cancel. There it is cancel cancel go back  Okay, it's a feature do the you do the thing you click audio. It's right at the top  But you don't to search for it. There it is now  What's different about NPR is because they have all this textual content Robert and Adam. This is the lesson I learned  Look there's audio right here that you start listening, right? Yep, and the web page  It's a web page, but this is the point is that this is I think the future of audio and probably video  Yeah, you tie

Start time: 598.94
End time: 608.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  an RSS feed with podcasts and connect it to  Like show notes or something and have that well, that's what I have to investigate because as you see if you scroll down

Start time: 608.24
End time: 621.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean most of these guys have  Little magazines, but if you don't this is what you're gonna get  You're gonna get what I do and what others do which is just basically icons  That show you shows and in our case since every show has the same album art

Start time: 623.40
End time: 633.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a very boring visual presentation. So what I'm sure don't you guys have different album art each time? No  Hmm. No, it's too complicated. Oh, man. We had we do it album art every single episode

Start time: 634.04
End time: 662.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I probably but even then all I would get is is is what I see here, which is  Different album art each time, but it's still not very compelling and I think that this is the message  Is that what's gonna happen is pod  You're the pod father  And both of us were early on in podcasting was a great thing, but just too hard for normal people  I mean we've hit a ceiling with  Normal people subscribing and listening to podcasts. It has to somehow be more integrated in your normal life

Start time: 662.62
End time: 683.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you know the genesis of podcasting goes back to the days when we had broadband  But it was always on and it wasn't very fast  You couldn't click something and have it play immediately  Right, so that's what the subscription model made a lot of sense and these days  I mean you go in the car even on 3g  You can just click something and it's nice playing and and I think that now of course

Start time: 684.56
End time: 703.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Flipboards done this very nicely, but it's not gonna be the only way to do it  but I think Flipboard points the way to the future of  multimedia content which is  You're right. We're online everywhere  We have high speed everywhere so everything it needs to be kind of an on-off switch where you say oh, yeah  I want to start listening right now, but as it but as like a

Start time: 784.10
End time: 810.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We I think we want to take the next step  I've been talking with some people and I think what we're gonna do and it's gonna take us a while and I'm not  Supposed to talk about it, but I do think that we're gonna have to make it more of a magazine  More textual plus and I don't think show notes are enough  I think it has to be we have to have more editorial that ties back to the audio  We have to think of ourselves as multimedia artists  Not just audio not just video but audio video and text in a form that can be consumed on flipboard on any platform

Start time: 810.96
End time: 828.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's really hard. I mean Leo  It is show notes and you know, it's just it's hundreds of links for every every episode we do but for you  You know with with this type of format you'd literally need someone  We have to build a long and collecting links and then publishing it. It's a lot of work  Yeah

Start time: 829.84
End time: 837.82

Start time: 838.14
End time: 888.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is Robert's Twitter feed  So in effect it pulls the links that you link to and makes articles out of them, right?  I think that the key is to start thinking of yourself as a multimedia creator  Not an audio guy or video guy a text guy but a multimedia creator and we need to as a network be a multimedia  Network not a video or video network but a multimedia network and that does mean that it's it means expense because you have to hire staff  It means editorial, you know Roku  We're very close now to this Roku streaming stick and this is very interesting. Have you seen this?  This is a we saw it at CES.

Yep, and then instead she shows up in white  She's graduating from spinster hood  We're gonna take a break come back with more Adam Curry the school actually it's the pod father the godfather and the Scoville Iser  One of these things is not like the other and who am I  Just your local friendly neighborhood announcer to tell you about stamps.com stamps.com  Okay  I'm not gonna say that going to the post office is a bad experience  I'm just gonna say that maybe it's something you can live without  Maybe in your life, you could just not have to go buy stamps or go mail that package  Maybe you could just do it all from your desk. Wouldn't that be cool? Well, you can with stamps.com  Use your computer your printer. You don't need a postage meter. You don't need special links  You just need stamps.com Mac or PC  They even will send you this this USB scale you throw the letter of the package on there  Exactly the right postage. It looks professional. You could print right on the envelope if you want  You don't have you can have envelopes you can have labels you could print on postcards always the right postage  You never run out you don't have to charge. You remember the days when people go to the post office to charge up their postage meter  Is that crazy? We don't have to do it anymore. Thanks to the internet and stamps.com  So I want you to try it. We have a no-risk trial  If you go to stamps.com, you'll see on the front the $80 you might say well $80 no-risk trial. That's a good deal  No stop up in the right hand corner. There's a radio microphone on those classic old 50s microphones click click that and  Then enter the offer code twit  TWI T and press go and that will get whoa $80 is turned to a hundred ten dollar bonus offer  $55 in postage coupons a free digital scale  You just pay shipping and handling that's worth 50 bucks by itself a five dollar supply kit a four-week trial all for using the offer  code twit  This way you could see if stamps.com is right for you  If you're an Amazon or eBay seller, you're gonna love this it prints out everything you need directly from those  Websites so you don't have to type in an address a name or anything and then the postage and everything  If you're an international mailer every time I mail international, but Adam does that sometimes too  It's a real pain because you have to get the international money order and you have to get the special  Form this will do the whole thing for you. And then the mail carrier comes and gets it and you don't have to get up out  of your seat  Never fill out another post office form by hand again use stamps  Com hundred ten dollar offer when you visit stamps.com and use our offer code twit. You're gonna love it  That is an old picture of me  That's not a good look  so  In really interesting here. You say a Facebook failed IPO Adam and I'm not sure I disagree with you  The underwriters  Decided to set the price before the IPO yesterday morning at $38. That was the dot  That was the price that if you were an insider like you were a big trader with your brokerage you could say hey  Cut me some of that Facebook stock and you know, it's the biggest tech IPO in history  It wouldn't be unreasonable to think it's gonna what they call pop which is come out at 38 bucks  But end up at a hundred bucks or 50 bucks or whatever  And then even if you just wanted to sell at the end of the day you'd make pretty good money

I mean, I'm pegging this stock to go down to 17  That's where I think it belongs. I think that's reasonable for what they can do what they've shown historically  In revenues and and profits so that's the problem

That's a big deal  They have a strike price and let's say just for argument's sake it's going to be around that 38 number  So now people are going to be very worried like oh, you know either I have stock or I'm in lockup for six months  I can't sell anything so on paper.

Well, I why I clicked on it. Anyway, I just don't see the  Model as something that really works anymore  I think it's you know, the only way you can make money with banner advertising  Which is essentially what they do. I looked at all the presentations of I follow it. I'm very interested  Is just high volume high high volume of lots of people someone who'll be drunk  Some of them make a mistake some of them will be interested no doubt about it  But early on brands were all sold on this how many likes a brand had and I know the advertisers  Advertisers are very very smart agencies not so agencies will sell a bunch of crap to the advertiser  But the advertiser at the end of the day go hey, did it make us money or not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why didn't stamps calm just sponsor your show well? I think Adam makes a very good point stamps calm  calculates return on in  On their investment very carefully  It's a little harder for Ford because it's a brand builder  But you're right and Ford even wants to do a lot of research  They check they're researching constantly to see if they're getting brand recognition  So no company that's spending ad dollars and is intelligent is spending ad dollars into a vacuum. They're checking does this work?  Does this produce results one way or the other they're not and I think you're right Adam  I don't know if it's the agencies that are that smart, but the advertisers whose actual money  It is are very careful about where they're putting it and in fact  I think that's one of the reasons you're seeing of a real softening in banner ads right now aren't we display ads are down

Transcript:  So I think that and and and that's why advertisers starting to demand  You know acquisition cost per acquisition instead of cost per click or cost per impression  They really want to make sure that they're getting their money's worth. Yeah  So I I I don't I think it's a but this was all brought up before the IPO everybody said well  Here's the negatives it could be another myspace everybody could vacate Facebook because somebody else comes along  It could they're they don't haven't shown that they know how to produce revenue and they certainly aren't producing enough revenue to justify that price  Right now  It's clear people who bought Facebook and by the way, I I would buy it if I could  Believe in the Zuck and believe in him and his team and his ability to somehow turn 900 million  Well and users we could say if it's Adams case 900 million eyeballs and they're believing in their own you into something

And that that I think is you know, there's a couple things going on here  That are very exciting to me. If you look at Kickstarter, there's a very interesting model  We have a company that's facilitating  the connection of people and is taking a piece of the action and  People are getting what they want and this is this is really the future and I think the network itself is going to is going to  Facilitate that tremendously where I want a product. I want  There you go. So there's million dollars on the Pebble watch. Yeah, yeah, so you want it and you know  It's gonna cost 299 when it comes out, but you know what? I want it so bad  I'll give I'll toss these guys 50 bucks to get it going.

Yes. Yes  I believe that technology does totally entraps us and makes us a lot less  Free is the word as human beings. So well whole  Humanization of technology is not necessarily a good thing now.

It's just a pain in the butt you fire up Microsoft Word and you type in a tut look in  2004 I found fresh books comm it was actually amber MacArthur introduced them to me when we were I was going up there to do  A TV show. It's a Toronto company and she said look because I said I keep forgetting the invoice. I'm not getting paid  she said fresh books comm and  Three and a half million people now have followed in my footsteps and are using fresh books to send out their invoices  They're professional looking their crisp crisp  They look that you get paid faster because there's a button right on the email that says pay this guy  And the truth is your clients it's not that they don't want to pay you  They just kind of make it easy for them so they can use a credit card or one of 11 different online  Authorization services to pay you right on the spot including PayPal  If you do time and hours they have an app an iPhone app  But you also have a web-based app that will do the time and hours and then just it goes right into the into the invoice  They have automatic tickler so if you know you don't get paid for 30 60 or 90 days  Automatically send out the invoice again and remind people and let them know hey, we're paying attention

I used fresh books  I don't have to do it anymore because I do have a staff, but if you're a small business you're doing this yourself  This is a great solution fresh books dot com  Try it right now 30 days of unlimited use and just make sure you tell them you heard about it on Twitter  Okay, fresh books  Dot com don't do that invoicing by hand anymore the faster you do it the faster you get paid  Yeah, you I'm telling you just try it for a month, and if you don't get more money in that first month forget it  Fresh books dot com are you ready for 802 dot 11 AC?  You are I just got a Buffalo router does this new 802.11

Start time: 6659.54
End time: 6673.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's AC have you heard about this absolutely AC is a bonding of the 5 gigahertz channels up to 8 for 160  megahertz to get you up to 1.3  Gigabits of transfer over multiple devices or 500 megabits per second over a single device

Start time: 6673.96
End time: 6676.92

Transcript:  It has another thing that's super cool it has adaptive antenna aiming so when it starts to talk to so I'm sitting here my Wi-Fi  Access point is over here. I'm talking you're doing your phone right now. It says oh Robert's having a conversation it narrows its beam  It's no longer  Omnidirectional to the people it's talking to which is kind of amazing all of this because the 2.4 gigahertz band is crazy  Crowded unusably crowded we couldn't use the standard routers even in here  We had a we had to upgrade to higher-end routers in fact you're gonna give us this is it serious zero zero

Start time: 6711.90
End time: 6747.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's essentially a souped-up version of that  It's it's a looks like a flying saucer and it divides the 360 degrees into multiple slices  With radios pointed in just that direction now the problem with the 2.4 gigahertz range and on the chat realm knows  This is there's really only three channels. They say 11, but it's three  It's one six and eleven if you put if you put your Wi-Fi in any other channel  You're really just straddling channels right and 2.4 gigahertz has several problems first it propagates  Well through walls which means if I have a access point in my house  It's interfering with the access point in my neighbor's house exactly and also with just the three channels. It's congested now

Start time: 6747.84
End time: 6765.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's interesting because you're making a  Benefit out of what could be a problem because as you get to higher frequencies it bounces off things  So five gigahertz is not going to go through walls as well right that's great  If your neighbors are impinging on you, but it's not so great if you have a home with multiple rooms  Are there solutions around that?  What a bridge up or yeah?

Start time: 6766.14
End time: 6787.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's actually one of the things that I've been hearing from some of the Silicon Valley press  And that is that the arrival of AC you know the coming-of-age of the five gigahertz Wi-Fi devices is going to do to five  Gigahertz what it what happened to 2.4?  This is gonna be just as crowded, but that's not true because it doesn't propagate right  So you can have an access point in each room, and it will not interfere with one another

Start time: 6788.20
End time: 6806.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, I mean now we'll need to upgrade. I mean it does it's downward compatible ABC and G and n are all working but  You you will want to get all these benefits to use an AC  Adapter on your machine correct house how long before notebooks and desktops or whatever come out with it the problem is it's draft

Start time: 6806.84
End time: 6821.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like when draft and first came out and it's kind of the draft for at least another year  I mean, so we're gonna take away early. This is way early  This was Buffalo and netgear fighting it out to see who could make it to market first  I think they were within three hours of one another netgears are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  6300 just came out the Buffalo  802 let's see a router is called the AC  1300 I have that home and I set it up and now the problem is your internet access isn't any faster unless you have such  Fast internet that it's challenging 802.11 n which most people don't  But if you're sharing files over the network I did notice a big boost there  That's an amazing thing so for instance one of the things I do I'll give you second just second  One of the things I do is I have it has a USB port  So I put a hard drive on it and make that a NAS and that way it's a much faster  Backup solution than if I were doing it over the normal Wi-Fi right exactly go ahead Adam. Sorry

Start time: 6876.74
End time: 6895.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I'm actually much more concerned about 802 11  BG and at 2.4 gigahertz gigahertz because that's the same frequency as your microwave  That gets absorbed by the water molecules in your body 5 gigahertz actually just bounces right off  So if I get gigahertz is actually better than you, but I'm with very low power. We're just talking

So just want to let you know  Anyway, so I'm excited about this 82 dot 11 AC where more than a year off from it's but it's a draft standard  But like the end standard there are early correct models. I was impressed. I was getting very good results with the Buffalo  I'm gonna test it more. I mean I just had it for a day and see overall but it's also a nice router for other reasons  I mean, it's a  Unfortunately has WPS. Yes, which is flawed  So all routers many routers that have a six-digit token on the back that allow you to easily bond with a router  You know or Buffalo calls it a OSS  This WPS was improperly implemented in these routers and it's trivial  To download software that will allow you on a WPS enabled router to get the WPA password and get in  in a minute or two  So it's a huge security flaw. If you have a router that has WPS. You should turn it off immediately  And unfortunately the link sis routers by Cisco they have an on-off switch, but it doesn't turn it off  So you're in fact complete you're vulnerable no matter what it turns off the light  That's they thought that's what you meant. Oh, you don't want to see the light  Firmware updates are being pushed out. It's an easy fix as it turns out  So Steve Gibson's talked a lot about this flaw on a security now if you want to know more  It's to go back to security. What a great show that is. I love security
