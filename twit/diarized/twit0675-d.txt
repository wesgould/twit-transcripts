Transcript:  Well, you're Mark Zuckerberg's age, which makes you a millennial, according to Brian McCullough of the ride deck ride home.  He is the tech meme ride home. He is a host of that in the Internet history show. It's great to see you again, Brian. Welcome.  Hello. Hello. And and a newbie. So a fresh face. Jessica Connett, who is officially absolutely a millennial.  Very true. I'm sorry. It's great to have Jessica from ours.  Technica and we're I'm sorry. Is that wrong? And Gadget idiot. I'm an idiot.  I knew it was one of those better than ours. Technica. Anyway, anyway, much better. Much better.  No, great to have you. Jessica covers gaming there, but covers all sorts of tech news as well.  It's great to have you. This is a good week for you all to be here because this was there are certain times in the tech that are toy store times.  This was a toy store time, a time that you want to go buy something.  And in the toy store, we have something from Apple and something from Microsoft.  And I know you cover these, Brian. So you probably were fairly busy this week.  The surface goes the first one came out this week, a little teeny weeny surface to compete with the iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a three ninety nine. Well, it's in your wheelhouse is a three ninety nine device that is the size of an iPad, has a special little mini type keyboard.  You can buy as an accessory along with a pencil and a mouse even if you want.  But it's Windows 10, Windows 10 S, although it can be upgraded to Windows 10 home for free.  And it's tiny. And I read an interesting interview with Panos Panay, who's in charge of products, chief product officer at Microsoft, who's of the opinion that the future of computing is teeny weeny.

Start time: 259.66
End time: 262.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that what we said when netbooks were popular in 2006 or is it?

Start time: 264.60
End time: 270.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, didn't they almost kill the PC industry? But they were.  But the difference is they were small. Yes, but they were cheap and junky.

Start time: 271.00
End time: 302.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the this new surface is about the same price as a netbook was back in the day. Right.  That's true. 400 bucks. I don't know.  Like the surfaces haven't been selling that well, right.  Compared to the iPad. And I don't know if the problem is really the price or the size.  It's simply that people don't really want windows on a tablet.  Ah, have you seen the stats for the surfaces?  Like they just generally don't do much for Microsoft is from what I last checked.

Start time: 302.00
End time: 309.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. Although I did note that both IDC and Gartner said the PC sales were up a small couple of percentage points.

Start time: 310.10
End time: 312.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But do we count it as a PC or do we count as a tablet?

Start time: 314.46
End time: 326.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of them, I can't remember which one.  One of them did count the Microsoft tablets and one of them didn't.  And then one of them did count Chromebooks and the other one didn't.  So it's hard to do an apples to apples. Interesting.

Start time: 327.46
End time: 341.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would say tablets, if they run Windows 10 and you can add a keyboard, a mouse and a pen are our computers.  But then absolutely doesn't doesn't Apple say an iPad is a computer or replaces the computer?

Start time: 341.12
End time: 364.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They call it the future of the PC. Do they call it the post PC device or something?  The future of the PC or something like that. It's supposed to replace the PC.  And then you back them up and you're like, well, you want to replace the Mac with that?  They say, no, we don't count the Mac as a PC. But the Mac is a PC because it's a personal computer.  And they're also upselling the iPad, but not so much the Mac anymore.

Start time: 365.40
End time: 418.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that brings up the second product that came out this week, and that is new MacBook Pros, but not just any MacBook Pros.  These have the butterfly key. They didn't change those. Everybody's worried about these.  And they kept the touch bar. But what they really did with these is they upped the RAM.  You can get as much as 32 gigs of RAM and they put the latest eighth generation Intel processors in there, including the i9.  They put high end GPUs. They even announced a GPU from Blackmagic, an external GPU.  They aimed these square at the professionals and the price matches.  They started at $2,700 and I was easily able to configure one to $7,000.  With the four terabyte of storage. How many did you buy, Leo?  I only bought one. And I couldn't. I choked at the four terabytes.  That drive alone is what, $3,000, Brian? Something like that. It's really expensive.

Start time: 422.05
End time: 434.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was anyone even asking for a quieter keyboard? That's my thing with this one.  You don't think so? I don't think so. I don't know. I've never had a problem with mine.  I've never heard complaints about it. Maybe I'm out of the loop, but it seemed a little strange as a highlight.

Start time: 435.62
End time: 449.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought I was complaining loud enough that even in Phoenix you'd hear me. Oh, yeah.  I'm not alone. There's three class action lawsuits. Those are more about the reliability of the butterfly keys.  I was going to say, so here's the deal. You know the conspiracy theory, right?  What's the conspiracy theory?

Start time: 450.28
End time: 509.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That this, it's a cover story that they've made the keyboards quieter.  They've actually fixed theoretically the problem with the keyboards getting dust in them.  But because they can't admit that there ever was a problem because of those lawsuits,  they can't say, oh, hey, by the way, guys, we fixed that problem with dust getting into your keyboard and ruining your whole computer.  So they say that, hey, what we did is made the keys quieter because what they what I tear down are one of those guys.  I fix it. I fix it. They said there's a silicone thing in there to keep it clean.  Sort of like a dam or something. Yeah, like a dental dam. Right.  So it's going to go that way. But the but so what they can they have plausible deniability.  They can claim, well, this little silicone layer is in there so that it dulls the sound of the typing.  But it actually could theoretically functionally also keep dust out.

Start time: 510.00
End time: 552.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the Gruber. The Gruber theory is he says marketing wise, I don't think they would admit to a reliability problem in the existing keyboards.  Legally, I don't think they should admit to it.  So whether they've attempted to address reliability problems along with noise or not, I think they'd say, no, no, no, we just made them quieter.  And I think you're right. I think I fix it.  Tear down where they show this thin rubberized layer under the keycaps, presumably to keep crumbs and dust out from under there where they can cause problems is is exactly to do that.  Not so much to make them quieter.  But it's interesting because neither Jessica, Brian X Chen, you said the same thing.  Do you don't think you don't mind how they sound? No, not at all.

Start time: 553.02
End time: 569.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's never been really an issue for me.  Like, in fact, I kind of want one of those mechanical keyboards that are super loud, like just to get that feedback.  But I feel like, you know, like this has never really been an issue where people complain about how loud the keyboard was.  So it's kind of a distraction in some ways to say it's a quiet.  You are a true millennial.

Start time: 571.60
End time: 584.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But let me ask you, Jessica.  So, OK, admittedly, you and Brian say not noise, but don't you feel like the travel is really short on these?  And it's you said you you use typewriters where there's a lot of travel.  There's also a lot of noise.

Start time: 585.67
End time: 589.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have used. I don't anymore.  My job would be very difficult with a typewriter.

Start time: 590.28
End time: 613.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd like to file a review for Engadget.  Here's the let me fax it in.  Let me fax it in.  Do you mind? It feels to me when I use the Apple keyboard.  I don't want to belabor this.  And people have heard me complain about a diagnosis.  It hurts my fingers almost because it's such a short travel and it has such a hard stop to it.  It's almost like typing on glass. Such a baby boomer, Leo.

Start time: 615.20
End time: 618.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What are you talking about, man? It's amazing.

Start time: 618.85
End time: 629.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm with Leo. I it's it's aside from dongle life.  The thing that prevents me from having upgraded to the latest Max is that keyboard.  It just feels like typing on glass to me. I just.

Start time: 630.42
End time: 640.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Renee Richie, who doesn't mind the keyboard, has had three fail on him.  So and I have talked to people. I mean, there is definitely an issue with stuff.  You said Brian, what did you mind if three failed on you?

Start time: 641.10
End time: 643.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I would mind it. Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 644.16
End time: 659.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a I wouldn't be happy, especially because until Apple's recent admission and willingness to fix these for free.  Yeah, it was seven hundred dollars to fix it. Right. Right.  Sorry, you were asking me a question. Yeah.  You had some problems, though, but you were able to blow the crumbs out.

Start time: 660.04
End time: 683.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I had some dust under like some of the keys and I have like a can of air spray in a drawer somewhere.  I just sprayed it for a few minutes and it's fine.  So I don't know. It's like I kind of I have this mantra where I feel like a lot of people forget that you have to maintain your devices.  You have to take care of them, even though they have fewer and fewer moving parts as as we get more and more advanced.  You know, but you got to clean things. You got to blow air every now and then.

Start time: 684.20
End time: 703.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it's fine. I kind of promised myself because I did buy one of these for thousands of dollars.  I will never eat over my key. Yeah, I never do that for sure.  So you don't eat. No, I don't. I don't eat over the keyboard. Yeah.  But I think a lot of geeks do eat.

Start time: 703.76
End time: 715.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the contrary argument would be when was the last time you heard of keyboards failing on mass?  So it's something that's been fixed for a long, long time that suddenly is broken again.

Start time: 716.00
End time: 805.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the thing. I've OK. I'm going to throw this out and you guys can tell me I'm wrong.  Because there's no way of knowing what Apple's long term strategy is with Mac OS.  And of course, Apple has been at pains to say, no, no, we're not merging iOS and Mac OS.  Not that anybody said that they were. I think the larger concern, especially among pros, is that Apple just lost interest in Mac OS.  They make so much money on the iPhone that they just don't really care.  They haven't updated the Mac Pro since 2013.  But all of a sudden, we're seeing a story about the Mac Pro coming out next year.  Last year we saw the iMac Pro, which starts at what was at five thousand dollars.  This year they didn't update the MacBooks or the lower end MacBook Pros.  They only did high end, very expensive.  Here's my theory that Apple understands it needs Mac OS because you can't write apps without Mac OS.  That's an important part of the ecosystem.  Plus, they really like the buzz they get from professional photographers and filmmakers and artists using and musicians using Macintosh.  And they kind of like to keep that going. But they don't want consumers to use them.  My prediction, please tell me if I'm wrong, is you won't see updated MacBooks, Mac Minis, MacBook Escape.  You won't see updated consumer inexpensive MacBooks, MacBook Air.  Because Apple's position these days is, no, if you're a consumer, use an iPad.  That the Macintosh from now on is for creative professionals. Agree or disagree?

Start time: 806.10
End time: 846.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing is that the professional community just complains very loudly that Apple doesn't understand the professional user anymore.  Which is that if they really understood professionals, they would probably have an SD card reader or more ports in the MacBook Pro versus this USB-C everything kind of thing.  And they would sacrifice thinness for perhaps a better battery life with a bigger battery.  Or a better keyboard.  And the Mac Pro was obviously a flop and Apple's admitted that, right?  The big trash can thing that they had for a while.  I feel like when I talk to videographers and other people like photographers, they just feel that Apple's dropped the ball on professionals.

Start time: 847.02
End time: 848.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this isn't enough to change their mind, you think?

Start time: 849.46
End time: 869.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I think already the perception of the MacBook Pro is pretty negative.  And given the keyboard concerns and also just things like the touch bar not really being that popular of a feature.  I think it's kind of, the Mac overall just doesn't really seem to have a vision right now.  You're actually taking it farther than I was willing to take it.

Start time: 870.33
End time: 900.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you guys think?  I mean Apple did trot out creative professionals with the release of this.  They have a whole ad campaign, the new Behind the Mac ad campaign, which is all these creative professionals using Mac laptops.  They certainly, when they brought Matthew Panzerino from TechCrunch in to show him that they were working on the Mac Pro, they said, look, we have all these real filmmakers and other creative professionals working at Apple to show us the way with the Mac Pro.  They clearly want to impress the community.  Go ahead, Brian.  I'm sorry I interrupted you.

Start time: 900.02
End time: 971.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so there's a theory out there that aside from whatever they might want to do in terms of integrating iOS and Mac OS, what they're really waiting on, the thing that's the big sea change that they want to make is they want to go to arm chips or maybe their own chips.  And so not only this sort of move, like you were right, they trotted out all of the professionals.  I think that kind of lends in my mind credence to the theory that there is a big sea change coming, especially to laptops, but they're not there yet.  And so they've got to keep treading water, treading water.  And so they trot out the professionals and say nice things to the professionals to try to keep them in camp.  The thing that's the most mysterious to me is the MacBook Air, which has to be, I think they said this on the Vergecast this week, and I hadn't thought about this, but that has to be the most successful Mac of all time, wouldn't you think?  And that thing is just left just dead in the water.  And so why, I guess this comes into your theory, Leo, that why would they abandon the most popular consumer grade laptop probably ever made?

Start time: 971.80
End time: 979.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you can say it's the most successful laptop and certainly was copied by everybody, but its sales are dwarfed by the iPhone sales.

Start time: 979.50
End time: 981.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, but not back in the day. Well, by the iPhone.

Start time: 982.50
End time: 993.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Welcome to today. That's my point. When you have a shiny object in front of you that has sold a billion, you don't care about a few hundred thousand MacBook Airs.  Jessica, are you a Windows or Mac user?

Start time: 995.42
End time: 1025.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For because of work, I use a MacBook Air. I have one of the last few, I guess.  But otherwise, I would be using Windows and I don't know anyone like that. I talked to professionally or personally.  That's really excited about buying an Apple. Anything right now, honestly, iPhone is definitely like the top one.  Friends and developers I know have iPhones, but there's not a lot of energy in terms of Apple laptops and stuff like that.

Start time: 1025.96
End time: 1093.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, Jessica, there's so many people I know that are talking and I'm thinking I'm looking at a surface book, too.  Because like Owen Williams, do you guys know him? Yeah.  Yeah, he went back to Windows famously, I think like a year ago, and he wrote a piece right.  It was before the July 4th about his surface book, too. And, you know, this will bring us back to the surface discussion.  The argument that he made that really kind of made me think about it is he said, well, you know, you have your iPad to do certain things, but then you've got to go back to your main computer to do other things.  But what the surface book, too, does is you pull the screen off and that's still your main computer with all of your files and all the things you need.  And so that was the thing that he also talks about, like, you know, drawing on the screen, making notes.  He's been won over by that. But that was the thing that really made me think, oh, yeah, what if my tablet also was my main computer?  Like I can see that being a super interesting and and, you know, the surface book, too, still has some USB ports and SD card readers and things like that that I'm unwilling to.

Start time: 1094.02
End time: 1124.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do miss those ports. I got to say, Owen wrote just a couple of weeks ago, the surface book, too, is everything the MacBook Pro should be.  Now he wrote this right before the MacBook Pro was updated. I'm curious if he's changed his tune.  I mean, you're sitting I'm sitting in front of a surface studio, but I have to admit, if I had the choice, I'd far prefer you to use Mac OS.  Maybe that's just maybe that's old fashioned. I come from that era where people loved the Macintosh.  Maybe that's just not reasonable anymore.

Start time: 1125.30
End time: 1129.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's cyclical. You know, people are getting frustrated with Apple taking away things from them.

Start time: 1130.50
End time: 1156.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I live in a bubble because, you know, we do a Macintosh show, which is for serious Macintosh enthusiasts.  I did, you know, I for years was all Mac is so much better than Windows.  Of course, before Mac, I use Windows. Jessica, you're a gamer.  So from a from a gaming point of view, there's no question that Windows is far superior to Macintosh.  And Apple continues, even with this $5,000 laptop, to ship the worst anemic Radeon graphics cards.

Start time: 1158.52
End time: 1180.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But in that case, like in terms of gaming, especially the mobile market is huge for games. It's exploding.  They own it on iPad and iPhone, right?  They the app store is is just saturated and they're making a lot of money there.  So in terms of games, I mean, mobile might just kind of be where Apple's looking.  And that might be their bread and butter there.  That's the problem. They're not going to take over PCs.

Start time: 1181.12
End time: 1225.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really hard for a company when you have a hit as big as the iPhone.  It becomes very difficult to do anything else.  I have the money and the resources, the skills, the talent to do more than one thing.  But there's no incentive.  I think the only reason the Mac is still around is because you needed to develop software for the iPhone.  That's I really seriously think that's it.  Jessica, move your mic a little bit closer because the AC, I want to get you more on mic if I can get it right in that shot.  Let's just let's just let's just see that snowball right there in the shutter.  I want to see it. I didn't ask you, Brian McCullough.  You're you look like a Mac guy. You live in Brooklyn.

Start time: 1225.04
End time: 1244.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Right.  But I think I got my first Mac in 2006. Whoa.  And you know what? You you named the exact reason when I was a kid in the 80s and 90s and you would go to Babbage's to buy computer games.  You would have shelf after shelf of PC games and one little sliver of a shelf for Mac games.

Start time: 1245.28
End time: 1273.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And most of the time, those were bad ports by Aspire and other companies from the PC game.  And they were two years after the PC game was already over.  You'd get, oh, we just got Bioshock. I'm so excited.  It's kind of pathetic, really.  All right. Well, you know, it's funny. I thought this would get a rise out of everybody.  And I think you've already written the obituary for Apple's Macintosh.  It's over. Is it?  Well, you told me it was Brian X.

Start time: 1273.56
End time: 1288.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jen. No, I just I just don't really think the pro community is the one to keep it like.  Well, who's going to keep it alive? Consumers?  Well, I think just given the fact that the iPad Pro is not the greatest replacement for a PC at this point.  No one's like saying I'm going to get an iPad instead of I mean, some people.

Start time: 1289.02
End time: 1318.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's there's such a diversity in the PC because so many companies make PCs.  There's so many different kinds of laptops. There's two and ones as convertibles.  There's like, you know, think pads. There's all kinds of different form factors.  You can pick the one you like the best. And by the way, I haven't done it yet.  I really should sit down and do a head to head comparison between the hardware and the new MacBook Pro and in a PC.  But I would guess the MacBook Pro is more than 50 percent more expensive for the same hardware.

Start time: 1319.00
End time: 1325.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the iPad Pro at this point has surpassed the MacBook Pro, hasn't it?  In terms of the pros. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.

Transcript:  Oh, that's sad. All right. Enough of that.  Let's take a little break. Jessica Connett, great to have you from Engadget.  Senior editor.

Transcript:  And well, that's why we make our show so damn long, because I figure you get in the car, you want to put on a podcast and that you don't want to touch it again, however long your commute.  So as commutes have gotten longer, so have our shows. We're now up to two hours, mostly because I can't shut up.  Our show today brought to you by LastPass. I don't have to tell you about LastPass. I hope I don't have to tell you about LastPass.  Passwords are a nightmare. They're the worst part of computing these days. And every website you go to, every app you install, they want a password.  And of course, you know, the experts, the security people say each one should be long, strong and unique.  That's a lot of passwords to remember. Far too many for anybody to remember. So people do the wrong thing.  They use the same password over and over again. They make them easy to remember, which means they're not very strong.  And it's even worse if you've got a business and your employees have the keys to the kingdom, the logins to your website, your bank accounts, all of that stuff.  Are they using bad passwords? Are they putting them on a sticky note on the on the screen? You got to protect yourself.  That's why we use LastPass Enterprise and every business should be protect password, protect every point, entry point to your business with the best password management you can get.  LastPass turns out 81 percent of all breaches are caused by weak and reused passwords.  LastPass makes it easy to generate completely random, unique passwords. You don't have to remember them.  LastPass remembers it for you, fills it in for you. All you need is that one password to unlock your last password vault and you are in.  Thirteen million individuals trust LastPass and about thirty three thousand businesses now for easy onboarding, password auto fill, mobile app access.  LastPass makes it easy for businesses to take control of their passwords, reduce the threat of breach.  We actually I used last I've been using LastPass since they started and I love always loved as an individual.  We weren't using it at work and that was a big mistake.  We had an engineer put a web page up with all the passwords because he couldn't remember them.  But it was a public web page. So that's what we started using.  That sounds like I'm making that up. It actually is the truth.  So that's what we started using LastPass Enterprise.  Now I don't have to worry. My employees, for instance, can get passwords to our QuickBooks, but they don't even know the passwords.  They can't change the passwords. And without LastPass, they can't log in.  We can make LastPass only work at work. We can make it.  You can put. Yes, you completely can restrict access to specific devices and locations.  We can set master password requirements. We require two factor.  That's part of the deal. You can turn on password resets and employee leaves.  You can say, OK, everybody's got to reset their password and you control it.  Over 100 policies, access security reports, create shared folders.  We have a folder just for engineers, just for engineers who need access to the website, just for engineers who need access to our accounts.  I mean, it really, really is a great solution.  And of course, LastPass makes sure that all the data is fully encrypted and decrypted only at the device level.  Data stored in the vault is never, never available.  Even the LastPass, only you can access it.  Take the. Oh, they had the LastPass security challenge.  That's great. That tells you how secure your passwords are and shows you where you can improve.  And then they have these nice one button update. Your password makes it very easy to fix it.  LastPass is available for everybody.  Use it at home with LastPass Premium or LastPass families for your whole family.  That's really cool because you can share your passwords with your spouse.  Lisa and I do that at home because, you know, she wants to know the Comcast password or whatever.  I just have that all in the family folder.  I also have her designated for something that LastPass calls emergency access.  If something should happen to me, if I pass away, she can request access to my password vault.  I really think that's important.  I keep seeing stories about people who die and know and there's and their loved ones don't have access to the bank accounts.  They can't get in. They're frozen out.  The emergency access is brilliant. It has a nice dead man switch.  If she says, I want access to Leo's passwords, they send me an email and I have a set period of time.  I could set that period of time to respond.  I say, if I don't respond in a week, then give her access. I must really be dead or disabled.  Yeah. Or just, you know, LastPass teams for teams of 50 or fewer.  And then, of course, LastPass Enterprise, what we use is the number one most preferred password manager.  At work, at home, make it right.  It's easy with LastPass.  Literally the first thing I install when I get a new phone, a new computer, I put LastPass on it right away.  I use the plugins for the browsers.  I use the standalone apps.  LastPass.com slash twit.  LastPass.com slash twit.  Find the product that's right for you.  We thank them so much for protecting all our stuff at twit.  Jessica Conant, two Brian's.  Brian X, Chen, Brian McCullough, and me.  We're talking about the tech news of the week.  I think we're done with Apple and Surface.  How about we move on?  Amazon Prime Day starts tomorrow.  Are you guys going to work like crazy tomorrow, Brian X, Chen?  Is it going to be like nuts?  Do you have a war room?  So the wire cutter is going to do, as you know, the wire cutting.

Start time: 1703.36
End time: 1721.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  As you know, the Times owns the wire cutter.  They do such a good job.  Yeah, so they're going to be looking at some of the best deals throughout the day.  And by best deal, we mean not just the lightning deals that pop up,  but they're going to compare the price history to what it used to cost  and determine whether these sales are good deals or not.

Start time: 1721.30
End time: 1726.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In years gone by, they've actually said, that's not a good deal.  Don't buy that.

Start time: 1727.04
End time: 1740.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, because typically when they go through the thousands of sales,  maybe only 4% of them are determined to be good deals.  That's terrible.  It's definitely worth checking out the wire cutter tomorrow.  And I think Tuesday is also Prime Day, right?

Start time: 1741.10
End time: 1760.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's 36 hours.  So they start 3 p.m. Eastern, noon Pacific, and they go through on Monday,  and they go through all day Tuesday.  I feel like it's amateur hour.  Like I shop at Amazon all year, so I'm going to skip Prime Day.  Are you excited, Jessica?  Do you have your eye out for an Instant Pot or something?

Start time: 1761.63
End time: 1782.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it's kind of like Black Friday.  I don't really go out on Black Friday.  Because yeah, I can shop at other times.  I can find deals at other times.  Yeah, and again, like the idea that they're not really even deals half the time.  I hate feeling duped.  So I kind of avoid Prime Day unless there's really something I have my eye on.  I don't need an Instant Pot right now, so I'm good.

Start time: 1783.69

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I feel like that Prime Day is still trying to rope people into buying on Amazon,  like people that are like still buy things offline and things like that.  And so I'm the wrong person to target because anytime I have a need,  within 30 seconds I've already bought on Amazon.  So I'm not in the habit of waiting around for deals or things like that.  So it's all about, to my mind, still bringing, if they still exist,  although Amazon is apparently reaching about 5% of all retail sales at this point,  convincing people to give Amazon a try.  But then also what I find amazing is how much,  and you can't tell me that on some level inside the hallways of Amazon they don't think of this.  Not only is Prime Day great PR for them,  but look at all of the other offline retailers that have to do deals now this week to try to compete.  So they win coming and going because everyone else has to kill themselves  and cut their prices just to try to compete.

Transcript:  So according to CoreSight Research, no Amazon doesn't say,  but according to CoreSight Research, Prime Day may have revenue of $3.4 billion in that 36-hour period.  And sales are expected to shatter last year's record by 40%, 40% becoming their new single-day record.  Of course, people will watch to see if it does that.  Prime is key to e-commerce for Amazon.  They want people to become Prime members.  And you're right, I think, Brian, they've,  part of the problem is they've saturated in certain economic groups, especially high-income people.  They were adding 10 million subscribers.  Again, they don't release these numbers, but analysts think they were adding about 10 million new subscribers a year for the last three years.  But the real issue is now they almost have 100% of high-income people.  They need to find new areas.  According to Consumer Intelligence Research partners, if you're a Prime member, you spend more than twice as much on Amazon, $1,400 a year compared to $600 a year for non-members.

Start time: 1928.59

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the smartest thing that they've done so far with Prime is Whole Foods.  It's crazy.  So the Whole Foods barcode or the Prime barcode that works inside Whole Foods gives you like 10% off whatever's on sale.  Have you used that?  Yeah.  And also, I also have the Amazon gift card, not gift card, credit card, which gives you 5% back at Whole Foods.  So I get 5% and 10% and take all my money.  That's pretty good.  You guys will lock me in forever.  I'm going to shop at Whole Foods forever.  You're going to know all the information about what I buy, both online and offline.  It's genius, right?

Start time: 1961.10
End time: 1964.54

Transcript:  And actually, this will be the first Prime Day with Whole Foods, so you may see some deals.

Start time: 1965.58
End time: 1972.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's 10% back for the credit card this week, or today and tomorrow, I think.  Oh, man.  Sorry, tomorrow.

Start time: 1981.57
End time: 1986.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  See, I bet you, you are going to do something on Prime Day.  You're going to go to Whole Foods.  Exactly.

Start time: 1987.02
End time: 1998.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's true, actually.  I'm going to do that too.  It's cyclical, right?  It went from online to brick and mortar, brick and mortar to online to brick and mortar.  We're just going to keep going around until Amazon dominates all of it.

Transcript:  Ben Thompson at Stratecary says that Amazon's real mission statement would be to get 5% of all economic transactions, period.  End of statement.  Or some fraction thereof.  Pretty brilliant.  I mean, pharmaceuticals at some point too, right?  Yep, they bought PillPack last week for a billion dollars, but that puts them in the pharmacy, online pharmacy business.

Start time: 2023.02
End time: 2031.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the billion dollars is not the headline.  It was the 16 billion or whatever they knocked off the market caps of other people in the pharmacy space.  That's right.  That's right.

Transcript:  Walgreens, CVS stock tumbled that day.  Well, the same thing happened when they bought Whole Foods, right?  Didn't supermarkets freak, stocks freak out?  So Whole Foods actually is, especially when Amazon got it, is not a strong driver.  They hadn't been doing all that well.  The sales had kind of flattened.  So Amazon's acquiring Whole Foods now looks a lot better with Prime Day.  Yes?  I mean, for me.  Well, you just, but you made the case.  And if, I mean, if you've noticed it Brian next gen, I would guess that everybody's thinking that, right?

Start time: 2070.40
End time: 2077.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess people have my shopping habits of like going to Whole Foods because it's like two blocks away from me.  Is, okay, we call it Whole Paycheck around here.

Transcript:  Okay.  But what Jessica pointed out about it, offline, going to online and then coming back to actual physical retail.  I mean, those Amazon ghost stores, you can't tell me 10 years from now they won't be on every corner like Starbucks.  Shouldn't we be afraid of this?  Well, because the genius strategy is, is you, you create an e-commerce juggernaut.  You kill everybody in traditional retail and then you have all these empty storefronts that you can just move right into.

Start time: 2120.22
End time: 2147.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, that's why I'll tell you why, Jessica, because as soon as Amazon controlled all book sales and eliminated book stores in communities all over the country, they jacked the price up.  As soon as you control all sales, the price is yours to send.  Now, I don't know if Amazon will become predatory.  Probably they won't because they're happy that they get five percent of all retail spend.  That's mind boggling.

Start time: 2151.08
End time: 2194.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do. I do. No, I worry because that is, okay, I do have a problem with capitalism, not garden variety capitalism.  But but that's what happens in capitalism.  If cap, you know, Adam Smith's, you know, hand of the market works only if there's competition.  Right. As soon as the breaking point of capitalism is monopoly, that's why we have antitrust laws, because as soon as a company can dominate, then there's then there's, you know, supply and demand doesn't mean anything.  Prices now can be anything they want because they have 100 percent of the market.  Amazon is has 49 percent of the U.S. e-commerce market.  That's mind boggling.

Start time: 2195.38
End time: 2198.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And yet Apple was busted for antitrust for e-books.  Remember that? Right. Yeah.

Start time: 2199.90
End time: 2238.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I want to point out something, and I've been trying feverishly to confirm this or not.  But so, OK, fifty nine percent of the e-commerce market, but five percent of all retail spend is insane if that includes things like car sales.  Right. Because that's the thing that in other numbers like this, when they are talking about Amazon taking over retail and things like that, they always caveat.  You've got to back out car sales because that would be such a huge percentage.  But they're specifically using the words retail, all retail spend.  So if that includes the car market as well and they've gotten five percent of that, that's absolutely insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If there was a prime deal.  Yeah. Two day delivery.  Yeah. Well, is there a world where Amazon owns a lot of our retail world, even in physical space?  But there are also mom and pop shops.  There's also a local market.  Like, is that a possibility?  Because that sounds OK.

Start time: 2276.31
End time: 2360.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Wouldn't you?  Don't you want those to continue?  I do. I like that.  I like local stores.  I look at though we live in a relatively 50,000 person community.  So that's kind of mid-sized small town America here in Petaluma.  And the downtown is all antique stores and boutique furniture stores.  And there is a bookstore.  I don't know how they survive, but nobody everybody buys online.  And there's no reason to have a bookstore.  And now that Amazon's in groceries as well.  Look at this graph.  This is a little bit scary.  This is the top 10 U.S. companies ranked by e-commerce.  Again, now this is the e-commerce part.  Sales share.  Amazon, that's the one where it's 49 percent.  The next competitor, eBay, six percent.  There's nobody even close.  Who shops on eBay? Sorry.  Yeah. Well, Apple's the next.  Walmart, which has Walmart.  It was trying to get into e-commerce.  The Home Depot, Best Buy, QVC.  Really?  I thought Macy's was doing well.  I guess not.  This is e-commerce, right?  Costco, Wayfair.  Actually, the fact that Wayfair has 1.1 percent.  I'm sure very happy with that.  That's hundreds of millions of dollars.  I didn't even know that was a well-known brand at all.

Start time: 2361.22
End time: 2363.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  They're big e-commerce.  I bought a rug on there once.

Start time: 2364.00
End time: 2371.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, there you go.  You see?  OK. So does it not worry you, Jessica, that one company would be so dominant?

Start time: 2372.22
End time: 2403.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it totally does.  Like that graph is scary.  And I just don't know if it's the sci-fi dystopia.  You know, it's easy to jump to that.  This is what this is going to lead to.  And this company is going to control everything.  Prices are going to be whatever.  And yeah, like we should definitely keep an eye on that.  But I also see more of a movement for shop local, like these kinds of community-based awareness programs that are kind of popping up.  And I really like that.  So maybe it'll balance out in the end.  I'm optimistic, I guess.

Start time: 2404.74
End time: 2422.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I, at the risk of sounding like an Amazon apologist by jumping in a second time and playing devil's advocate, the article, the TechCrunch article that you had up, Leo, specifically notes that the main driver for Amazon at this point is their marketplace, is allowing other retailers to sell.

Start time: 2422.08
End time: 2426.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Half of all those sales are from non-Amazon companies.

Start time: 2427.32
End time: 2463.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So even, I mean, the problem is, is that functionally, does anyone really know that?  They think they're getting it from Amazon anyway.  And Amazon gets insane margins.  The margins for allowing someone to use their warehousing and logistics and sell on the site is actually better for Amazon when Amazon sells a product itself directly.  So on the one hand, I don't even know if I'm making a coherent point here.  I am saying that Amazon's main growth is allowing other people to play e-commerce.  But at the same time, again, does anyone know that?  They just think they're shopping from Amazon anyway.

Start time: 2464.02
End time: 2495.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know who does know that?  Jeff Bezos, who is clearly brilliant, now the richest man in the world by like 10, 20, 30 billion dollars.  He, I mean, if I put myself in his shoes, sure.  I don't mind if everybody sells through Amazon.  Then I don't have to warehouse it.  I don't have to do any logistics.  All I have to do is take a percentage of the transaction.  That's exactly what he wants.  I bet you he'd like 100 percent of all the sales on Amazon to be marketplace.  Then you don't have to have a warehouse.  Your life is much easier.

Start time: 2496.28
End time: 2536.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the point is that they're they're charging the fees to use their warehousing to you because they've already it's a sunk cost.  It's already the warehouses exist.  They built them right.  So they can charge the fee for the warehousing and logistics that is actually it ends up in the end.  I've seen this several places that that they're making more money because being a middleman for other people, being the will take care of all this stuff.  You know, if you're if you're starting a T-shirt company or whatever it is and you don't like they can instantly give you worldwide scale and ability to serve any customer.  And so if Amazon says, yeah, that'll be 15 percent like that, that seems reasonable.

Start time: 2536.64
End time: 2564.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, actually, worldwide is an interesting word there because Amazon does not succeed very well outside the U.S.  And they face huge competition from companies outside the U.S., particularly in China.  What's the big Chinese?  Alibaba. Alibaba is bigger than Amazon, right?  Yeah, so I wonder if you'll start to see each region have its own equivalent of Amazon.  Why is it so hard for Amazon to do well outside the U.S.?  Is it a U.S. phenomenon?

There is a Paytm.  I'm sorry, that's a financial services company.  Paytm. Alibaba owns that.  That's the other big thing in parts of the world where banks and checkbooks are not common.  These digital payment services like M-Pesa and Paytm, those are huge.  And another very nice way to make money.  There you don't really have any.  You don't have to worry about employees.

One of the big businesses Amazon has that came out of nowhere was Amazon Web Services, which is hugely profitable.  They're totally dominant over competitors like IBM and Microsoft.  They're now looking at making switches and selling network switches.  So bye-bye, Juniper. Bye-bye, Cisco.  Here comes Amazon.  That's got to scare anybody when Amazon says, you know, I kind of like your business.

I feel like this is the secret economy, the secret magic behind everything we're talking about here that nobody pays any attention to is data centers.  Infrastructure.  Infrastructure.  And you know, every transaction that you do is going through dozens of computers and you don't, we don't, it's the cloud.  That's the problem with the word cloud.  It's not sexy.  It hides all this stuff.  It is though fascinating, isn't it?  And people like you guys who are infrastructure experts, man, you guys, you got the keys to the kingdom.  I don't, I'm pointing to some of our audience members who work for a company, a little company in Mountain View that does a little bit of this stuff.  Facebook is, what's the deal with Facebook?  Where do we stand with Facebook?  You haven't been hearing a lot about Mark Zuckerberg lately.  Is he high?  Is he high?

Transcript:  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  That was like a few weeks ago, and that's kind of significant because, like, everybody  agrees that they handle the Cambridge Analytica scandal quite poorly in terms of, you know,  communicating with the world and the press.  I don't know if there's causation with that episode, but Elliot's gone.  Elliot was his name, right?  Schrage.

Transcript:  And it's kind of, it's fascinating to me that, like, it seems that Facebook and Google are  both ahead of Apple in terms of AI and machine learning and these kinds of real future aspects.  So again, I don't know where Apple's future lies, right?  And I don't think it's AI either, so...

Start time: 2921.56
End time: 2925.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple has combined the Siri team and the machine learning team.

Start time: 2925.10

Start time: 2929.29
End time: 2941.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Andrea.  And so he's going to be in charge now of both.  You got to figure Apple's saying, we don't want to be left in the dust here.  Well, I guess...  But they kind of are right now.  They really are.  Yeah.

Start time: 2942.08
End time: 2966.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the question of Apple, so they want to take a strong stance on privacy, right?  And the question is, do you need to store information about people in the cloud to have  good AI and kind of aggregate all that versus like Google and Facebook are obviously doing  that and so far ahead?  But can Apple catch up to them if they stay committed to privacy and not collecting your  information and playing in the cloud?  But see, I think that's the opportunity.

Start time: 2967.22
End time: 2975.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Apple's done something interesting with iOS 12 because they do want to beef up Siri,  but they do want to be known as the privacy company, right?  So that seems like conflicting.

Start time: 2976.00
End time: 3001.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but they say that they do it all on the phone, right?  So like Siri suggestions is a new AI tool in iOS 12.  And it's supposed to be studying what you do to make suggestions like, hey, maybe you  should turn off the phone because you're having dinner right now or something like that.  Like, do not disturb, right?  But can it really be that smart if they're just doing everything using data from your  phone versus like the cloud and the collective whole of like people's behaviors and patterns?

Start time: 3002.02
End time: 3046.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they've they've actually done a little sleight of hand because one of the things  Siri suggestion uses is what your apps know about you.  So instead of Apple knowing anything about you, they palm it off and they use this as a  demonstration.  The Peets app, right?  Every time I drive by Peets, I stop for a mint mojito.  Remember, they demonstrated that.  Yeah.  So the Peets app is paying attention to your location and what you buy and then signals  Apple.  This would be a good thing to do.  So Apple in effect says to Siri, well, we don't we're not going to collect information, but  we'll let the apps on your iPhone collect information and then we'll use those to make Siri  smarter.  I thought that was quite a clever little sleight of hand, actually.

Start time: 3047.08
End time: 3133.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Did you see?  Oh, sorry.  Go ahead.  So they were talking about this story from two weeks ago, or maybe it was before the  fourth about how they're rebuilding Apple Maps from the ground up.  Yeah.  And, you know, sorry, they they admitted that they're going to use data from everybody's  searching on maps on iPhones and things like that.  And they go back and forth a thousand times in the articles I read about this saying,  no, trust me, it's anonymized.  We're using your data, but we're not going to know all this all this stuff.  The thing about getting AI systems better and machine learning systems better is you  need data.  It's recursive.  So the more data you can feed these systems, the better they get.  So it's sort of like and I know we could it's a whole thing about the cultural differences  between different companies and things like that.  But, you know, Google and Facebook, they have nothing but reams of data.  And so the engineers there to them, it's just natural to use those things.  But it does.  The question will become when you have to do something and make a big system like Apple  Maps better, you have to use the data that's available to you.  I mean, I'd rather Apple bend over backwards to make sure that they're protecting privacy  and things like that as opposed to just using it.  But I don't think Apple, if they're going to compete in AI, you know, like Jessica's  concerned about, you got to use the data that your users are collecting or generating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple says, and this is really interesting because I think that they completely understand  this challenge.  And what they told Matthew Panzerino from TechCrunch is, well, what we do is we don't  take the beginning of your trip.  We don't take the end of your trip.  We just take anonymized stuff from the middle of your trip that could be anybody.  There's downsides to that, though.  They don't know the entrance to a building and they have other ways of figuring that  part out.  I think if Apple really applies itself and its creativity, knowing that its mission is  I actually really find this fascinating.  Its mission is to keep its users private.  That's a big selling point for iPhone users to protect their privacy.  Can we do something intelligent?  And I think if they apply and that's why I find it interesting that they hired John  Andrea, who has a pretty good track record at Google with this stuff.  Maybe they'll fail.  You know what?  Maybe you can't, but I'm glad somebody's trying.  It's almost as if you had somebody in the ad tech business say, hey, could we customize  ads without collecting dossiers on everybody who uses Facebook?  Could we somehow do this?  I would applaud them doing it even if they just found out five years in.  Well, no, it's not competitive.  I want Apple to at least try.

Start time: 3209.46
End time: 3215.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think an argument can be made that it's kind of lazy to just collect everything.  It is lazy.  It's the easy thing to do.  I think maybe Apple can do it.

Start time: 3222.40
End time: 3277.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's really important that we all keep our eye on Apple and that when they claim  things like we anonymize the data, it really is anonymized.  And we've seen many times where so-called anonymized data, in fact, doesn't end up being  anonymous because it turns out data tells you a lot about people that they really are doing  what they say they do.  Apple's pretty good about publishing white papers and explaining in a technical fashion  what they're up to.  I think that's important.  We need to demand that of them.  But I also want to encourage them to try.  And so I guess that's the pat on the back that I hope that they get, which is good for  you on trying.  We'll keep an eye on it.  Make sure you really do that.  Don't end up being lazy.  But boy, it would be nice, wouldn't it, to have a phone that you could use that didn't  track your every move or a social network you could use that wasn't building a dossier  on you that they were happy to hand over to any government that asked.

Start time: 3277.34
End time: 3289.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But do you think average people care as much as we do?  And that's the thing.  That's why it's our job.  So others can get away with being lazy and Apple can keep trying harder, but people might  not care.  That's kind of the issue, kind of the challenge.

Start time: 3289.93

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks, streamlining your business operations with  FreshBooks, the easy to use cloud accounting software built for the small business owner,  the freelancer.  When I started using it, when I was freelancing back in 2004, I might have been one of their  first customers.  It's right when they first started.  I was complaining about every end of the month I had to do invoicing and sometimes I'd put  it off and then I wouldn't get paid.  It's one of the worst parts of freelancing is doing the books, right?  You didn't get into it unless you're a bookkeeping freelancer.  But for most of us, we got into it for other things, but you still have to do those invoices  and those books.  FreshBooks made it so easy.  By doing your invoices, making it really easy to do your invoices, beautiful looking invoices  that make it easier for your customers, your clients to pay you, you're actually beginning  the process of doing accounting without doing accounting.  It will automatically connect to your bank account, update expenses daily.  You can import them in bulk.  You can even take a picture of a receipt, upload it, let FreshBooks add that to your  Maybe even add it to your expense report so you can get paid back in the invoice.  You'll keep tabs of your business no matter where you are.  FreshBooks mobile app is awesome for iOS and Android.  So now you have the invoices.  That means you have accounts receivable, you have accounts payable, you have accounts paid,  you have your expenses.  Guess what?  You've got your accounting done without even doing anything about it, just kind of in the  process.  It is so fantastic for the first time ever.  I knew whether I was making money or not.  I usually find that out when you have paid your taxes at the end of the year on April  15th.  You go, oh, I guess I didn't make any money this year.  There's no need to chase clients for payment anymore because you can accept online payments  directly from your invoice, which means incidentally you get paid an average of twice as fast.  Clients think paying in bills, you know this, paying bills is as much of a pain as making  bills, but if you make it easy for them, they're going to pay you faster.  You can always see which invoices have been sent, but also which ones have been viewed,  paid, overdue invoices.  Import clients from a CSV file if you've got them.  Bill for time by client specific project.  If you've heard me talk about FreshBooks before, you notice they keep adding new features.  That's one of the advantages of FreshBooks.  It's a web-based application, so it's always getting better.  They now have a revenue streams graph that lets you know exactly where your invoice and  non-invoice revenue, which might include online sales or ads, things like that, is coming  from so you can plan for growth, make informed decisions about how to diversify.  They now have integration with Microsoft Outlook payments.  That means it's even easier for users to pay your invoices from Outlook.  24 million people have used FreshBooks to painlessly send invoices, track time, capture  expenses and then getting back to doing what they love.  Shouldn't you take a look at FreshBooks?  We've got a 30-day free trial for you.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  You're this week in tech in the How did you hear about us section, if you will.  That way we'll get credit and you'll get 30 days free.  FreshBooks.com slash twit.  Jason Howland, All About Android, was talking about future phones.  Really interesting article in the Washington Post this week by Jeffrey Fowler on the new  smartphones.  I don't know if you saw this, Brian X Chen.  This screen is something that I think this is made up, but Samsung is looking at a flexible  screen that opens up in a phone to make a giant sized screen, almost a tablet.  There's phones from, he refers to sci-fi too and the photo the photoable device from Westworld,  which is somewhat like this.  But also this is rumored to be the next phone from the camera startup, Light.  That's the company that makes that 16 lens camera.  This is a nine lens camera.  They're in a circle on the back.  I guess it's more than a rumor since this prototype comes from Light.  This would be a way to turn a camera and a phone into something that is as good as a  DSLR.  Some of this is made up.  Some of this is real.  I think there's a genuine interest in creating some of this.  This is a prototype Y-charge adapter that lets the phone charge just by sitting on a  wireless table.  Of course, iPhones could do that with Qi charging.  I'm still waiting for my local bar to get a Qi charger.  Of course, there's Magic Leaps headgear.  This was an interesting article about the future of technology.  How much of this is just BS sci-fi?  How much of it's actually going to happen?

Start time: 3878.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  People have been talking about flexible screens for a while.  I think one of the big challenges is batteries.  Batteries are really delicate.  In flexible.  Exactly.  When you make a flexible battery, you have to make it pass all these different safety  tests in order to bring it to mass market.  People have been talking about this for years.  It is really interesting though.  I really hope that it happens at some point, especially the flexible aspect of being able  to put it in your pocket with having a bigger screen and things like that.  What else was in the article besides the screen?  How about this light camera with multiple lenses?  That seems more realistically coming sooner, I think, because phones already are becoming  more and more DSLR-like.

I think it'll be a while until we get to an actual book phone.  I'm actually more excited about the cameras because where I see our phones and all of  our mobile devices really connecting is in AR.  That's where we get magic leap and all that too.  The camera is really important when it comes to filming your environment and then putting  things on top of that.  I see cameras being increasingly important in phones as we go on.

Transcript:  Although some analysts think that Samsung will do this new phone, start manufacturing  it in the fall.  I don't know if it'll be an S10 or some people are saying it'll SX, but one analyst says  it will cost almost $2,000.  Now how much would you pay?  That seems a little ... I don't know.  I'm not sure why.  This is a Korean Times story that says the non-subsidized price would be anywhere from  $1,850 to $2,000 partly because of these screens.  The 7.3 inch OLED screen, 4.5 inches folded, 7.3 inches when opened might be pretty pricey.  Samsung has shown these for years.

Oh, Emmy nominations are out.  Normally we don't talk about the Emmy nominations on tech shows, but this time we do because  Netflix got more than HBO 112 Emmy Award nominations on Thursday.  That's more than any other television network breaking the streak that HBO held onto for  17 years.  We've heard a story, and maybe it's been a little bit debunked, but that the new owners  of HBO, AT&T, came in and said, you guys, we need to look more like Netflix.  You're doing too few shows.  We don't need hours per week.  We need hours per day of viewing.

Transcript:  Now, AT&T is in the cable business in effect because of U-verse.  Or the pipes business.  They're in the pipes business because of AT&T, but they also own DirecTV, so they're in the  satelite.  So they are in the premium TV business.  I mean, you could argue the reason they bought Time Warner is because they wanted to have  content so that they could eventually be an over-the-top business, right?

Transcript:  And also, don't forget, Leo, everybody's betting on 5G being the thing that, this game changer  that maybe you wouldn't pay your cable company because 5G would be so good that it would  kind of be a wash.  But so the point I was going to say is, so if strategically you think that that's what  they want to do, they want to, people are hoping that there will be Netflix and then  somebody else.  Maybe the Disney OTT, maybe AT&T's OTT.  Well then, what you would do is you would lead with HBO, right?

And we let Netflix throw all the spaghetti against the wall at once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly, so I think what everyone reacted to and which I think still stands as a concern  is that what he was saying is he's like, we need to do more things, more content, we need  more 10-minute shows, 15-minute shows, we need more shows, more shows, more shows.  I don't think that that's a bad idea and obviously what they want is the same level of data in  terms of people's watching habits and tastes and things like that.  But don't lead with that.  Do that in the background.  Leave HBO alone, write its brand to create your OTT service, and then quietly introduce  all the other changes that you want to do and then no one will care.  But I'm still concerned that if this is the attitude they're taking and they're writing  into town, showing up at HBO and saying, guys, everything's going to change, that would have  me worried.

I remember when Tech TV was sold to Comcast, that's exactly what they said.  We bought you because we love you.  They didn't love us.  Amen.  And I guarantee you, AT&T will tell HBO, oh, we bought Time Warner because we love all  of their products and we certainly aren't going to change anything you do until next  year when we're going to just completely fire everybody and start all over again.

And I really buy into their theory about the show, which is that the show fundamentally  doesn't care about humans.  About you.  About you or humans or having any of their characters have an interesting, it's more  interested in the machinery.  It's almost like, and maybe this is a smart thing to do, Lost convinced everyone that  what you want to do is make a show for Reddit, make a puzzle show that everybody, and it's  succeeding on that level, but it's not succeeding at all.

But I think HBO has shown its interest in kind of picking up maybe smaller shows, like  high maintenance and stuff like that and making them their its own.

Transcript:  That's exactly what they're going to do.  And that's what will completely destroy HBO.  It's possible.  And I say that as a podcaster, not as a YouTube star.  But I have to say, that's exactly what happens is these companies go, we don't know what  the hell, why is it people watch?  Get a YouTube star.  And the thing is, it's never worked because YouTube is its own, it's sui generis, it's  its own thing.  And stardom on YouTube is fine on YouTube, but it never seems to translate to anything  else.  And I just and the same thing with podcasts, too, to be honest.  I really feel like HBO should just stay HBO and try to.  I read an interesting.  I guess it was a Twitter stream comparing this is a really sounds far afield, but it's  going to make sense talking about Elon Musk's submarine that they made.  He made to save the kids in the Thailand cave.  And, oh, I know what it was.  It was Zainab Tufiki's article.  And I saw that today, too.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where she says, you know, this is really an interesting contrast between  Silicon Valley's ill, let's jump in and let's fix it.  Let's throw money at it.  Let's use we're the smartest guys in the room.  We can solve anything versus the slow safety mentality that makes airline travel so safe  these days.  The idea that you develop expertise, you're careful, you're cautious, you think about  it, you don't rush in.  You're not the smartest guys in the room.  And that has in the long run proven a better thing.  That's what saved those kids when Elon's submarine wouldn't even have worked.  We're going to talk a little bit about Elon because he seems to be going off the deep  end with this whole thing.  I feel like that's exactly the kind of thing.  It's the HBO versus YouTube mentality and that HBO is very much old school, cautious,  great writing.  Careful filmmaking.  They still do one thing though that Netflix doesn't do and this may be the big differentiator.  They release shows one week at a time.  That sucks.

And Netflix called, Reed called, and Reed Hastings said, we'll write you a check for  $100 million today to put it on Netflix.  And Brunetti said, okay.  And he called Spacey and Spacey said, yeah.  And the thing that put them over the top wasn't the $100 million, they could have gotten that  from HBO or whoever they were talking to.  It was the release it all at once thing.  For a whole season, you produce it all and then you release it all.  And for some reason, they preferred that model.  I'm not sure why.  I didn't ask them that question.

Our show today brought...  We'll talk about it in a second.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans.  Let's talk about the biggest expenditure you're going to make in your life, the most important,  the biggest check you will ever write.  It's that new home.  That's a big deal, right?  And it's a stressful time.  One of the things that makes it stressful, of course, is getting the loan.  The other thing that's making it stressful these days is as you're house hunting, the  interest rates are going up and there's pressure.  Let's just buy this house because I don't know how much it's going to cost us to buy  it in a month.  But it takes a while to get a house that you really like.  This is where Rocket Mortgage from Quicken Loans really can make a difference.  They want to do something about it.  This is exactly the kind of thing you'd expect from the best mortgage lender in the business.  We've talked about it before.  They have something they call the power buying process.  Here's how it works.  Quicken Loans is going to verify your income assets and credit.  They'll do this in less than a day.  And you'll get verified approval, which by the way, right up front is great because you're  basically a cash buyer.  From the point of view of the seller, if you've got a loan approval, that means they don't  have to worry.  They know you're good for it.  But then, this is when the best thing happens.  When you're verified, you qualify for Rocket Mortgage's all new exclusive rate shield  approval.  They'll lock up your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.  There's no anxiety.  Rates aren't going to go up.  In fact, they might even go down.  If the rates go up, your rate stays the same.  If rates go down, your rate drops.  Either way, you win.  Exactly, exactly what you want.  Trust me as somebody who's done this a few times.  To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit two.  That's rocketmortgage.com slash twit.  And the number two.  Rate shield approval is valid only on certain 30-year purchase transactions.  Additional conditions or exclusions may apply based on quick and loans data in comparison  to public data records.  Equal housing lender, licensed in all 50 states, and MLSconsumeraccess.org number 3038.  It's rocketmortgage.com slash twit two.  Elon has deleted some of the tweets that he put out today.  What'd he say?  Yeah, that's the problem with Twitter, right?  I miss them.  You can always, nothing is deleteable.  So it started when a British diver named Verne Unsworth did an interview in which he was  asked, what do you think about Elon Musk's idea with the submarine?  I think he's submarine where it hurts.  He said you can stick its submarine where it hurts.

Start time: 4983.32
End time: 5010.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He just had absolutely no chance of working.  He had no conception of what the cave passage was like.  The submarine I believe was about five foot six long, rigid, so it wouldn't have gone  around corners or around any obstacles.  It wouldn't have made the first 50 meters into the cave from the dive start point.  Just a PR stunt.

Start time: 5016.32
End time: 5117.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So this really affronted Elon.  Now, by the way, I don't blame him because I'm going to give him credit.  He leapt in.  He said, look, we want to get these kids out of the cave.  I'm going to send engineers.  We're going to build this thing.  If it helps, it helps.  If it doesn't, no big deal.  But at least he did something, right?  But when he saw this tweet, this interview with Verne Unsworth, he kind of went crazy.  He really didn't like the notion that it was a PR thing.  He fired back.  Never saw this British ex-pat guy who lives in Thailand at any point when we were in the  caves.  The only people in sight were the Thai Navy Army guys who were great.  Thai Navy SEALs escorted us in, total opposite of wanting us to leave.  Then he says, well, he goes on and on.  Eventually he says, the guy's a pedophile.  You know what?  He says, we'll make one of the mini sub pods going all the way to cave five.  No problems.  No problemo.  Sorry, pedo guy.  You really did ask for it.  Then somebody said, please delete that.  Calling someone a pedo is not cool.  Somebody else tweets, Elon, you should try inventing a device that prevents you from  using Twitter.  By the way, I would buy that device.  Elon deletes those tweets.  Although he at one point said, bet you a signed dollar, it's true.  It started a couple of weeks ago with an analyst call where Elon kind of went off on an analyst.  Maybe reasonably because the guy was asking him whether he was ever going to be able to  make all those Model 3s and so forth.  He shut him down.  He seems to be getting a little wilder though.  Yeah.

The quotes from him are, I've been sleeping under the desk and all that sort of...  Is it possible that the main problem aside from, okay, maybe he's been going through  a lot because maybe Tesla is really having a hard time in a crunch period.  They could be running out of money.

Transcript:  Zeynep writes in the New York Times, this is an opinion piece I should point out, what  Elon Musk should learn from the Thailand cave rescue.  Instead of venting, Mr. Musk, indeed Silicon Valley as a whole, could perhaps see the Thai  operation as a lesson.  This was a most improbable rescue against the longest odds.  The Silicon Valley model for doing things is a mix of can-do optimism, a faith that  expertise in, oh, this is the key one, that expertise in one domain can be transferred  seamlessly to another and a preference for rapid, flashy, high profile action.  But she writes, what got the kid and their coach out of the cave was a different model,  a slower, more methodical, more narrowly specialized approach to problems, one that has turned  many risky enterprises into safe endeavors, commercial airline travel, for example, or  rock climbing, both of which have extensive protocols and safety procedures that have  taken years to develop.  This quote safety culture and quote model is neither stilted nor creative.  On the contrary, deep expertise, lengthy training, the ability to learn from experience is a  valuable form of ingenuity.  She says that's what helped Sully Sullenberger to land that airplane on the Hudson River  in 2009.  But that's by contrast, Silicon Valley moguls seem to favor spending money on improbable  but impressive sounding long shots.  You can't say that's not true.  She talks about Mark Zuckerberg's gift of $100 million to the New Jersey schools that  did nothing to improve them.  If Silicon Valley wants to help the world, she concludes, there's a lot it can do starting  with making its own products safer and its own companies more just, perhaps more important  it can develop a respect for hard earned expertise in areas other than its own.  That's an indictment.  I think that's probably what started Elon Sunday off badly.

Transcript:  Of course, Tesla framed it as the driver's fault or somebody else's fault or whatever.  I talked to someone who does self-driving cars and he's still working on it, but his  argument was how many cars have autopilot on the road right now?  What is it?  Three cars out of three people died from it?  That's pretty bad odds, right?  You got to consider that just because three is a small number.  It's not necessarily a great argument for this failing and that people are basically  beta testing auto driving software and dying.

Transcript:  It made me think twice about it.  I use it.  I love it.  What it seems to be the case is that sometimes it gets confused and actually dives off the  road.  I use it, but I use it as if at any time it could fail drastically.  I do notice that when GM with their new Cadillac and Nissan with their new Leaf put these kinds  of self-driving technologies in, they're much more conservative.  The old school car companies, for instance, GM has this feature in its Cadillac CTS, I  think it is.  We drove it the other day, but it only does it on highways.  It's mapped.  It won't even do it on city roads even though it could and certainly the Tesla does.  They're a little more conservative.  Yeah, for sure.  I think that might be the right way to go.  Certainly naming it autopilot was a lot of hubris.  That's what gets people into trouble, right?  That's what gets somebody in the backseat napping while the car is driving.  Not a good idea.

Transcript:  Leo, not to provide you with a good segue to a different story here, but-  Please do, Brian.  You know I want it.  The analogy is Google with their moonshots.  You know, it's a very engineer's view of the world to think that because I was so smart  to solve this incredibly difficult problem that I can solve another problem.  And the story that I'm alluding to is Google's X division graduating, as they say, a couple  of their moonshot companies this week.  But if you think about it, Larry and Sergey have wanted to change the world for 20 years  now and they've wanted to evolve Google beyond simply making 98% of their money from advertising  to something else, anything else.  And they haven't been able to do it for 20 years.  And I'm not saying they won't and I'm not saying that that's hubris or whatever, but  it's not easy.  And just because you are a genius and you solve one insane difficult problem, I think  Zeynep's most cogent point was that that doesn't mean that you can do everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I say this all the time and nobody ever agrees with me, but I feel like that a lot of the  woes in our society, they come from the fact that it's really easy, especially with Twitter,  but other technologies too, to say something without any thought that you would, you know,  in an earlier time, with Jessica's typewriter, you would have had some time to regret it,  some time to think about it, some time to step back from the cliff.  But Twitter, it just encourages this visceral, instantaneous response that is more times  than not a mistake.  No?  Maybe not.

Start time: 5690.60
End time: 5718.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe it's just-  Well, and one thing I see it doing, like, I wouldn't say that Twitter and these kinds  of services have exacerbated any problems in tech, any problems with ego at top levels  of major companies.  I think it's just exposing it more than that.  It's exposing a lot of things and in that sense, it's kind of a positive, but it's  also, there's no response to it, right?  It just kind of exists now and we're figuring out how to deal with that.

Transcript:  This is where my age distinguishes me from the rest of you guys, because I'm old enough  to have been covering technology at the beginning, the onset of the consumer access to the internet  that generation like John Perry Barlow that was very optimistic about this, and way over,  it turns out, foolishly and way over optimistic.  We really thought that the internet would democratize speech, that yes, of course, bad  guys would get the chance to speak too, but that sunlight would disinfect.  Just as you said, Jessica, by making it be more public, all the bad ideas would come  and then we could throw them out and move on from them.  Foolishly, it's a shame and it makes me sad because we were all very, in the early 90s,  very optimistic about what this internet could do and how it was going to change the world.  It's done some of that, but it's also done some stuff that we didn't anticipate at all.

Transcript:  It's also interesting to look at the next generation of people that are using the internet.  Some of us are millennials, but the people who are even younger, they're all using Snapchat  now.  Smartly, because it doesn't live.  It's not immortalized and they have these shadows of social media, which eventually  just disappear.  Can I segue into my story?  I only am thinking about this because I was writing about Apple's screen time feature.  That new feature in iOS 12 that's coming out in the fall, it's basically acknowledging  people have addiction problems.  You can monitor the amount of time that you use on the iPhone and you can set limits like  a time limit for Snapchat or Facebook or whatever.  Once you run out of time, it kicks you out of the app, it locks you out, you can't use  it anymore.  I wanted to test it on myself because I think I'm a compulsive phone user.  I pick up my phone every five minutes.  Who isn't?  Pretty much all of us are.

Transcript:  I wanted a teenager to test it on, so I don't have a kid, but I borrowed my boss's teenager  for about a month.  Or as you call him, a screen-ager.  A screen-ager.  Or her, I should say.  Yeah, so I installed the iOS 12 beta on an iPhone X that I loaned to her and I watched  her app usage for about a week to see how her phone usage was in general.  She was using the phone six hours a day, which is a lot.  Her peak was eight hours a day.  That's our nine to five schedule.  She was using the phone all day.  I found that kind of crazy.  I told her boss about that.  Her boss, or sorry, my boss.  I told my boss about that.  Her dad.  Also her boss.  And my boss just flipped out.  She was sending all these text messages to her daughter.  She was like, what the, why would you spend seven hours on a phone?  You busted her.  And you were looking at your phone at midnight.  You busted her.  And then, and what's fascinating, so even immediately before, I mean immediately after  I set the time limit for Snapchat, because that's what she was using the most, her app  usage, or sorry, her phone usage dropped to four hours and 44 minutes on average per week.  And then by the third week, it dropped to three hours after these limits kicked in.  And...  Now I'm worried.

Start time: 5920.71
End time: 5955.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me look at mine.  Are you using iOS 12?  Yeah.  Now I'm really worried.  You say that your screen time on average...  Mine is three hours and 46 to begin with.  Three hours and 45.  It's three hours and 46 to begin with.  Three hours and 46.  Now before I look at mine, in my defense, I want to point out, I've been playing a lot  of Pokemon Go lately.  Okay?  Are you still playing that game?  I came back to it.  It's got even better.  It's much better now.  Isn't it?  I understand completely.

Where is it that I find out?  Screen time all devices.  Yeah, there you go.  Okay, last seven days.  Oh, good news.  I've only spent 29 minutes.  Okay, that's wrong.

Pokemon Go is number one, followed by my Reddit app, Narwhal, then Hangouts, Instagram.  But this is like such a small amount of time that I don't think it Venmo's...  Venmo?  How much time can you spend on Venmo?  Nine minutes, it turns out.  I pick up the phone 12 times a day.  But this was...  See, this is only...  I don't know what's going on here.  It's only for one day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Get out of here.  I set a limit for social media for myself for one hour because I found that I was using  Twitter for like four hours a day or something, three hours a day.  And yet I post like on Twitter maybe once a week or something, like two or three times  a week.  So I was just lurking on Twitter.  I was reading people's...  That's the only way to use Twitter.  That's the safe way.  I guess so, but it was just a waste of time.  I wasn't doing anything productive.  It is a waste of time, though.  But even after I did that, I found other ways to waste time on the phone.  I kept checking my banking app to see if any more money was magically appearing for no  reason.  Do I have any more money?  No, not yet.  Any more money now?  No, not yet.  No, not yet.  Oh, God, what gives?  Where's all my money?  I should be rich by now.  I kept on checking.  What's going on with Trump?  What's going on with Trump?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So at the end of the day, so what's funny is a teenager spent less time on the phone  than I did at the end of the experiment.  After three weeks, she cut down to three hours.

Start time: 6090.04
End time: 6094.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 6094.52
End time: 6116.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It was a combination of her mom yelling at her and I set the limits for Snapchat, Safari  and something else for her.  Interesting.  I think games, games.  Yeah.  And she was also just very disciplined because she was asking for more limits.  She actually liked it.  You know, she like at the end of each week, I checked in with her and she was like, can  you add another limit for Netflix?  Because I'm wasting too much time on that.  So do you have kids by the way?

Start time: 6116.30
End time: 6120.52

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I just wonder how this is going to turn out when when this releases in fall and whether  parents are going to have as much success as I did with their teenagers, you know, because  I know that a lot of people feel like it's a problem for their teens right now.  And I mean, at least in this experiment, Sophie, the teenager, was fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  My kids aren't quite this old yet.  But Brian, so wait.  Yeah.  You how do you set your kids like the limit?  Like you have to go into their phone physically or is there like a parental control over other  devices?  Yeah.

Start time: 6159.24
End time: 6197.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll just back up for a second.  So when you set up screen time, you can set up a family account as well.  So you can be the parent.  You set yourself up as a parent and you can add people as your kids.  And because they're your kids, you can add the restrictions, including screen time.  So in that case, you can you can see their statistics in the same way you see your own.  And you can add limits after you see them.  Yeah, I think it's really great.  It's really buggy right now.  I wouldn't use it until fall.  But I think the concept in general is awesome.  I think people are going to like it a lot.  It's going to be pretty hard to bypass because you need a passcode to to bypass the when  it locks you out of the application, for example.

Transcript:  Can we talk about Fortnite?  I hate Fortnite.  Oh, Fortnite's awesome.  Oh, God.  I tried it a few days ago with my fiance's brother and other brother.  Anyway, we were playing as a group for the first time and it's just such an agonizing  game, right?  Because like they just drop you into the deep end.  They don't teach you how to play it at all.  You're surrounded by all these teenagers who are just really, really good.  You run around for 20 minutes not knowing what the hell you're doing.  20 minutes?  I get about three.  Yeah.  And you learn the controls.  You're doing really well, Brian.  And you finally see somebody and they just destroy you.  You're dead.  And it's probably a 15-year-old, right?  But what a horrible experience.  There's like no onboarding.  You know, there's just like you have to expect to learn how to play by getting your ass kicked  over and over.  But that's called gaming.  That's all I like about it.  Most gaming is like you have a little sandbox where you're a little tutorial or whatever.  They teach you how to play the game.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah. Don't say Twitch.  Say Twitch.  Thank you.  Do me a favor.  I'm looking at all the tweets and it's all been pulled down because FIFA is really,  really good about getting rid of FIFA video on Twitter.  God.  Yeah.  So part of the fun of it is that you can continue to watch the game after you get greased in  Fortnite, which happens to me instantly.  I get to watch the person who killed me, right?  And then you watch the person that killed him, which is a little bit of satisfaction.  Then you watch the person that killed that guy all the way up to the end of the game.  You get to watch the whole game.  That's I think that's kind of to me.  Well, that's that's the story.  Boring.  Well, that's that's everything.  And that's kind of what Jessica, this exactly was my experience for a long time.  I thought, who's going to when you either play a game than watch somebody play a game  until Fortnite? And then I realized, no, this is really fun.  I think Fortnite is single handedly among all the other things it's done, including  make one hundred fifty million dollars a day on iOS alone.  And then selling nothing virtual goods, a funny dance, a costume.  It's also going to be the best thing that ever happened to e-sports, not because it'll  all be Fortnite, but because people will suddenly get that it is fun to watch a game  to the end. Yeah.

Start time: 6431.36
End time: 6456.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, e-sports, I think, are a lot like VR, where you really have to experience it  firsthand to understand it.  Like you have to put on a VR headset to really understand how awesome VR can be.  And you have to be invested in at least one round of one game and see someone play  through till the end and feel that excitement to get e-sports.  So it's yeah, like Twitch is huge in terms of introducing people to these kinds of

Start time: 6456.88

One of the things I love about ZipRecruiter is, you know, first of all,  and we've talked about this a lot.  When you've got an opening, instead of figuring out what job board to go to,  you just go to ZipRecruiter.com, post it there.  Actually, while you're doing it, go to ZipRecruiter.com slash twit for me.  Post it there.  And you're already posting to 100 plus job sites,  including social networks like Twitter and Facebook.  I mean, you're getting it out everywhere.  But even better than that, ZipRecruiter actually brings people to you.  They build a platform that finds the right job candidates for you.  Learns what you're looking for and identifies people with the right experience.  And then says, hey, here's a job you ought to apply for.  We did it the other day.  We were looking for a new bookkeeper.  This was wild.  We tried it two ways.  We had a headhunter and then we tried ZipRecruiter.  Literally, Lisa posted it within about an hour.  These candidates are coming.  She says, wow, these are really good.  Oh, even better.  80% of employers who post a job on ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate  through the site in just one day.  And unlike a headhunter, not only is it faster, it's better.  And it's a lot less expensive.  In fact, it's free right now when you go to ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  They even highlight the strongest applications in the ZipRecruiter interface.  No more calls to your phone or emails to your inbox.  It all goes into ZipRecruiter.  They format the resume so it's easy to read them.  We were blown away.  We were really blown away.  ZipRecruiter really works.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  We use it.  Some of the biggest companies in the world use it.  And now you can use it free at ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  They call it the smartest way to hire.  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  All right, I'm going to give up on that aerodactyl.  What kind of companion do you walk around with?  That's another thing they added.  You walk around with your companion Pokemon.  I have a...  I am very proud of my albino nine tails.  I know.  Special creature.  I know.

Transcript:  I evolved my Zubat to a Golbat but I don't know what the Golbat turns into  because I can't get enough Zubat candy.  Okay, that's enough of that.  Let's move on.  Did I miss anything?  Are there other stories?  Because it seems like we had many and I don't know if I've hit them all.

Transcript:  I really, really want you to end with the Reddit banning half of their...  Thanos.  So do something else but please end with that.  No, I'm going to end with that right now.  Let's go home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I didn't have time to sign up.  That's one of the things is everybody tried to sign up and join the subreddit  so that they could possibly be banned and I didn't make it in time.

Start time: 6871.30
End time: 6877.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The subreddit was Thanos did nothing wrong.  It was an Infinity War thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, we don't have to refer to the movie but if you haven't seen the movie,  God knows why you haven't.  But if you haven't seen the movie...  By the way, if you haven't seen it by now, don't.  It's not very good.  It's not that good.  It's a mishmash because they had every freaking character in it.  There's some good moments but this might spoil the end.  So they made a subreddit called Thanos did nothing wrong.  And see, by the way, Brian, you not only had to subscribe to it, you had to create a post.  Oh, okay.  I wouldn't have had time.  Yeah.  So I did that and I said, I don't feel so good.  I was told that was the appropriate post.  And then the very next day, which was I don't remember what day they did this,  they decided to kill half of all the subscribers in the post,  which if you've seen the movie makes sense.  I survived.  Everybody who got banned was supposed to join a Soulstone subreddit  for the poor people who got absorbed into the light.  But apparently there's a lot of pissed off people.  There's still 557,000 subscribers.  A lot of the people did not do what they were supposed to do.  They're just sitting there banned.  How do you know if you're banned?  Because you can't post, right?

Start time: 6970.42
End time: 6973.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it tells you it's like you can't access this Reddit or whatever.  Yeah.

Start time: 6973.68
End time: 6976.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I'm not banned.  I survived.  I'm one of the lucky.

Transcript:  Leo, you were talking earlier about what people thought of the web would be,  the early web and the promise of the early web.  Doesn't this remind you of the web when it was good?  Because it's like all the users banning together to make an elaborate joke happen.  And also what I loved about it is that Reddit, they contacted Reddit, Reddit got on board.  They wanted to do this before July 4th or the week of July 4th.  And Reddit says to them, well, our engineers are going to be on vacation.  So I love the whole thing.  This is why I loved the web when I was growing up for this kind of crazy stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the Cambridge teapot writ large.  They actually, to throw in another thing, on Twitch they did a live stream of the banning.  So you can watch the names scroll by as they were banned.  It was really, I completely agree with you, Brian.  This is why God gave us the internet for stuff like this.  No, it's fun.  It's just dumb.  It was silly.  There was no point.  But now there's no point in being in the Reddit because it's boring.

Start time: 7057.42
End time: 7064.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was curious about that.  So if this was a vibrant community, is now one of those Soulstone communities,  now the vibrant subreddit?

Start time: 7065.83
End time: 7128.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  They won't let me in.  Oh, you've been banned.  Banned from Soulstone.  I don't know.  Did I learn anything from this?  No, I don't think so.  I think the best thing you could say is what Brian said.  It's kind of a fun idea that half a million people would pull together  to create this kind of strange, meaningless joke.  There were a lot of S posts, a lot of bad meme posts.  And I guess if you really want to see a lot of bad Thanos memes,  you could still go there.  The funniest thing was that Thanos posted.  He posted a thing and snapped his fingers.  Not Thanos himself, but...  Josh Brolin, right?  The human that got to play Thanos.  Josh Brolin.  Yes, I think we can end with that.  I think you're right, Brian McCullough.  And I will now end the show.  You ready?  No, wait a minute.  I need my glove.

Transcript:  Great to have you.  Thanks for joining us.  We do Twitter Sunday afternoons, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time,  2200 UTC.  If you want to watch live, you can at twit.tv slash live.  That's actually our page that links then to all the other streams, including an audio,  a couple of audio streams as well as video streams.  So you can pick the way you want to watch it.  If you do watch the live stream, it would be great if you go in the chat room because  that's like that's where the audience gets to yell back at us.  It's irc.twit.tv.  You could do it in the web or use your own IRC client.  You can also join us in the studio at a great studio audience today.  Thank you all for joining us.  Just email tickets at twit.tv.  Let us know you're coming.  We'll put a chair out for you.  If you can't watch live or stream it live, you can always get on demand versions of  everything we do at our website, twit.tv, twit.tv.  Or subscribe, you know, every podcast application will have twit.  We've been doing this quite a while now since 2005.  So they've all figured it out.  Subscribe to the podcast.  That way you'll get it the minute the show's available late Sunday afternoon,  early Sunday evening.  It also works, I should mention to do to listen to us on your voice enabled device,  whether it's an Amazon Echo or Google Home, a Siri, a HomePod, or even that Cortana thing  that Harman Kardon made.  In most cases, just say, listen to twit and you'll hear us.  Sometimes you have to say, listen to twit on tune in.  Not sure why that happens, but that's sometimes another way to do it or any of our shows.  Thanks for being here.  We'll see you later.  Now you're ready.  I've got my soul stone glove.  Another twit is in the can.  Nothing happened.  Half the audience disappeared.
