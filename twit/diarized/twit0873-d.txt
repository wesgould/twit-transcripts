Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's talk  EFF has written already a piece  Twitter has a new owner. This is Jillian York and Jenny Gebhardt and Jason Kelly and David Green combining their great minds  Here's what he should do  It's pretty clear. Elon doesn't have a clue what he should do  He knows what he wants to do, but they're kind of mutually exclusive  mutually conflicting ideas things like get rid of spam bots and protect free speech  Which are mutually exclusive?

Start time: 286.46
End time: 347.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, there's this thing that people do  Where when they don't know much about a complicated subject they say it's so simple. I don't know why you're not doing it  It's really obvious that all you should do is accept. I remember I was just thinking about this the other day  I read a book when I was a kid a kids book  Where the premise was that the protagonist had figured out how to predict the weather 10 years out and the way that they did  It is they just asked the the meteorologist what they did to predict the weather one day out and then they just doubled it and tripled it  Well, they got to 10 years and this whole thing like I want to I want to  reduce the amount of people who get banned and I also want to ban anyone who I think is a bot is a  Really good example of just not really understanding what you're talking about and I think you know  The argument that Twitter should have all the things that are legally allowed in America is clearly not a good plan

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Free speech by the local. Yeah, bye. Bye. Yeah, and so, you know  I think that every conversational space has some limits  And you know it is true that like setting a limit for a hundred million people is really hard  It's even harder to do it for three billion, which is one of the reasons Facebook kind of sucks  right and and you know, I think a lot of people are like  the problem with Facebook is that Mark Zuckerberg is the wrong person to set the  conversational policies for three billion people speaking a thousand languages in a hundred countries and I think the right answer is like nobody should  have that job and  You know  America has an approach to this that as someone who's not an American but was just called up for my citizenship interview  I'm quite fond of which is federalism  just the idea that there's some like minimum standards that we have for for what we want and then we allow we devolve control to  smaller groups of people who set their own rules and  We make it really easy to go from one group to the other so the states can set a bunch of rules for themselves that are  Different I like living in California for example where non-compete agreements are illegal  and  You know, it's really easy to move to California  So you can move to California and you just will never be subjected to a non-compete which is which is good  That's a way to find out  you know how how people want to live and what works and what doesn't the laboratory of democracy as they say and  You know allowing  Twitter users to leave Twitter but continue to exchange messages with it by by having a federated system where you had  People who ran their own servers that if they met a certain standard, you know about privacy and about certain other things  Maybe doxxing and so on they could continue to interchange messages and then you know within their own communities  They would set up their own rules and you might have a Twitter community of your own  You might have a sounds like you're describing mastodon  It's well the problem with mastodon is that every everyone is already on Twitter and so there's a really high switching cost  I have to write  You have to convince all the people you want to talk to on Twitter to go to math

Start time: 481.86
End time: 487.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you worry that part of the problem is simply scale that if everybody who was on Twitter went to mastodon

Start time: 488.36
End time: 506.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Similar problems with rear their ugly heads if they went to one mastodon server for sure if they went to 10,000 mastodon servers  There would be interesting new gnarly problems like you know, is it is it whitelisting or blacklisting when people create a new server?  What are the terms on which yeah when I created my server I banned

Start time: 507.64
End time: 522.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did not I did not interoperate with gab.com  right is a right wing version of mastodon and  Another server which shall remain nameless truth social or something. Yeah  Well, it's now truth socials running a mess it on but are they federating? They're not federal

Start time: 522.80
End time: 645.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know if they're federating or not. You're right. I mean if mastodon's got a really interesting moderation  Yeah, I moderate my instance. Yeah, but as a user so I use quadrature to nets one which is memo.fr  They're they're the French equivalent of EFF or French analog to EFF and I like them because they you know  They stand up for your speech, right?  I thought they'd be a good place to be and they federate with a lot of people and I noticed that there were people who are  actual Nazis in my mentions who were  On servers with names like, you know white supremacy  Some brother and I could just block the whole server. So I just like individual you can block an entire server  See, that's great. Yeah, so they you know, that's a set of policies that I like  It's really easy for me to quit quadrature to net and go to a different server if I want a different set of policies and to  Automatically have everyone who's following me there move their follow to somewhere else. So my switching costs are really low  You know, there's a there's a study that preprint that just came out that's going to be presented at CHI this year  the computer human interaction conference that usenix puts on  about  people who left whatsapp when they change their privacy policy in 2021 and installed signal and  There were several million people who did this and the researchers surveyed  Over a thousand of them to get a good representative sample  And what they found is that only about 20% managed to shift any of their conversations to signal like that has got anyone from what's  That they wanted to talk to to leave whatsapp and move to signal and of those  half a percent of them  Managed to actually delete whatsapp and move all the conversations that matter to them to signal  So switching costs are really high. They make it really hard to leave one service. They keep other services from popping up  interoperability and federation  Make switching costs really low  You don't have to convince all your friends to leave you just like literally a hundred percent of the people who installed signal could have immediately  Deleted whatsapp because it wouldn't matter if the people they wanted to talk to had left whatsapp because they could still talk to them from

End time: 650.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the key  Interoperability absolutely. Yeah, Tim. Are you a Twitter user?

Start time: 653.40
End time: 671.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I definitely am and it's been an interesting week for sure  I've definitely lost a lot of followers this week, which I think is really unfortunate  I think it's very very early for people to be making such a drastic measure to be you know deleting their accounts  We really don't know how this is gonna shake out or even if it's gonna pass  I mean, there's still every possibility that Musk is going to just change his mind

Start time: 674.00
End time: 685.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Theory that Musk will just walk away from this  He doesn't really although he sold I think eight billion dollars with the Tesla stock since this offer  He's got to get to come up with 21 billion personally. So there's a lot more to go still

Start time: 686.88
End time: 693.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So and he said he's not selling more  Yeah, he can't I'm a little curious about the math. Yeah. Yeah

Start time: 694.50
End time: 699.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Tim your point of view is the wait and see point of view. I'm gonna see what happens

Start time: 700.36
End time: 767.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is for now and ultimately, you know, I think Twitter is  An important enough platform that to simply walk away is to basically, you know, throw up your hands in defeat if you want to have  Some say in what happens going forward and I think that you need to ultimately stay and voice your opinion on what Twitter should be  I think Cory's got a lot of great ideas and be wonderful to have some of those implemented  for sure if I could immediately step away to something like mastodon and have  My audience come with me then then I probably would do that as well  But obviously that's not something that we can do. I am definitely very concerned  I mean Musk on one day was saying he didn't want to be political and then the next day he's tweeting on political memes  Which were quite short-sighted in my opinion  So I have a lot of concerns about what that means for you know, having someone like that at the core of the brand  but it doesn't necessarily mean that it's going to  Turn turn this what I think is a very important social platform into a  Untenable solution and I'm optimistic that if enough folks stay behind and then folks are  Keen on having it remain what it is, which is basically an open platform for for discussion on all subjects with reasonably  Okay moderation  Then I hope that we can continue to improve the situation and not not make it worse

Start time: 767.92
End time: 774.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Twitter is made up of the people who tweet on it. Not the people who own it. So so far. Yeah, how about you Owen?

Start time: 775.48
End time: 790.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, this is this is the insane thing, you know  Elon Musk says Twitter has a problem because like Taylor Swift isn't tweeting and that he's doing  Everything he can to make it as unpleasant as possible for someone like Taylor Swift to be on Twitter by his

Start time: 791.02
End time: 797.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Stated plan the reason those top ten tweeters don't tweet very much is it's a hostile environment for them

Start time: 797.74
End time: 825.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that what you're saying? Yeah, there's no payback. It's no it's benefit  Yeah, so they they use it as kind of one-way broadcast, you know  They've got a new record that's dropping  You know, there's a new music video. They tell their followers their followers, you know, go wild for a second and  They don't stay to interact because there's nothing in it for them. They don't get value, right?  There are zero many zero plant many people pointed this out

Start time: 825.40
End time: 852.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are smaller communities on Twitter black Twitter is the one most people use as an example where there's somewhat insular  And they are really important to the people who are members of those communities, I'm sure there are many more  I'd hate to I'd hate to lose that for those people and I don't think anything Elon's thinking about doing is gonna make that less  Tenable or is it Corey you what are the dangers of what Elon might do?

Start time: 854.46
End time: 877.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean  Here's the thing that that I think we should take away from this  Which is that when Twitter was run  By a board of like however many eight extremely wealthy tech people  It was not well managed  to the extent that  Those were the eight people who decided to sell it to Elon Musk, right?

Start time: 878.50
End time: 883.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So if you think by the way, he points out that none of them were real Twitter users, right?

Start time: 884.42
End time: 894.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So but if you think Elon Musk shouldn't be in charge of Twitter then perforce  You shouldn't think you should think that the people who put him in charge of Twitter shouldn't have been also shouldn't be in charge of Twitter

Start time: 894.90
End time: 900.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. Right. Well, ultimately the shareholders are who is gonna decide whether he gets it. He still has to get a shareholder vote

Start time: 901.36
End time: 931.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure, that's very true. But I think that you know, there are lots of ways that Twitter could become really awful. So  You know this human verification thing. There are lots of ways that it can go very wrong  basically musk is proposing to do in some way to gather a  gigantic amount of potentially compromising personal identifying information because uniquely identifying and disambiguating  100 million people in a thousand countries or a hundred countries rather is a really big job and it's gonna involve

Start time: 931.62
End time: 957.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well either government ID or biometric and he's not averse to that because Tesla gathers all the information about every drive  Sure  I remember when I had a Model X order in I  Felt like I shouldn't say anything about Elon because a well-known blogger did say something negative about Tesla and Elon canceled his order  So yeah, he's very he's not a free speech very capricious, right? It's capricious. That's a better word than anything

Start time: 957.48
End time: 1031.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so so, you know if if musk says well what we should do is aggregate all this  Potentially sensitive personal identifying information and then never leak it  He's being extremely optimistic right and rather reckless I  About well now 15 years ago  I wrote a column where I compare personal identifying information to uranium and plutonium  because I grew up in Ontario where where we mine a lot of the world's uranium and  We when uranium comes out of the ground it's pretty benign you can actually like buy it on Amazon for science fair projects  But once you refine it into plutonium, it's immortal  Like it will last longer than any human institution or or built object. It is like pluripotent, right?  There's no amount of it that's so small that it won't kill you  So you can't unmake it and it is it is infinitely toxic and if you pile up all of that PII  It will end up kind of slithering around  Within and outside of Twitter like the only way to keep data from leaking is to neither retain it nor nor collect it ideally and  And that exposes a lot of people to risk so that's just like one example of what it means to have like a

Start time: 1032.86
End time: 1047.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  dilettante show up well even crosses my mind that may be part of the  Because one of the questions is what well, how is he gonna make any money on this? This is a huge expense  No one's ever made money on Twitter. How does he justify this expense? Maybe the maybe the information is the point

Start time: 1049.28
End time: 1126.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think he doesn't know what he's doing. I you know, I think that he's someone who's extremely narcissistic  You know, I'm not trying to diagnose him at a distance  But this is the guy who who didn't found Tesla and bought it from people who did found Tesla and as part of the contract  Made them promise that they would call him a co-founder even though he wasn't yeah, that's a really weird thing  he also calls himself the chief engineer of Tesla even though he's not an engineer at Tesla and when you write about if you're a  Journalist and you write about the chief engineer of Tesla their PR department will contact you and say  You'll find that Elon is the chief engineer of Tesla the  The person you're talking about is like the chief operating engineer. He's the guy who does the work  Elon wears the like the engineer hat and gets to pull the whistle on the railroad. So he thinks he's the engineer, right?  It's it's it is a really bizarre circumstance. So I don't know that I mean, he's pretty chaotic, right?  He does a lot of chaotic things. I think that he's he's got poor impulse control  I think he's a very good showman  And I think that he doesn't really know what he's getting Twitter for I  I've heard some theories that I think are kind of plausible like  If he has Twitter he can use that as like a PR vehicle for his his other stuff

Transcript:  But but you know, so here's so here's my Elon Musk story  One day I was on Twitter and someone  Retweeted Elon Musk saying I consider myself a utopian socialist in the mode of Ian Banks  So science fiction writer was dead and I couldn't help it and I replied and I said I knew Ian  He was an ardent trade unionist. The National Labor Review Board has sanctioned you like four times in the last three months  I don't think you can call yourself a utopian socialist in the mode of  Of Ian Banks and we got into a really dumb argument where he said things like well  There aren't any unions in banks as culture novels and I said, yes, they're set on  The solar system sized spaceships that travel thousands of times the speed of light that have a trillion people  And are piloted by superhuman a eyes and and he said, you know  Well, if if if Ian could have seen one of my factories, he'd see that it doesn't need a union either  You know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Difference between faster than light travel and eking out marginal gains in the production of electric vehicles and then he called me  An enemy of humanity, I think oh my god, but here's the thing that was really weird about it. That part wasn't weird  That was just like oh, he's just a crank  But the part that was really weird was all the bots that follow Elon to try and put him on tilt  I actually think this is a lot of it. There are there are for sure a hundred percent  Shorts who try to put Elon on tilt with bots that just troll him night and day and vice versa

Start time: 1229.80
End time: 1232.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I might add he has his own bot army. I

Start time: 1233.42
End time: 1298.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He that is may entirely be true  I mean, I definitely there were a lot of like notice me senpai people in there who I don't think were bots  I think that they were you know sad fanboys  But that like the actual like inauthentic conduct right like just hundreds of bots that showed up that I had to block  Before I could even read my timeline after being mentioned by must exactly still get them  Yeah, yeah, I'm like this is five years later  And I still like a couple of times a week  We'll have to block a bot that just goes through everything musk has ever tweeted and tweets weird horrendous garbage  To see if they can put him on tilt so that short positions  I think so short positions can maybe because they're just trolls who knows right?  So I think that like some of what he's motivated by all this stuff about like we have to get rid of the bots  Is that he has got this unbelievably specific thing?  It's like it's like if he suddenly was like real like he bought all of CVS  Because he wanted the special shampoos used to treat hair plugs to be more  You know prominently features should have been because they're really hard to find it. It's a problem for people  It was really it's just a problem for him

Start time: 1300.90
End time: 1318.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know Cory I think you're really on to something there because  Elon really got active on Twitter to like fight with Tesla short sellers. Yes, so the idea that they're you know  They're jidding him up. You know like egging him on  It's actually pretty plausible

Start time: 1320.08
End time: 1323.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They say I think it I asked Cory if they make his life miserable

Start time: 1324.96
End time: 1357.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So maybe that's all he's trying to do is get rid of that. Yeah. Yeah, I  Asked Cory what Elon could do to screw Twitter up  Let me ask you Tim Stevens what Elon could do to make Twitter better  I put you in the spot didn't I I honestly feel like you know they always say  No, no plan survives the first encounter with the enemy. I really think that Elon's plans to  Free speech open the algorithm and get rid of the bots is only gonna last as long as until he gets in the chair  And then who knows what he's gonna do

Start time: 1359.30
End time: 1427.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I think the number one thing is what Cory was talking about earlier  Which would be the ability to take your audience with you to another platform if you want to but since we've already covered that ground  I think ultimately has to be much much better moderation tools and much smarter  moderation as well as I assume Twitter on my phone and on my desktop and  a couple other platforms as well and as I go from one to the other I'll actually see different sets of tweets because  My phone has a different level of basically profanity filter and other filters than other platforms do which just kind of  shows  How weak Twitter is that actually keeping you from seeing abusive content even if it's light stuff?  So I think if Musk really wants to open the floodgates and let everybody back on  Then ultimately they need a lot better tools to give me the power to  Control what I want to see and what I don't want to see whether it be misinformation whether it be hate speech whether it be whatever  As of now depending which platform I go to all that stuff gets through  And I have it relatively easy compared to a lot of folks who I know who have  You know a lot of people who are saying very mean things to them  So if he's really gonna open the floodgates in the name of quote-unquote free speech  Then moderation tools need to improve significantly

Start time: 1428.78
End time: 1495.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tools for end users as well to control. Yeah, absolutely what they see Mike  Maznik made an excellent point on tech dirt saying Elon is essentially saying what people said at the beginning of Twitter  Before they really had had a Twitter and he's just gonna throw out 15 years of struggling  With moderating a platform like this and all the knowledge gained there. It sounds like Elon just saying no no no you guys  We I got an idea. Let's let's do it better  I don't want to go on and on about Elon, but but somebody in the chat. I'm saying somebody should defend Elon  I guess it's you Owen  Okay defend the man I mean look he created SpaceX amazing right  Tesla has has changed the world for  Electric vehicles which someone else found it I understand  But he certainly took it and you know you could also make the argument he did it with government grants  But he's taken to electric vehicles into the mainstream. Thank you, Elon  SpaceX is pretty cool. They landed those two rockets like that. That was cool  They're certainly better doing better than NASA

Transcript:  Wouldn't mind that either. I mean I like Twitter. I maybe that's an unpopular opinion, but I know it's very popular  No, no, I try to convince people how awful Twitter is all the time and nobody will but I think people on Twitter  Like to talk about how much they don't like it  I can I can name some things about Twitter that I think should be fixed  In terms of like content moderation and stuff. I got dogpiled at one point by this. It was hilarious  I wrote about about police violence and this cop  Said well, why don't you come along for a ride along and you know  And I'll show you what it's really like and it was just like this kind of bad faith response to a pretty subtle in it and  significant argument made and I just I just blocked him and so then he quote tweeted it or he  screencapped the block and  He had like 12,000 or 20,000 followers and said hey this guy hates cops  Why don't you gang up on him?  And then I just got like like literally thousands of like I want to come over to your house and kill you kind of tweets  Like I hope the Burbank police  I hope someone murders you in Burbank and the Burbank Police Department don't do anything about it  And I was like, yeah  This is definitely a guy I should have gone on a ride along with because he's really proved himself to be kind and  I'd learn a lot from but the point was there was no easy way to do to block it  I tried using a bunch of tools like block together to block all of this guy's followers  to just say like I just if you're following this like  Ghastly monster of a human. I just don't want to ever hear from you and  All of those tools tripped Twitter's you are doing too much automated stuff  Filters right and and they lock me out of my account  That was like that was like a compounding feeling like there are a bunch of things like that if you're like a Twitter power  I'm sure everyone's got like half a dozen. I should point out you accomplish your goal though because

Transcript:  How you want to accomplish it well now they could still reply to me I just and I read it  I couldn't block just couldn't do anything right? Yeah, it just locked my account. So it was like it was a stupid  You know, it's a stupid edge case moderate fail and they're like moderation stuff  There are a bunch of things that I could completely see building that would be really good  You know one of the things that Twitter did that I was very skeptical of and now I'm like, oh my god  That was brilliant is hide  As an option so if someone replies to you can hide their reply  And so what people see when they go to your tweet as they see there are some hidden replies which they can click and see  and what that does is  Often that like the worst kinds of arguments are the ones where it's just people trolling in foolish ways  And it just means that everyone ends up talking about something that's not very interesting  Yeah  and and and and also like just generates a lot more heat than light and  What I can do I think of myself as you know  if I have a tweet that gets a lot of retweets and so on I think of myself as someone who  instigated a conversation and the way that I can  Be you know express my duty to that conversation to try and make it good  Is I can hide the stuff that I think is dumb and the people who want to read it can and they can reply to it  If they want but um  Unless you take an extra step, you don't see it  You're not tempted to reply to it and the actual caliber of the conversation goes up  So if you're someone who like kicks off big interesting Twitter conversations  They've produced some pretty simple and innovative tools that actually make those conversations better  Yeah, and so, you know, there's a lot of stuff on Twitter that I that I really rather like and then there's a bunch of stuff  That I don't like too. I  Just would like Twitter. I just think that some of the the hard Twitter calls to make about what should and shouldn't be permitted  Are calls that are much better made among small communities, right?  one of the  Constant failure modes of Twitter and all social media is the inability to distinguish speech from counter speech  So there's a big difference between that guy call or calling someone the n-word and saying I can't believe I just called the n-word  Right and yet both of those tend to trip the same filter. And so that's a that's a really big problem  especially since people who's like  You know burning  Passion in life is figuring out how to hurl racial slurs at people can have all day long to think up  euphemisms for the n-word or putting you know  Words in brackets to indicate Jew or whatever and then the people who they're actually targeting  Have just want to live their lives  and so they're the ones who aren't going to use the euphemisms and are going to get killed by the algorithm or by the  moderators who are over busy or moderating in languages, they don't speak and and  The actual like bad actors you're trying to catch are the ones who don't and really the people who can distinguish speech from counter speech  Are the the people in the affected community and letting them find their own place where they can talk  And set their own rules and decide what they do and don't block is  I think the only way we can answer this  it's not like we have to add more pages to the three ring binder that has the  moderation policies and  Enough branching if thens that we cover all potential conversational  Possibilities right we just need people who understand the context to to be the ones in charge of determining what what stays and what goes

So thank you club members seven bucks a month  Club to it go to twit TV slash  Club to it. Thank you in advance our show today brought to you by podium  I'll tell you what I think the the merchants of Petaluma have discovered podium  I love it when I go to our local ice cream store and as I'm leaving they say would you like to leave review on?  Yelp or Google and I can click a link and leave review just like that. I get messages  Hey, we haven't seen you in a while. Would you like a discount on ice cream?  Yes  It is a great way to stay in touch with your customers because text messaging  Is much more effective. It's what your customers want. It's kind of a habit we learned during the pandemic  So much better than playing phone tag. There aren't enough hours in the day for that  Podium makes every interaction as easy as sending a text. So everything that makes your business great can get done faster  I know for instance when we need somebody to do something around the house  The one that gets the job is the one that texts me back fastest. I love that  Podium isn't just a better way to communicate. It's a better way to do everything you can get reviews  Yes, you can collect payments through podium. You can market to your customers podium makes it all as easy as pressing send  You won't just free up more time. You'll grow your business. You'll get more done with podium  You'll close deal with customers before the competition even has a chance to call them back  And I know that's a case because it happens to me all the time join more than 100,000 businesses that already use  Podium to streamline their customer interaction get started for free podium  pod I um  Podium comm slash twit if you sign up for a paid podium account, you can get a free credit card reader as well  Restrictions apply that's podium  Comm slash tweet. We thank them so much for supporting our show and thank you for supporting it by using that address podium  comm  slash tweet  I  Said no more Elon. I should mention one more Elon story during all of this last week a judge  rejected Elon's bid to  Truncate end its settlement his settlement with the SEC  That's the one where he got in trouble for tweeting that he was taking Tesla private funding arranged the SEC said no  That's not true. And you can't say that find him 20 million dollars find Tesla 20 million dollars and  Furthermore said that Elon from now on  Would have to have lawyers review every tweet to make sure he wasn't making illegal tweets  Elon says that's a violation of my free speech a federal judge said no, it's not  You cannot complain that this violates your First Amendment rights. So a little little victory I think in this case  for the SEC

Transcript:  I mean, this is a fractally stupid story  So Molly Molly white at web3 is going great did a pretty good a great page  God bless you. Okay. Yeah, and one of the things that she points out is that they actually did very explicitly consider their auction design  And whether or not it would have an impact on etherium's ability to press process transactions  And they discarded the Dutch auction plan, which I don't know if it would have been better or worse for  Ethereum as a system  But they discarded it because they said it would be too hard on their network and they explicitly chose this mechanism  Because they thought it would be better for for the financial processing system underpinning it  But I mean all of this is really awful, right? So they're selling plots of land for a game that doesn't exist and  Which may never exist so it's it's this is very selling the Brooklyn Bridge  but their whole pitch this pitch that board apes are you know are the vanguard of NFTs and NFTs are the vanguard of  revitalizing the art market by decentralizing it is a  Really like disingenuous pitch because no one who owns a board ape could tell you who the artist was behind it  There there are no royalties for those artists. These are works made for hire  They are the the artists who did make it the primary artists is woman of color are struggling to  capitalize on any of this they're really just faceless entities behind the curtain there  and so the all of the promises that are made about this just are our  literal like errant nonsense that is indefensible and and inarguably wrong and  you know, that's that's  You know you land on top of that with we are such financial geniuses that will come up with an auction designer or sale  design that won't crash aetherium that promptly crashes aetherium and  You know and then on top of that all this business about them getting doxxed  where like a journalist went and looked up their financial filings in which these people who have a  multi-billion dollar empire who are extracting hundreds of thousands if not millions of dollars from investors and customers  Without telling you who they are  but who had told a regulator who they were as a matter of public record suddenly claimed to have been doxxed because someone looked at  the public record and then  Threatened and harassed the journalist who did it like, you know  That doesn't permanently disqualify you from running even a lemonade stand let alone a media empire.

It's a great site to look at  I'll just give you some idea  Of what's what's going on out there web3 is going great comm and my favorite feature  We mentioned this on Wednesday and twig is over here in the lower right this little tracker  Which is the grift counter trademark and as you scroll through the various  articles the grift tracker adds up  of grift  Involved so by the time you get to the end of the page, which you probably will never get to it's a significant  significant sum of money going on this is if you read this, I mean, I just I feel like  This kind of  Says all you need to know about all of this  But am I wrong?

Um, but but ultimately I I tend to share your thoughts on  nfts in general leo, I  Think that there are some legitimate applications for the technology and i'm very interested to see where it goes but  99 of what I see is is basically grift and and uh and pyramid schemes and and finding that one percent that nugget  I think is is a very difficult thing. I'm curious to see what we hear from  Auto manufacturers all the time. We're talking about doing things like  parts verification on  On blockchain and things like that, which makes some interesting applications  You can really validate the supply chain of a given product  Both in terms of you know for a classic car making sure that everything is valid  But also in terms of making sure that your battery materials are sourced in an ethical way or as ethically as they can be anyway  So I think there's definitely some applications like that on the business side things but from a consumer standpoint from a  You know sticking to the man and coming up with a new way of of retiring because 401ks are boring  um that that just really doesn't um  I don't see a lot of people to be there myself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What what what does the blockchain add to this?  So I wrote an article about this called I think something like um, the inevitability of trusted third parties  so the the  The thing is that vins and repairs don't magically appear in the blockchain  As you said if you were going to have a registry of repairs in the blockchain  You would need people to enter those repairs correctly into the blockchain. Otherwise, it doesn't work  So you're already trusting people to do that anyway if you trust you want to do it  Do we think that the problem with the existing databases of vins and service?  Uh that has gone on is that people change the database after it's posted because there are those databases last time  I bought a used car  I looked up the vin of the cars that I was looking up on them  Or do we think that the problem is that sometimes people just don't enter the data  And if they just don't enter the data then having an immutable thing that they just don't enter the data into  Doesn't make them enter the data more  and you know more importantly like  if you are going to trust, you know, we talk about these supply chain issues, right like um,  I I just before lockdown I was in brussels for an event  And I met someone who's you know, very sincere about this blockchain for good project that she'd worked on or run with eu money  Where they were trying to guarantee fair trade produce and so they were you know, they would track the  The the entire life cycle of a food commodity like a bag of flour or a potato or whatever  And they put it in the blockchain and I said so um, I find a potato in the grocery store  How do I know it's the one that the blockchain is referencing and not a different potato?  So well, you just have to trust us  I'm like, well, that's fine, right? Like maybe you are trustworthy in which case why are we roasting the planet?  You could tell me what I need to trust you on  And even if we're not roasting the planet  Why are we you know, even if you believe the proof of stake is is not six months away as it has been for the last  Five years, but actually like imminent  Um, then  You know, why are we entrusting it to a system that can only process 15 transactions a second worldwide for all users?  like the ethereum virtual computer  rather than  Uh just having it as tim said in a database, right?

Transcript:  So look appendly ledgers are super cool  And I I helped write up one that you use every day without knowing it speaking of supply chain every time your browser  Gets a certificate from the world  Uh, it uh signs it gets a signed certificate that's signed by the certificate authority that issued it  It makes a hash signs it again and uploads it to one of several one or more of several certificate transparency  Servers around the world. These are these are not a blockchain. They're just merkle trees  They're all over the place and there are append only logs and anyone who wants to can subscribe to them  and see whether or not a certificate has been issued for their domain that they didn't authorize and  This is a really powerful tool  I wrote it up for nature with the guy who led the project at google ben lorrie is a cryptographer works on open ssl a bunch  Other projects and and it's really cool and I do think public append only ledgers have an application  But I think that the that if we are going to talk about trust models, right?  If we're going to say this is trustless  Then it has to be trustless  And if you're going to introduce trust if you're going to say there's a human oracle who could confound the entire transaction who could break the entire transaction  You have to show why that person shouldn't just replace  The cumbersome computing you're doing to get around having any human oracles in the loop  Otherwise, it just makes sense to have that person run the server too. You you haven't gained anything new by it

Transcript:  As you uh as you point out little mathematics, don't be afraid  In your piece if problem plus blockchain equals problem minus blockchain then blockchain equals zero  Yeah, it's pretty pretty it's simple. It's math  Yeah  The blockchain hasn't added anything  to the problem

Transcript:  Not in those cases. Anyways, I think there may be some in which it does but I look at this this concept of append only ledger

Start time: 3392.56
End time: 3396.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean stuff can't be deleted from the ledger. You can only add to it. Is that the yeah

Start time: 3397.26
End time: 3402.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so you can you can add a later record, right? You could say well, you know think about the deed for your

Start time: 3409.10
End time: 3518.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, think about the deed for your house, which in theory there's actually like a piece of paper down at the right  Whatever the petaluma property registry, right?  And it's like literally a sheet of paper with all the others who owned your house  It says so at the bottom, right? So you can go back and see it so you can add to the ledger  So it doesn't mean that once you sell your house  You can never sell it again because you can append a new record to the bottom of the ledger, right?  But you know you in this case you're trusting the city to  Hold the deed and not go in and erase things or move things around and so on  And you know, basically we build institutions to make that trust work and they're not always great  And there have been ways in which they failed us pretty grotesquely  But the way that we make those institutions work best is by taking them out of the market, right?  The thing that actually makes those things work best is when people feel an ethical or a normative reason to do it  You know the thing that keeps auditors honest is not the fear that they'll be discovered for colluding. It's their code of ethics  And you know when we when we turn everything into a financial transaction  Where we just say caveat mtor if you can make one dollar being the auditor and one dollar and one cent cheating as the auditor  Then you have like a moral duty to cheat  Instead of saying you have your duty is first not to money but to your profession  Then that's the way we keep our institutions working  You know, we can laugh at politicians who say i'm a public servant first and and you know here to earn a living second  But unless that's the way they feel or unless that's the way a lot of them feel the system does break down  And for me the problem with with the web 3 stuff is so much of it is grounded in the idea that we solve all  of our problems by making them monetary by just assigning values and selling stuff and and  explicitly getting rid of any normative claims about  What people should do and just saying people should do whatever the smart contract allows. I think we design the system

Transcript:  Think that they are in hot water. Actually, we we kind of called it in our piece  On protocol.com because we said hey, you know fidelity is rolling out this plan  They're catering to micro strategy, which is a software company that is places really kind of frankly bizarre side bet on bitcoin  It's not at all strategic to their software business, but the the ceo michael sailor is uh, you know  Is a bitcoin fanatic anyway  So fidelity is making bitcoin an option for micro strategy employees in their 401k  The problem is the the department of labor which oversees 401k plans  Said in march that they were going to investigate any fiduciaries like fidelity  Um  Who put cryptocurrencies in a retirement plan?  So fidelity was setting itself up for an investigation here and they they knew full well

I'm gonna soak it in a peroxide solution and an ammonia solution  Then i'm debating you can dip it in mop and glow to preserve it. That's a that's a pretty common way of doing it  I found a website for um  So i'm thinking about doing that what I really would like to do is preserve it in like methanol  Or ethanol rather on the back of our bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, uh, I don't I don't think that was in the john mcgrew poem that I heard the sour toe  sour toe verse  But uh, maybe they should add that you were talking about how there's a public record at the county seat of everybody who's ever owned your house  There's a lot of public records and there are companies out there who go around send people to the county seats record them and put them online  So that a lot of people are quite shocked to learn if you search for information about yourself  You can find the home you own you can find a lot of information  This is kind of a historic and historic problem  You can go to companies like spokio and say take me down, but there's so many of them  You could easily miss  A few it's easy in other words to dox someone or dox yourself  Google has announced that they are going to allow  People to remove at least the google search result for personally identifiable  information  from google search  I think this is a good move  There is a lot of different kinds of information obviously  Governmental id numbers bank account numbers credit card numbers pictures of your handwritten signature  Uh id docs like your driver's license or passport  Highly personal restricted and official records like medical records  Personal contact info including your address phone number and email address or confidential  Login numbers. This is from a google blog post on wednesday. If you want to know more  Or  You can google goes always had a set of policies to do this, but it sounds like this is a little bit easier  to do  Thoughts anybody  I I think it's tim stevens. You've ever done a search for yourself on spokio and been horrified

Start time: 4340.50
End time: 4377.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have not actually but yeah, I definitely think this is a positive move. It'll make it easier for people to take  Uh a first step to to keeping you know  The basics of your information being easily found. I guess to me. I think this is kind of like  Putting a cheap padlock on something that you want to keep secure  It'll keep the honest people from from getting in there, but anybody who wants in they're going to find a way  They'll cut the padlock off  Um, so, you know that information will still be out there obviously and will be not that hard to find for people who know how  to find it  But it will at least keep  People from we're only going to take the the most basic steps in trying to find that information  It'll keep them from finding it easily. So I think that's a good thing

Start time: 4377.76
End time: 4387.82

Transcript:  Anyway, I have a horror story about this. Do you from when we moved to?  Back to california from the uk  You know, we had a half container and um, the customs broker requires your passport  So I sent them a copy of my passport  And they put that with the way bill on the outside of the container  And there are people who do market research at the port of los angeles. Oh, no write down  Transcribe all the all the way bills. They just stand there writing it down  Yeah, so they're public records, right? And so one day  uh someone uh  One day for some reason I put my passport number into google  I think I was just having a kind of paranoid moment and I found  Literally hundreds of websites that had my passport number and my home address  Linked together because that's where the container was being delivered  So I actually have not used my home address for deliveries except for things like shipping containers  for  About 15 20 years now. I rent a postbox down the road  Because i've had problems with stalkers and weirdos and whatever  And yet there are some things like you cannot have your shipping container dropped off at the postbox a mile away  You know you you still have to get it home  And um, I never got rid of them all  We moved and my passport expired like that's that's why i'm now safe. Holy cow, right?  And uh, it's pretty bad. I I have a uh, a google alert for my name and address  And whenever it pops up in a public search result  I I go and ask the company to take it down  I do worry that if google alerts were to leak well, then that would expose a lot of my information  But if google were to leak it would expose a lot of my information anyway so far

I just don't I and google's had a bunch of insider attacks through their own through their own  Errors or yeah, and then google's had a bunch of insider attacks. Oh they have  Yeah, where they've just had like people following around mostly it's dudes creeping on women. Oh my god  All right. I mean a lot of these companies have it google's got actually pretty good internal  Access controls and forensics as I understand it  There was an amazing piece in wired about how amazon in order to enable the agility of its teams  Has no had no controls over making whole copies of all of their user and or merchant data  And literally thousands of them were floating around within the company every team had  Its own local copy and there was no tracking and no forensics. They have tons of insider attacks  They had people who were like  Selling to merchants how their rivals products were were performing and they had people who were creeping on customers and so on  amazon's another one that I think a lot of people get delivered to their home and even if they have a mailbox  Because you know, it's you order heavy things right or big thing  Oh, yeah  And so, you know  And what's the point of paying for prime and next day delivery?  If you have it delivered to a mailbox that you then have to drive to and you only go to once a day, right?

Transcript:  Well, I mean there is an argument that getting a warrant is really hard  And that's probably true in some places. We know it's not true in other places  So in some cases these extraordinary data requests are really about a very minor amount of of labor saving  Uh, you know and it produces an enormous risk  So you're you know, you've got two different risks you're weighing right?  One is that you have these companies that are billions of users and have incredibly intimate and powerful pictures of our lives  that can be used to really do enormous harm to us and we  Create a system that is very easy to breach. I think there's something like 16 000  Maybe 1600 us police departments. There's just no way they're going to be able to identify all the different police  emails and so on and in fact a lot of the the  Forged requests came from real police emails because the police  Websites were had known vulnerabilities and they were able to open a webshell and take over accounts or create new accounts  A lot of this was done by children who attacked other children  So it's like we're not talking about a high degree of security here that was being breached, right? This is really like, uh,  Very beginner level script kind of security defects that we are  We're backstopping this very powerful bypass with and against that you have the security risks of making the police get a warrant  and uh, because warrants are a lot harder to forge right warrant like warrants are a lot more recognizable and standardized than  You know the the like an a casual email from a cop that just says, you know  There's a there's a bomb on the bus and it'll go off if it drops under 40 miles an hour and I need to get  into Sandra Bullock's email, right and uh, and and you just have to kind of curiously specific by the way  Yeah  well  We we Torontonians we stick together. So me and Keanu we're like we're like this  so yeah that the the um,  I guess the the I think that the security trade-off is a bad one

Transcript:  And I think the companies could say no, by the way  They they are not legally obligated if it's not signed by a judge if it's not a legal warrant  But they think blood will be on their hands, right?  So cops that's the worst thing that could happen is that later there's a press conference saying well  Uh, you know, we went to apple and they wouldn't give us this information and as a result a child has died  That's that's what they don't want to have happen

Transcript:  And you know we could we could make it  If we could if we could show that it's actually too hard to get a warrant  We can make it easier to get a warrant. I'm not convinced. It's too hard to get a warrant  I think there is supposed to be some due process there and I and I don't think that judges are like, you know unduly skeptical of cops

Transcript:  I mean again, it will introduce a new security risk, which is the risk that it will take a little longer  and there might be some emergencies that are harmed, but  what we're seeing is the  Visible side of the security risk here and it's only the visible side  We don't know about the invisible side right like if your bank account gets cleaned out and you never find out why?  Maybe it's because someone got the information needed to uh, socially engineer your bank  By doing one of these requests and you never found out about it, right?

They're just finding out what your first street was or whatever. There's a lot of that  Um that is never solved  We don't know where the source came from and so we have no way to know how widespread this is and i'll remind you  The only reason we found out about this is because literal children  Had had started to use this en masse  Primarily to sexually exploit other children. Good lord. And so there might have been other more  Uh sophisticated attackers who just like kept it on the dl. Yeah, and who might still be doing it, right?  And we would never know. Yeah

Transcript:  Really good our show today brought to you by noreva speaking of sounding good if you  Are bringing people back into the office  You're starting to use the huddle room the conference room you have people but you also have people still at home  And if you're still relying on that crappy little thing in the middle of the table  You know those people at home aren't hearing what's going on. They're dialed out because it's impossible to understand  Or maybe you went to a big expensive av company  and got a complicated  system with speakers and microphones and wires and dsp's everywhere and they have to come in every time and  Calibrate the darn thing and  There is a third way a much better way. It's  noreva  noreva  Has patented their microphone mist technology. That means all you have to do is put in  What looks like a speaker bar in your conference room big room, maybe two of them  It's got integrated microphones  It the microphone mist technology on that  Speaker fills the room with thousands of virtual microphones  So that there are no dead zones everyone can be heard clearly everywhere in the room  No matter which way they're facing if they're social distancing if they're if it's a classroom  Participants could just move around and talk naturally in the space and remote students can still hear and exactly what's going on  It is a revolution in meeting room technology and it couldn't come at a better  Time you don't have to have any any technicians. In fact, you could install this yourself if you ever installed a sound bar  It's easy 30 minute diy job  Continuous audio calibration means your rooms are instantly and always ready with optimized audio. No outside technician is  necessary  And management's easy too. Your it team team will love it, especially if you have many rooms  The noreva console lets it monitor manage and adjust the system anywhere  They are even off-site  So there's no need for it to go from room to room look how easy it is to install  Your new noreva sound bar. So ask yourself if you want to go with a costly and complicated traditional system  Are you tired of the little microphone in the middle of this of the table? That's the worst way to go make the leap simple economical  effective  noreva and you are  eva.com  noreva.com it's the best way to do  Huddle room audio they've got the patent on it and it really works. Thank you noreva  For your support of this week in tech you support us when you go to that website actually, I  Guess they just it's just noreva.com. So you still support us by going there. So go ahead and do it  All right  ET phone home  Two astronomers are two astronomer groups are planning to send messages  From the world's largest radio telescope in China sometime in 2023.

The message is called the beacon in the galaxy  The first thing they'll do is send prime numbers  presuming that math is universal and mathematical operators then the biochemistry of life human forms and  Then the controversial part the earth's location  timestamp  They're sending the message toward a group of millions of stars near the center of the galaxy  Ten to twenty thousand light-years from Earth  Now the only good thing is it'll take them ten to twenty thousand years to get this and I'm gonna hope it's gonna take  Them at least this long to come back. So we don't have to worry too much about this, but still  Theoretically  Is it a bad idea to say hey guys come on over?  Let's let's let's let's get together.

They'd lost subscribers  You know 200,000 here 200,000 there doesn't sound too bad the stock market  Punished him 35 percent lost more than 50 billion dollars in the day immediately after it's actually continued to drop since  Netflix has started laying off people as  If like the whole thing is folding up and going home  Netflix did forecast they'd lose another 2 million subscribers over the next three months. So that may be  What some of this but didn't Netflix have a great two years with pandemic?  Can they go ahead Tim?

Transcript:  I think if anything is if we needed another indicator would just have a speculative the market is right now  This was a pretty good one Netflix has a kind of not great quarter  Some bad news and everyone just drops it immediately stock drops 35 40 percent something like that  Yeah, I think that shows how much people are really looking for big continual gains and and ultimately  Yeah, it does point to the fact that Netflix and disrupted the industry  They were way out ahead and now a lot of other competitors have caught up and there are so many options on the market that  It's not really sustainable for most people. So I know quite a few people myself included who are kind of floating between streaming services  They'll go here for a month or two and then jump over somewhere else for a while and it used to be that Netflix was that one  That one service that you needed to have on 12 months out of the year, but that's not really the case anymore  There are compelling options from other services

Transcript:  You know and I think that  Internally at Netflix you have to remember that the execs themselves are heavily compensated with stock, right?  And so this stuff really matters to them, right?  But also you have to remember that they're recruiting in extremely tight labor markets for  especially for technical staff and executive staff and that they get an enormous discount on their wage bill  Provided that they can convince people that taking compensation in stock is a good idea because it'll go up and up and up and if it doesn't  Then you have to pay cash, right? There's a reason that Facebook has has  Failed in its engineer recruiting numbers for the last three years like significantly. I think by about a third  It's because engineers  Don't believe that the Facebook shares that they're getting are gonna blow up the way the shares that they might get from somewhere else might  Be and so Facebook's cash basis gets materially worse every time their share price goes down and then investors go  Well with a bad cash  Cash basis we should sell our shares and then the share price goes down there and they're in a kind of destructive spiral

Transcript:  Yeah, I was just gonna say I know we said we're done talking about Twitter  But there's a lot of reasons why a lot of employees at Twitter are unhappy with this and there's definitely expected to be a lot  Of losses within Twitter if this deal goes through and that's one of the main reasons that that conversation has been  hugely based on stock and certainly there are ways to provide  Similar proxies for for private companies, but certainly nothing as visible or as seemingly attractive to new employees as  The good old stock option and if that's not on the table anymore  How is Twitter gonna continue to hire good people?  I think for some reason that might actually be something that Musk is looking forward to because one of the things he wants to do  Is cut staff this could cost but in the long run that's gonna make it really hard for them to recruit  talented engineers and keep them

Transcript:  Alphabet in a similar situation YouTube ad revenue  Didn't go down. This is a there's another stock market thing. It just didn't go up as dramatically  So that's considered a loss from the point of view the stock market growth slowing dramatically on YouTube ad revenue  I think the you know, they only it only grew it only grew 14%  Only six point eight seven billion last quarter, but Wall Street wanted and hoped for more  And that's gonna impact Google's ability to acquire talent  Maybe one of the reasons Google announced at the same time that they were gonna spend 70 billion dollars to buy back  stock which puts them  second in the  Tech sphere Apple's buying the most stock back  Apple's a big  Believer in stack stock repurchases then alphabet then Facebook in 2021  I'm  Curious what you think Owen about stock buybacks. Is that a healthy thing for a company to do it makes make shareholders happy  I guess it probably makes  Employees happy because it raises the stock value

Transcript:  Yeah, and stuff where like I think in that they've since eliminated from the UI  The ability to turn off certain kinds of nags  So like somehow I had Spotify configured before so that it wouldn't ask me to turn on Bluetooth every time I turned it on  To quote improve service because I don't want Spotify to know where I am  I don't want they're using it for location services, right?  I you know, I use Spotify because I have the no mic  So knows one systems than on spying ones and you have to use something like Spotify for it  So I have it I pay for it  And I don't want to be nagged to turn on this thing and all there is is like maybe later there's not a  and  Some there used to be somewhere in the UI a setting that persisted when I migrated between phones  that let you turn that off and  That setting is gone the ability to make that setting is gone  And so now I just get the nag every time I turn on Spotify, which you know  It's just the last thing I want it's really annoying the other thing you're identifying here is that  share prices tumble  Partly because of the speculation effect. I think that's absolutely right and partly because of bad surprises, right?  It's not just that like Google didn't Google didn't grow as fast as they had before  It's that Google didn't grow as fast as they predicted and I think this ties into the speculation question  Because when you're speculating you're just gambling on the future and you're like who sounds like they know what they talk about  What they're talking about? Well, Pinchai sounds like he knows what he's talking about  Last seven years. He's told us it would grow this much and it grew that much and then he doesn't you're like  Oh, maybe he just got lucky. I better sell some of my stock because  You know, he's just pulling numbers out of his butt as it turns out and he doesn't know what he's talking about and and  Next year the earnings could be anything  They could be you know double and they could be half who knows because clearly doesn't know what he's doing  He's he's lost his crystal ball, you know, and I think that's that's what stampede investors out of  Company out of these big tech stocks when they fail because they're as as you said, you know, their fundamentals are terrible, right?  For at least for Twitter and you know, that's Netflix and stuff  Their fundamentals aren't great  And so, you know that all of their value is people buying the stock and the expectation that people will buy the stock and that's  Entirely driven by confidence and whether or not  Yeah, our tell our you know, baby Nostradamus is who've got their own little crystal ball that can tell you how their company will perform

They want to do regional release windows  I understand that I have an American publisher of a British publisher  I know what that's like, but you know like the expecting the entire world to arrange itself to your shareholders convenience  And when they fail to do so accusing them of felony contempt of business model  It's not an adult posture it's it is a like there's no word for it  But childish as a way of thinking about how the world should work  Oh now they're saying VPNs are responsible for hacking stalking bomb threats political assassinations child pornography
