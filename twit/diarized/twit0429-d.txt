Start time: 166.33
End time: 175.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You have been very busy.  You've been keynoting.  You've been doing TV shows.  You're doing the Comedy Hack Day, which is awesome.  Just did one at MIT, right?  MIT Media Lab about a month ago.

Start time: 176.12
End time: 187.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Very.  Tell me what that is.  So the idea, it's our company, Cultivated Wit, is the name of the company.  And we like to smash humor and technology together to try to make interesting things.

Start time: 188.02
End time: 190.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And then somebody wins because they do the best in both?  Yeah.

Start time: 191.08
End time: 205.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So it's a hackathon, but better.  Because you have funny people involved.  And the goal is to make funny things.  Wait a minute.  Can comics write code?  Some can.  Really?  Actually, Dick Costello is very funny.  And some also, the point is to create a team that has multiple talents.

Start time: 206.00
End time: 214.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now, bear it in that the one that I liked the most was the one where it did a link bait  generator.  What was the name of that?  Yeah, clickster bait.  Clickster bait.

Start time: 215.42
End time: 239.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, so the idea is you have a lot of editorial outlets, news outlets, really being mysterious  with their headlines.  Right.  You won't believe what Jack Kennedy said to this dog.  Exactly.  Yeah.  And why bother actually creating content behind that?  No need.  Let's just have a site full of click bait links.  Brilliant.  And they auto-generated it.  It pulls celebrity images and rhetorical questions.

Start time: 240.14
End time: 247.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the way it auto-generates this.  Africans have been demanding it, and what he did helped every lesbian alive today.

Start time: 250.51
End time: 259.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  By the way, that's Brian Brushwood from NSFW.  Hey, what's going on?  The BB show, and of course, well-known magician.  What did it say?  You can't show that one.

Start time: 259.02
End time: 265.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They said it shows Christ, and it says they fired him for being himself.  And what he did helped every lesbian alive today.

Start time: 266.00
End time: 270.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So that's guaranteed to get clicks.  Actually, I would click on that just to wonder what the heck is that?

Start time: 270.14
End time: 270.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 271.00
End time: 272.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Probably something to avoid.

Start time: 274.16
End time: 303.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The big thing that the news outlets still do today is they ask a question like,  you know, can your car kill you?  Yeah.  And then...  The Cleveland Clinic did it.  And then in the body of the thing, they say no, but you clicked on it.  It's an old trick.  It's an old trick.  You know probably every one of them.  You're the king.  You invented link baiting before there was a name for it.  Exactly.  When you were the anti-editor in the back of Macworld magazine,  you would say intentionally provocative...  I was hired to do exactly that.

Start time: 303.08
End time: 318.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But he stopped doing that now.  Well, I don't get paid.  I was paid to do that.  Can you do it now?  Dennis, Felix Dennis gave me, he said, here's what you do.  And he gave me that title and I was the anti-editor.  I was paid to condemn Apple and the Mac.  And people still are pissed at me about this.  I know.

Start time: 319.00
End time: 321.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, well it's typecasting.  You kind of, you know, you got known for that.

Start time: 322.00
End time: 323.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  Turns out to be a winner.

Start time: 324.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a good carrier.

Start time: 325.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can't go wrong.

Start time: 326.28
End time: 350.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Apple had a little bit of an event this week.  I will give John a chance to vent some spleen.  Reprise your old role.  They announced a significant number of things.  Two new iPads, the iPad Air, which kind of surprised us.  We didn't know they would name it that.  Yeah, that was dumb.  The old iPad shrunk to a smaller size.  Almost half a pound lighter, which I think is a big deal.  Faster process.  Wasn't that heavy, but okay.  It was kind of heavy.

Start time: 351.12
End time: 364.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  It was kind of heavy.  I mean, when I switched from the full iPad to the mini,  I realized I would, I didn't ever want the full one again  because it was too heavy.  When you're holding it and you're reading long things,  holding it for a long time, like a Kindle,  it's so much lighter and easier to read a book on  than that big monstrosity.

Start time: 365.02
End time: 390.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They've also put Retina on the mini.  In fact, they did something odd with the mini.  The mini was kind of essentially an iPad, too.  It was a couple of generations back, 1024 by 768.  They caught it up.  They caught it up all the way up.  So in fact, this is going to confuse me  and a couple of other, MG Siegler wrote about this thing.  I don't know what to buy because the big iPad, the Air,  is smaller and lighter, so it's closer to a mini.  And the mini is faster in Retina, so it's closer to a mini.

Start time: 390.06
End time: 395.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the X, Y dimensions of the iPad haven't changed, have they?  Just the depth and the weight.

Start time: 396.02
End time: 402.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The X, Y has, too, because notice this narrowed bezel.  They took away some of that big wide frame on it.  So it's in fact narrower.  It's so big.

Start time: 403.87
End time: 415.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So on the iPad mini, did the actual,  when you say Retina resolution,  is that a reference to the number of pixels per inch  or the total number of pixels?  It's the same resolution as the 10.7.

Start time: 416.81
End time: 448.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look, Retina is a marketing term.  All it means, according to Apple...  It means awesomer.  It's better and you should spend...  No, it means...  Betterer.  At the normal viewing distance, you can't see pixels.  That means a 1080p TV at 10 feet.  That means a laptop computer at arm's length.  And on a phone, it means higher pixels per inch.  The density on the iPad mini with Retina is the highest  by a little bit of any device out there, 326 ppi.  So it's higher than the regular iPad Air.

Start time: 449.66
End time: 471.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is weird for me because one of my friends,  Andrew Main, picked up the iPad mini.  In relation to Gucci.  Before it was...  This is going to sound like I'm saying he's a hipster.  But before it hit Retina and was saying, like,  this is it.  This is totally sufficient resolution.  I don't need to get to a level that I can't see the difference.

Start time: 471.34
End time: 475.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, history disagrees.  I mean, you can never say, like, this is enough technology.

Start time: 476.04
End time: 478.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You actually played the history card this early in the show.

Start time: 479.69
End time: 480.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I did.

Start time: 480.33
End time: 489.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I did.  It was way before the Nazi card, though.  So, look, like, to say, like, oh, we don't need more RAM.  Like, didn't Bill Gates famously say that and was, like, super wrong?  I suppose.

Start time: 491.03
End time: 521.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there's a sweet spot with performance versus fidelity, right?  So it's like the trade-off at some point is let's reduce the fidelity  so we can get higher frame rates.  And if you're into games, if you're into the aesthetic performance of things,  then I would say that there is a sweet spot that you want to hit,  where it's like, you know, for example, I'm disappointed.  I still have the iPad 3, the third generation one,  and there are games I play that I'm mad because, like,  why did I get this stupid upgrade if I was just playing it in a lower resolution?  It would run much, much smoother.

Start time: 522.57
End time: 546.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that was an issue.  Oddly enough, it's why the iPad 3 is no longer being sold,  even though the iPad 2 is.  That was a problem on the third...  I hate this.  This is Apple Arcana, which nobody cares about.  But the iPad 3 was the first retina, the third generation iPad,  but it didn't have a processor sufficient to move pixels.  So people complained about its sluggishness.  That's why Apple, oddly, is still selling the iPad 2.

Start time: 548.01
End time: 565.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But part of that was, I think Daring Fireball Dude said this,  but people still want a cheap option.  And if you are using...  It's not that cheap. It's $299.  And you can get a...  Yeah, but...  Yeah, OK.  And if you're using it as a kiosk, you don't need high resolution.  You need big, digit buttons.

Start time: 565.58
End time: 567.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And maybe you want the 30-pin connector for some...

Start time: 568.26
End time: 570.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you already invested in all those adapters.  Yeah.

Start time: 571.12
End time: 575.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That was fun.  I think Apple's big problem,  and I think you and I talked about it before the show,  is it's like, eh...

Start time: 578.01
End time: 608.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eh...  Who cares?  Well, it's...  Somebody.  It's a little bit like...  It's... OK.  OK.  First of all, Apple, yes, you've done amazing things.  However, I feel like...  But what have you done for me lately?  You're going to keep up with appearances.  You're kind of taking steroids now.  The fact that you're combining...  The fact that you're combining your 5S and your 5C sales together  to say, no, I'm as big and strong as I ever was.  Apple Smash!  It's like...  It's beneath you, Apple.  Well, I'll get you...

Start time: 609.00
End time: 638.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm just glad to see that.  A really good example of that is the chart that Tim Cook showed  of iPad sales in which they didn't show...  iPad sales, they showed cumulative sales.  Now, anybody who's ever made a chart knows  that cumulative means it's always going up.  Sales could stop.  That's hope.  On returns.  So, and he didn't...  You know, they didn't hide it, although they did...  There was...  It says cumulative at the top.  There's no zero point on it.  It's...  So, this is this Quartz.com...  Oh, that's cool.

Start time: 638.02
End time: 640.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's up and to the right.  I like that.  Yeah, made an actual...

Start time: 642.26
End time: 645.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a line going upward, Leo.  Are you saying that there's something wrong with Apple?

Start time: 646.16
End time: 658.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So, the bottom part, the bar chart on this Quartz,  it shows actual sales, which are flattening.  They're dying.  But if you do cumulative sales, well, it's always additive, right?  It's always going to be...  So, that's a little bit of chart foo, if you ask me.

Start time: 659.26
End time: 673.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and also, I mean...  And this is going to...  It's a back-ass-ward way of me complimenting Apple.  Part of the problem is that, you know,  my kids still use our Generation 1 iPad.  You know, they use the whole lot of it.  That's the problem.  It's great.

Start time: 674.04
End time: 675.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  That's why I mean it's mad.  Well, it's kids are the problem.

Start time: 676.22
End time: 678.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just like, well...  Kids are the problem.  Why do they not want more?

Start time: 679.04
End time: 681.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Put that on my tombstone.  Thanks, Bear Tuesday.  Yeah, if they would just buy more stuff...

Start time: 682.00
End time: 687.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They should power the economy more than they are.  Yeah, cheap bastards.  They're holding this great nation and this great company back.

Start time: 687.04
End time: 697.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think his kids are a bellwether, though.  I think that's the problem everywhere, is everybody's got...  I don't even have...  I have an iPad third generation that's so-called slow,  and I have no desire.  I'm going to have to,  but I don't really want to buy a new iPad.

Start time: 698.63
End time: 730.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's fine.  And what's funny is...  When you...  I'm experienced that not just on the iPad,  but on the iPhone as well.  Like I had previously announced that this will be...  Or the 5S is the first iPhone that I did not buy at launch,  and I wasn't intending to buy it all,  but then weirdly, my wife is the one.  She's using my old iPhone 4S, which doesn't have LTE,  doesn't have the extra dimensions on the screen.  She's like, well, I was really looking forward to getting your 5.  And so it's like, well, crap.  And so now I'm going to end up buying the 5S,  even though I'm not really all that excited about it.

Start time: 730.87
End time: 777.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right after Tim Cook showed that graph, he pointed out,  iPads have sold 170 million to date.  That's a big number.  Paul Thurotte, who was, by the way, our host of Windows Weekly,  he was the guy who wrote that quote  that they didn't source in the thing that was said,  anybody who thinks the iPad is a game changer is a tool.  That was Paul Thurotte who said that,  quickly sourced by many folks, including...  As soon as I heard the word tool, I thought, that sounds like Paul.  In any event, Paul pointed out that 170 million iPads,  while a nice number,  is the number of total PC sales over the last six months.  Six months!  Not three years.  And, and widely, whereas widely agree that we're in a post PC era  and nobody's buying PCs anymore.  So numbers can, numbers lie.  This is not a...  Well, it's all perception.

Start time: 777.06
End time: 788.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not...  It's perception.  It's nothing to do with numbers.  Right.  No, PCs still sell like hotcakes.  They sell like iPads, only better.  Well, they sell...  There's a lot of PCs being sold.  They have to be sold.  Why?

Start time: 789.38
End time: 791.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Why do people still buy PCs in a post PC era?

Start time: 791.00
End time: 818.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because, well, the case of my machine, my Vista machine,  it's essentially starting to die every which way.  I have Wind Word.  Now, this machine has not been modified.  There's nothing going on.  But why does Word all...  So I got two screens, right?  Yeah.  I take Microsoft Word, I can type, and type, and type.  As soon as I save the file,  Yeah.  it blows up Microsoft Word.  And, if you really want to blow it up,  if I take Microsoft Word and move it to screen two,  boom, it blows up and disappears.  Maybe Vista's the problem.

Start time: 819.68
End time: 825.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a strange set of problems, but it does take...  This is only recent.  Like in the past month?  No, in the past couple months.

Start time: 825.04
End time: 827.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty recent.  John C. Dvorak, I love you deeply,

Start time: 828.00
End time: 830.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but it sounds a little bit like I'm sitting down  with my parents right now.

Start time: 831.24
End time: 832.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And when I was a kid...

Start time: 833.04
End time: 837.78

Transcript:  You know what I've been getting lately?  The radio show is such a...  It's both a...

Start time: 838.00
End time: 852.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait. Stop a minute.  Brushwood Show.  In other words, I should not ever complain about these bugs,  these inherent bugs and these failures,  because I sound like an old man.  Is that what you're saying?  What are you trying to get sort of an ageist jerk off?

Start time: 853.61
End time: 854.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which is what an old man would say.

Start time: 855.00
End time: 857.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to be called an ageist. This is great.  Get off my lawn, Schwud!

Start time: 858.22
End time: 862.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, the ageist thing comes from Berkeley.  It's not really an age-based commentary.

Start time: 863.51
End time: 869.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just guessing. It doesn't...  I don't know.  Like, I don't know nothing about your problem,  but it just seems to be like that.  It's an idiotic problem that shouldn't exist,

Start time: 870.00
End time: 873.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is what my comment is.  Well, it shouldn't, but it happened all of us.

Start time: 873.85
End time: 889.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You think... I mean, it could be you,  it could be the hard drive...  No, it's not me, believe me.  It's not the hard drive.  It's not a user error.  So I've been getting a lot of people calling the radio show.  Same thing.  My Gmail isn't working.  I don't have any mail in my Gmail.  I don't know what the...  So you're saying the same thing to me that he did.

Start time: 890.06
End time: 893.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, but here's the point.  Which I should never have mentioned.  No, no, but here's the point.

Start time: 894.02
End time: 895.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've gotten like three or four calls like that.

Start time: 896.02
End time: 908.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now, clearly, if Gmail really weren't working,  there'd be more than four people,  but if it were working, there wouldn't be four people.  So what's going on that some people...  So there's a problem.  Time for a house call.

But if you are Google and you perceive your business as being so valuable that you don't want to tie it to a specific location in the United States, I don't know.  I'm just saying maybe it makes sense.  They have a patent.  To house a bunch of your data to where you can kind of move on.  That's how I feel about my whole situation.  A little bit of head-on-out to intercoastal waterways if trouble arises.  This is from their 2009 patent, a water-based data center.

They have a whole thing for data centers in the containers.  As you know, Google must have to buy new data centers several a day at least.  So these data centers can actually be put into these containers and loaded on these ships via crane.  It's a floating platform.  Now, one of the issues with data centers is cooling and electrical.  You've got to have lots of cooling.  That's why they went up to Portland where electricity was cheap.  You're buying into this, I can tell.  I'm totally buying into it.  So they use a sea-based electrical generator and use sea water.  And use sea water cooling.  That's the coolest thing ever.

So, his point, and this is the smartest take I heard on it, was, look, you've got Apple  squeezing Microsoft from one end saying, we'll give software a way to sell hardware.  You've got Google squeezing from the other end saying, we'll give software a way to sell  you.  Sell your data, sell your information.  So, whoever is trying to monetize software directly is stuck.  And he was positioning it as Microsoft, but it's not just anyone who's trying to sell  their time as coders in software to a user to spend cash dollars.  It's in a weird spot if we're training people from two of the largest organizations that  software should be free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's a nasty virus going around called Crypto Locker.  That's what the virus experts call it.  But you won't see it necessarily.  But what it does is it uses strong encryption to encrypt your files and you can't get them back.  Right.

Start time: 1827.02
End time: 1831.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a really this scam began some time ago when they were.  Well, there was ransomware.  Ransomware.  You could always remove ransomware.

End time: 1854.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I talked earlier today to Steve Gibson.  He actually took time out of his busy Sunday, you know, to join me.  I asked him about Crypto Locker and why he wanted it.  What?  I think you should have recorded that.  I did.  OK.  Right now, Steve, why are we talking about Crypto Locker?

Start time: 1854.56
End time: 1894.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought it was really important because this is sort of something new.  This new Crypto Locker, which an alarming number of people are falling victim to, it actually encrypts all the documents in their personal documents folder and even other files that it can find in thumb drives or on the network.  You know, it's able to reach out essentially from your computer, but it it encrypts them in such a way that no expert.  I mean, truly no one is able to decrypt it, not even the NSA.  We've seen this category of software before.

Start time: 1897.10
End time: 1919.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's called ransomware, where you'll get a virus on your system, malware on your system, and it puts up a sign.  Usually it says this is the FBI.  Give us money and we'll let you access your computer.  But in the past, that stuff is an expert could get around it.  This is not like that.  This literally does strong encryption on your data and there is no expert that can get around it.  Correct.  They ask for money, right?

Start time: 1920.40
End time: 1944.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they ask for about three hundred dollars US or euros or the equivalent in bitcoins.  They'll take your money in many different ways.  And the idea is that they do have a key which can be used to decrypt your data.  So basically it's holding your files at ransom.  And if you don't pay them, they really are gone.

Start time: 1945.44
End time: 1975.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You have 72 hours to send them the money.  After that, they delete the key and it doesn't matter.  You know, you could beg and plead all you want.  No one can unencrypted your data is gone.  Correct.  It's a countdown time with how much time is left.  And worse, apparently law enforcement has misguidedly found the servers that these keys sometimes finds the servers.  These keys are on and shuts them down, which means you may not even have 72 hours.  If law enforcement gets to the server, the keys are gone, even if you pay the money.

Start time: 1975.26
End time: 2015.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So, so yeah, the way to think about this, I think, is backing up is now more important than ever.  You're not backing up just in case your hard drive crashes or something bad happens to your computer.  But if you got infected by this, there's really no guarantee you can get your data back.  Do we know who's doing this?  No, there's so far they've managed to hide themselves.  The way they're doing accepting cash is through money packs.  And in fact, some of the retailers that offer money packs have said they're having a hard time keeping them in stock now.  Because so many people are buying them in order to try to get their files back.  There's a run on them.

Start time: 2016.92
End time: 2033.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They also accept Bitcoin, which is a much less common but equally anonymous form of payment.  Right.  It may not even be just one group.  We've seen this with ransomware before.  Somebody sells a kit and then various groups will spread this around.  It could be coming from a variety of different people.  How do you get this virus?

Start time: 2034.46
End time: 2081.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the problem is that it's going, it's making people a lot of money.  And so they're going to be copycats.  My concern is this is we're talking now about the first one, but this is the first of I'm afraid many because this is going to be the new model for what happens when you get your computer infected.  And to answer your question, most of it seems to be so-called phishing mail where something is email is sent to you that looks authentic.  It looks like it's from your bank.  It looks like it's from PayPal.  It looks like something you may not expect, but it's reasonable.  And they get you to click on a link or sometimes they'll say, we just deducted some money from your PayPal account.  And you go, what?  And you click on it before you think.

Start time: 2082.08
End time: 2107.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I've seen one example.  It looks like it's from a bank and it says we received a wire transfer to you and your name attached is the facts.  It has the extension dot PDF, but hidden.  It's really a dot PDF dot E X E.  When you double click it, it doesn't launch a PDF or Adobe Reader.  It launches an executable.  And by the time you figure that out, you're dead.  Does an antivirus prevent this?

Start time: 2109.22
End time: 2154.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, so far it is managing to get past all the AV, although it is so new.  It's only about three weeks from the first time we saw it.  So there is some some delay before the antivirus vendors catch up.  There's also a tool which is supposed to prevent its infection, which is available for free, where it deliberately blocks some of the specific behaviors that this thing, this crypto locker does.  The problem with that is if that got traction, the crypto locker authors would easily circumvent it and work their way around.  So really just being extremely careful, clicking on links in email and and really have a backup because you unfortunately may need it.

Start time: 2154.00
End time: 2161.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now there is there are backups and backups there.  If you have what's called a hot backup, this may not be enough.  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 2163.02
End time: 2176.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because if, for example, if you're backing up to a like you have a family or residential network attached storage, if it can see the files, it can encrypt them.  So that's a tool called a hot backup.  So it can encrypt your backup.

Start time: 2179.17
End time: 2209.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And furthermore, you could back up encrypted files.  Once it's encrypted, if you don't catch it right away, those files could be backed up as well on top of your good copies.  So you want a backup system that isn't local, can't be seen as a drive letter from your computer, your presumably affected computer.  And you want a backup that has what's called versioning so that you can go to a previous unencrypted version.  But if you do, then you do have recourse.  Best thing, though, not to get this.  There is no Mac version of this yet.  It is a Windows only.

Start time: 2210.43
End time: 2235.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Yep.  And again, I'm just worried that, I mean, everything we've seen, mostly, I mean, historically viruses have been an annoyance.  This is new.  And it's not like this cryptography is rocket science.  All of the code to do this is in the public domain.  It's common knowledge how to produce this kind of system.  And I don't think we've seen the last of it.  I think this is the first of it.

Start time: 2236.40
End time: 2273.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, it just reinforces how important it is to practice safe computing, not to be very suspicious of attachments, whether they come from somebody you know or not, to be very careful about clicking links in email.  Never click a link directly in email and let the web page open.  That's always dangerous or instant messenger or on Facebook or on Twitter.  If you see links, you know, a lot of my Twitter friends have been hacked lately and I get direct messages from them with links.  And, you know, that could easily fool you because it's a direct message, private message from a friend.

Start time: 2273.86
End time: 2299.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of the best little sort of pithy bits of advice we have is if you did not go seeking it, don't do it.  That is something that's offered to you.  Unfortunately, in this day and age, we have to view that with suspicion.  So, you know, manually go to the bank's website that sent you email or that you believe sent you email.  You know, you initiate the action rather than letting someone push the action on you.

Start time: 2299.00
End time: 2350.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because if you get an email from your bank, you could just type in the URL in your browser.  That would be safe. Right. Yes.  Yeah. And don't count on your antivirus to protect you while they are getting updated quickly.  They may not block that initial infection.  And of course, it's a cat and mouse game.  As soon as the antivirus has come up with detection routines, the bad guys change how it works.  Exactly.  Steve Gibson is at GRC.com. He's a great resource to the community.  If you haven't listened to his Security Now podcast, I'm a little biased.  I co-hosted with him Wednesdays, 11 a.m. Pacific, 2 p.m. Eastern at twit.tv or just download it from twit.tv slash SN.  Thank you, Steve. I appreciate your time.  Thanks, Leo.  Yeah, that was actually from earlier today from the radio show.  So I apologize. There's no video for those of you watching on video.  You just had to watch us nod and think and sit there and eat Twizzlers.  Fake Twizzlers.  Fake Twizzlers.

Start time: 2351.57
End time: 2432.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, help me out here.  It seems to me like there's there's almost like a game theory aspect to this whole conundrum because we've seen the rise of when computer viruses began.  A big thrust of it was, you know, to make your mark.  Like, just be the guy who invented the virus, who, you know, went around the world.  And then we saw destructive viruses for a while in the early 90s where it's like, you know, wipe your hard drive just for grins because you want to set fire to something beautiful.  And then for a long time, we've seen kind of the only reason to write a virus was so that you could get a zombie computer that you could use to make click links for you.  So you would have basically a zombie net.  But this is a new and credible threat because, number one, the game theory breaks down where if you're writing this kind of computer,  it's important that it follow through on the threat of utterly destroying everyone's data so that it gets a reputation for being the kind of thing that you don't want to mess around with.  And you actually want to spend the money in order to recover your data.  And likewise, there's also through cryptocurrency with Bitcoin and so on, there's a simple and relatively untraceable way to get money from it.  I mean, is this I fear Steve is 100 percent right.  I mean, it seems like we could see an onslaught of this, right?

Start time: 2433.06
End time: 2459.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They the FBI estimated that the earlier ransomware is, you know, the one the FBI warning where you'd say FBI says you have child porn on your right.  Give us $300 in money packs and we'll forget about it.  That has made people millions of dollars a year, five million dollars a year is one estimate I saw.  But that's nothing because that was you could get around that.  You could bring it to the guy and he, you know, the shop, he would know he could get malware bites and he could remove it.  This there's no recourse.  There's no recourse.

Start time: 2460.00
End time: 2470.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is like it's close to perfect terrorism.  Yeah, it's pretty creepy.  So what one of the thoughts it raises for me, Steve's last point about don't engage in anything you didn't seek out.

Start time: 2471.16
End time: 2477.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, that actually is a Bruce Schneier.  But it's a great general principle of life.

Start time: 2478.00
End time: 2536.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, like somebody comes and talks to you.  I didn't seek you out.  I'm not engaging with this, but it's harder to do in a high speed network.  Because you're not sure.  And we are we've we've I know I'll speak for myself.  I've trained myself to say like I rarely seek out news and information, for example, the news finds me.  You know, that's the mantra of pushed.  Yeah, it's like so it's just in my feed.  Right. And, you know, I even have advice when I'm talking to people like click before you retweet so you know what you're spreading.  Right. And something may look really attractive as a headline.  Have a reasonable looking link.  And then you're sending someone off into some malware empire.  But this is so this feels consistent with that.  The other point I would make is there's a great television show, which this reminds me of.  And I highly I can't recommend it enough.  I have nothing to do with it.  And you'll have to use creative means to acquire it.  It's a British Channel four television show called Black Mirror.  OK, there are only six episodes, a lot of Sherlock three episodes per season.

Start time: 2537.96
End time: 2544.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but the black mirror is the one to do because I have by all I haven't seen any of them because I'm a legal law abiding citizen.  But but but the rest of the show is amazing.

Start time: 2559.00
End time: 2561.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2561.22
End time: 2566.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like the Twilight Zone for technology.  Yeah, it talks about the black mirror that we all keep in our dark side of all this stuff.

Start time: 2567.60
End time: 2577.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so this reminds me of one of the scenarios. Is it a serious?  It's a series with each episode stands on its own. Is it fiction?  It is probably.  It's like persons of interest, like Terminators of fiction.

Start time: 2578.89
End time: 2581.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 2581.34
End time: 2588.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it does a great job of dealing with this is not it.  This cannot be it. No, I don't know why that's.  Oh, yeah, it is actually. Is it? Yeah, that's one of the episodes.

Start time: 2589.16

Start time: 2596.07
End time: 2598.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So tie this in for us. So here's the here's the point.

Start time: 2600.24
End time: 2657.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have it's a new type of hostage taking.  It's a new type of theft and a new type of crime.  And to your point, you would wear.  I don't even think they have to destroy your data.  You just have to never see it again. Right.  To know that the threat is real and it's credible.  And we are all we've walked into.  We've all kind of together agreed somewhat passively.  Like this is what we want to live in. Right.  We want to digitize all of our files. We don't want to have.  We want to put all of our movies in the cloud.  And you get to books like Jonathan Zittrain's The Future of the Internet and How to Stop It.  And you look and Bilton's book.  Is this why you're kind of pushing it away?  It's not that I'm pushing it away.  I think I am to provide a little more context, just trying to be a little more conscientious about the engagement.  When so my unplugging from social media and email for 25 days was like healthy.  Trying to hold on to devices longer. It's just 25 days.  Which is infinite for me.  Consider. It's hard. I have a hard time doing it.

Start time: 2658.08
End time: 2660.00

Start time: 2670.92
End time: 2691.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I kind of think that that's a mistake to to say like, well, I'm a special case because I'm in, you know, your your opponent and a leader in the thought leader in this space.  I'm going to I'm going to just full on defend the idea of always being plugged into your prosthetic brain.  You know, like I went three days without being plugged into my prosthetic brain and I hated being able not to know things.

Start time: 2691.02
End time: 2696.42

Start time: 2697.48
End time: 2700.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2701.06
End time: 2706.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 2707.32
End time: 2709.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  The nettle is so illiterate.  I'm getting the context.

Start time: 2710.18
End time: 2712.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what it means?  See, he doesn't know what it means.

Start time: 2712.00
End time: 2712.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never know what he means.

Start time: 2713.14
End time: 2721.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  We got to have to people have you ever have you ever you know what a nettle is like?  I know a netty pot, which clears out a netty pot.  If you're a nettle, it is a is a stinging nettle.

Start time: 2725.06
End time: 2767.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Look at this.  Oh, yeah.  OK. Yes.  So as it turns out with a nettle, if you gently hold it, it will prick you.  Right.  So if you grasp the nettle firmly, you can get it.  Oh, perfect.  Yeah, that's a great metaphor.  So it is a common perfect is a common saying that because there's intention in it.  Right.  So the idea is I'm going to I understand the the technologies at Double Edge Sore, but I am instead of doing there's two ways to approach it.  One is I'm going to back off a little bit and maybe we should be more judicious.  The other is say, no, this is the future.  And we need to face it and we need to take control of this and we need to fight the NSA instead of just saying, well, I'm not going to give them any detail.  Fight them.

Start time: 2768.08
End time: 2795.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't see those as two different points so much as I see them as part of the same.  I agree.  They're both legitimate.  They're both legitimate responses.  So in this case, you know what it doesn't mean like don't use technology.  It means use it with knowledge and try to stay ahead.  So have to Steve's point, have yourself backed up in a non network fashion.  You know, in part, that doesn't mean you have to every day lug hard drives to a safety deposit box.  But maybe once a year you do that because things are this important.

Start time: 2795.20
End time: 2824.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Help me on this regard, Baratunde, because like outside of photographs, I have a really hard time thinking of reasons to justify local backups of everything.  Like every so often I take all the photographs that we've ever taken and I burn them on, you know, put them onto a hard drive and I give it to a friend just to get it off site.  But like outside of that, what else is there to be worried about?  You know, stuff like, you know, your credit card information has a built in liability barrier on it where it's like even if somebody steals it, you're not responsible for those charges.  What else is there I should be scared of?

Start time: 2826.05
End time: 2851.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and this I'm not even advocate.  That was an example that I'm not wed to the idea of the safety deposit box thing.  But this virus seems like it's not discriminating against any kind of file.  Is it? No, it's just wiped out.  So, you know, for you who creates things, it's far more than photos that you care about.  It might be scripts, it might be notes, it might be journals, it might be things that have intrinsic personal worth and zero to maybe even negative worth to other people.

Start time: 2852.82
End time: 2869.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So in that regard, we're kind of all skewed because all four of us are people who create content that we desperately hope other people will bother to look at.  So it's hard to wrap my mind around the idea of like, what have I written that I don't want out there?  I'm like, I wish all of it was out there. That's I don't know.

Start time: 2869.22
End time: 2875.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's not about it being out there. It's about it not being available to you.  I'm not talking about like mass publication of yourself and talking about mass deletion of your stuff.

Start time: 2877.06
End time: 2880.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, either way, that sounds like I'd probably be better off.

Start time: 2881.34
End time: 2887.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, OK, so just to clarify, like you don't if you lost everything you ever created until this morning, you'll be fine with that.

Start time: 2888.65
End time: 2907.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I definitely wouldn't be fine with that.  But when I picture that scenario, there's another OK, there's me in the moment who's utterly panicked like, oh crap, everything I created is gone.  And then there's some like metamie.  And maybe I'm alone in this, but there's some metamie watching that scenario that says good.  Now you could do something that matters.

Start time: 2907.28

Transcript:  Well, there's another aspect of this, Brian, which is that most of the stuff you create, if you're doing it for a living, is is out there backed up in the system.  I mean, PC Magazine has all my old columns.  I have copies. But if I if I lost everything, I just go back and down.

Start time: 2924.26

Welcome to Mame That Advertiser.  And I use some all now.  Do you really?  Yeah, we use it.  We use it for scamstuff.com.  You should.  Like, like, like, OK, and forgive me.  This is this is not scripted.  It's not a bit we set up or whatever.  No, it isn't.  I didn't know you knew him.  Yeah, no, no, no.  My experience with some all is some all is basically the place to get all of your metrics  for everything over time.  Right.  And for me personally, like scamstuff.com, we want to know how much we sold, what the  traffic is or whatever.  We throw that into some all some all is better at it than than the than than Shopify in some  ways.  Well, here's the thing.  Service that we use business intelligence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The idea of B.I. has been around for a long time.  Big businesses have used this for a long time because once they realize we're in the era  of big data and you can know everything about, you know, widgets and how they've sold and  who's buying, they started really using this B.I. software to start generating.  You know, really, you can project how you're going to do it.  All sorts of stuff you can know.  But it's never been in the realm of the individual.  And yet here we are really in terms of the individual.  We're in this big data here.  You've got Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus.  You've got Instagram.  You've got YouTube.  You've got Foursquare.  You've got Tumblr.  You've got Blogger.  You've got Wordpress.  You've got all of these sites where you're pouring data into it.  Everything that's being bought on Amazon.  You know, if you're selling scam school on Amazon or would you like to know whether the  Kindle is doing better than the iBooks?  All of that stuff.  You could put that in there and instead of guessing, you can really understand what's  going on with your business.  Some all does exactly this.  They just added Instagram, Foursquare, Tumblr, Blogger, Moe's, Stripe.  That's the credit card fulfillment company.  Braintree, BigCommerce.  So, Brian, you're a perfect example with the scam school book and the scam school stuff  because you want to see this campaign.  You know, when I do a concert, you know, a performance in this town, do I see increased  sales in this town?  If I tweet about it, does that make a difference, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera?  It's really useful to know.  And best of all, this is free.  This is absolutely free.  Social, commerce, payments, traffic, whatever you want to know.  Improve modern analytics, integration with related data streams, personalized daily or  weekly emails.  You can, of course, export it or get a spreadsheet view within some all.  You can get your projections in the email.  There are dozens of features.  They've really taken off.  They've grown 20% over the last month.  There are now 60,000 companies and customers using some all's data analytics service.  And you heard it all about it first here.  I think we are the first place to show some all to the public.  Up to the minute real-time data.  In fact, there's a mobile app for the iPhone that will show you how your online store is  doing up to the minute in real-time historical stats.  You can track revenue units sold.  There's an Android app coming soon.  I want you to visit someall.com and sign up for your free account.  Start by connecting three or more of the web services you use.  It does everything, so that won't be any trouble.  Take a few minutes and see.  It's hard to describe what it will do until you use it.  These analytics are hugely important.  Someall.com.  Think about it this way.

We're obsessed with the numbers for our physical health.  Why not the health of your social presence or the health of your small business or the  health of everything?  You should know what numbers you're doing on everything.  This is amazing.  What a surprise.  I had no idea that someall was a sponsor.  I got some feedback from them.

Transcript:  You probably met him.  He would love to know you.  He would love to know you.  Dane is one of the coolest guys you'll ever meet.  Really, really great.  Disney, I think, might have done some damage to the notion of streaming media.  We all know kind of intellectually that when you buy a movie on Amazon streaming.  I'll give you an example.  I wanted to own The Sopranos.  When James Gandolfini passed, I wanted to own The Sopranos.  It was the greatest show of all time.  There was no box set.  I was going to buy a physical media version of it.  So I priced it out.  It was actually about the same to get it on Amazon and have it stored in a locker.  No physical stuff to move.  No DVDs to lose.  Quality was excellent.  So I have it.  You have it.  I don't have it.  If you look at the license agreement, I never had it.  You have the right to stream it until such time as you don't, basically.  Disney brought this all home.  Some say it was an accident.  I don't know.  Seems unlikely with Disney.  Disney and Pixar have yanked their movies from Amazon Prime and from Apple, from the iTunes.  If you had it in your locker, if you didn't have a physical copy of it, it's gone.

Transcript:  It just deleted the thing you thought you bought.  Which played out perfectly in the Trane's book.  That's exactly why he wrote that.  Saying because you have access to some cloud version of a thing, you don't really have the thing.  And some day someone's going to decide you don't own that.

Start time: 3591.32
End time: 3603.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Disney, you probably knew this.  I know John, you know this.  Disney had this very clever marketing strategy with video cassettes and later with DVDs  They would make a movie only available for a short time and then they would pull it for seven years.  It was very smart.

Start time: 3605.00
End time: 3614.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and they would change it a little bit every time.  They'd beef it up.  Or there'd be some new cut in there.  But it really helped sales because everybody...  Limited time offers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And if you have kids now, you're going to get that Lion King right now.  You are?  Well, I think anyway.  Theoretically.  So I think this has something to do with that.  We can't do that anymore because everybody has got copies of it.

Start time: 3629.26
End time: 3633.77

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's the important thing, Leo.  Whether it was on purpose or not.  Believe it that there are people working at this company who are watching very closely to see what the response is.  And if the response is that people don't really care when we take things away, then that's a green light.  That's a flag that says go ahead, make artificial scarcity our letter of the day.  But if everybody goes completely 8-nuts on this, then it'll make it difficult.  So I say my default position is make noise and get angry about everything.  Nobody does that anymore.

Start time: 3709.18
End time: 3745.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Keep in mind also, the flip side here, which is that kids, while they are very good about repeatedly watching the same content over and over again, they're not terribly picky.  For example, I don't think...  While my kids have said they want to get on Netflix to watch, you know, Disney made a bunch of their...  You know, they got Ant Farm and all these other kids shows that the kids watch over and over and over again.  Like, I've never heard the kids once say, hey, where's that one thing that I really wanted to watch that's not available right now?  Kids are very menu based, you know?  It's like whatever Netflix has, that's all that ever existed.  And if something they watch wasn't available all of a sudden, they don't seem to notice at all.

Transcript:  So imagine a scenario, and Ken from Chicago in the chat room reminded me of when Kindle, when those 1984 books disappeared from your personal Kindle library, which is so perfectly ironic.  So imagine a bigger case where, you know, we're 30 years down the line, even five years down the line, and through the ownership stakes of corporate X, like Omni Media, you know, Allied Waste Management, etc.  There's a little Gary Steingart reference in there, but more than a few titles disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is the real point, and I think the real risk of this is it's going to raise people's awareness that you didn't own it.  They can do this.  It's in the terms and conditions.  At any time, they can delete those files.

End time: 3833.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would hate to take the evil corporate five-year position here.  Oh, this is going to be fun.  But it seems to me that the outrage would be directly proportional to the popularity of the title.  If it's something that everybody bought and everybody loved and everybody perceived as their own, then yes, the whole world would go nuts and freak out about it.  And there would be a big fix to it immediately.  But if it's a minor title that nobody cared about, then it would be quiet.  And there's part of me that's kind of OK with that.

Start time: 3835.66
End time: 3852.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the part of you that appreciates niche culture and freedom in general is equally as upset.  I'm telling you what you think, which is a lot of fun.  It's equally as upset about that unpopular title disappearing because it's unpopular titles that give us cultural diversity.

And every time the way it gets settled is if it's very popular and well-beloved by the  populace, then they get up in arms.  If it's not, then they don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's why that's not true.  If that were true, then we would only rely on one juror.  But the reason we have 12 is because you get higher fidelity and you get a more accurate  reading with 12 instances of justice up and down, thumbs down.  No, but it's not market-driven.  First of all, it's the market of jurors.

Transcript:  I get what you're saying, but it's also our whole system of justice doesn't come down  to a pool of jurors.  There's a Supreme Court.  There's a legislative body.  There are referendums.  There are all sorts of mitigating factors against the mob.  The only reason we have those is because we have increased and higher levels of fidelity

Transcript:  Don't you think, Brian, really, that stuff that's unpopular deserves as much protection  as stuff that's popular?  Okay.  In fact, I can give you a really good example of this, and these are the works that are  technically copyrighted but are orphaned.  Nobody wants to assert the copyright, but those are protected as copyrighted works.  In fact, it was the whole crux of the debate over whether Google could scan books because  even though these were orphaned works, it would be lost.  Larry Lessig suggested just a simple change in the copyright law.  If you want to renew the copyright, you need to pay $1, which was obviously an insignificant  amount of money, but many, many, many, many works are orphaned.  You should go into the public domain because there's no one who says, yeah, I'll pay a  dollar.  Nobody cares enough.  That stuff needs to be protected too, don't you think?

Transcript:  Okay.  I totally agree with the $1 angle, and let me state, unequivocally, I'm not saying that  everything needs to be, just everything's all willy-nilly.  I am saying that I suspect there's other currencies besides monetary currency out there.  I agree.  I agree.  And any kind of intention of protecting your stuff.  For example, there will be, and it's difficult for me to think of one at the moment, but  there will be some work of art where part of the work of art is that you will never  own it, and I can do with it whatever I want.  And I want to protect the ability for that artist to do that thing, whatever it is, whatever  that fantasy scenario is.  And I don't think this is ever going to be a simple, yes, one side or the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Certainly, it says it's owned your gold, for example.  It flatly says your Warcraft gold has no monetary value, which is what's fascinating to me.  Look at this.  Me bringing it back to the dock.  The NSA confiscating bitcoins.  Like that is fascinating to me because unlike ISK in EVE Online or gold in Warcraft, this  is a case where the government, by seizing a cryptocurrency, is for the first time perversely  kind of acknowledging it as having real monetary value.

But they also confiscated...  And I don't know how they...  I'm actually very curious how they confiscate bitcoins, but the FBI says it seized $28.5  million in bitcoins from the alleged owner of Silk Road.  I need an explanation.  I want my donuts back.

I actually started Twit, not because I wanted to do a business or make money or anything.  I just didn't want to have any more meetings.  Tech TV was all meetings.  You remember that?

Transcript:  Anyway, you do sometimes have to have meetings in business because that's, we have a rule  here, more than five emails on a subject, get the parties in the room to discuss.  However, we are, like many businesses now, distributed all over the world.  We've got people in Texas.  We've got people in Brooklyn.  We've got people in England.  So that's why when we have to meet, when we have to get people together to cut through  and solve problems, to brainstorm, to create, we use GoToMeeting.  It is a great way to keep everybody on the same page or sharing screens.  But also now with HDFaces, you see them.  So it really is as good as a face-to-face meeting.  Sometimes better.  Frankly, sometimes it's better not to be in the same room with people.

Which because it shows you how hard it actually is.  I mean, they've gone back three, nearly three years in online statements, transaction, forum  and all of those things.  Blog posts and found little mistakes, hints of someone's interested in the Mises Institute.  It was really an interesting story, wasn't it?  It's hard to not be yourself.  I can see the movie.  Because what I got from that story, assuming it's true, is you're going to let pieces of  your personality slip out.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right, right, right.  They claim he's the dread pirate Roberts.  That's the handle DPR that the guy who ran Silk Road used.  What's interesting is they now the FBI says they have recovered his wallet.  That's very nice of them.  Probably on his computer.  You found your wallet.  In his wallet.  And this would be also incriminating, I think 144,000 bitcoins.  I have four in my wallet.  So they're worth almost they're worth more than 100 bucks.  How do they do this?  It's a virtual product.  No, but your wallet is stored on a computer hard drive.  OK, right.

Start time: 4633.78
End time: 4651.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, that's the thing is, is so Bitcoin is not a cloud based product, as I understand  it in so far as like there's not a central server.  It's not like Napster.  It's more like BitTorrent, where it's like you you keep the keys to your own money separate  from everything else.  And if they recover your keys, they essentially have your money.

Start time: 4652.44
End time: 4655.97

Start time: 4660.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So he in other words, the way it sounds, either had the computer on him so they could associate  it with him that it had all the bitcoins on there.  And he kept an unencrypted file, an encrypted system that would allow them to just waltz  right in and find the wallet.  That's what you're telling me.  Yeah.  OK, I'm not buying any of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think what I might what I'm about to say might feel like a side jag.  But I feel like it's totally in line with what we're talking about right here.  What we're talking about is the ethics of behavior about the ability to look at a history  of a person's transactions and figure out if he's guilty or innocent or whatever.  Here's what's remarkable to me.  And I kind of want to throw this out there.  And if you guys don't want to go along, that's fine.  We'll move on to something else.  But is the nature of Internet transactions causing all of us to be more ethical?  And what I mean by that is, you know, for the entire history of mankind, there has been  some religion or other that has that has said there is a permanent record and there is an  entity monitoring your every move.  And, you know, are you doing the right thing or the wrong thing?

Start time: 4758.94
End time: 4784.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's the theory of Bitcoin.  You know, cash is anonymous.  That's why a lot of people like John C.  DeVorek don't want cash to ever be eliminated, because it's the only really anonymous way  I advise his drugs.  Right.  Right.  But not just drugs.  I'm old enough.  I don't need drugs.  But whatever you know, if you don't want the government to monitor you, you can't you can't  use a credit card.  You can't write a check.  You have to use cash and you have to get it from some anonymous source.  My middle initial is C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, OK, well, where I'm headed with this is that it's not just about Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is just one of the different threads in this discussion.  You know, we there there's technology now you can actually go online to YouTube and  look at where where they have recorded movies.  You know, there's movies of people doing this thing or acting or doing whatever they do.  And there are people who have figured out that you can look at the difference in the  color scheme of their skin and amplify it and be able to see the rate of their pulse  as they're acting in the movie.  You see a baby and it looks like he's flashing red.  But that's just because they turn up the contrast to a billion on this thing.  Or that baby's the devil.  It could be.  But also there's the ability to to break down.  There's the ability to break down the pattern.

Who we are on the inside is transparent to anyone who has the right algorithm that can  break it down, whether it's your spending.  No, and that's what's interesting about this.

Start time: 4879.04
End time: 4913.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  In order to be able to tie this to somebody and even to get to the bitcoins, you have  to have the secret.  It's using public key crypto.  So you have to have, in effect, the secret key, which means they must have seized his  hardware and it wasn't encrypted or they got him to unencrypted.  And so but that does that gives you the connection, right, to his physical hard drive.  But otherwise, no, you without somebody's secret key, you don't know if I you know, I  get Bitcoin donations because we have a little donate thing on the TV.  I don't know where those came from.  I have no idea.  It's a long.  You don't care either.  I don't want to know.  Well, I don't know why.  It's anonymous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 5084.70

That's that's going to work.  It is a very interesting world the FBI has dealt with.  The future is weird, y'all.  If you heard my interview on Wednesday, we had the guy who founded LavaBit, the email  system that Edward Snowden used, Lidar Levison was on triangulation on Wednesday and talked  about how the FBI approached him.  And his sense was that the FBI had no clue what they were up to or what they were looking  for.  And yet this is fairly sophisticated FBI work.  I mean, this is this is pretty deep work.  I wonder where the truth lies.  Are there experts within the FBI that can do that kind of triangulation that you're  talking about, Brian?  Well, I think Brian should be hired.

Who will be so good at recording their track record and use certain words and certain types  of jokes and certain positions that you will be able to predict with a degree of accuracy  so high that it will be indistinguishable from the guy's actual tweets when he was live.  I believe this.

And then she feeds it more information.  It's not far off.  I don't think we're here yet.  We don't know what that amount of data is.  If that's him and all, it gets very interesting.

Start time: 5816.26
End time: 5840.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think everybody deserves to have privacy if they want it.  But I think conversely, if those who choose to live in public have their certain advantages  to that as well.  We've had this conversation, Jeff Jarvis and I, many times on this week in Google, because  As an example, when he got a diagnosis of cancer, talked about it and found it very-  the community that responded to him and so forth found it very powerful and affirming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo's mostly right.  And to be honest, if I can bring this back to the Twitter network, this is something  we talk about on Framerate all the time.  And we're seeing this as an intentional move from HBO.  HBO has refused to make available stuff like Game of Thrones available the next morning.  They essentially create a black market.  Then they get all the notoriety of having the number one most pirated movie in all of  BitTorrent, which is great for their promotions.  But they don't actually lose anything as far as their arrangement with cable corporations.  In a perfect world, HBO would love to offer you an individual subscription the way Netflix  does, but they're too in bed with Comcast.

Start time: 6040.68
End time: 6054.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the answer to that, I mean, it's not...  There are people who are not...  No one's an idiot here, right?  It's money.  I'm sure Channel 4 has made some deal in which they get compensated for UK distribution.

Start time: 6054.18
End time: 6059.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Channel 4 is private.  It is not funded by the government.  It's not funded by licenses.

Start time: 6060.04
End time: 6064.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But even BBC stuff is not...  They have proxies.  They very much...

Start time: 6064.64
End time: 6073.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But that I understand because they're saying the British public with their TV...  Unless they don't do this anymore, but they used to have to pay a TV license fee and that  pays for the BBC.

Start time: 6073.80
End time: 6084.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But even like I tried...  I think I tried to use RDO out of the country or something.  There's just a lot of contracts around media.  And the end user never knows.  And so it just looks like...  But I...

Start time: 6085.24
End time: 6088.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So Channel 4 is publicly funded.  I apologize.  It's like the BBC and everything.

Start time: 6088.48
End time: 6096.36

Transcript:  I like though that Brian's theory that HBO is doing a little jiu-jitsu with that by intentionally  not offering it for download, hoping as it is that it would become popular through Bitmorrent.  And it's great publicity.  It undermines these untenable...

Start time: 6112.24
End time: 6118.90

Start time: 6119.85
End time: 6145.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I can respond, freaking...  This has been HBO's philosophy from the beginning.  HBO has never been concerned with actual numbers of viewers.  In fact, instead all they do is they care about getting awards.  It used to be the CableAce Awards.  Now they're eligible.  They must care about money.  Certainly, they care about subscriber count.  But you're right.  What they want is the notoriety of being extraordinarily popular.  They want to create this narrative of like, we're awesome.  Because their revenue comes from subscriber count.

Start time: 6146.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 6147.24
End time: 6155.75

End time: 6161.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

You're like the only...  You are the progenitor of all these guys.  This is personal brand.  I've started it before anybody else in terms of saying, I'm going to make money just doing  this.  I'm going to ride it all the way down.  And you have been very successful.

Transcript:  All right, stop talking, both of you.  Look, John C. Dvorak, you epitomize the fact...  Both of you, Leo and John, you embody two different aspects of the same thing.  First of all, yes, personal brands matter, and it matters a lot.  And keep in mind, up until this point, the only reason that somebody would go to another  scene or newspaper was because they thought they could get closer to their actual value.  John C. Dvorak, the way you determine your value is that you go out there and you ask  for direct contributions from your No Agenda audience, and it does very well.  And they pretty much, give or take, give you exactly what your value as a human being who's  able to, with your algorithm of insight, is able to determine.  Leo Laporte did the exact same thing.  He makes us more...  He was fired from one entity, ran off and said...  You were fired?  Straight to...  Give or take, whatever.  He goes off and says, hey, world, what am I worth?  And the world bought bricks and founded Twit.  Baratunde, you haven't pissed anyone off yet, so I don't know how to determine your value.  But the point is...

Start time: 6381.82
End time: 6392.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But isn't that what you want to do, Baratunde?  I mean, personal brand for you is very key.  Yeah.  And you have a great personal brand.  We just got to get the word out.  We got to get the word out.

Start time: 6392.50
End time: 6412.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think that these guys have been working for a living for a long time that think they  can go off and do this and they've never been freelance, which is...  Leo and I have been contractors and freelancers.  We worked in a lot of different places.  These other guys who worked for one place for 25 years and think they're going to go  off and do this by themselves without the oversight of the man, I think they're in for

Start time: 6414.24
End time: 6451.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a rude awakening.  Some of them are, but many of them will make it because they're entering a totally different  environment.  I think time is right.  The guy who...  Hold on.  So you have a couple different groups here.  I have people that we're not talking about at all who are never part of mainstream media  or anything.  The YouTube kids.  I have a friend who just started a talent agency focused on that whole category of people  because they've got millions and millions of followers.  They're kind of invisible to the mainstream discussion.  Making good money.  People like Jenna Marbles are making great money.  A lot of them, even without the money, they're making connections.  They're making deep emotional informational connections with an entire audience.

Start time: 6452.48
End time: 6468.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do want to very much agree with both you and with JCD on this regard.  The fact that somebody is talented and has a certain market value does not mean that  when they leave an entity, they're able to get what they're worth somewhere else.  So in that regard, you're 100% right.

You have some who will create new types of networks where they'll pile a bunch of interestingly  talented personalities, but it won't be CNN.  It will be some new thing.  And some of that's probably already happening.  You have brands like AOL and Yahoo are trying to grab some of these people.  I'm doing a show with AOL right now about crowdfunding.

End time: 6614.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, but we actually we did we did an event last week.  So this I mean that crowdfunding is part of it, though.  So I think you have people who are directly monetizing.  They're going straight to their community.  They're merchandising.  They're lining with brands.  Some of them.  So Roman Mars is a guy named Roman Mars who does a great podcast.

Start time: 6614.64
End time: 6620.70

End time: 6645.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And they're.  That's what's interesting.  I have never heard of Roman Mars.  And yet.  So what it is, is a lot of people like these YouTube kids who have these bubbles of community  and fame.  A lot of people never heard of Twitter either, by the way.  And they have these bubbles of community fame and they don't.  It's so different from the way it used to be where you were nationally famous or you  or nothing.

Start time: 6646.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah.  And you were independent on mega hits.  Right.  Or or something very local.  I mean, you obviously had like local journalists, local celebrities, local artists.  You weren't going to make a lot of money doing that.  Yeah.  Yeah.  So there's a new possibility of building that.  And so what Roman and 99% Invisible, for those who don't know them, they do a podcast about  design and architecture.  Oh, I love that subject.  This campaign was about going weekly.  So a year ago, they raised one hundred fifty K. He was able to hire a producer, raise production  values, spend more money on quality.  Now they're going weekly, hiring another reporter.  So they're employing people and their community showing up to back it.  So they're doing well.  They're doing really, really well.  But crowdfunding as a way for these quote unquote personal brands.  Also a term I don't really like.

Start time: 6691.88
End time: 6716.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This bothers a lot of people, though.  Maybe people are getting used to it now.  But we used to talk about this all the time.  And people say, but there's so much content and I can't find it.  And how do you get discovered?  Because people are still in this other mindset where it's the mega hit mindset.  Are people kind of used to this now?  And it's OK.  And, you know, am I happy to be a YouTube star?  Or does everybody want to make a mega hit at the next step?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But if you get Crypto Locker, it will encrypt everything you can see.  All the letter drives, right?  So if you have a backup drive just sitting out there, no.  If a network attached to it, no.  If it can see it as a drive, it's going to get it.  What you need, and so that's why hot backup is not enough.  You need a backup that preserves versions, that is off-site.  You need carbonite.  And one of the best things about carbonite, it's flat rate.  Less than five bucks a month for everything on a single computer.  They do have small business plans, network attached storage, external drives.  They have versioning.  I think versioning is only on the Windows version.  But if you're on Windows, that's the one.  Nobody on the Mac has to worry about Crypto Locker.  This is also a great solution.  Because even if somehow carbonite backs up the encrypted file,  you still got a previous version always available to you.  It's smart.  I think this is a good solution for you.  And now's the time.  You can try it free for two weeks.  You do not need a credit card.  Just need our offer code, TWIT.  If you decide to buy after two weeks, you'll get two free bonus months.

Start time: 7185.72
End time: 7205.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's the one key thing of this.  There's a number of things in this bill,  but the one that will really make the difference  and is probably the most controversial,  you can recover court costs if you win against a patent troll.  So one of the reasons patent trolls work,  it costs them nothing.  It's cheap to sue somebody, and generally, the patent  troll is the lawyer who's prosecuting.

Start time: 7205.78
End time: 7206.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, he's doing it on spec.

Start time: 7206.86
End time: 7249.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  He's doing it on spec.  So it really is very cheap for them to sue.  However, if this passes, and I'm hopeful it will.  It was introduced by Bob Goodlatte, nicely named  Republican of Virginia.  Sounds delicious.  You will be able to recover legal fees.  Now, the way patent trolls work is they come to you  with a license fee that's somewhat less than your total  legal fees would be.  Yeah, it's the game.  Yeah, and then so you're going to do the equation and say,  well, I could sue them and lose and owe them twice that,  or I could just pay them.  Even if I win, I still have to pay more in legal fees.  So I'm going to just give them the fee.  This way, and this isn't in Canada, they do this now,  and it's very effective in preventing  and controlling and a lot of random litigation.
