Transcript:  Oh, good.  Even better.  I wanted to actually start because Briana was a game developer,  is an expert on game development, because a couple of things  happened this week that I thought were fascinating.  Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, AOC, member of Congress from New York,  played a game on Twitch called Among Us.  It's apparently very popular with the kids.  Got 444,000 streamers watching her play that game.  Is that awesome or what?

Start time: 298.72
End time: 350.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's beyond awesome.  You know, I feel very strongly you've got to meet people where they are.  And you know, this younger generation, they  spend less time watching cable news and more times watching people  play games on Twitch.  So fun fact, I was actually the first congressional candidate  to ever stream on Twitch to fundraise.  And I just think it's absolutely amazing that she's  out there talking to people.  We have to talk at the game itself.  Among Us is so good, Leo.  You would destroy it, this game.  So you get eight people together.  It's werewolf, basically, right?  It is.  Yeah.  It's voice chatty.  So you get a group of eight people there.  And if you're the imposter, you have to like trick them  into making you think you're not the imposter while you sneak up on them  and kill them.  So that's my game.  It's great.  It's great.  I love it.

Transcript:  Well, I discovered this week.  So when the Nintendo Switch came out, I bought it immediately  and played Final Fantasy for a little while.  Was it Break the Wind or something?  And I played it for a little while.  And then my son, my stepson, who was 17, he's going to be 18 in about a minute.  Took it from me.  And I've never seen it again.  And then once in a while I say, Michael, how's that switch doing?  He said, that's great.  I said, have you ever played Animal Crossing?  He said, yes, you wouldn't like it.  So finally, you could get them again.  About last week, I looked on Amazon.  Oh, my God, I can get a switch again, because for a while you couldn't buy one.  They were out of stock.  So I bought one and I immediately put Animal Crossing on it.  And then and I've got it right here.  I went to the Biden campaign headquarters  and this is in this is an island.  The Biden HQ is an island.  It's actually quite a beautiful island.  I'm a little bit I'm a little bit jealous.  And and you can wander around.  You can buy Biden.  I see I'm wearing a Biden Harris beanie.  You can't really tell, but I'm also wearing a Kamala tank top.  And but the main thing you can do and if I could find him,  I don't understand quite how this works.  These are canned, I guess.  They're not live.  There's nobody I don't think in them live.  Oh, isn't that a cool garden, a red, white and blue mum's garden?  But somewhere the Canada is wandering around in here.  And you can get in the I'm going to go over in the rope line.  Maybe he's maybe he's in the rope line and you can pose  for selfies with Joe.  He's got his aviator glasses.  I also bought a hat that said no malarkey.  Yeah, he's he's he's I guess he's taken the day.  Oh, who's that? No, that's just a blue moose.  That's not.  So I I thought this was also interesting.  I don't know. I don't know if there is.  Hey, Joe, let me let me get my smartphone out so I could quickly.  Oh, he always walks away while you're ready to.  Let's take a picture. Zoom in.  Come on. Come on. Oh, man.  I'm not really. He's leaving. He's going to the beach.  OK, there's a shot. Me and Joe at the beach.  I get the camera back. Oh, he's leaving.  Come back, Joe. Come back.  Do you think this also what does this do for a candidate?  Does this also bring he's leaving?  He's walking right out of the frame.  I guess I'll get a selfie with the with the purple mule.  There's my selfie. That's pathetic.  Is this the same thing?  Is this like Alexandria or I have some pictures I took earlier?  I have to go to my.

Transcript:  So I you know, I'm on one hand, I'm kind of unconvinced  that anyone is going to make up their mind about voting.  There's no issues here at all.  At all. It's right.  But I also remember like a traditional question  we've asked politicians for a long time.  It's like, who's the person you want to have a beer with more?  And that was famously.  People want to have a beer with George Bush more than John Kerry.  So I think as far as I think making the Democratic Party seem  more relatable to people, I think this is generally a smart move.  And I want to see more of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  In 2016, the Trump campaign was lauded  because they seem to be the only campaign to figure out how to use Facebook  effectively, and I think a lot of people give credit to  to that for his election.  Facebook doesn't seem like Facebook is the battleground anymore  for presidential politics or any politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They made it complicated.

Start time: 639.48
End time: 640.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is it because it's too complicated?

Start time: 641.58
End time: 661.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, because of all like the the horrors of 2016  and all the lawsuits and all the cases, I mean, I think they wanted just to like  stay away. And then there was new laws in terms of or like  they're not letting ads run what like the day of the election or a week before.  So I don't know. It just feels like it got complicated.  It wasn't the same game that they were trying to play in 2016, obviously.

Start time: 662.30
End time: 684.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There have been calls for social media to  shut down for the next week.  Just, you know, stop.  I don't think Jack Dorsey or Mark Zuckerberg is going to stop operations.  But that gives you some idea to how much people  consider social media influential, maybe not in a good way on politics.

Start time: 686.20
End time: 731.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think something that's worth considering is, you know, someone who has a massive  ad budget and we spend quite a bit of it on Facebook ads.  You know, we can't do it on Twitter anymore because Twitter has even IE's.  They've gotten rid of that.  We've looked at doing it on TikTok, but there's not really an ad model  in the same way. It's more content based over there.  So for someone like us that is literally in the business of serving up political ads,  Facebook is the only place it's the only game in town.  So you're basically paying for television, YouTube or Facebook,  meaning Facebook and Instagram.  So I can say it's very profitable for someone like us.  Is it good for democracy?  I think that's a different question.

Start time: 731.46
End time: 732.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's a very efficient.

Start time: 733.08
End time: 740.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it? I just had a question.  Is it harder right now with targeting and with conversions?  Are they making it harder on the political front?

Start time: 741.78
End time: 765.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Getting registered to run ads has continually gotten harder  because I ran for Congress first in 2016.  It was a bar there.  It just keeps getting higher and more difficult to jump through all of Facebook's hoops,  which is frustrating when you're someone that follows the rules.  So we definitely see them cracking down.  Is it having an effect?  I can't really say.

Start time: 765.88
End time: 811.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Let me ask Heather this because we've talked a lot about the notion  that maybe Facebook should do what Twitter did, which was reject all political ads.  But whenever I mentioned that, people say, but here's the problem is that if you are  a candidate without a strong national presence,  Facebook is actually a tool that can bring many candidates who would not normally be  viable to the attention of the voting public.  So maybe shutting down political ads is the wrong thing to do.  Furthermore, if you're savvy enough, you can know there's plenty of politics on Twitter.  So there's plenty of ways you can create bot armies and do all sorts of things.  What do you think, Heather, is it is it the right or the wrong thing to do to shut down  political advertising?

Start time: 812.84
End time: 846.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think anybody's ever asked for a full shutdown.  People would like maybe Facebook to be a little better, harder to spread, I guess,  like some of the things that Twitter has done to make things a little more friction.  Like it's harder to retweet all of a sudden.  They want you to say something with your retweet, which is way too much pressure.  But so Facebook, they're not taking any new political ads for the week up to the  election. And then they're stopping political ads after polls close.  That actually seems like a good idea.  A little earlier. I don't know if when the polls close, I mean, it's a very horse out  of the barn kind of thing.

Start time: 847.34
End time: 879.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, maybe not, because there's some concern that if early on in the early voting, one  candidate or another takes a lead, but the full count hasn't come in because there's so  many absentee and mail in ballots that this might be a chance for I think people are  worried mostly about the Trump campaign declaring victory inappropriately and buying up  ads on Facebook to do that.  Is that I think that's what they're probably trying to prevent.  Right. What do you need ads for?  After the election? That's the only thing I could think of.

Start time: 879.76
End time: 907.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you just want to sow confusion.  If you're going to have lawsuits, you kind of want to win over public opinion.  Right. And the reason that worry is some early kind of research shows that more Democrats  are doing mail in ballots and Republicans and then the mail in ballots get counted after  the day of ballots. So on the day of we could see a red map and then the day after it could  turn blue or a week after because these things they're going to take forever.  And so it's that little in-between time when they might be counting on some confusion if  it's not as clear cut.

Start time: 907.98
End time: 933.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What is your take? I've talked to both these people, but I'm curious what your take is,  Heather, on how do you put this?  Facebook's motivation is is I mean, I don't think Mark Zuckerberg is particularly political,  although you had an article or there was an article in The Wall Street Journal how Mark  Zuckerberg learned politics.  And there's a picture of a giant zuck walking down the front of the photo.

Start time: 936.65

Start time: 941.06
End time: 970.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Talk about fake news.  But there is some concern that if Facebook if Facebook decided that they liked one candidate  better than the other or there was an issue that they cared a lot about, that they could  be very manipulative.  And we've seen it happen in other countries, Myanmar and in the Philippines, where Facebook  has been misused by political figures to spread misinformation.  And they haven't done they didn't at the time do a lot to stop it.

Start time: 972.86
End time: 1007.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if you can really ascribe a political leaning to Facebook so much as Facebook  trying to figure out the best way to have influence and money and then overseas.  A lot of times that's incompetence or dropping the ball, not having people on the ground  to speak the language or spotting what's happening soon enough.  And I like with the issues of conservative bias, which is going to be fun this week.  I mean, Facebook realized that it didn't want to alienate conservative users and that it  was more beneficial to it financially, perhaps to make sure those voices were more heard.  And then maybe things like Mother Jones were not as heard.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's kind of what I've always thought is that it's not their immoral.  They're amoral.  It's most corporations have no moral imperative.  Their job is to return money for the stakeholders.

Transcript:  Also, having the Republicans have been easier on Facebook on like antitrust issues and  everything in competition.  So he's actually leaning towards getting comfy with Trump versus perhaps the Democrats who  have questioned him more like that very viral video of AOC questioning him.  Right.

Start time: 1062.70
End time: 1100.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's been a lot of conspiracy theories, and I hate to give any conspiracy theory, any  juice, but that Mark is smart enough to know where his bread is buttered and he's going  to kiss up to whoever he needs to to make sure they're regulated the least.  And I think a lot of people think there was a deal with the devil.  There's Zuckerberg had dinner with Trump a week before this happened or that happened.  I don't know how much of that is true, but I guess any competent CEO is going to be aware  of the wins, the political wins and attempt to navigate them.  Right, Brianna?

Start time: 1101.60
End time: 1126.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  I keep thinking about the Upton Sinclair quote.  You know, it's hard to get a man to understand something when his living depends on not  understanding it.  With with Zuckerberg, I think this is a wider phenomenon in tech.  I think there's a base set of assumptions that they hold.  One of them is like the solution to bad speech is more speech or connect.  By the way, on the surface, I love that.

Start time: 1126.92
End time: 1128.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's right. It's a great model.

Start time: 1129.30
End time: 1166.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, we all thought that.  But I think if you start digging down into these beliefs, you're like, OK, is inherently  connecting people and letting them broadcast say QAnon stuff.  We have some objective data today.  Like, is this making our democracy healthier or sicker?  It's really hard for me to think of an example of where that's making it healthier.  So I think the bias of someone like Zuckerberg is having a certain set of very popular  beliefs in the tech industry and really leaving those unexamined.  I think that's the real bias more than right or left.

Transcript:  It was I forget the exact timing, but Facebook was in the headlines for literally  breaking some things, democracy, something.

What I see it doing to my country right now, it's really hard to argue that the  discourse in the United States in the last, especially four years, has gotten  really terrifyingly toxic.  And I'm sure there are other reasons for it.

I think we need to look at universal health care, but there is a wide range of  I think we need to look at universal health care, but there is a weaponization of a  certain portion of the electorate where it's a grievance engine.  Right.  And it tells you that if you don't get this one policy, then the solution is to set  it out and wait for maximalist policies.  We're seeing that more and more with the, with the, the left in a way I've never  seen in my whole lifetime.  I am really worried about that conversation.

The Overton window is the, is the kind of the, the, the, the range of policies that  are kind of within the natural discourse.  Like that's not too far out of, out of range.  It's in the window, the Overton window.  I feel like the Overton window has been moved and broadened by the discourse that's  happening on social media.  Yes.

Transcript:  Oh, well, the social dilemma on, on that's okay.  Let's talk about that.  Definitely touches on that.  And the fact is they want to keep you on the platform.  So they're going to feed you what they think you want to hear more of or know more about.  And so you get into this deep rabbit hole around things that might not be right.  And even if it's misinformation, it's still something that will keep you on the platform.  And that's where the ethical nature of it and moral nature of what they're  allowing to be on these platforms comes in.

Start time: 1490.74
End time: 1510.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  which was blocked on all social media, even Fox, by the way, apparently,  was offered the story and they said, that smells a little bit.  We're not going to do that.  But the post went ahead with it.  Rupert Murdoch, being what he is, went ahead with it.  And then Twitter blocked it.  You couldn't retweet it.  But you're saying that had the negative impact on how this spread.

Start time: 1510.72
End time: 1523.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel the fire that all these platforms are starting to censor  Black Mirror style.  And I think there's a way to be responsible and accountable and not feeding into that.  Like, I do think they could have said this hasn't been verified or this.

Start time: 1524.88
End time: 1526.46

Start time: 1526.68
End time: 1552.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, that's like because they wanted to use this as an example.  This became that.  And I just I don't think it was the right timing for that example,  because it just became a story that the left and the media are continuing  to censor this side. If this happened to Biden are like they would have.  Or if it was the other way around, then they wouldn't have censored it.  And so, I don't know.  I feel like there's some issues there.  But Heather, I'd be interested to hear what.

Start time: 1552.62
End time: 1570.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the Washington Post has done such a good job, I think, of walking the  the line of covering this stuff.  It's very difficult. And, you know,  to not look partisan, but at the same time, to also not do the two sides reporting.  It's difficult to do.

Start time: 1571.26
End time: 1593.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's easier because I mean, I came from like CNN where there's a much faster  pace and Washington Post, there's, you know, more incentive to go slow and get it right.  But what I thought was interesting with this particular story is it ended up being  a platform story more than it was about Biden, which was not the intention at all.  And so we're all writing like two thousand word think pieces about Twitter's policy  and Rudy Giuliani is like, no, that's not the plan.

Transcript:  It was interesting in the debate on Thursday to watch the president bring it up  as if everybody had knew the story, you know, in almost a shorthand way.  And all the commentators and all the network said,  yeah, nobody knew what he was talking about  because it had been somewhat suppressed.  So maybe it yeah, maybe it did have a salutary self salutatory effect.  I don't know. Salutory.

Start time: 1628.22
End time: 1641.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I read some other commentary that was along the lines of  people aren't supposed to know the details of the story exactly.  They're just sort of supposed to give this general impression that wrongdoing happened.  And so they that's all it is.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I'm going to take a different opinion here because I'm on the show with three  journalists. I'm not a journalist.  I and I have a different opinion.  I used to believe this five, ten years ago.  I would 100 percent be there with you.  I have come to the conclusion that we can't be information idealists.  And I think we need to be information realists about the way misinformation  spreads, because we can really see this as pushing our democracy to the brink.  And I think the republic is going to be just fine  if social media companies like Twitter take a harder line on flat out  disinformation. I think it's going to be just fine.  We knew this was going to happen.  And also the fact that, you know, Russian disinformation  certainly seems to be indicated in this.  I also think there's a national security argument for this.  So I I have grown increasingly comfortable with this.  What I think we should do is I think the answer is to  I think Facebook is so large that if you don't like their policies,  it's very hard to go somewhere else.  So I think that I think that breaking up the Facebook monopoly.  And then if you like Twitter's policies or you like Facebook's policies,  you can go there. You can enjoy that.  Or you can go to something like Gab, which maybe the policies are  better fit for you.  But I think ultimately, I think that choice is going to be fine. Yeah.

There's been an assault on Section 230, which protects Twitter,  Facebook and social media websites so that they can do that.  I think we have. Yeah. Yeah. It's stopped.

He's something I tend to talk about and everything where you have dinner  and you talk about death life and how you would want it, you know,  being remembered and what you want on your tombstone.

Now there's a lot, and I'm sure you guys will have a lot to say  so I'm gonna give you a chance.  There's a lot of conversation over the Justice Department.  They finally filed there, as the Wall Street Journal says,  long awaited antitrust lawsuit against Google.  Quite a bit of conversation about how it's malformed,  it's politically intended.  It's, you know, maybe there's some merit in it,  but it's not the right lawsuit.  But I am gonna submit, it does, I think,  it has a bracing impact on the minds of corporations  all across this great land of ours,  because it forces you to say,  hmm, maybe we should think twice about that acquisition  or that move.  I think you might argue that Apple is holding back  on its location tracking Apple tags,  because there's been some talk that maybe  they're, you know, disadvantaging Tile, the competition,  because even the CEO of Tile has said this  in front of Congress, Apple isn't giving them access,  then Apple will have this built-in advantage.  And I think Apple hasn't released their tags,  because I think they're going,  we don't wanna get in trouble right now.  If nothing else, I'll go to our government expert.  If nothing else, doesn't a lawsuit like this  make people at least slow down and think  about what they're doing, that it could be risky?

Start time: 2224.50
End time: 2278.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I absolutely think so.  I think it's a good thing.  I think, you know, as The Verge  and many other legal experts have noted,  this is not the strongest case.  And I think the fact that it really seems  to have been brought forward for political motives  really undermines the public confidence in it.  But yeah, does the Justice Department  generally enforcing antitrust law,  does that have a positive effect for consumers?  I think unquestionably.  And I just wanna see them pursue smarter cases.  I really think you cannot overstate  just how much the stench of partisanship  when it gets into cases like this.  It just, it undermines the rule of law,  it undermines public confidence.  It's just, it's so terrible.  And I think that's gonna be one of the darkest legacies  of the Barr Justice Department.

Start time: 2278.70
End time: 2345.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You then agree with Karl Bodie writing in TechDirk,  Bill Barr's Google antitrust inquiry is a weaponized farce.  Yeah.  That's pretty strong.  Heather, do you agree?  I mean, I think if you read the indictment,  a lot of it's stupid.  A lot of it's like, you know,  I think Neelay Patel had a great tweet.  He said, Google harshly stopping carrier bloatware  should be illegal is again,  not the best argument for the Department of Justice.  Section 143 of the indictment,  Google was concerned that a major US carrier  would ask manufacturers to install a search widget  powered by the carrier's in-house search engine.  They, Google told this, I'm gonna guess it's Verizon,  but it's gonna told this company,  these customization requests will not go far.  If you want Google on your phone,  you better not put your own search widget on there.  That's a lousy antitrust argument.  But is there some merit in this, Heather?

Start time: 2347.18
End time: 2367.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The whole case kind of reminds me of the impeachment,  you know, where they had to pick one topic.  They're like, we're gonna pick one thing.  There's a lot of impeachable offenses, hypothetically.  What if we just pick one narrow, easy win?  And this feels like to me that the Justice Department  was on a time crunch because they wanted it  before the election and they wanted to pick  whatever part of the case they had,  the most ready to go, the tightest.

Start time: 2368.08
End time: 2378.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's evidence of that because the staff attorneys  in the DOJ in fact, apparently said,  it's too soon, we're not ready.  And it went ahead, Barr's department went ahead.

Start time: 2379.20
End time: 2401.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it seems very, very specific and narrow.  Hey, maybe it's some 3D chess here,  maybe it's some negotiating, like an opening gambit.  We'll see if Google will settle this,  if we can get them to settle things,  if they're smaller and piece by piece  instead of a giant antitrust lawsuit.  I don't know, it's all contributing  to like the lawyer industrial complex.  These people are gonna be busy with this for years.

Start time: 2402.78
End time: 2432.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but so I'm curious, Heather,  whether you think that, and it was probably  before your time, but I remember in 1998  when the DOJ went against Microsoft  and that thing did take almost 10 years to resolve.  But I think there's no question,  Microsoft actually came out of it stronger  because they were chastened and they stopped their,  you know, engulf and devour business practices  and they actually became a better company for it.  And I think the world was a better place.  In hindsight, that was successful.

Start time: 2434.22
End time: 2447.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I was alive then,  was not paying that question.  Barely.  I'm sure, I mean, that may be true.  I still think maybe Microsoft wished  that wasn't a thing it had to go through.  Oh, oh, oh, definitely.

Start time: 2448.04
End time: 2482.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not saying that.  In fact, somebody quoted Bill Gates.  You know, they said, you'd sit down in the boardroom  and somebody would say, well, you know, we should do this.  And Bill said, I'm not ever sitting in that chair again.  We are not doing that.  I think that that, you know,  it did have a beneficial effect on Microsoft in hindsight.  So these things I think  are not necessarily bad things to do.  But I think, sure, it's also hard to imagine.  How do you, what do you do to spank Google?  Do you break them up?

Start time: 2484.02
End time: 2486.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I feel like Facebook  needs more of a spanking.

Start time: 2486.56

Start time: 2491.30
End time: 2513.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I mean, yeah, this feels like it's a distraction  from the major issues that we're dealing with,  which is like, we don't have a pandemic relief bill.  You know, obviously-  Well, that's a good point.  Yeah, like the Supreme Court nominee.  And then they're like, well, we throw this in  to like continue to show how, you know,  these platforms are evil.  Like, it's like, I feel like it's just a whole-

Start time: 2514.16
End time: 2517.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You kind of want to shake some people.  Yeah, it's just like they want to distract us

Start time: 2517.48
End time: 2535.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  from other things which make other things feel evil  when the administration is somewhat evil.  Right, right.  But I mean, I think that there's something to be said.  I mean, I think the one thing that I saw in this  was that they were paying a platform  like over $100 million for exclusivity.  And like, in essence, that cuts out anyone else  from that competition. More than that,

Start time: 2535.88
End time: 2542.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  they pay Apple between eight and $12 billion a year  to be the default search engine on the iPhone.

Start time: 2542.78
End time: 2567.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, so how is anyone else gonna grow, you could say.  But then it's like, there are companies  that get discovered and like users end up making  that company a popular platform.  And so if maybe a company like Apple is smart enough,  they'll say, well, we want to be with the cool kids now,  but probably not if they're getting paid a shit ton of money.  Right.  So yeah, I mean, that's an issue.  That's definitely possibly an issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't get them, but I did learn about one this week,  and I apologize to this company if it's Neva or Neera.  But it was mentioned without naming it in the complaint  because they do like an ad-based search product.  Oh, that'd be-  Sorry, a subscription-based search product.  So you don't have to have any ads,  which obviously is problematic because if you can't afford  to buy your way out of ads, well, that sucks.  But so yeah, it's an ex-Googler, I believe,  and so there are other companies coming up  and there's always DuckDuckGo and Bing,  and I think I've literally named all of them.  Have you heard about Brave?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  part of this complaint against Google is Chrome,  is their browser.  Yeah.  Oddly, Brave and Microsoft's Edge are both based  on the open source Chromium engine  that Google uses for Chrome.  I don't know.  One of the things that DOJ implied is maybe they could get  Google to divest Chrome.  Maybe that is a good idea.

Start time: 2646.08
End time: 2654.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they can get Chrome to stop slowing down my computer.  That would be a great idea.  A big good start.  If DOJ could do that,  that's a winning election issue, I think.  Yeah.

Transcript:  You know, the last time I was on,  you were actually going through the Microsoft antitrust case  from the 90s.  Right.  You were looking at what's actually in there.  It's all utterly reasonable stuff, like before acquisitions.  In the consent decree, yeah.  Right, absolutely.  So, I personally would be happy  with something more in that vein.  I feel like we're so used to these mega-mergers.  I feel like we all have a collective,  we're shocked into thinking we don't have any power.  And I don't know.  I think there's a reason Facebook and Google  have put so much effort into their public-facing messaging  on this because they realize this is a big threat  to their essentially duopoly, right?  So, we have power.  And I just think it's worth remembering that.

Start time: 2709.92
End time: 2815.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's also worth remembering that the Department of Justice  has not exactly been aggressively pursuing  antitrust policy.  Avery Gardner tweeted this,  "'As you gear up for the antitrust complaint,  recall DOJ's own statistics show it didn't bring a single,  not one single case for abuse of monopoly power.  Since 2010, there's only been one in 2011."  And that was, I'm trying to remember what that was.  Was that the AT&T Time Warner?  And that was more politically motivated.  There hasn't been a lot of antitrust enforcement.  And by the way, this predates Trump.  This goes back to George W. Bush and Barack Obama.  I mean, the DOJ has been pretty lenient.  They've allowed T-Mobile and Sprint to merge.  They've allowed Comcast to gobble up NBC  and Universal Pictures.  I mean, it's been anything goes for a decade.  Mm-hmm.  According to Tech Dirt, the one example  usually trotted out to claim otherwise AT&T's lawsuit  to stop the AT&T Time Warner merger.  And that really ended up being,  and you might remember this, Heather,  because this was to piss off CNN for Trump  and helping Rupert Murdoch than any serious concern  about media consolidation.  Murdoch wanted the deal blocked.  Politics is inevitably gonna get any of this stuff,  I would imagine.  Yeah, yeah.  You can't say, oh, this should be divorced from politics.

That's, it's a, I can tell you,  I was very motivated by that idea.  And I think that if you can come to the conclusion  that, oh, all these systems are against me,  it allows you to kind of not think anything  those systems are telling you are true  with coronavirus or other subjects.

They would actually get fish scales  and sacrifice 50,000 fish to paint your car.  That's how they did that?  Absolutely, before they figured out  how to do it with aluminum.  So then that was the era that bright colors  were associated with wealth.  Then it switched.  Then in the 90s, it switched back again,  really bright colors.  And now we're back to the top selling colors  are white, silver, and black.  And the bright colors are associated with cheap.  And I just, I wanted to go back to the other.  Like give me vibrance.

So we make our own power.  Good for you.  Yeah, I love it.  Wow, that's great.  We've got two of those Tesla batteries.  Cause where we are, PG&E, our electric company,  turns off the power just randomly  because the power causes fires  and fires cause death, destruction and mayhem.  And so I, you know, that we've already,  we've been told that the power, right, John,  the power might go off again.  This week, not here.  It's going out already.  The reason, this is so annoying.  The reason is our electric company,  when given millions of dollars by the state  to fix the power lines, get them out of the trees,  cut back the brush and all of that stuff,  instead gave the executives bonuses.  And now they're afraid on windy days or dry days  or warm days, guess what?  We're in California.  On windy days, dry days or hot days,  they turn off the power  because they're afraid it'll spark a wildfire.  So, which is just nuts.  Heather, you're in San Francisco.

It should always be because your old phone  is no longer functional in some way  that you can't pay to fix.  It's silly to be like,  oh, I just want this one new feature.  I got a new phone last year.  It should be like a laptop.  You get a new laptop and your old one's too slow.  That's sad.

I'm that person that gets my money back from AppleCare  every single time I buy it.  If it really is four times stronger,  that is a very compelling feature to me.  I was disheartened in our friend Joanna Stern's review  that Apple wouldn't let her actually drop test it,  so she's in the middle of the stadium catching throws.  They wouldn't let her do it,  so she's just throwing the phone around in the studio.

We're arguing with each other.  We don't need to be,  we want to have our voice in that conversation.  We want to work it with the system.  So issues like LGBT rights  or women's reproductive healthcare, things like that.  We want to stand there and push the conversation  and direction we agree with within the system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You rebels, you.  Arshad, they brought to you by LastPass.  You see, here we are in the LastPass studios.  We are fans of LastPass.  I've been using LastPass as my password manager for,  it's as long as they've been around,  more than a decade, I think 12 years.  Steve Gibson, I can't believe it's 10 years ago,  we had our security guy, Steve Gibson of Security Now,  go under the covers with LastPass.  He got Joe Segrist, its founder, to show him all the code.  He said, this is amazing.  This is exactly what you want.  He's been using it now for a decade.  70,000 businesses use LastPass, 25 million users.  It is the award-winning number one password manager.  Okay, maybe you can give COVID a little credit  for the number of businesses using LastPass  because when you start sending employees home,  they are no longer in the protected environs of your office.  They are at home with the passwords,  the keys to the kingdom, to your bank account, your website,  your customer records, everything.  Identity and access management is teetering,  so you've got to make sure you've got something  to protect your assets, and that's what LastPass is.  It's been a saving grace to our company.  We use LastPass to enable our team to set up, utilize,  and this is important, share strong passwords  for their accounts and programs.  If they're at home, you don't want them texting  each other passwords or emailing them in clear text.  You can use LastPass, it'll send them securely.  This is an important step towards improving data security,  but here's the thing about LastPass.  They do something kind of magical.  Usually there's a trade-off between convenience and security.  You can have one or the other.  LastPass somehow makes it even easier to work from home,  makes it even more convenient for employees  in a lot of different ways.  Of course, the LastPass Vault auto-fills wherever you are,  works on Mac, Windows, Linux, with every browser known  to man on your iPhone and your Android phone,  and that auto-fill means they don't have  to type passwords anymore.  LastPass generates long, strong passwords.  You don't have to remember them anymore.  It is awesome, and one of the things you always get  with LastPass is oversight of shadow IT,  enforceable policies, so your IT department likes LastPass too  because they know exactly who's using what, when, and where.  They make sure that every single person using  your precious assets is authorized to do so.  That's what LastPass does.  They support not only two-factor face  or recognition or fingerprint ID,  they also support multi-factor,  additional contextual factors that help make sure  the right person's using the right resource,  things like geo-location and IP address.  LastPass uses a zero-security knowledge model.  A zero-knowledge security model.  That's what all the big companies do.  It's kind of the state-of-the-art in security  where you assume there is no secure perimeter.  Anybody using any resource has to authenticate.  That's what LastPass does.  That's because security is their top priority.  AES-256-bit encryption,  PBK-DF2 to make it hard to brute force,  salted hashes, SHA-256, all the buzzwords,  all of the security things you know.  That's what they do.  Data is encrypted and decrypted only at device level.  Your master password is never transmitted,  not to LastPass, not to anywhere.  The data in your vault is completely secure.  That's why I use LastPass, not just for passwords,  but passports, drivers, licenses, everything.  LastPass has won eight awards so far this year alone.  PC magazines, editors, Choice,  the Fortress Cybersecurity Award, Business Insiders,  Best Overall Password Manager, and many more.  I can go on and on.  But look, you don't have to take their word for it  or my word.  LastPass speaks for itself.  This is the time.  There is LastPass for every possible scenario.  Go to lastpass.com slash twit.  It's the first thing I put on any new device.  It's the last thing I ever take off.  Lastpass.com slash twit,  because stronger security cannot wait.  Thank you, LastPass, for your support.  Ease the burden for yourself and your remote workforce  with the cybersecurity protection you need.  Lastpass.com slash twit.  We had a very good week this week on twit,  and I'm hoping that our crack team of editors and producers  put together a little mini movie for your enjoyment.  Watch.

And there's so much pressure to be in like  physical Zoom calls with people that I can,  I can see some of this technology being like put on makeup  or brush your hair or something like that  because there's so much more work for women  to look professional than there are men.

You know, you see this all the time on Instagram  and influencers, I'm glad to have a phrase for it,  social peacocking.

I bet it wasn't easy to make this into what it is.  And I'm just perplexed by the number of people  that are gleeful that this failed.  I have the same reaction.  Simone is a friend of mine.  She was a producer for Quibi.  Oh really?  Simone is a lovely person.  Simone's the best human being I know.  And I mean, some of the shows there,  I'm not gonna say it was for me,  but that Golden Arm show, that was legit awesome.  That was the happiest moment of this last year.

My favorite is Titus Burgess,  who is one of my favorite actors  from the unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.  It's a show called Dish Mantled.  It was pre-COVID in conception, I think,  because the idea is that they'd have a chef  make an amazing meal, then they'd mush it all together  and put it in cannons and shoot it at two chefs  in a special room.  They would get splattered with this meal.  They would then have to taste it, figure out what it was,  and make it, and the chef who came the closest  to making the original meal got $5,000.

Transcript:  Quibi's other feature was that you could turn the phone  sideways and not only would the picture readjust  as every phone does, you'd get a different angle  on the scene, that the scenes were shot  in both aspect ratios, portrait and landscape,  in some cases, apparently not every show.  And so it would do something interesting.  And then they got sued by a company,  said, you know, we invented that.  That was your, so that was another thing.  But here's the thing, you were very kind.  You said, you know, I've created this vast media empire  over the last 15 years.  What I didn't have something that Quibi had,  $1.75 billion in venture capital.  And that's what killed them, right Heather?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, that's why, and I don't have an opinion  about Quibi one way or the other,  having literally never watched anything,  but the video of somebody's phone  showing the Golden Arm show.  That tells us something right there.  And I think that's like 99% of people  who know about Quibi.  I think some of the glee was just, not even glee,  but like they, you guys talk about like making a business  and you said how many years it was.  Like it takes work and scraping by.  And they had such a ridiculous amount of money  and made so many missteps and just seemed  to not even know, some of the executives  not even know their market that well  or who they were appealing to  or how to make things shareable and viral.  And it's just like a head smacking moment,  more than glee that people are losing their jobs,  just astounded that they didn't try harder  or do a little different something, I don't know.  It was a typical Hollywood move.

Start time: 5327.40
End time: 5397.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, I mean, I think it's like when you have two,  as you said, two older white individuals  that are like, we're gonna do this new thing  and put over a billion dollars into it.  They're boasting about it.  They're also shooting down every successful platform  who has figured it out, who has spent many years doing it.  It's kind of like it's a recipe for disaster.  And then also they're just giving money.  There was also a feeling, I think,  from a lot of creatives that they were just giving money  to the people that already had money.  Whereas I think that there's two Hollywood execs  that are starting something new  and they're definitely looking at more diversity  in terms of putting the spotlight  in a more up and coming creators and writers  while having definitely the star power.  But it just felt like they were giving every celebrity  and their mom money for a show  and they were spending so much money.  I knew a lot of people that had shows there  and it's just, everyone knew they were just throwing out money.  People are not excited, unfortunately,  in this era of kind of like,  I think that people have a chip on their shoulder  in Hollywood a bit to see something fall, right?

Start time: 5398.50
End time: 5413.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My first reaction, I actually said this a couple of times,  was it's just the Hollywood model  does not work on the internet.  The internet model is more like TikTok and YouTube.  You make a platform that anybody can create content on.  You make it easy for them to do so  and then you use an algorithm to surface the best content.

Start time: 5414.12
End time: 5440.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They were telling people what they wanted  versus like, create the solution.  And then that was like, I think that assumption  made people not like, want to see them fail.  Unfortunately, that said, I also know a lot of people  who have shows who are deserving and a lot of people,  yeah, they were employing a lot of people.  So I even said after they launched  while everyone was making fun of them,  like, I feel like I want them to succeed  because it means more people get more jobs, right?  Well, that's how I've modified my thinking

Start time: 5440.68
End time: 5528.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  because over the last few nights,  because I do feel bad.  There's a story of a Quibi film crew  that was out making a movie  and they were told that Quibi had folded  and they're desperately trying to continue  so they can at least finish what they were making  and maybe find another market for it.  There are a lot of people be left out in the cold.  So my initial take was, oh, this is Hollywood  versus Silicon Valley and they just don't get it.  But then I thought a little bit about it.  What it really is, Quibi's doing,  art, stuff that's thoughtfully created  or we're trying to anyway.  I mean, that's what a movie is and a TV show,  stuff that somebody writes a script  and they bring in a lot of talent and they produce it  and they have a huge number of film crews  and people doing this.  And that was a different kind of creation.  And I don't wanna see that kind of creation fail.  We need that.  I think it's important.  I think that's, you know,  when you think that they put $1.75 billion into this  and frankly, no show on Quibi got more views  than Nathan Apodaca, this guy on his longboard  drinking his crann apple juice  and making a 43 year old song by Fleetwood Mac  again on the top 10.  I mean, this is the opposite of Quibi, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're an active participant in it  and I think that with Quibi, people are like,  it's a lean back, but it's also for the next generation.  So it was confusing and they went too high.  Like starting at 1 billion, you can't keep that up.  You're never gonna be able to keep that up  or make your money back in time.

I think there's been one good show coming on Apple,  but it's getting better over time.  Like they hung out more than six months  and kept making mediocre TV.  You know why?  To find a good TV.

Start time: 5583.16

End time: 5601.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they're taking their time to figure out  what works versus buying like how many shows.  Yeah, it doesn't work.  But like spending that much money on that many shows,  there's no room for any errors.  You're not leaving yourself a lot of room for mistakes.

Start time: 5601.88
End time: 5611.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they don't have that many shows.  They don't have a catalog.  They don't have what Netflix has  where Netflix can make 10 bad shows  and still there's a catalog so you can watch stuff.

Transcript:  I feel like the really big mistake Quibi made  was market segmentation.  Look at car stuff.  What's like the most successful YouTube channel for cars?  It's Donut Media.  It's dudes sitting around talking about cars,  upgrading their cars, talking about the top 10 best cars.  It's very authentic.  It's hyper segmented to that market.  What was Quibi's car show?  It was Idris Elba driving around doing dumb stunts,  trying to beat a stunt driver.  It was a big spectacle,  but it doesn't appeal to people like me.  Look at Twit and what you do.  You've got an Android show.  You've got a main tech news show.  You're very segmented with your different audiences.  Quibi was trying to dilute that down  and find dumber, broader concepts with celebrities.  I mean, it did.  Look at the shows they're doing.  You know where I learned that lesson?

Start time: 5666.08

Transcript:  Tech TV.  Yeah.  Because it was on cable, right?  This is the network that I kind of made my name on  from 1998 to 2004.  It was on a cable.  It was a cable network.  And my always thought just, you know,  if you were going to do ESPN,  you don't do shows for people who hate football.  You do shows for people who are really, really,  really into football.  And Tech TV, I said, we should go deep.  We should go, we should be, you know,  there's 14 million programmers in the US.  We should be aiming for the most geeky people instead.  And this happens, this is not unusual.  Everybody wants to get the big broad audience.  Maybe that's because advertising, I don't know.  But so they put on Thunderbirds and what was that cop show  they put on, you know, bad cop, bad.  Because they wanted to get a bigger audience.  Well, no geek's going to watch that  and no general audience is going to watch the geek.  So you just killed yourself.  And in fact, they did.  Yeah.

We will have more in just a moment.  Our show today brought to you by ZipRecruiter.  Did we use ZipRecruiter?  This is how we hire.  So I could say this with authority,  ZipRecruiter is the best way to hire.  If you're business, if you are lucky enough  that your business is looking to hire people,  God bless you.  Thank you.  The world needs you.  And you might be saying, now, how do I find somebody?  Yeah, there's so many people looking for work.  Where do I, there's a needle in that haystack,  but how do I find it?  That's ZipRecruiter.  It's hard to fill these jobs,  but ZipRecruiter makes hiring faster, easier, and smarter.  So you're spreading your net,  you're casting your net as wide as possible.  And then ZipRecruiter does something really interesting.  They look at your posting and they match you up  to some of the resumes they have on file.  And they invite the people who match best  to apply to your job.  That's why when you post a job on ZipRecruiter,  you are gonna get qualified candidates fast.  In my case, we'd post at breakfast,  we'd have two or three qualified candidates by lunch.  Four out of five employers report,  they get a quality candidate on ZipRecruiter  within the first day.  And by the way, these applicants don't flow  into your email or your phone.  They go into the ZipRecruiter interface,  the resumes are formatted so it's easy to scan them.  You can have your own screening questions,  true, false, multiple choice, essay,  so you can screen out the candidates  that don't fit your needs, rank the rest,  and hire the right one fast.  It really works.  The world is changing, you've gotta be flexible.  But if you are hiring, can I tell you  ziprecruiter.com slash twit?  You can always count on ZipRecruiter  to make hiring faster and easier.  And now's a good time to see for yourself  because you can try ZipRecruiter free  at ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  That's ziprecruiter.com slash T-W-I-T.  Don't suffer, let ZipRecruiter take the hiring drudgery  off your plate, they make it easy.  Go to ziprecruiter.com slash twit,  and I can say that some of our best employees  have found on ZipRecruiter.  ZipRecruiter is the smartest way to hire.  Thank you ZipRecruiter for supporting this week in tech.  Now the FCC says, oh yeah, first they said last year  during the net neutrality thing,  oh we can't regulate the internet.  Now they're saying, damn straight,  we can regulate the internet.  In fact, we're gonna get rid of that section 230 thing  that's protecting all those social networks.  They even got the FCC's general counsel  to write a kind of confusing legal memo.  It had lots of highfalutin references  to previous court decisions to somehow imply  that somehow magically the FCC,  now they can regulate the internet.  Any thoughts on, Brianna, can you explain section 230  or is that?

Start time: 6019.04
End time: 6036.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  It's pretty short and sweet.  In fact, short enough I can read it to you right now.  Part of the Communications Decency Act of 1996.  No provider or user of an interactive computer service  shall be treated as the publisher or speaker  of any information provided  by another information content provider.  In other words, you're not a publisher  like the Washington Post is a publisher.  I'm not a publisher in our chat room  and I'm not held to the same requirements as a publisher  is for instance, I can without any risk remove hate speech  from my chat room.  I can't be sued for hate speech in my chat room  so I have privileges in both directions.  This I think is, some people say this is,  these are the 26 words that created the internet.  In fact, there's a book with that title.  I don't know what we would do without it.

Transcript:  I do wanna say, and you know,  sometimes on this show you play devil's advocate  so I'm gonna play it here.  A good friend of mine is Carrie Goldberg.  She's a lawyer.  She's been very critical about Section 230  because she's had to adjudicate a lot of the situations  where it's really, really gone wrong.  The example she starts her book with is with Grindr.  There was someone on Grindr that created a false profile  of basically a gay man and harassed him for years  with people showing up to his apartment  for basically sexual relations, right?  And he tried everything he could to work with Grindr  and get them to take it down  and to take these repeated fake profiles down  and they just would not do it.  And what Carrie has found in her work  is that there's really no civil recourse  for a situation like that.  I myself did not have a civil recourse during Gamergate.  I'm not saying we throw Section 230 away because of that  but I have begun to become increasingly open-minded  to the thought that perhaps we could widen it  in a way that might address those very reasonable concerns.

Transcript:  That's a good point.  I hadn't really thought about that.  I mean, normally what Section 230 is used for  is to let somebody like Grindr pull that account down  without liability, right?  But if they decide not to, where is the recourse?  And you're saying that you can't sue them over that.

I mean, right now on Instagram, you flag people  or if they're catfishing or if they're harassment,  I mean, the platforms do something about it, it seems,  most of the time.  But yeah, sometimes.  I mean, for my, but like, yeah.  I think that everyone has a different experience with that.  And then it's also very biased.  There's no one way to do it  because it depends how high profile you are,  how much accessibility you have.  Do you know an exec at that platform to help you do it?  And then that person could then fight against it.  So I do think there needs to be some rules and regulations  around that, including on dating apps,  where it could get dangerous.  Yeah, I mean, that's terrible.  If they're using this against people,  then yeah, there's an issue there to definitely broaden it  or create a new, it seems like regulation around that  for these platforms.

I think somebody, I think Jeff Jarvis told me on Wednesday  that calmer heads have apparently talked him off that ledge.  But maybe we do need to address it somehow.  I thought it was kind of beautiful in its elegance,  but it does have a consequence  that I hadn't really considered.  So thank you, Brianna, for sharing that.

I just, because she can't, I mean,  Kerry was unable to sue the person themselves  because they had no money  and they were just continuing to participate in this.  And it's not a crime to start a profile.  So it's really a situation.  It's like a lot of online harassment things.  It's just not adjudicated very well, which is prudent.  So this is why, this is a lot of why I ran for Congress.  I thought we needed smarter policy.

Although anybody online, especially a woman,  but anybody online these days is subject to that.  And I don't know what the right answer is.  I think you assume that the platforms will do a good job,  and maybe the platforms would feel like,  well, we can't do anything at all without 230.  But I don't know what the, that's an interesting one.  Now we gotta think about that.  Too bad you didn't get into Congress, Brianna.

Transcript:  WeChat apparently will live to chat again.  A US judge, the judge who originally issued  a preliminary injunction blocking the order  from the Commerce Department  that would have put WeChat out of business in the US  on September 20th, Judge Laurel Beeler  made her injunction permanent,  at least until there's a trial.  The Justice Department asked her to reverse the decision.  She's now rejected it.  In her decision, she said,  the record does not support the conclusion  that does not support the conclusion  that the government has narrowly tailored  the prohibited transactions  to protect its national security interests.  The evidence supports the conclusion  that the restrictions burden substantially more speech  than is necessary to further  the government's legitimate interests.  In other words, she says,  it's just too much to ban WeChat  given your problems with it.  WeChat is the Chinese chat client  that's used mostly primarily in China,  but also used by China as expats in the United States  to communicate with friends and family back home.  But for instance, Disney uses WeChat,  because WeChat's more than a chat platform,  it's a commerce platform.  Disney uses WeChat for payments for passes,  concessions and other purchases  at Hong Kong and Shanghai Disneyland.  Apple believes that if WeChat were to be blocked in the US,  it would cause iPhone shipments to dip by as much as 30%,  because without WeChat and an iPhone,  no one's gonna buy it in China.  So I think that those briefs convince the judge  that the harm would be greater than the solution.  Now, the DOJ says they are gonna appeal it  to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals,  so it's not over, but WeChat will live for now.

Well, I thought we had heard the last of them 10 years ago  when they stopped suing people for stealing music.  They have taken down 18, count them,  18 GitHub projects used for downloading YouTube videos.  The main target was the YouTube DL project,  which is a Python library  used by many YouTube video ripping tools and services.  You may say,  why would the Recording Industry Association of America care  if I download a YouTube video?  Well, they say,  the clear purpose of YouTube downloaders  is to circumvent the technological protection measures  used by authorized streaming services,  such as YouTube, to allow users to reproduce  and distribute music videos and sound recordings  without authorization.  You should go after WeChat, RIAA, please.

And I think overall,  Microsoft has been a very strong steward for open source.  In fact, at Rebellion,  we modeled our code of conduct  directly off the Microsoft open source code of conduct,  because it was so good.  But if they're just gonna roll over like this  with a legal threat for something  that there's clearly fair use  to be with YouTube downloading,  we use it at Rebellion all the time for political ads.

If they, honestly,  we're on YouTube,  if you want a smaller version of our show  than the HD version we put out,  I say go to YouTube and download it.  That's not infringing.  According to John Bergmeyer,  who is the legal director of Public Knowledge,  he said, this is not a DMCA request.  There is no assertion that YouTube downloader  is an infringing work.  The claim is it's illegal per se.  It's not.  That's like saying BitTorrent is illegal per se,  because in some cases it's used illegally.

We get taken out all the time.  In fact, the fact that I played Nathan Apodaca's TikTok  that had the music from Fleetwood Mac's Dream behind it,  means that this show will almost certainly  get taken down on YouTube,  which is why our editors will probably just take it out,  which pisses the hell out of me because it's fair use.  It was a news story.  It's completely legal use.  And by the way, nobody's not gonna buy Dreams  because they heard me play it on this show.  In fact, quite the opposite.

When you set the content ID, you can do like,  remember when National Geographic accidentally said,  any videos with a space launch should be taken down,  even though they didn't own them.  And our videos and a lot of YouTubers' videos  that had pictures of the Crew Dragon launch  got taken down because National Geographic said,  we own it, but they don't.  Or you can say monetize it.  That's one of the switches.  Put an ad on it.  Or, I mean, there's a variety.  Or you can say, put a link to the song download on it.  There's a lot of things you can do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hey, can you put a pin in that?  I wanna talk about that one.  I wanna take a break. Go for it, go for it.  I wanted to bring that up with you.  I'm so glad you mentioned that.  Let's talk about it in just a second.  But first, a quick word from our sponsor.  If you're watching or listening to our shows,  almost certainly it's brought to you by Cashfly.  In fact, you may remember for years I said,  bandwidth for the Twitch podcast  is brought to you by Cashfly at c-h-e-f-l-y.com.  That's our CDN, our content delivery network.  We've used it for years.  It has been a lifesaver for us.  They've been innovating content delivery since 1999.  We've been using them at least 10 years.  And one of the things we've been using,  this was just something they let us do,  but now you can do it too.  They call it their storage optimization system.  One of the real expenses of a,  so you have to understand  how a content delivery network works.  They have servers, as you can see, all over the world.  And they put your content on all those servers  so it's close to your customers, your downloaders,  your listeners, and they get it faster that way.  But if one of those servers doesn't have the content,  that's called a cache miss,  it has to go out and get it from the original source  and download it.  And that can end up costing you a lot of money.  If you store your stuff on Amazon's S3, for instance,  you might have noticed that even though you're on a CDN,  your S3 bills are through the roof,  that's because of all the cache misses.  We've never had that problem because CacheFly  lets us store our content on CacheFly's servers.  Now you can too with their storage optimization system.  It lets you keep the data and content  closer to your customers  without traffic over the public internet,  slowing you down and costing you money.  You could save thousands a month by shielding your origin.  No cache misses.  That means a lot of things, not only saves you money,  but it means no more buffering, no more slowdowns,  your download speeds will be drastically improved,  and your data transfer out fees significantly reduced.  Because with CacheFly's SOS, you get a 100% cache hit ratio.  All you have to do is decide how much storage you need,  they'll take care of the rest.  And by the way, CacheFly is always getting better.  They're rapidly expanding, they added just new pops,  six new pops, points of presence.  Those are the servers I was talking about in South America.  They are now serving 10 times the amount of traffic  in Latin America over last year.  They've not only maintained,  but drastically improved their performance in the region,  while taking on a much higher traffic load.  That's why I love CacheFly.  Doesn't matter where your users are,  Latin America, North America, the Caribbean,  Europe, the Middle East, Asia Pacific,  your content is delivered locally to your listeners,  your users, even in hard to reach regions.  You can expect consistency and performance  everywhere in the world.  Reliable throughput and scalability,  that's what makes CacheFly as much as five times faster  than other CDNs.  And of course, SOS is backed by CacheFly's  100% uptime SLA guarantee,  and it's industry-leading global performance.  So whether it's video streaming, podcasting,  digital downloads, CacheFly can do it.  By the way, they've partnered,  they're a good company too, I really love these guys.  They've partnered with World Central Kitchen.  They've donated now over $50,000.  Their goal to serve 300,000 warm meals  to those who are struggling.  They're good people, and it's a great company.  And if you serve content over the internet,  I want you to find out how CacheFly can help.  They're giving away a complimentary detailed analysis  of your current CDN bill and usage trends.  You may be overpaying by as much as 20%,  plus not getting the service you deserve.  Go to twit.cachefly.com and find out.

And I gotta tell you,  the gaming community is usually toxic,  but feminist gamers, gay gamers, right-wing gamers,  game journalists, all of us came together in a glorious song  and went after the Twitter main character of the day,  and really, really critiqued this person  to the point where floundering Stadia,  he actually took it out of his bio,  the fact that he was a Stadia developer  because Stadia doesn't need any more problems.

Transcript:  I guess he's a game developer.  I'm a game developer.  You shouldn't be paying to stream games.  Like if anything, they should be paying you  because you're advertising.  Among us, the game that AOC played,  when it came out in 2018, it was a complete failure.  Isn't that funny?  Nobody played it, and then a makeup YouTuber  started streaming it to millions of people on a whim,  and it exploded in popularity.  They should pay her.  Right, well, it was him, but yeah.

Now leave anything out?  Oh, I did leave this out.  There is a bot that orders $18,752 worth of Mac Sundays  every half hour to see if they're broken.  The McFlurry machines.  And what?  You go to mcbroken.com.  You can see that because I guess I didn't know this,  not being a McFlurry lover,  that McFlurry machines break a lot.  So, see?  So, before you head out,  you might wanna know that the McFlurry machine  in Roanard Park on Redwood Drive is still broken.  It's been broken all day.  I've been checking.  Yeah, but good news.  The McFlurry machine just down the road in Petaluma  is working.  Apparently, this guy wrote a bot.

Rashik Zahid decided it's better to know  if the ice cream machine is broken before you go.

And I'm currently placing an order  worth $18,752 every minute  at every McDonald's in the US  to figure out which locations have a broken machine.  Now, I don't know, I hope these McFlurry machines  aren't spinning up to make unconsumed McFlurries  all over the country.  That seems like a McFlurry waste.  He's actually from Germany.

Right now we're doing a huge ad buy in Florida.  Florida, the way we're looking at it,  has 52% chance to go for Biden.  So we're looking at that.  We're saying that is worth our ad dollars.  So we're putting a really big ad buy there.  So why did you buy an ad in Nebraska then?  Well, because a candidate we like a lot,  Carrie Eastman is there.  A local candidate, okay.  Well, she has a 48% chance  of beating a Republican incumbent  who's there with a 52% chance.  This is someone who vetoed COVID relief.  And I take that personally.  I think we should be doing more on that.  So, but yeah, if we win Nebraska,  we also get that electoral vote, won't hurt.  We're looking at Michigan.  So, yeah, we are, I'm an engineer.

They raised about 1.3 million.  I raised close to a million.  Good for you.  And we said if we combine our forces,  we can really help win this election.

Transcript:  I sure did.  If I could plug one more thing.  We have the opposite of mindfulness classes on Zoom.  It's Rocket, it's Relay FM's worst show.  What?  Is that your tagline?  We are the best worst show on Relay.  Many of the hosts that you love here on Twitch  are over on my show.  All of them.  I think Christina Warren and Simone DeRush for both there.  So please come watch us there.  I love Christina Warren.  It's a good time.  Isn't Christina great?  Say what?

Transcript:  No, we're not.  We're sharing.  It's sharing.  It's not cannibalizing unless it's a McFlurry.  Relay.fm slash, no, there's no,  I don't wanna, McDonald's will sue me.  There's no people in McFlurry as far as we know.  Relay.fm slash Rocket accelerated geek conversation  and it really is good.  Thank you everybody for being here for this week in tech.  We do the show every week, hence the name  of a Sunday afternoon, evening, about 2.30 Pacific,  5.30 Eastern, 21.30 UTC.  Actually next week, it will be at 20.30 UTC  because we're gonna fall spring back forward.  And so whatever that is, we're gonna do it  and we will be at 20.30 UTC.  So just a little word of warning.  But it'll still be, weirdly enough,  2.30 Pacific, 5.30 Eastern.  And if you wanna watch it live,  there are live streams of audio and video available,  a variety of them, at twit.tv slash live.  People who watch live often like to chat live  in our chat room.  It's an IRC chat room, old school, very.  IRC.twit.tv.  You also can get on demand versions  of everything we do at our website, twit.tv.  This show included.  There's also a YouTube channel devoted to this week in tech.  And actually the best thing to do probably  would be get a podcast app that you like  and subscribe to us.  We're everywhere you want us to be.  And if you subscribe, then you can download it  and automatically the minute it's available,  you don't have to worry about it.  Thank you everybody for being here.  Thanks to our wonderful panel.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit.  This is amazing.  Send the cat.
