We were scheduled to have Ryan Block, your partner on.  And Veronica, his partner, is playing tennis  against Maria Sharpova.  Yeah.  So he felt it would be disloyal to come do this show  and not watch Veronica beat Maria Sharpova.

Transcript:  That's weird.  Like there needs to be something about that.  Either she's trying to get into tech more or.  There's always something when you see people  that aren't traditionally in this scene  hanging out with people in the scene,  it's because, I don't know,  they're trying to get into it more.

Transcript:  I guess, well yeah, Ashton when he started,  now he's I guess part of the scene a bit more,  but when he started getting into it  a year and a half or two years ago,  he started hanging with people like Kevin Rose  or with Michael Arrington.  You're like, hmm, what's going on here?

So this was a week that many of the big tech companies  announced their quarterly results.  Apple announced the biggest quarter,  I think in its history.  In fact, there was some thought,  what Apple announced first,  that they might beat Microsoft for the first time ever  in revenue, not profits, never in profits, but in revenue.  No, Microsoft pulled ahead  and had one of its best quarters ever  with a profit of $16 billion.  I'm sorry, a revenue of $16 billion in three months.  That's kind of an astounding amount of money  and a good amount of that profit  since Microsoft just sells bits.  They say they have sold 175 million copies  of Windows 7.  That is 10 copies, wait a minute, let me get this right.  I gotta get the numbers right.  10 copies of Windows 7 every second,  every second since it came out.  It's pretty amazing.  Anything to say?  Nobody has anything to say.  It's like...

Start time: 310.88
End time: 338.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's their cash cow, right?  I mean, I think that we expected  that this new vision of Windows was gonna sell a lot.  They have a lot of support from the OEMs,  but I think they also came out  with a much better version of Windows  than they did last time around with Vista.  And so there are a lot of companies that sat out Vista,  so to speak, especially the big enterprise customers  that decided to skip a generation and wait.  And so they were doing the big upgrade  from XP to Windows 7 now.  And so I think that's why they sold so many copies.

Transcript:  You'll notice that I started the show  with a computer story.  And the reason is this is the last time  we'll talk about computers for the next hour and a half.  It seems like computers are gone, right?  All we ever talk about,  and anybody talks about these days is cell phones,  maybe iPads, maybe mobile computing,  but computers themselves...

Transcript:  Here's a thanks to Bawit Taba in our chat room,  the chart of the day from Silicon Alley insider,  Microsoft's online operating income.  And this is a loss.  All those reds, a loss.  They made money in September and December 2005,  and they have lost money every quarter since.  This quarter online, $700 million in losses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Start time: 393.50
End time: 414.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But when you have 16 billion in revenue,  losing 100 million here or there is no big deal.  It just shows you though,  that these big computer, PC companies like Microsoft  are having a hard time making this transition  to the modern world, the online world,  and the portable, the mobile space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder what percentage of their product  was delivered over the internet  versus delivered in a cardboard box in a store.

Start time: 424.80
End time: 426.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's gotta be good for the bottom line, right?

Start time: 427.12
End time: 462.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll be...  I also think there's no opening.  What they're losing money on here is Bing.  Bing.  They're investing literally hundreds of millions of dollars  in Bing right now, and they see that the success of Bing  as critical to the future of the company.  And so, I mean, what are they inching up towards?  I mean, they're the number two player,  but I think that they have a chance of getting  above 25, 30% market share in search,  which I know is super, super important to them.  And so they'd rather lose $500 million,  $700 million right now,  rather than be completely shut out of that market  down the road.  I think that most of that money is related to Bing  and to Live.

Start time: 463.46
End time: 474.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Excellent point.  In fact, we talked last week about the fact  that Bing is gaining share,  considerable share over Google and Yahoo,  but the way they're doing it is by buying share,  which is not a tenable long-term position.

Start time: 477.16
End time: 514.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know if it's not, I mean,  it is tenable in the sense that they can cut these deals.  I mean, you look at something like AOL,  which is kind of ready to renegotiate its deal with Google,  right?  And so they're looking to Microsoft  to offer them a better deal.  And AOL is only about 2.5% of web search,  but because it's AOL users,  it actually accounts for about 6% of paid clicks.  So if Microsoft were able to sign up AOL as a search client,  they would actually be able to get closer to that 30%,  but they actually, from a revenue standpoint,  would be able to make more money off those users  than an average percentage point of search.  Right.

Start time: 515.94
End time: 533.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What was it Jason Calacanis used to say,  every percentage point of market share in search  is worth a billion.  Yeah, something like that, yeah.  So spending 700 million, even if all of that was spent  in a quarter to get 1% market share,  would still be a net gain.  Eventually, in theory, yeah.  In theory.

Start time: 534.02
End time: 553.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Does Microsoft think they're gonna compete with Apple  in terms of hardware?  I mean, I feel like they spent so much time  kind of focusing on obviously huge communities.  Like we're a minority, some of us who use Apple products,  most of the country and most of the world  who don't have the money do still use Microsoft products,  but doesn't mean that that is innovative products.

Start time: 554.40
End time: 577.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I guess that's why the stock is so flatlining,  given this huge profit, this huge revenue.  Microsoft stocks never, it's always kind of flat.  And I think probably the market perceives Microsoft  as last year's technology, not the future of technology.  And that would also explain why Microsoft's putting  so much money into online.  I mean, they've got to become a cloud company.

Start time: 577.80
End time: 584.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Maybe they realize they're just not gonna compete  against Apple.  I mean, every time they do try to put something out there.  Now, sure, I gotta point out,

Start time: 585.22
End time: 587.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they have 95% market share in the operating system.

Start time: 589.40
End time: 604.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They'll compete with the products, the basics,  and still win.  I definitely think in terms of Peter said,  Bing is the way to go and they're doing it right.  I mean, it's only been around for what, eight or so,  and they already see a lot of progress.

Transcript:  I use it sometimes.  The travel sometimes, the comparison travel's pretty good.

Start time: 612.84
End time: 631.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But we saw Google's response to that is they bought,  what was it, IATA, so that they get all this database,  this huge database of travel information,  so that they can do exactly what Bing's doing.  If you enter in a search on Bing, it gives you like fares,  it gives you more than just search results, right?  Is that why you use it, Shira?  You use it-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, Marison, you could basically,  you could find it also when the best time is  to buy the tickets or the hotel.  So if you say you need to be traveling at a certain point,  it'll say instead of buying it today,  maybe wait two more days.

Transcript:  Right, right.  Hey, I wanna talk,  before we get too far down the road with this,  and we're gonna come back to this, Microsoft and Apple's,  quarterly results, Amazon's as well,  Intel's last week, AMD's last week,  and there's a lot to say about that.  But Denise Howell's gonna call us in just a bit.  She's an attorney, of course,  the host of our show this week in law.  And there's an interesting new iPad application.  Robert Scoble said it's the page maker or Excel of the iPad.  In other words, the killer app that's gonna make the iPad  the next best thing in the world.  It's called Flipboard.  And when I mentioned this,  I was on this week in law this week,  when I mentioned this to Neelay Patel,  who is within Gadget, of course,  you know him very well, Peter.  Neelay went ballistic.  He says, yeah, we don't like Flipboard so much.  The idea of Flipboard is it scrapes the web  to create a beautiful, I mean, nobody denies this,  a beautiful magazine of content.  But here I'm looking at Boing Boing,  but this isn't the Boing Boing site.  Notice there are no ads.  The articles are from Boing Boing.  It's a beautiful magazine with a great page turn.  But is this what Boing Boing intended  when they created a website?  What do you, now you're no longer  in that business particularly.  I mean, they're not gonna scrape Gadget, Peter.  What do you think of this?

Start time: 724.96
End time: 761.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there wouldn't be, I mean,  the way Gadget is structured,  it wouldn't make sense to really scrape.  I mean, you guess you could scrape like the front page feed  Maybe you're smart.  And you wouldn't mind that.  Well, you wouldn't mind it at all.  It'd be like, I mean, it's like, well, I mean,  a big part of what Flipboard does  is it scrapes people's Twitter feeds, right?  And the copyright related to individual tweets  is very unclear, let alone the issue of a feed.  But if you look at, you know,  Engadget's terms of service for RSS feed,  which are terms of service that I helped create originally,  you know, back when I was there,  was that, you know, we, oh, sorry about my video there.  That's all right, it's a very intriguing look.

End time: 817.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The video coming out, I can see the video on my own Skype  looks fine. It's called a Skype thing, you know.  Yeah, it's, but what I was gonna say was that,  you know, the RSS feed is a full text feed  that Engadget does.  And a lot of sites don't do that, right?  A lot of sites do truncated feeds,  which are maybe headlines and an excerpt  to force you to click through to their website,  where you can see ads.  Engadget is one of the few sites, you know,  big tech news sites, which does full text feeds.  And they do that, you know, as a service to the reader.  And I think that it's something that is very positive,  but the condition of use is that it's not meant  to be republished on the web.  It's not meant to be used in a commercial context.  And I think you could argue, and I'm sure Neelai does,  that Flipboard is a business,  and that them using Engadget's full text RSS feed  constitutes a commercial,  a non-licensed commercial use of the feed.  And I think that's legitimate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Flipbook, Flipboard says, it's, by the way,  they had a rocky launch because it was so popular.  You know, initially the idea was when you first get it,  you sign into your Facebook and Twitter account,  it aggregates content from the people you follow  on those sites, as well as from other sites.  And you can easily add, it's actually kind of fun,  you can easily add other sites or subtract sites.  The founders of Flipboard say,  no, we're paying attention to the RSS.  And when the RSS only does a truncated feed,  we do a truncated feed.  We try not to put more into the magazine, into Flipboard,  than you'll get on the RSS.  But that's actually not true in some cases.  People pointed out that the Boston Globe,  which has that big picture feature, which I love,  if you love photography, it's fantastic.  The problem with it is those pictures appear on Flipboard  in its entirety, even though they come from,  I think it's the Associated Press,  and they're not licensed to do this.  I mean, it's great if you love photojournalism,  it's fantastic.  But I wonder how the Boston Globe feels about this.  Aren't they great?  I mean, one thing you can't deny  is this is a great presentation.  I mean, it really is a great way.

Start time: 887.20
End time: 910.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an interesting issue because I think we're talking  about the future of this in terms of curation,  and it's like, who's gonna come up  to really curate things properly?  And this is a platform that's doing that for us,  but then it brings up the issue of like,  what's kind of taken content,  and how are you gonna be kind of giving credit  where credit's due?  I mean, look at Huffington Post.  A lot of it's pretty much taken from other sources as well.

Start time: 910.82
End time: 951.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, right.  I've had a little problem with that, frankly.  I mean, they do link back to the original source,  but really, the Huffington Post is like a newspaper  built of feeds it didn't pay for.  This, here's an interesting,  this is an interesting use of this.  Here's the daily dose of imagery image,  and then to the right of it, Twitter.  People who are talking about this on Twitter,  now presumably, if you had your,  I can't get in because I don't have an account  because it's been overwhelmed since it came out last week,  but if you had signed into your Twitter account,  you could add comments here,  and you could see the comments, particularly,  I would presume, of your own social graph.  This is a very interesting idea.  It's kind of compelling.

Start time: 952.44
End time: 970.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a great app.  It's very robust, it's high level.  I mean, it's social viewing.  I think that's the future,  whether it be in video form or in text form,  it's all about watching or reading something together  and being able to have all those other social tools  alongside, and this does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Peter pointed out that Dave Weiner, the creator of RSS,  has posted on his blog, on scripting.com, about Flipboard.  I hear Denise calling in,  so we'll get Denise on in just a second,  but let me read a little bit of what Dave Weiner says  to kind of set the stage for Denise.  He says, first of all, he says,  he knows Mike McHugh from Netscape days.  Mike McHugh founded Tell Me, he sold that to Microsoft,  and then went on to found Flipboard.  He says, Dave Weiner says, with no disrespect, Flipboard,  and here I am scraping Dave Weiner's blog.  I hope Dave doesn't mind.  Send PayPal him some money.  I will, I love Dave.  Dave, I love you.  Is that enough?  With no disrespect, Flipboard is a scraper.  It takes content flows that weren't intended  for this kind of presentation and repurposes them.  How could it do otherwise?  It's a chicken and egg situation.  Right now, there's no content that is specifically designed  for a Flipboard-like environment,  but now that their product exists,  it seems we have one half of the puzzle in place.  Why not put out a proposal to the content tool vendors,  of which Dave says I happen to be one, and say this,  if you want to produce content flows  that look beautiful in our environment,  here's how to do it.  In other words, create a kind of a new kind of RSS  for programs like Flipboard.  He says, put hints in the source code  or create new renderings of the source code  specifically to be viewed in the new environment.  So he's not, I think this is typical of Dave,  and I like this about Dave, he's generative.  He says, well, okay, maybe there's a problem here.  Here's the solution, let's account for it.  Denise Howell is on the line.  She's the host of This Week in Law,  and a practicing attorney,  knows a little bit about these particular kinds of subjects,  and she's poolside right now.  Thank you, Denise, for joining us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  I think we're in a brave new world here.  I think that the iPad as a platform,  and pad, tablet, computers in general,  are going to open up a lot of issues like this,  because they're the same kinds of issues  that we had when the browser first came into being.

Start time: 1128.34
End time: 1198.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, deep linking and search engines,  and copying and re-displaying,  repurposing content in various ways,  and exceptions that had to be carved out  from copyright law to make that happen,  because as a policy matter,  the courts and ultimately the legislatures,  when they've been asked to look at this,  have decided it's a good idea for us  to be able to search the web.  It doesn't make sense for us as a culture, as a society,  and there have to be some exceptions  to what otherwise would be technically copyright violations.  You copy, you reuse for commercial purpose.  You're technically in violation of the law.  But maybe there's a new thing developing here.  And like you, Leo, I really like Dave's suggestion  that perhaps rather than leaving this  to the courts and legislatures  that can take their time with these issues,  there should be some addressing of the fact  that there's a legal issue here upfront,  and smoothing that out rather than just forging ahead  and going forward with a product  that is gonna tick some people off.

Transcript:  Well, it reminds me of YouTube.  I mean, YouTube pissed off a lot of copyright holders.  And Google, when it bought YouTube,  they knew that there was gonna be an issue with copyrights.  We talked about this on this week's Twill,  and I encourage people to listen to it.  Of course, the Viacom decision kind of vindicated Google.  The court said, well, no, you're protected  by the safe harbor provision of the DMCA.  And so Google is actually now okay with YouTube.  I don't know if this is directly comparable.

Transcript:  to play with it yet. It's very compelling.  Watch out, I'm reading The Economist,  for instance, right now.  I don't know why you would subscribe to The Economist.  Admittedly, this is the stuff that The Economist puts online,  so the paper version may have other stuff.  And it's not the full article,  but it's enough of the article  that I kind of don't feel like I need to read more,  and it's a mashup too, because as you can see,  there's Twitter comments here with further links in,  although you can't click those links,  which is really kind of too bad,  that give you deeper, it's almost a gloss on this.  This is very compelling.

Transcript:  Right, and the fact that they're scraping  and not using RSS, now I'm gleaning that  from the articles I read.

Start time: 1285.04

Start time: 1286.36
End time: 1308.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know enough about Under the Hood,  but that's an issue too, because RSS,  is syndication that implies some reuse in various contexts.  There's been a lot of legal trauma over RSS as well,  because as soon as you're syndicating something,  people think they can use it for any purpose.

Transcript:  Does it let them off the hook  that they don't charge for the app  and there's currently no ads in it?  They're not, in other words, monetizing it?

Start time: 1314.20
End time: 1359.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It certainly helps.  As you suggest, there's no guarantee  that that's gonna remain the case.  But the copyright law looks at whether you are  interfering with the creator's ability  to have a market for their work.  And as you just said about The Economist,  even with the free no ads scenario here,  it seems to me that you are.  I mean, the real issue here is that a lot of these sites  like The Economist are attempting to have  a market around their works in various ways.  They have certain things behind a paywall.

Start time: 1361.78
End time: 1365.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is not stuff from behind the paywall.  This is stuff that's freely visible.

Start time: 1365.52
End time: 1387.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  So that's where I think we're in a brave new world here.  This is not technically a web browser or an aggregator,  but it's sort of a hybrid of both.  And maybe there needs to be some sort of exception  in the free no ad context  that makes room for something like this.

Start time: 1389.24
End time: 1432.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What about a technical solution to this situation?  I mean, basically the copyright holders  are having a problem with controlling their media.  What if we change the HTML protocol or whatever  and the code and browsers such that the copyright holder  can say do not link to this piece  and none of the browsers would link to it,  put the control entirely in the hands of the creator.  That's a wild, off the top of the head suggestion,  but wouldn't that be possible or at least a signal?  I don't want to, I consider this proprietary  or whatever only my site.

Start time: 1434.30
End time: 1445.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what I get back to what Leo was talking about,  how there was a lot of litigation in the early days  about whether you could link to someone's site,  whether you could deep link past the front door page.

Start time: 1445.52
End time: 1448.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the status there?  Cause I know that some people have been forbidden  from doing that, right?

Start time: 1450.98
End time: 1475.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The status there is basically if there's a link  and it's discernible or publicly available,  there's no problem with linking to it,  at least not in the United States.  There's been some rogue decisions in other jurisdictions,  but basically the linking cases have all come out,  are you kidding me?  Of course you can link, it's the web.  It's a link, what do you want?

Start time: 1475.24
End time: 1475.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 1476.30

Start time: 1482.50
End time: 1487.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, there was some litigation about that a while back.  And-

Start time: 1488.88
End time: 1493.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They say you can't, but technically you can  because the courts say you can, is that it?

Start time: 1494.38
End time: 1496.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's basically how it's all come out.

Start time: 1496.36
End time: 1510.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they say no deep linking  cause what happens people leak to concerts directly  instead of going through the front door of Ticketmaster  and they want you to go through the front door  for some actually legitimate technical reasons.  They're trying to keep people from doing robotic  ticket purchases and things like that.

Start time: 1512.08
End time: 1537.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, yes, if you are circumventing  somebody's technical measure that has prevented you  from readily getting to a site,  that's a different matter.  But if it's a URL that is either publicly out there  or you could figure it out without too much problem,  then linking is pretty much fair game  as far as the law is concerned.

I will tell you, Callie, since you're just joining us  that we've bookmarked the stories we're gonna talk about  today to the degree that we end up following any rules  on Delicious, Delicious.com slash twit slash 258  because this is episode 258.  And we will get back to the news in just a bit  with Ray Maxwell, color guy on Twitter,  Shira Lazar from CBS, Peter Rojas from Gadget.com,  Callie Lewis from the new GeekBeat.tv.  It's great to see you.  We'll talk about the new show too.  That's really exciting.  Absolutely.  In just a little bit, but before we go any farther,  I wanna mention our good friends at Ford,  Ford Motor Company.  I don't know if you know this.  We're gonna be going to Detroit on Friday and Saturday.  We're covering Maker Faire on Saturday and Friday.  We're getting a great tour of the Ford Rouge plant,  including the amazing kind of virtual reality equipment  they use to test and design cars ahead of time.  It's really a remarkable technology.  We'll be streaming that live Friday,  right after actually this weekend,  come to think of it, on live.twit.tv.  I drive a Ford Mustang, but I have to say,  before I bought the Mustang, I took a look at the  Taurus SHO and now I'm thinking about it again,  this new Ford EcoBoost engine.  I don't know if you're aware of this.  An amazing engine.  This is a 3.5 liter V6, twin turbocharged,  that delivers, get ready for this, 365 horsepower.  3.5 liters, 365 horsepower, and a V6  with unparalleled fuel economy, too.  It's standard on the new 2011 Taurus SHO,  and I'm kinda thinking, boy, I might wanna try this.  EPA estimated fuel economy, 17 city, 25 highway.  But let me tell you, when you hit the gas pedal  on this thing, it roars to life.  The twin turbochargers increase the air density.  It's using direct injection to increase fuel efficiency.  I don't need to explain this to the auto buffs out there,  but the fuel is pressurized into the combustion chamber,  so it's more efficient than other injection methods.  Ford's using really amazing state of the art technology  to design the most efficient engines in the industry  and give you performance of much bigger engines  with a fuel economy of a smaller engine.  It's truly amazing.  And of course, you know the SHO will have  the voice activated sync that I love so much.  Hands-free calling, turn-by-turn voice directions,  911 assist, voice activated music and podcast browsing.  By the way, it works great with your iPhone 4.  Absolutely flawlessly, I tried it.  It works great with my Android,  and I have to say, my Droid X, I use a T1 headset,  and I'll give you a secret.  This Blue Ant T1, there's a free Android download  that's supposed to use with the T1  that reads text messages to your T1.  It works with a sync.  So now my Android, when I get a text message,  reads me, the Ford sync reads me my text message,  and I can then choose from some pre-canned messages  to send back, so pretty amazing.  Ford sync, the Ford EcoBoost engine,  combined to make an amazing automobile.  Try the Taurus SHO at a Ford dealer near you.  Shop at a Ford dealer this week and drive one yourself.  You will be blown away.  They are in store now.  Drive one this week, the Ford SHO,  with the new EcoBoost twin turbo engine.  Amazing, and don't forget to watch our special broadcast  from Dearborn, we're heading out on Friday,  and we're gonna take a look at the Ford plant,  the Rouge, the very famous Rouge plant,  which was where the Mustangs were made, but not anymore,  so I won't be able to visit my baby's birthplace anymore.  Sherla Zahr, Ray Maxwell, Kali Lewis, Peter Rojas,  great to have you here.  I mean, I'm just curious, I bet you,  I'm gonna guess you're all iPhone 4 users, yes?

I did switch to the Nexus One at the beginning of this year,  was very excited about the iPhone 4, I loved it,  beautiful, but it was dropping calls on me like crazy,  because here in the Bay Area, AT&T, not so good.  And so I said, well, I'll try Verizon, I got the Droid X.  Here's what I think, I think once people get used  to 4.3 inch screens, they don't go back.

End time: 1936.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, actually I was concerned about the size,  because girls' pockets are smaller than guys' pockets,  for sure, and I like to be able to carry my phone around  in my pocket without having to carry a purse,  or without fear of dropping it.  And it fits right in, I don't drop it,  unless it's in my hands, of course,  but it doesn't fall out of my pocket.  And it's a fantastic device.  I'm switching as soon as I decide to pay  the termination fee over on AT&T.

Like, I use it to shoot video and to shoot pictures,  you know, and upload to YouTube,  and then the apps, of course.  But I've been using the Skype app to call people.  How sad is that?

Start time: 1986.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and here's something nobody's talking about,  but people who use the iPhone 3,  the two-model old iPhone, who have gone to iOS 4  are bitterly unhappy.  There is a revolt going on.  It is so slow and unusable.  So a word of warning, anybody who's still got an iPhone 3  and has not yet upgraded, don't.  Although that puts you in an awkward position,  because now you're suddenly out of the Apple universe.  Ray, you're in Canada, so I don't know if you count.  iPhone.

Start time: 2062.30
End time: 2068.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 2069.64
End time: 2106.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right, yes, I think the 3GS is fine.  Oh, it will tether, which is nice.  That's another thing the Droid X does nicely.  You pay 20 bucks a month for it,  but I traded in my MiFi,  because basically this is a MiFi as well as a phone now.  It does the Wi-Fi tethering.  I really like that.  Let's move along.  We did talk a little bit about quarterly results.  Apple had a great quarter.  Microsoft had a great quarter.  We talked about this last week.  Intel and AMD had a great quarter.  In fact, AMD would have shown a profit for the first time  in a long time.  Is the PC industry coming back?  Peter, do you have a thought on that?

Start time: 2106.78
End time: 2149.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think that Intel and AMD  tried to diversify their product lines,  and I think that they were both smart  to introduce the low power chips.  I mean, Intel got as further along than anybody else  in getting netbooks.  I mean, it's basically every netbook  is using an Atom processor,  and Intel's trying really hard to get smartphones  and the smaller devices using Intel chips at all,  and they're actually encountering  a little bit of resistance,  but that's one reason why they introduced MeeGo,  which is that new mobile operating system  that they did in partnership with Nokia.  Is that a terrible name?  It's a terrible name.  Okay.  It's true.  It is a terrible name.  MeeGo use phone.  But you know what the name they had before was?  What?  Moblin.

Start time: 2150.34
End time: 2151.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, Moblin.  I've used Moblin.

Start time: 2152.24
End time: 2200.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is kind of a D&D vibe to it.  Yeah.  So, and I guess in that sense, it wasn't so bad,  but I think that the regular PC market's very mature,  and I think that we have to differentiate  between a market that's gonna die and disappear,  which I don't think is gonna happen anytime soon,  with one that has just reached maturity  and is sort of stabilized  and isn't gonna have a lot of its growth.  Ray said earlier, it's a commodity market,  and I think that's exactly right.  I think that most PC makers recognize that a long time ago,  and I think it's one reason that HP bought Palm.  I am writing a thing about this right now,  which I'll post on Gadget at some point,  about why HP bought Palm,  and it was because they looked at the future of computing  and realized that it's gonna be about devices  that are like the iPad.  Yeah.

Start time: 2201.66
End time: 2207.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, they're gonna do the slate after all,  a Windows 7-based tablet towards the end of the year, right?

Start time: 2208.80
End time: 2220.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it's gonna be aimed just at enterprise users,  and I think that it's basically gonna be something  that they release and then quietly shove aside.  Yeah, and you think they'll do webOS?  Their heart's not in it at all.

Start time: 2220.38
End time: 2221.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  WebOS is where their heart is.

Start time: 2222.62
End time: 2265.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It will be.  They will definitely do a webOS tablet.  I don't think we'll see it this year, though.  Oh, interesting.  Well, I don't think they have enough time.  If they come out with something this year,  if they actually release a product this year,  I think it will be a shoddy product.  Why is that?  It takes time.  Well, I think Apple spent years working on the iPad  and it takes so much time to customize the operating system  and so much time to optimize the hardware.  You have to, I mean, the thing that Apple did with the iPad  that people don't think about is that they spent a lot  of time making sure that the processor was completely  optimized for the mobile platform.  And so you have great battery life,  you have a super responsive user interface,  and those things take a lot of engineering resources  and a lot of time.

Start time: 2266.56
End time: 2278.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a good point.  That A4 chip, now, correct me,  you probably know better than I,  but I was told that if you know, for instance,  you're not gonna support flash,  you can actually customize the chip to be more efficient  and leave that part out.

Start time: 2279.58
End time: 2284.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, there are a lot of things that they did  to optimize for battery life.  If you're not gonna have a camera,

Start time: 2284.78
End time: 2300.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you don't have to, you can make the processor simpler,  things like that.  Yeah.  That's interesting.  So that's one of the reasons.  Now, the A4 is in the iPhone 4 as well.  And the iPhone 4 does have better battery life,  not as much as the iPad,  but it does have better battery life.

Start time: 2301.56
End time: 2304.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it just has a much smaller battery than on the iPad.  Right.

Start time: 2305.00
End time: 2316.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It feels snappy.  It certainly doesn't feel sluggish.  Yeah. Yeah.  So is this custom silicon?  Is that what HP is gonna have to do, that kind of thing?  Or can they use an atom?

Start time: 2318.68
End time: 2364.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's one of the reasons why the slate  that they introduced running Windows 7 is so crappy  is because it's on an atom processor,  and Windows 7 is just not fast enough,  especially if you're gonna start doing,  you want responsive touch-based input for a tablet device.  It's just not gonna work.  And so I'm not sure that they're gonna have  to do custom silicon,  but I think that they are gonna have to find a partner,  and maybe that'll be Intel, you know,  maybe it'll be Samsung,  and Samsung has really come a long way  with these mobile processors.  They're gonna have to come out with something  that'll be highly optimized to make a great web OS tablet.  I think that they have a good shot at doing it,  but you have to keep in mind that HP doesn't have  a lot of experience building  and developing their own consumer software platforms.

Start time: 2364.62

With the iPad line, yeah, and they have,  I mean, the Glisten was the last one I think they put out,  which I think says it all, right?  It's slick and coated with fat.  Yes.

Transcript:  I'm starting to feel like John C. Dvorak.  He has made a living saying everything sucks.  And I'm starting to feel like  maybe that wasn't such a bad strategy.  90% of everything that comes out in the tech industry  does in fact, suck.  Now, here's an interesting story from the Yankee group.  Let's talk customer satisfaction.  They say that according to the Boy Genius report,  73% of iPhone users are happy with AT&T.  Of course, what they don't say is that means 20,  what is it, 27% are not.  Right.  That seems like a large number that are not frankly.  I'm so surprised they spun that as, hey, good news.

Transcript:  Nobody knows.  Nobody knows.  Although it's my feeling that since it was consumer reports  that dinged them for the antenna  and they did their tests with not with AT&T,  but with their own point and in their own testing labs,  seems to me that, well, maybe there is a problem with AT&T,  but that if there's a problem with the iPhone,  it's independent of the carrier.  Now, we have a lot of European listeners,  a lot of Asian listeners.  Well, they're telling me right now,  Saley is saying in the UK, the iPhone's just fine.  A lot of people are saying overseas  that they're not seeing the same problems  that we see in the States.  In fact, a lot of people even in the States  who have good AT&T coverage are saying,  we have never dropped a call.

Start time: 2543.82
End time: 2571.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just think it's a combination of the antenna design  and the coverage.  And if you have excellent coverage  and a high signal strength,  then you're not gonna see the problem.  It covers a multitude of evils, of sins.  Right.  And on the other hand,  if you are in a area where you have a weak signal strength,  then it's going to be sensitive to how you hold the phone.

Facebook now has half a billion users.  They crossed that point.  Diane Sawyer was the 500, no, she wasn't,  but they pretended she was a 501, whatever,  half a billionth user.  Now somebody pointed out,  and this is actually kind of an interesting statistic,  but there's only about a billion people  who could use Facebook,  who have internet access and a computer.

It's not just about technology, it's about humanity.  And I think as kind of techies and geeks,  we forget about that, that it's going beyond this community.

They're a number of statistics they came out  with for instance, number one, when they asked the question,  do you seek out recommendations for products or services  on this site?  Facebook number one.  But it's only 16% say yes.  Then MySpace, Wikipedia and YouTube.  Actually, YouTube did a little better than Facebook on that.  Have you ever purchased products or services  that were recommended to you on this site?  Facebook didn't do as well.  YouTube was number one with 14%.  Facebook number two with 12%.  Wikipedia 10%.  Does Wikipedia recommend anything?  I think these people are drunk.  MySpace 8%.

You know what, it did remind me,  and I'd like to just take a moment.  It has nothing to do with news to say,  I think if we look back 100 years from now  at what some of the most important developments  were in technology,  Wikipedia is gonna rank right up there.  And I don't know if Jimmy Wales  and the Wikipedia Foundation get enough credit.  They have created an asset of such incredible usefulness  that we just all take for granted.  If you wanted to know something about a subject,  in the old days you go to the library,  you might get what you needed.  It'd take you a long time.  Three seconds from now,  I could find information on anything.  I could get an answer to almost any question,  not just because of Google, but because of Wikipedia.

Start time: 2876.78
End time: 2900.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  I think when it comes to information on products  or technical sides of things or whatever,  it's really, really good.  When it comes to people, not so much  because people get emotionally involved  in the editing of that.  But you know, if you take that side of it out,  then Wikipedia is fantastic.  Yeah.

I think all these sites, like whether it be YouTube  or Wikipedia that have crowdsourced content material  by like regular folks are becoming,  we'll see in future years, more legit.  They'll be the places we'll be going to for content.  I think the interesting next step would be  if kind of official outlets like a news network  or places like that would create partnerships  with a site like Wikipedia as a place  and legitimizing as a place for real information,  not just a place where random people are posting things.

It's like the encyclopedia,  it's obviously like an encyclopedia,  modern day encyclopedia,  but I think Wikipedia has never been really taken seriously  more and more so as they're having a history of subjects  and people and events, they're becoming more legit.

So the foundation could make  hundreds of millions of dollars every year  if they would just put a little bit  of a Google ad on there.  And even though they know that,  they continue to refuse that, they raise money.  I donated, I don't know, 250 bucks  the last time they asked for money.  I just think that they've stayed clean.  They have a higher purpose  and I just wanted to give them a little props, that's all.

But right now I wanna talk about squarespace.com.  If you're making a website, and who isn't these days?  By the way, that's another point  maybe to having to do with Facebook.  It's fine to be on Facebook,  but don't make Facebook your only presence on the web.  I think you'd agree, Shira, that as a social media expert,  you gotta have multiple points of access on the web.  And it's really kind of important to have your own website.  What a great place to do it, squarespace.com.  If you go to squarespace.com slash twit, take a look at it.  They call it the secret behind exceptional websites.  And it really is.  Starting at $8 a month,  let's see if I can pull this up here.  I've run out of switcher ports.  Starting at $8 a month,  you can create a site that is gorgeous.  It is both hosting and a content management system  that is second to none.  Dane and Anthony and the gang  just put together something truly incredible.  Templates that don't look templated,  that are easy to modify,  even if you don't have any skills at all.  You just drag and drop the columns  and create things that just look unique and beautiful.  And if you do know CSS and JavaScript,  well, the sky's the limit.  Great stats packages,  so you know exactly who's watching, who's visiting,  where they're coming from, how long they stay.  Beautiful photo galleries.  If you're a photographer or an artist of any kind,  lots of people use Squarespace for portfolios.  In fact, go to the examples page,  squarespace.com slash twit right at the top there.  Click the portfolios link.  You'll see all the artists who use Squarespace  to show their stuff.  This is so easy.  And look at these guys.  They're aesthetic professionals,  but they don't have time to be web designers.  So they use Squarespace to do the job for them  and incredible stuff.  Squarespace uses a very sophisticated  Java-based VPS technology  to make sure there's always enough bandwidth for your site,  no matter how popular it is.  Take a look at squarespace.com slash twit.  You can try it free for 15 days.  In fact, if you've got an existing blog on WordPress  or TypePad or Blogger, you can just bring it right over.  They have import tools that'll bring it right over  and you're never stuck.  You can also get your data out of Squarespace.  That's very important too, I think.  It's not, you're never trapped there,  but I think you're gonna love it.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  Now here's the big come on.  Try it out for 15 days.  If you like it, sign up for anywhere from eight to $50 a month  for the full community package  with multiple editors and all that.  And if you use the coupon code twit,  you'll get 10% off that cost for the rest of your life.  The life of your site.  All sorts of great features.  Don't make Facebook your only place on the web.  Even if you just go here and you set up a Squarespace site,  at least do that so that when people want to find you  and they Google you, they find a great site  from Squarespace.com.  Squarespace.com slash twit.  We thank them for their support of this week in tech.  So privacy advocates going crazy this week  because Walmart said we're gonna require RFID tags  in the pants.  Actually in the tag attached to the pants.  And my friend Jeff Jarvis I think wrote a great article  saying, come on, what is the privacy impact of this?  People will know what my pants size is.  What, they're gonna search my garbage for the RFID tag?

Start time: 3240.12
End time: 3271.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is anybody-  There's a key thing in the article.  It says removable tags.  These tags, as I read the story,  are used inside the store to keep track of inventory.  When you buy the pants, they remove the tag.  They're not gonna track you after you leave the store  with the product.  So now another author there commenting on this said,  well, some people have RFIDs in their driver's licenses.  And so-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they're fearing that they'll read those.  But they can, all you have to have  is a different digital code and make the equipment  so it'll only read the code that's appropriate  for inventory control at Walmart.

Transcript:  So somebody has my driver's license  and you're required to hand it over all the time now  when you use a credit card and stuff.  There's this mag strip on the back  that has all the information you need.  All I have to do is swipe it without me noticing,  and they've got everything.  Now, somebody did, I was talking to a friend of mine  who's a security expert, Shaquille,  and he pointed out that on YouTube,  there's a video you can watch about RFIDs in passports.  US has been putting RFIDs in passports for a while.  There's a proof of concept video there  where they use a long-range RFID reader.  And hackers know you can build,  normally RFID, you scan it over something  and it's pretty close proximity.  If you go to McDonald's and you have that instant pay thing,  you have to wave it over the thing.  But apparently you can make long-range readers.  These are, well, your FastTrack, I think,  is something similar.  They're passive devices, but you've got something  that reads it from 10 or 15 feet away.  And apparently, the US uses fairly distinctive numbers  in its RFID.  So they showed people walking through trash cans,  walking around, and inside the trash can is an IED,  a homemade bomb, and a little RFID detector  that just waits for the American citizen to walk by  and then explodes.  That's a little scary.  I don't think it's gonna happen to my Walmart pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, I'm sorry.  No, you go.  Yeah, the issue that privacy people have obviously  is what are the implications for the future  of anything to do with RFID?  And they are constantly concerned  that if we take one step, if we put one toe into the pool,  then we're just gonna get all wet.  There is something to be said for that,  but with tags that are removable,  with very weak signals that are gonna be removed  before we even take the pants out of the store,  it's not that big of an issue.  And we're already using RFID so much in our lives  that we don't even think about, and it's not a security issue.  So I think they take it kind of out of control,  but at the same time, they're also trying to  think towards the future, and that's a good thing as well.

Start time: 3418.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not so worried about Walmart.  Walmart, it's interesting,  because this is not the first time Walmart proposed this.  In fact, I think it was two, three years ago,  Walmart told its suppliers every one of them  was gonna have to have RFID in every item  if they wanted to sell it at Walmart.  I mean, it makes sense.  These guys must have an inventory challenge  that is kind of unimaginable.  And in that case, it wasn't the privacy advocates,  it was the suppliers who said, hell no.  We're not gonna, what are you, crazy?  But I think Walmart's moving close to that.  And I suppose the day may come that they,  I don't know, while you're driving home,  everybody could, a bad guy could see what you bought.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it'll be easy to track anything.  Go ahead, Zahshira.  No, I think it'll be easy to track anything at this point.  And there is definitely inventory issues  at all these types of stores.  I have a family that are in the clothing business,  and you really need to keep track of things  as a store grows more and more  in some place like Walmart.  But then I was interested in the passport thing,  because I would think with immigration,  couldn't that become an interesting thing  if they say we all need to have our passports on us  at all times to see who's legal or not legal?  And you have your RFID that says that.

Start time: 3506.96
End time: 3524.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there is some concern about it.  By the way, they're pointing out in the chat room  that the transponder on your Fast Track  is not the same as RFID.  I didn't mean to imply that.  I'm just pointing out that you can make a reader  that works somewhat similar.  I am told by the bad guys.  And then I love, go ahead, go ahead, Ray.

Start time: 3524.82
End time: 3545.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think what we have to worry about is,  they have a transponder that you can put in your pet now,  inject it, and identify the pet.  Well, now when they start wanting to inject those in people  when you're born, then I'm gonna get worried.  There was a company that was doing that,

They interviewed her in Computer World.  Robin Sage, a figment of security researcher,  Thomas Ryan's imagination,  an attractive 25-year-old woman with an MIT education,  a job at the Naval Network Warfare Command,  and quote, over 10 years, and quote, of hacking experience.  He got friends for Robin Sage,  who shared photos, personal information,  conference invites, and requests to review documents.  Employment nibbles from Google and Lockheed Martin.  The funny thing is, people from the alleged schools Sage  attended wanted nothing to do with her.  People at MIT said they're very cliquey.  Nobody from the CIA or FBI ever linked to her,  despite his attempts.  But she had 226 friends on Facebook,  206 on LinkedIn, and 204 on Twitter.

Transcript:  It brings up an interesting thing, you guys,  because Boston Globe actually released a story,  I think it was on Friday night, about the Pentagon.  They found they were checking out  these kind of child porn sites,  and while they were on their government emails.  So there's obviously something going on  with social networks and these sites,  and people actually logging in when they're online,  so people that work in the government.  And it definitely brings up a security risk,  because then, if there's any,  like if those sites have issues,  or any sort of worms, or things that are messed up,  it could go through the system,  and people could then have access to  government files and everything.

Transcript:  What about-  We never covered the Jessie Slaughter story on here,  which kind of broke a couple of weeks ago,  but I think we have two women on the panel,  and social experts on the panel.  I'm wondering what you think.  This is the 11-year-old girl  who posted a bunch of videos on YouTube,  a couple of them are with her dad  just screaming at her and so forth.  And she ended up being 4chaned,  and her mom says she's at a safe house now,  and an undisclosed location,  we're getting death threats from her.  Shira, did you follow this story,  what do you think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no I did.  I think it's really difficult,  because there's so many teens that obviously,  they have their own kind of personalities online,  and they become a bit viral in their community.  But if you watch this video  that she had on her Tumblr account,  she basically, she was using really bad language,  calling people out saying that she was gonna shoot up,  she was using some sort of really-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think a lot of these teens realize  the repercussions of what they're saying.  Sorry, they create these videos or blogs and posts  with their little community,  and they don't realize that it can venture beyond that.  And so I think what really we need to start creating  kind of an etiquette or kind of guidelines,  and in terms of what people post,  I think parents are gonna become used to  approaching their kids about this type of stuff,  but I think that as kids grow up,  they're just gonna become used to what they can't explain.  It's like you know what strangers are,  or take candy from a stranger,  and they'll learn what to do and what not to do online.

Transcript:  To your point, it's certainly something  that needs to be taken care of by the parents.  It's the new sex talk, I guess.  Yes.  There you go, you're right.  Oh, I agree.  Yeah.  So, but parents need to understand,  maybe there needs to be like a campaign  for educating parents on how to talk.  Maybe we need these videos for parents,  but the parents are the ones that have to be able  to educate their own kids,  and some of that will come by trial and error online.  We're still new to all of this,  so it is at the beginning stages,  and it's gonna be trial and error.

Transcript:  It's kinda sad.  I think there's a similar issue with people  needing to learn how to trust and discern  between different kinds of sources of information online.  So, I mean, you see people passing along  bad information all the time,  and I think that people,  as we get sort of acclimated to the web,  and it's still, I mean, even after 15 plus years,  it's still new for a lot of people,  that how all this stuff works,  and the mechanics of how the web works,  and how information passes along,  and that not all sources are as good as other,  not every source is as good as every other,  are things that people have to learn,  and it takes a little while,  and you have to start to see bad information  get passed along.  I mean, I think this whole,  with the woman from the USDA,  I think that's a perfect example of  a video, an edited video being posted to the web,  and it gets a woman fired,  and then it comes out that the video  had a wider context to it,  and I think that it's a very good example  of the kind of new media skills  that everybody needs to learn,  that you need to not take everything at face value.

So, clearly this dad was more clueless  than his daughter was.  So how is a parent gonna talk about that  if they don't get it?

Start time: 4093.66
End time: 4114.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Good point.  It's like a new media literacy  that people need to learn.  I mean, should schools be teaching  kind of getting to other parents  and having social media people,  like all of us, kind of going into schools  and telling parents really what they should be aware of  and what they shouldn't  and how to react to situations like this properly  so it doesn't become like the laughing stock  of the internet?

Transcript:  I want to mention our friends at Audible briefly,  audible.com.  If you listen to audio programming,  and obviously you are,  you probably already know about audible.com.  God knows we talk enough about it.  It's a great site for people who love listening.  And people who love books, too.  I want to kind of point that out.  Of course, there's 75,000 titles, not just books.  Comedy performances, radio shows, all sorts of stuff.  I love the books.  Mysteries, science fiction, history.  I just finished The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo,  and I have to recommend this.  This is a wonderful book.  Stieg Larsson, actually it's a trilogy.  Stieg Larsson's passed away,  but they call it the Millennium Trilogy.  And there's two more also both on Audible.  The Girl Who Played with Fire,  and The Girl with the Hornet's Nest, I think it is.  It's interesting,  because one of the main characters in this,  there's two characters,  one an elderly middle-aged journalist, roughly my age,  and the other a young 20-something hacker  who is kind of antisocial, but brilliant,  and she helps solve the mysteries in this book.  It's a very, I think a very feminist book.  Any of you read the book?  I really enjoyed it.  The woman is so strong in it,  and it also shows you a Sweden  that is not the clean, sanitized Sweden of our fantasies.  The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo by Stieg Larsson.  But this is just one of, as I said, 75,000 titles.  It's one you can get absolutely free.  In fact, you can get the first two books  in the Millennium Trilogy for free  if you go right now to audible.com slash twit two.  Audible.com slash twit two.  You'll be signing up for the gold account.  That's two, I'm sorry, the platinum account.  I have the gold account, one book a month,  and then there's a platinum account.  Actually, I have the platinum account, two books a month.  And the first two books are free,  yours to keep, you can cancel at any time.  The only problems, picking two books.  There's so many great ones.  My recommendation, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo  and the sequel, The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  Actually, I think The Girl Who Played with Fire  is the second one, then The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest.  Some really great murder mystery novels.  Well written, fascinating,  with some very interesting characters.  But there's much more on here.  Audible.com slash twit two for your iPhone, your iPod,  your Zune, your Kindle, a lot of GPS devices,  over 500 devices.  Audible.com slash twit two.  We thank them so much for their support.

The idea is, by the way,  it's two big time directors doing this,  Kevin McDonald and Ridley Scott.  And so what'll happen is they asked everybody  to shoot what they're up to on July 24th  and then upload the video.  And yes, you have a week, Shira.  And they said upload something that's funny or interesting  or something you really care about.  Not just, it could be mundane, I guess.  They're gonna edit the best of these together.

And hopefully if it's in theaters too,  you'll have the people that are on YouTube in theaters  watching the movie as well.

You also had to answer these questions, what do you love,  what do you fear and what's in your purse or in your pocket?  And so besides actually documenting your day,  you had to answer those questions,  which will be interesting because it'll kind of,  actually they'll splice those up, those like emotions  up into little pieces.

When that video first came out,  we interviewed the guys, the creative,  who had written the commercial at Weedon and Kennedy  and shot it, because we didn't know how they made it.

We talked about it on Security Now,  and if you haven't listened to this week's Security Now,  you probably want to.  The sad thing is there is no fix for this,  and there probably won't be a fix  until Microsoft, at the earliest,  until Microsoft's regular cycle updates  on the second Tuesday of August.  They call it the LNK Zero Day or USB Zero Day.  If you read Microsoft Security Bulletin 228-6198,  it's a vulnerability in the Windows shellcode  that renders shortcut icons.  These are the .LNK files.  This vulnerability has been there for 10 years.  It has survived multiple code reviews.  Remember how Steve Ballmer said,  we are gonna review every bit of code in Windows XP,  and Windows Vista's gonna be the most secure code  we've ever written.  There will not be a single flawless,  and it got right through it, no problem at all.  And bad guys have discovered this attack.  There are already websites that take advantage of it.  The ISC warns, quote,  prepare for extensive attacks of Windows Zero Day.  What happens is you go to a website,  and by the way, PIF files as well can be subverted.  The first samples were on USB keys.  So it was, it would install itself  on a USB key root kit itself  so that nobody could see it.  And then it would copy itself to the next computer  and the next computer,  and every time you used a USB key,  it would copy it to all the computers.  But now it's out there, it's all over the place.  Metasploit, which is a commonly used tool from hackers,  it's in Metasploit.  It's everywhere.  Microsoft's fix for this is to turn off  the shortcut rendering engine.  So that's a quick workaround,  but all your shortcuts,  all your, will suddenly become,  LNK files will suddenly become blank icons.  Siemens already has been infected.  The Siemens SCADA equipment,  which I think is a router, has been infected.  If you want the fix it,  there is a Microsoft fix it tool at 2286198  that disables shortcut icon rendering,  but it is not a long-term fix.  And in fact, it may, I wouldn't be surprised  if it is only a temporary fix as hackers work around that.  So this is a very serious vulnerability.  I talked about it on the radio show,  and I almost don't like to,  because there's nothing you can do.  It's like, sorry.  And if they do bring out a fix,

For one thing, they're trying to think in a more modern way.  Even the iPhone still has this kind of, has this heritage.  And it seems like the designers at Microsoft were told,  look, cut the cord, do something completely different.  And so it's got that Zoom kind of...  They started completely over.  The Metro interface and all that.  Yeah, I like it. Which is really nice.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm very interested.  So, well, we'll see.  Those will be coming out, I think, October or November.
