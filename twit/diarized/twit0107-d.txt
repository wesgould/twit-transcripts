Transcript: Thank you, Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is TWiT, This Week in Tech, episode 107 for July 29th, 2007.  We're gonna need a bigger flywheel.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Audible.com.  For your free audiobook, visit Audible.com slash twit.  It's time to twit, and we have a number of twits and more to come.  I believe Patrick Norton and Robert Heron should be...  In fact, wait a minute here.  I see Robert.  I see Robert on the horn, so let's get him in here.  We haven't talked to Robert in ages.  Also, Patrick Norton should be showing up any day now.  Where Robert goes, there goes.  Patrick, hello, Robert.  Can you hear us?  Hi, can you hear me?  Yes, welcome to This Week in Tech.  Robert Heron with DL.TV as the high-def TV expert for PCMag.  Also here from the great Buzz Out Loud at bol.cnet.com, Molly Wood.  It's good to talk to you.  How old's your baby now, Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is almost five months.  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh man, it seems like it was just the other day you had him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree.  Five months.  Hey, I recognize that laugh.  It's Steve Gibson.  Yay!  From Security Now.  Here on the TWiT Mothership Show.  We love having you on.  In fact, people say all the time, I miss the days when Dvorak and Gibson would have at  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, here we are.  When was that?  The episode, I Get No Spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That was the I Get No Spam episode.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  What do we say?  I don't remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You went off on me because I bounced some email that was aimed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, right, because you used some rinky-dink system to minimize your spam.  I was like, so lame.  Yeah, of course I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep, I was bouncing anything that had HTML and sending a message saying, hey, please  just use text because so much spam is HTML.  That's where this I Get No Spam came from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That technique still works because a lot of the mail now, the bad mail now has GIFs in  it.  Yep.  Do you still do it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I turned off all filtering and we changed our addresses and everything's happy.  Every year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was effective in my complaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And John, inquiring ones want to know, do you still get no spam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I get one piece of spam.  In my box now, let's see, nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Most of my email reading now is just going through the box to delete spam.  That cuts it by about 15%, 20%, and then I just ignore the rest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was getting like half to 70% spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I feel like I'm getting something done because I've deleted the spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You also are having heavy filtering done, Leo.  Oh, I have huge filtering.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if it works for that, can you imagine?  In fact, Leo actually gets no mail.  I get no mail.  I get no mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So there's a lot to talk about.  I think we should probably start at least once again pandering to the audience because  so many people sent me the link to John's article about using a Mac.  John C. Dvorak, is this true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel so alone in the world.  That's all I have to say.  Are you a Windows user now, Molly?  I think I am.  Yeah, and I'm the last unashamed Mac basher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  Now, you know, I haven't changed anything.  I mean, basically, I'm using a Mac.  I went, as you know, we've talked about it before, I'm at Pod Show and they have a, they  asked me what I wanted to use.  And it's a Mac house.  And in fact, the guy who's the head of the, who handles all the individual computers is  a guy who used to work for Apple at the retail level.  And he's a Mac expert.  And they offered me a Mac or a Dell.  You know, I'm thinking first, wow, I'd like to get a, you know, NPC noise.com machine  from those guys up in Washington, which is my favorite computer.  No, no, we do everything with Dell.  Well, okay.  John, what do you think this is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You just write your own ticket here.  You're back in the corporate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm thinking, well, wasn't Dell like sponsoring the Twitch show for a while and then they  bailed out and they took forever to pay us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, no, wait a minute.  They did.  They ran for a few months.  They may come back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They did a quarter.  Okay.  Well, I don't want to kill the deal.  But anyway, I'm thinking, hey, Mac, I'll take a Mac with two screens and I get, you know,  you got two screens.  Oh yeah.  How big?  The newer iMacs run two screens.  Two thirties?  Yeah, we're too big.  No, no, I don't know.  It's in the other screens of some of you Sonic thing.  It's more than enough for power for little old, little old johncdivorek.org slash blah.  So I started using it and I'm playing with it.  You know, I have a few issues here and there and I asked this guy about how do you do this?  This doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you know, it cracks me up is that supposedly if there's such a Mac family, why is Cast  Blaster in Windows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think Adam Curry uses a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ah, that's why.  So Adam is not a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, actually, Adam Bloom, the CEO, doesn't use a Mac either.  The only, it's like everybody else in that office uses a Mac, except for maybe there's  one or two PCs, but they're pretty rare.  And the weird thing is this is what's kind of interesting to me because I'm trying to,  you know, I don't normally work for a living.  So I work in an office once in a while.  And what's odd is that most of the Mac users in these environments where you have an office  with people using a Mac, they mostly use laptop Macs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because the, well, because the power book, the Mac book, sorry, is where it's at  if you're cool.  Yeah, the laptops are pretty good.  I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like the only guy with a big clunking iMac dual screen thing.  Everyone else has got laptops and they move them from here to there and they're just scattered  around.  And I use that little laptop.  I just don't like it that much.  I mean, when I use a Mac, I use a big Mac.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So poor Molly, she's all alone with Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am all alone.  And it's, you know, I used to at least be able to say, yes, it's true.  I'm an unashamed Mac basher, but I have a Mac at home.  So I know what I'm talking about.  Aha.  See, now this is different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have PCs at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I just bought a new Dell laptop and I'm selling my Mac.  I couldn't take it anymore.  What don't you like about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm just stunned.  I know, I hear hyperventilating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel a little sorry and then maybe it's the bathroom.  I primarily used my Mac for the things that Steve told me, Steve Jobs told me that it  would be great for the iLife and the digital media manipulation.  And that drove me absolutely up a wall.  I found that iPhoto was completely unusable and would just crash all the time.  And it was just ludicrous and unbelievable to me that you can't just, I don't know, cherry  pick some photos off of your camera and put them into iPhoto.  You have to load up the whole thing.  And that OS X of all operating systems would not offer some sort of filmstrip view in the  Finder.  Like you can't, if you have a bunch of photos and you just want to scan through them quickly,  you cannot.  I just opened each one in preview and look at it, which is unbelievable.  And I just, I don't know, I just found it too aggravating.  And I found that the most unstable apps on the entire thing were the iLife apps.  Mail, forget it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  iPhoto, forget it.  Did you see the Joy of Tech column or a comic about you, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I have to go check it.  I did read the fake Steve Jobs blog.  Did he talk about you?  Yeah, I'm a frig.  I'm apparently a frig.  You're a frig.  But I don't know what a frig tart is.  Can somebody explain that to me?  What a frig tart is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My son was throwing dirt clods over the fence in our neighbor's yard and the neighbor who's  this crusty old guy got mad and we sent my son over so he could chast time and that chasem.  And that's what he called him.  My son, a real hard time not laughing in his face.  And he came over and came back and said, you know what he called me?  Actually called, called him the another kind of tart.  But anyway, an F tart.  But we said, what?  And he said, actually, that's not unusual.  I think the fake Steve Jobs uses that.  Anyway, it's the Joy of Tech.  And here's, you know, it's Nitro, Zack and Snaggy who do our great album on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That would be my second, my second victory in the Joy of Tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You've been in there several times.  Anyway, in Joy of Tech, just a typical day.  Hell freezes over.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Pigs fly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And of course, this is all illustrated.  Chickens get lips.  Beautiful lips, chickens.  All because John C. Dvorak says, I'm using a Mac.  And surprise, I like it.  But John, you wrote a book about the Mac.  I know you've had, you've been a Mac user for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've been in and out of using the Mac.  It's only the Mac community that thinks I'm a Mac basher.  Yeah.  Hey, by the way, it just proves there's a bunch of psychos over there, which is kind  of disconcerting, to be honest about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Don't believe me.  Windows fanboys can be just as mean, nasty and psychotic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've never run into that.  There just aren't as many of them and they're not as loud.  And they're not as proud.  Yeah, maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, there I am.  How about that?  I'm a Windows fanboy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love Windows.  I don't dislike the thing.  I mean, I never thought I would.  It's very snappy.  That's one thing I like.  It does take a little longer to boot.  I like the fact that the Mac boots and pretends it's booted and it's not.  Well, Windows does that.  Windows invented that.  No, Windows doesn't do anything not like this.  Oh, come on.  No, Windows invented that.  The screen comes right up.  I mean, with Windows, you got that stupid logo with that little thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, but Microsoft, Microsoft, you'll get your desktop there.  You'll get your desktop there and then click on something.  Nothing happens because there's still 18 different things that have to start up.  That's that's but anyway, it's all operating systems do that.  This is sysadmin day, by the way.  So kiss a sysadmin today.  Actually was the last Friday of July.  So this is airing a couple of days later.  Eight annual system administrator appreciation day.  And actually, I got a Intel sent me a Starbucks, a $5 Starbucks card.  Actually think you're a sysadmin.  Well, I'll be honest, they sent it to Patrick Norton.  Care of me.  What does that tell us?  I'm confused.  They guess apparently they think Patrick is a sysadmin and that he has my address.  So I don't know what the heck.  But I guess apparently Intel sent out, I don't know how many, but quite a few.  I think that's a nice thing to do.  It's not you know, that's one Quinti Vente latte, but the Steve Gibson Steve Gibson  beverage.  Yep.  Other big stories today.  Gosh, there's so many.  I don't know exactly where to start.  We could talk with we can do a reprise of this Google story that we did last week.  You weren't here for this, Molly, nor Steve nor Robert.  But John and I were talked a little bit about Google's announcement that they would buy  megahertz spectrum auction if they had some conditions, if it were an open auction, if  anybody could buy into it, if ISPs could buy in wholesale.  A number of stipulations at the FCC is highly unlikely to agree to.  I want to correct myself, by the way.  Apparently at one point confused the 700 megahertz spectrum, which is a UHF spectrum with the  VHF spectrum.  I know they're different.  So this is the VHF spectrum.  All right, right.  I'm sorry.  See, I did it again.  This is the UHF spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So what's the presumption that Google wants the spectrum for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's what we were talking about last week.  That's the fun part.  My hope is that they want to kind of get in a competition against the wireless companies  and do their own wireless thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Correct me if I'm wrong, but it seemed that it was kind of an altruistic move on their  part where they were they were basically going to buy it and free it up.  True for open use rather than, you know, just simply corporatizing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly.  It seems kind of unlikely to me that it would be a truly altruistic move, though.  I mean, you know, there's got to be money made, but there's got to be money made.  They've got the dark fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems to me that when you're done talking amongst yourselves, I'll tell you what's  going on.  Oh, please.  Now, wait a minute.  OK, hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hold on.  Let's discuss it.  Then John can tell us the truth.  Verizon doesn't like this idea.  They said the spectrum is not as valuable if it's open.  So, I mean, on the face of it, it sounds altruistic.  You think that Google has a secret plan?  Not you, John.  I know you know.  I'm asking Molly.  Then you could talk to her.  Right.  It saves the truth for later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know that it's necessarily super secret.  I mean, Google also has a bunch of dark fiber.  I think they are probably trying to create a more competitive landscape, but I think  they're probably doing that by, you know, creating their own network, running their  own devices on it.  Who knows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'd love to see them undermine Verizon and AT&T.  Verizon doesn't want any open access.  But interestingly, seeing that the commissioner, Kevin Martin, and most of the commissioners  are in support of some form of open access, both AT&T and Verizon have said, oh, okay,  I think the Google thing scared them.  We'll live with the official FCC version.  I'm not sure exactly how what the FCC wants is different from what I think Google's is  just more extensive.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin Martin said he only wants to open up about a third of the spectrum.  I see.  He said that he opposes the idea of it being sold wholesale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Wholesale licensing, yeah.  That's what Google wants.  Wholesale prices allowing ISPs to interconnect freely to the network at any technically feasible  point, which admittedly sounds a little bit like a Jerry Rigg kind of solution.  In any event, I hope Google, look, it doesn't look like Google's going to get what they  want, but I hope Google can live with these, not exactly the same rules, but at least some  openness.  I think the FCC will at least require some openness on this, which is good.  It sounds like a good compromise.  All right.  Now, John C. Dvorak, what's really going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, if you read today's news, and by the way, I have a column on this exact same subject  running in MarketWatch, which runs today.  It's probably up now.  Oh, look at it.  Oh, I'm sorry.  We're actually, this comes out on Sunday.  So it will be up by now.  Yeah.  So cut that out.  Anyway, so there's MarketWatch column from last week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm thinking about moving our tape data Sunday, by the way, because this happens all the time  where John's plugs are...  I don't think anybody cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But there's a story in today's financial news that's apparently Google and Sprint are now  doing some sort of a secret deal.  This is a separate thing.  Yeah, they're going to do a Wimax thing.  A separate thing is a separate thing.  Is it really a separate thing?  Because if anybody remembers back in the late 1990s, Sprint had a thing called Sprint Broadband  Connect, which is what I use, which is the point to point ISP that they decided to kill.  It was microwave.  It was microwave.  And I still have the gear.  And they work kind of.  It was about 750 megabits.  It was 750k bits per second, is the best I could get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  MMDS, I think, was what they called it.  Microwave distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe.  Anyway, the point is that it seems to me that ever since the early of last year, 2006, when  that kind of bonehead CEO of AT&T mouthed off about Google getting a free ride and we  should probably charge them more money because they're making money off of our network, as  OIA invented the internet, I think that freaked Google out.  And I think from that point on, Google was looking for a defensive series of moves that  they could make that would protect them from ever really getting screwed by AT&T.  Because if AT&T wanted to, we all know, they could have set up a search engine system of  some sort and kind of put a break on Google search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree with you.  I think this is Google's response to net neutrality.  Now here's what the long term thing is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They want to be their own backbone.  Yeah.  So Google decides to do this.  Now they bring out an aggressive price because they can supplement things all kinds of different  ways and they're making tons of money.  They could give it away for crying out loud.  They give everything away.  They could if they wanted to.  Now, so let's say that Google and Sprint already knows how to do this kind of thing.  So Sprint is their partner now.  So it's a Google Sprint network or a Sprint Google network, whatever we're going to be  fans of, which dog is on top.  Spruigle, I like that.  And so now instead of turning, instead of having AT&T put the screws to Google, Google  can now put the screws to AT&T saying, look, I think we're going to take our search off  your system altogether.  And what we're going to do is that Comcast is going to have Google search and Sprint  Google is going to have Google search, but you're not going to have it unless you pay  us.  It's the kind of way that it works in the cable TV business where one guy takes over  and the other guy says, well, you have to pay to be on our network.  No, no, you have to pay to take us kind of thing.  It goes back and forth.  So Google can really put, unless between now and 2009, some other search engine comes up  that's worth the crap, Google could really put the screws of these guys and make them  pay to put Google on their thing.  Anyway, I think that's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then on top of that, I think in order to not restrict their delivery at all, they  would, I think that they essentially want to be their own backbone to set up their own  network, whether it be the dark fiber network or on the 700 MHz spectrum.  Yeah, so that they're, they guarantee delivery no matter what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The key is that they would have a big network themselves that they could fall back on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But why do they need Sprint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well the interesting thing about the Sprint deal is not just the WiMAX thing actually.  It's that it is, it's Sprint being open to third party applications like Verizon and  AT&T have refused to be.  So Sprint is basically saying kind of for the first time that Sprint customers will  be able to use Google apps like Google Talk.  They've even kind of hinted around like maybe they would let people use Skype on Sprint  phones.  So it is kind of Sprint getting on, seeing which way the wind is blowing in terms of  them not being able to have the same sort of exclusive...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Sprint's done this.  Sprint has been an ISP.  Sprint knows how to do this.  You know, instead of starting from scratch...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well AT&T has been an ISP.  Verizon is an ISP right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but I'm saying Sprint has been one.  If you're going to partner with somebody, you're not going to partner with these guys  who are trying to screw you like AT&T.  So you partner with Sprint, one of the enemies of AT&T, and you can go from there.  And the fact of the matter is...  It's a clever move by Sprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a clever way to say, hmm, when we see the business changing, maybe we should quickly  shift alliances.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you know, there's a merger in the works if you think about it too.  I mean, there's no reason that those two companies can't join hands, although I can't see the  car cultures working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, does Google need Sprint?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I guess if Google buys the 700 megahertz spectrum, do they start making devices?  Do they start making phones or web devices of some sort?  I mean, it's crazy, but...  They let Sprint do it.  Yeah, they can collaborate on hardware like Google branded hardware or Google Sprint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Something's up.  Something's up.  I might be a dissenting opinion and just think that this Sprint Google thing is a sideshow.  And just some sort of alliance that isn't really relevant to the long term.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything's relevant, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everything's relevant.  Google has a master plan.  Well, we know that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Boy, I'll tell you, if you wanted to...  Sounds like somebody's opening the master plan box to look what's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can I add one more thing here?  Yes.  You know, and I do all these analyses of Google and some of the things they do.  And the curious thing about it is those guys never invite me to any one of their events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You say this every darn show, John.  Isn't that unbelievable?  Maybe they don't like you.  I don't know.  Isn't that ludicrous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They enjoy a tech for crying out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, now maybe they will now that you're in a comic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they won't.  Never happen.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No, they won't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They'll never invite me.  I want to ride those Segways from one building to another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I didn't even know they had things.  That's how uninvited I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They do.  They have things.  They have a big Christmas party and they invite most of the media, but they don't invite certain  people that they hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  You know why they hate us too?  Because of that news.com story about Eric Schmidt.  I didn't even know.  Oh, yeah.  You're Cnet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You're dead meat.  You're history.  Cnet.  No Cnet reporter will ever darken Google's door.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I used to work for Cnet, so it's possible that's why I'm on that list.  They think...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you know what it is?  They think that ZDNet is Cnet.  And so they're just confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They should just Google it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's move on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think that's probably the most interesting story of the year probably, and I'm very curious  to see what happens as it develops.  But here's another story.  Nevada's governor accidentally posts the password to his Outlook email on his website.  By the way, his username is Governor.  His password...  By the way, this is Kenny C. Gwynn.  Is it spelled with a U or an O?  No, it's just spelled normally.  G-O-V-E-R-N-O-R.  Kenny C. Gwynn, the Republican, the governor of Nevada.  His password, Kenny C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, see, that's the funny thing.  Kenny C. is the former governor.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the former governor.  The current governor is Jim Gibbons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new governor is Jim A. Gibbons, and they couldn't even be bothered to change the password.  So it's the old...  Poor Jim.  From Kenny's password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This shows you that Jim never uses Outlook because he wouldn't be typing Kenny C. when  he logs in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He would think not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He wouldn't really want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although he is also Republican.  Or the field has just saved.  Pardon me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Or they just saved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  It just saved and he just hits return.  It's just a bunch of stars to him.  He doesn't know it's Kenny C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jimmy doesn't do any typing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They posted this file on a Microsoft Word file giving step-by-step instructions on how  the aides should send out the governor's weekly email updates on their website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is so sad.  Oh, it's sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  People that govern us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These are the people who are now calling for universal internet filtering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that's right.  Congress now...  Now, who...  This was at the end of the day.  Somebody just stepped up.  Or was it a big group of Congress people's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was at the end of a...  It was the end of a...  Session.  Of a hearing...  A set of hearings that they had on the whole problem.  And of course, it was our wonderful Ted...  What's his name?  From Alaska.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ted Stevens.  Mr. Stevens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's one of us from that band.  Not a truck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not a truck.  We ought to filter it.  Just like a sewage plant filtering the sewage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so funny too because they're talking about the problem of child porn, which is  obviously, you know, photos of children being posted on the internet.  And then they're talking about protecting the children from internet predators, which  to my mind are two entirely different things.  No, it's all the same.  And they're mixing them all together.  And it's like, we know how well internet filtering works.  I mean, you just, you can't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Commerce Committee Chairman Daniel K. Nua of Hawaii, Democrat.  Ted Stevens, the Senate Commerce, Science and Transportation Vice Chairman, Republican  Alaska, argued the internet is a dangerous place where parents alone will not be able  to protect their children.  So the government's going to do it for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is someone going to come out of the screen?  It's going to come and get you.  Thank you, Ted.  Like a horror movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's terrifying about this is the idea of Congress trying to literally take the protection  of children out of the hands of parents.  Right.  Like just send them all to a little government run camp, I guess, where they'll be protected.  The good news is we can completely ignore this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's unconstitutional.  It'll never happen.  They can't even get a, you know, copa through the Supreme Court.  I don't think that there's any chance.  This is just grand.  You sound like the salami.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Copa, copa cola.  I know what's what I thought too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ooh, delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I am starving.  Hey, Robert Heron must be following this with interest.  This HD DVD versus Blu-ray.  Another blow against HD DVD.  Target says it won't carry anything but the Blu-ray players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And apparently that's just completely false.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that story is completely false.  I was about to say that.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, it jumped out.  I mean, immediately the HD DVD group came back and said that it's simply a case of the Blu-ray camp  buying an end cap within all Target stores throughout the holidays.  All right.  So this is getting, this is a vicious battle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did have to admit though that Target only sells the HD DVD.  They sell a Toshiba player, but only on target.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I was in a Target store about a week ago and they had both formats available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And Blockbuster only sells, only rents Blu-ray though, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Unless you go online and then you get either one.  Okay.  And Netflix sells both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to say that unfortunately the Toshiba HD DVD player, which I own, is just a piece of junk.  Which one do you have?  I've got the latest, the second generation.  The HD2?  What is it?  I don't know.  Anyway, I mean, it's running Linux.  It's got all the new Linux licenses in the back of the manual.  And you turn it on and it's like, you know, John was talking, I don't remember if it was before we were recording or not,  about how long it takes the Mac to boot.  And I mean, this thing, it's like all of the way a consumer would hope their appliance works is just gone.  You press the door open button and literally a minute can go by.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You must have the first generation.  It's better now, isn't it Robert?  Because the latest gen doesn't run Linux and the latest gen, it's granted, boot up times on both set-top boxes are pretty slow, no doubt.  However, once it's fired up, you know what the funny thing is?  The fastest Blu-ray and HD DVD players are the game consoles.  Right, because they're powerful computers.  They both start up in about 15 seconds and disk access times are zippy.  Because they're powerful computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm on Target.com and they list the Toshiba player as available online but not in stores.  And then what the HD DVD guy said is that they sell the Xbox HD DVD player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, right. I'm not sure about what set-top boxes they sell, but as far as the disks from movies, they still have both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they still have both, but they only sell the one player and it's the Xbox one.  So it is sort of, I mean, obviously the HD DVD camp was going to have to say, no, it's not that bad, but it's sort of bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But HD DVD also said that they have similar deals in place with like Circuit City and other...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why would Target do that?  I'm sure they were paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I think they probably just want to start selling stuff.  Like they want to get into the game and pick a side, I would think.  It's just very odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he's right. They were paid off.  Paid off, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And it's a different... it probably sets them apart a little bit from the Walmart who went with the HD DVD camp for the low prices for the set-top players in addition to the players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's just a vicious battle up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unfortunately, it is the case that it seems if you believe the reports, Blu-ray's numbers are substantially higher than HD DVDs.  Disks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  However you want to spin that, if you look at just set-top box players, according to even CNET's own article that's online right now...  1.5 million to...  It's only a third.  No, but it's 50% more HD DVD set-top players than Blu-ray players sold if you ignore the game console.  If you take out PS3.  Yeah.  It's only a third of the...  I'm agnostic and I just don't care about either form.  I use them both. I love them both. I have both players. It's just... enjoy.  There's no difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, Patrick Norton is now in the house swelling this panel to a vast six people.  Hello, Patrick.  Hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the frightening number of Twits?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We've never had so many Twits in the same room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, we have at the legendary live Apple show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, which shall live forever.  In infamy.  In infamy.  Yeah, you're right. We had... that was a too big a panel.  This is too big a panel, but everybody's going to get a turn to talk here.  Were you on that one, Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think so. I was on an Apple and I got to sit next to Steve Wozniak. It was very exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, that was fun. That was at the Apple Store. Yeah.  By the way, I made a mistake. I said Molly was alone and the only Windows user. No, it's not true.  In fact, according to Steve Ballmer, there will be a billion machines running Windows by the end of the year.  One billion machines.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does that include like OS 7 and the Apple IIs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm sure it includes everything they can count.  One billion machines. Does something happen when that magic number...  Is there critical mass? Does the world blow up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think Ballmer buys a big white fluffy cat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ballmer makes such good copy. What was the latest thing he said?  We are not going to be defeated in online ads.  We will be victorious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why are they even in online ads?  The company has been a failure in advertising since it began with all those online magazines and then Microsoft's sidewalk and one thing after another.  So now because Google is doing it, we have to do it.  More than that, I think this is part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, they even said this at the analyst's day that this is part of their transformation into a software plus services company.  They are looking at what Google is doing and they say we want to be there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they sure are serving OS patches quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What friend of the show dumped Google ads in favor of Microsoft ads?  Mr. Dig. Big. That's a big acquisition, I guess, for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't drop Google ads. They dropped federated media.  Google also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google also. Now, that's Facebook and Dig are both using Microsoft's ad platform.  Now, you got to figure Microsoft. Well, that's the thing.  You got to figure Microsoft said we'll give you 100 percent of all revenue for the next two years.  Yummy profit. Yeah, or something.  The problem Google's always had with its ads is they won't disclose what percentage of the money they're getting they're giving to the advertising.  There's not much.  And I have a feeling it probably isn't a very big percentage.  That's why they don't disclose it.  Microsoft might be more transparent about that.  Or maybe maybe they just say not we'll give you more money.  Does it really matter if they do context sensitive ads?  Do you as a as a website reader care who's serving the ad?  I've always found the ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Say again, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've always found the superior targeting of Google ads more relevant to me as a website consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google ads are terribly targeted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, I'm not the only one that just strips every ad out of every web page I visit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do you use ad block for Firefox?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I've run into one too many times where there's an ad server that's bogging down the rendering of a page that just drives me nuts when I'm in a hurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, there was a story in the somewhat alarmist story in The Wall Street Journal the other day about viruses now and in web ads, very alarming web ads and being launched on your system without you taking any action.  That's got to strike a little bit of fear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Steve and I talked about that on Security Now this week.  It's happened both to Tom's Hardware and to MySpace.  MySpace, when it happened to MySpace, they estimated a million people got infections from just from this.  That's how it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And aren't these sites also with the little lock our website is protected and checked and verified to be safe?  Needs nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, that's how it works. I want to know how it works.  Steve Gibson.  That whole hacker safe logo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve Gibson, explain how these ads can infect you.  Well, Leo and I were talking on Security Now that even a responsible site like Tom's Hardware, you'd think, OK, well, you know, isn't there something that they could do except that the way third party ads work is the page that their server is serving contains sort of a generic URL to someone else's server, to the advertising content provider's server.  So what happens is the page goes to the user's browser.  The browser parses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, Steve.  Can you start over?  Let's see. I'm on Tom's Hardware.  Now, where does this begin?  There's a little ad that's being served.  That banner ad, that graphic, that jumping monkey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it a flash ad or a regular ad?  Any kind of ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It certainly has to involve and exploit an unpatched or unknown exploit in the OS.  For example, there have been some for just JPEG files.  We're just displaying a JPEG on your machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait, I just want to get the architecture of this correct.  I've got, let's say, my page, devork.org slash blog.  OK.  Now, let's say I've got a little ad on the left hand side that somebody bought.  Is that thing itself just when someone's looking at my blog page serving evil things into a reader?  It could, yes.  Someone has to click on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.  The idea is just the process of rendering the image, if the image rendering code has any flaws and those are discovered.  Just the process of displaying the image on your web browser will allow malicious code to run in your machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So this is what happened on MySpace and on Tom's.  You just go to MySpace, that ad banner that's there could carry an infection.  And in fact, it did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's Google thinking that they've got this sort of foolproof model.  Like we'll get into, you know, Microsoft's busy patching their operating system all the time.  We'll just do this advertising thing.  We don't have to worry about viruses and all that.  All of a sudden they have a huge security issue on their hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, if they serve text ads, it's not a problem.  Let me ask one more question here to Steve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What if you're using a Mac?  Nope, you're safe.  You're safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you're using a Mac or Windows 98, you're probably safe.  Or Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, it's targeted at Windows machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When I was hearing Leo talk about the billion Windows machines, I couldn't help thinking, yes, a billion infectable platforms.  Woohoo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The hackers are going, yeah, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One billion machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yes, John, you're probably a lot safer over on a Mac because it's still currently not nearly a target of the likes of Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what is the, well, we saw if Tom's hardware and what was it, MySpace or Second Life or whatever it was?  MySpace.  Yeah, I guess this is something to be concerned about.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and my point was that those sites are really, they're not able to do anything to prevent this unless they were to fetch the ads, run it through some AV, assuming that the AV knew about this particular exploit, and then they serve it themselves to the user's browser.  But of course, that's not the traditional third party model.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, let me ask one more question then.  Let's say you're selling ads on your website, Tom's hardware, let's say, and within the contract, it makes it very stipulate, stipulates very strongly that if anything like, if you're doing anything like this as an advertiser, you're liable for some sort of damages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And we, Leo and I also talked about that.  The problem is that the advertisers themselves are, are allowing images to be uploaded from clients.  So all the advertisers, of course, the advertiser doesn't themselves create the images.  They're just a third party aggregator for all the images, the ads from their clients.  So you could argue that even the advertiser can't be responsible for the virility of, of its own ads because they're just accepting ads from their clients, storing them on their server and then redistributing to the web sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's exactly what happened is that these systems are often automated.  So the, the ad server that was on MySpace and Tom's hardware was automated.  Somebody just bought an ad.  They didn't validate the person and put it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think you can have an indemnity clause in a contract like that that would cover them.  I mean, it would seem to me that these guys have to push it one step further and push it out farther.  So you keep this from happening.  It sounds the way you're describing it.  This is a disaster.  Potentially.  And it sounds like one to me.  Potentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is, I think this is the first chink that I have heard about in Google's armor that, that seems legitimately dangerous to them from, from two perspectives.  One is the ad serving platform perspective because it's terrifying to think that you might be receiving ads that are infected.  But the other is from the search perspective, because if we find ourselves in a situation where you can only go to a few trusted websites, then what do you need search for?  Let me, let me underscore that this has not happened to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This isn't a Google problem.  It was another ad service that was doing this and Google's text ads are not vulnerable.  It would only be image based ads or worse ads that had JavaScript, which many do, unfortunately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And JavaScript and a lot of advertisers actually want JavaScript in place so they can actually track.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  You want JavaScript to track the true numbers.  But what would this, is there any way of doing this with Flash?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Not that any, not that I know of there.  I don't know.  I don't think of any Flash exploits out there right now.  We're going to see it.  You know what we're going to see and I have a feeling we'll see exploits.  We're going to see, I think a quick move to Flex, which is Adobe's new Flash like platform.  That's really a Java killer.  And I think you see Flex everywhere on the net.  You're already seeing it in a lot of places.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's Microsoft's, you know, wannabe?  Silverlight.  Oh, that's right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But, and this is, you know, Steve and I have this battle on security now because Steve says turn off all scripts.  No scripting.  That's a problem inherently.  And he's right.  It is inherently a security issue.  But I say, but then you're turning off all the functionality of the new web.  I mean, all of that stuff, Ajax and all require scripting.  Yeah.  Back to carved tablets.  Yeah, that's safe.  Nobody ever got a virus.  You could hurt yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You hit yourself with a hammer.  This is my new slogan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No one ever got a virus from papyrus.  I think this is, this is the thing.  We should be pushing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure that because most papyrus is made from sheep skin and there's an anthrax issue here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or bovine encephalitis you could get, you know.  Hey, I love this.  Remember the LifeLock ad where the CEO comes on and says, this is my social security number.  I am protected by LifeLock.  Hack me.  He got hacked.  I love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seemed like a doctor.  It hurts when I do this.  Stop doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is a company that sells identity theft protection that basically bundles stuff that you could do for yourself for free.  But these ads were very compelling because the guy comes, comes on and said, let me, let me tell you, I'm protected by LifeLock.  In fact, I'm so confident.  I'm going to give you my social security number.  So, so, so this guy, somebody took out a $500 loan using the guy's social security number.  Wow.  But worse, worse.  The CEO showed up at the fraudsters house with a film crew and coerced a confession out of the guy.  The police say the guy is mentally disabled and that destroys their case because it's an illegal confession.  So now they have no plans to arrest the guy.  He's off scot-free.  Thanks to LifeLock.  Wow.  He's safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they went through all that trouble for a $500 ripoff.  Well, I can go buy a Blu-ray player now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  I like to, Devorak got a bit of a scoop.  You were sitting in a Giants game with the CEO of Seagate, Bill Watkins.  And we've been talking a lot on Twitter about the hybrid.  I know I feel bad about it now.  This is the idea is it's a hard drive that uses both disk and solid state.  Is that the idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, a hybrid hard disk.  Yeah, it's got a flash memory, typically.  And up to for the desktops, I was told it's going to be like a gigabyte or more or two.  And then for the laptops, it's like $250, $300.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is this the ReadyDrive stuff that's from Vista?  No, this is kind of like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is the real hybrid hard disk is all part.  And I was told by these guys a couple of years ago by the experts, including Seagate people,  that Microsoft Vista is like designed for these disks.  It's going to increase the performance.  It's going to do all this cool stuff.  And so then I get Watkins and he's telling me, you know, it's Vista's got all these issues.  And actually, that's the little thing I posted on my blog, that little video,  is only part of the whole chat I had with him.  I'll tell you what else he said.  Anyway, first he says that, you know, that Vista is so screwed up that it doesn't work that well  with these hybrid hard disks to begin with, even though they're supposed to.  And so they have to wait for that fix, which is a year away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because SP1 is not coming out this year.  Yeah, so they say that SP2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to admit, the only thing more annoying than my Mac is Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The truth comes out that you guys don't like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't work good.  It's buggy. It's slow.  It doesn't work well.  It's pretty.  I know, but it's funnier if I say work good.  Like think different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  So anyway.  I've got no issues with it, but I'm a freak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So anyway, he went on and he said that the real winner for these hybrid hard disks  is going to be people like Google and all these other operations.  Google again. Google wins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know. How does Google always win?  I want to buy more Google stock.  Dane, buy me some more Google stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says that with these disks, they save so much energy because they work on a laptop to save energy, right?  Save battery life.  They save so much energy in a server farm that he says you could take and fill the place up with terabyte hybrid hard disk  and throw away all the 500 megabyte hard disk and all the drives that are in there currently  and almost make it up overnight in what you'd save in energy.  Turn off the AC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The idea is that the turns out the access patterns of hard drives is, as we know, much more reading than writing.  And the distribution is such that you have the distribution is such that you're also reading the same stuff much more than you're reading everything.  So if you have a sufficiently large cache, then that is in the drive, then it's able to hold the stuff.  Most people are wanting to read most of the time, allowing the drive to spin down.  And if that's non volatile, then you're able to also to accept writes.  And it's only as that begins to get full that the drive says, oh, I better flush this now large non volatile memory onto magnetic so that it's it's really secure.  So the idea is that the duty cycle of the drive spinning is reduced dramatically.  So the drive is no longer hot because it doesn't spin enough.  It's almost like a giant ram cache then.  Yeah, exactly. It sort of spins up, dumps the cache and then spins down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, we shouldn't confuse this with solid state drives.  In fact, Alienware and I don't Patrick, have you guys seen or reviewed these as now shipping laptops, gaming laptops?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's been there's been solid state hard drive shipping and laptops, mostly from more sort of vertical commercial vendors for like a year.  It's really expensive still, right?  Oh, it's extremely expensive.  Yeah, the capacity considerably lower than what you're going to get at a rotating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So these are the these are the Area 51 and the Aurora notebooks.  They'll have this what they call SSD or solid state drive options, but they're not huge.  You have you could get a I think it's a 32 or a 64 gig drive and the 32 gig.  I'm sorry, the 64 gig is in raid zero, which is kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a little strange.  Would it be faster or just more efficient?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Your awesome.  What say again, Robert?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Boot times would just be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So these are faster than hard drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Some of them are not faster than the hard drives.  They should be faster than hard drives, but some of them we've seen are a little mediocre in their performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so the problem is that the technology of the non volatile memory is still so slow, even by comparison to hard drives.  So they are faster than.  And yet the other thing if you do a study and you zero the the amount of time required by the drive,  I know it's like Windows still spends so much time just organizing itself that even if you remove all of the read time,  you still have a substantial boot time because it turns out the drives are not any longer,  really that much slower than all the nonsense that Windows is going through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Remember on the screensavers, Patrick, we kept trying to make a giant RAM hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We made it.  I mean, we've done it.  We finally got it working.  Yeah, I mean, but I used to use I mean, we used to use RAM drives like, you know, on.  I remember my Duo 280X, I could get a big heap in the battery life edition by doing a RAM drive in my 12 megabytes of RAM on the notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So instead of 15 minutes, you got 18 minutes of battery time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you would get the email of gigabytes, some impossible number of gigabytes of RAM at the time for anybody other than a server, you know, farm into four days.  Yeah, yeah, four gigs or more cash every the entire operating system in the RAM.  You have this insane performance boost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm still old enough that I remember when going into a egghead store and the guy at the counter talking about having eight megabytes of RAM.  Two megs for the operating system, two megs for cash, disk cash.  And you never fill that up.  Two megs for flash, a RAM drive, and I guess two megs for applications.  And you'd never fill that up. Eight megabytes.  So to follow in our continuing saga of all of MP3, it looks like it's finally coming to a crashing close.  The prosecutors in Russia are demanding jail time for Denis Kovasov, the owner of all of MP3 for massive copyright infringement.  I wonder what happened to all the royalties that they've been putting aside for the artists at all of MP3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they're being nice boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they got a really nice boat.  Prosecutor has asked the court to sentence Kovasov to three years in prison and ordered him to pay 15 million rubles to EMI, Warner and Universal.  Fifteen million rubles is like $12.98.  But it's a lot in Russia.  Anyway, that's the end of all of MP3.  That just shows how badly Russia wants to join the World Trade Organization.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One that's not the end of all of MP3 because they basically flipped the entire operation to another URL.  The MP3 Sparks, is that running?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MP3 Sparks, it's still running, apparently.  It is reportedly run by the former operators of all of MP3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Kovasov is gone, but they just kept the code and they continue to take money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's not in prison yet, Leo. It is all far from over.  He's not over yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mousen Squirrel could take over.  He could still flee.  He could flee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He could show all Leo voices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mousen Squirrel.  Let's see, a 22-year-old intern who is being held responsible for giving up the Social Security numbers of 7% of the entire state of Ohio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, not giving up, losing.  Losing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And he's also, he's saying he's the scapegoat.  Well, he says he's a scapegoat because he says, this is actually a fascinating article at blorg.com, tech.blorg.com.  He says, the extent of my instructions and what to do after I removed the backup tapes with all of these Social Security numbers on them  and took the tapes out of the building was, bring them back tomorrow.  So he left them in the car, unencrypted.  They were stolen.  And then this is good.  I'm sure somebody's getting in trouble for this.  The intern says that the $125 an hour consultant told him not to tell the police that sensitive information had been stolen,  which is why he was the prime suspect for the theft in the first place.  It's just some tapes.  Nothing on there.  It's my Barry Manilow collection.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where are the laws making that a crime?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Stealing Barry Manilow tapes.  No, just playing them.  That's a crime.  He left 100,000 Social Security numbers left in his car parked outside his apartment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Who would steal?  I guess they just must be emptying his car.  Typically they steal your radio or something.  They thought they were cassettes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I've heard that thieves increasingly are looking for identity information specifically.  So they look for laptops in the back of cars.  They look for anything that looks like it might be like a computer thing in the hopes that there will be personal information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I still think they thought they were Barry Manilow tapes.  They didn't know.  Hope Springs Eternal.  Those things look like, no, they probably thought they were videotapes, right?  Because they look like, well, they look like DV tapes, don't they?  Nowadays.  I guess so.  Tape drive?  Tape drive.  Tape backups, like the DLTs.  One in five online Americans view video on the internet in any given day.  Thanks to Patrick Norton and John C. Dvorak and Molly Wood.  It's your fault.  Thank goodness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank goodness they're all watching you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because we're promoting the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because you do it.  Remember that thing called Cranky Geeks?  That's what they're watching.  Oh.  DL.TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wish one in five adults would be watching that show.  That would be an easy street.  CNET TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In a typical day, 19% of you, this is another one of those Pew, I love the name, Pew Internet and American Life projects.  I think the Pew stuff stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Pew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Just remember, no one ever got a virus from papyrus.  No, that's not true.  Half of video viewers, 18 to 29 watch clips on YouTube.  15% cite MySpace, but only 7% turn to a cable or network TV site.  How much of this happens at work?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's another study we saw.  What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  20% of their work day is spent dicking around, basically.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have no doubt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hate those stories though, because 20% of the people that watch this show, they're watching it.  Because 20% of your work day is spent dicking around no matter what you're doing.  No matter what?  That's what the water cooler's for.  Yeah, it doesn't matter if it's fantasy football or if it's something with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have an anecdote related to this.  You know, Philippe Bacan, remember him?  Oh yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's still, you know, he's done very well, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he's done better out of the computer business than he did in.  But he had this thing to tell, he told me this thing once.  He says, you know, the problem these people have in these offices is that, yeah, people are on the internet a lot,  and they're doing a lot of their home shopping by going to Amazon.  But he says normally in an office environment, they'd be sneaking off work,  and it would take them a lot longer to go buy a book at a store than it would to click a one-click buying on Amazon.  Good point.  It's actually a more efficient world to have them be doing all this stuff at work.  Otherwise they're at Benihana or somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Long luncheons.  I agree with that 100%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You think it's still the case that people wait to go to work to use the internet  because their connections at home are still so slow?  Not so much anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Remember that the Black Friday for the internet, you know, the biggest shopping day of the year,  which used to be the Monday after Thanksgiving because everybody would go back to work and shop.  And the last few years, it's been just as the brick and mortar stores, it's been the Friday after Thanksgiving.  Right.  They're home.  They're home shopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mm-hmm.  I think people just wait to get to work because they get up late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I just miss those power lunches we used to have at Tech TV, the four hours of blowfish sushi.  Oh, those are the good old days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I never got to go to any of those.  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, you were working on the show.  See, I was in between calling.  Leo, Leo, be quiet.  Mom's the word.  We once had a make-a-wish kid.  This is the kid, I guess he actually was fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, it's not going to end well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know.  Already it's a bad start.  Saki, it was awesome.  Already it's a bad start.  He's like 10 or 11.  He's like baseball.  He had been very seriously ill, but the good news was he's feeling fine, but still he had a wish.  And his wish was to come to the Screensavers.  You don't remember this, Patrick?  Well, that I remember.  And then they took us all out to Blowfish and we had a huge sushi bill.  I didn't get to go to Blowfish.  That's because you said you could make, I don't know what, a hard drive out of a Frisbee,  and you hadn't finished it yet, so you had to do that.  He was still silver coating the Frisbee, and we all went to Blowfish.  That's why.  Yeah.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's okay.  He wanted to go to lunch with Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought Blowfish was a little expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It was very expensive, but it was good.  It's okay.  Hey, John, you seem like the type.  Have you ever had Blowfish, real Blowfish, Fugu?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In Japan I did once.  That's the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If it's not perfectly prepared, it'll kill you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they have their license.  It's really not that dangerous, but it tastes like halibut.  Chicken.  You find one of these.  The chicken of the sea.  You find a good sushi bar that has a good halibut,  and they can slice it just like Fugu.  I don't think the taste is that much different.  So there you go.  Fugu makes your mouth a little numb.  So I think if you have some halibut and maybe some Novacaine.  There you go.  You mix them up and you just put the Fugu.  I think you'd have the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's interesting.  So the mouth numbing is actually the nerve poison,  but there's just not enough to kill you.  I think it's throughout the meat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  And it's just concentrated in the gallbladder or some little thing,  and if that's concentrated, if you have that, you'll drop dead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, there's a bird that lives in caves that makes its nest  entirely out of saliva.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, then they make it.  That's where birch nest soup comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Somebody's been watching Planet Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes!  By the way, that is a tasty soup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I'm not ever eating it after seeing that bird make the nest out of saliva.  Unbelievable.  Isn't that the best HD or Blu-ray DVD ever made?  I have a point.  I completely agree.  So much fun to watch.  It's just spectacular.  That little worm that spits out the string and then the fly flies into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  My only complaint is the HD doesn't include any of the how they made it.  Oh really? That's on the Blu-ray?  No, it's on the regular DVD, but it's not on the high-def.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's no room. We already have, you know, that's too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's also great family viewing.  I mean, something that you can really get the kids around with,  because they'll be as fixated with it as adults.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Although Henry will no longer eat bird's nest soups.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you guys talking about?  Planet Earth.  You ever seen that Planet Earth series?  Oh yeah, I watch it all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  BBC series.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's busy working on his level 60 We Done Did priest.  He doesn't have time for Planet Earth.  Did you see this? The Senator in Guam?  Yeah.  Senator, I think I stole this from you actually, from Buzz Out Loud.  Senator Ray Tenorio is a level 70 dwarf priest in World of Warcraft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Loser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's not a lot to do in Guam.  Yeah, not a lot of legislating that happens in Guam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He looks like a nice guy.  Loser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you never know where you're going to find him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He says, he says, what I like about World of Warcraft,

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  it's a great way to be able to reach out and connect with other people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know how many months of time it took to do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Level 70.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think you can outsource it though, right?  Can't you pay somebody to get to be a level 70 for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They'll do it a day for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'm going to do because I want a flying mount,  but I don't want to do any work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think, can't you get a flying mount at level 40?  I believe you can.  Oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're like mocking the entire World of Warcraft community,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yet you want to be able to impress them with your flying mount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You got to get the epic flying mount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Epic flying mount!  My brother is super into WoW,  and so I was like, well, what if I paid someone to get me a flying mount,  and then I just showed up and had my flying mount and I was level 70,  but then I couldn't play at all.  Would that matter?  See, that's what I worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I worry about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then what if I was like, it doesn't matter because I'm a girl?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Just say I'm a girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I fight like a girl, so I'll just stand here and look cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, with my mount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll fly around.  All the level 70s have all this armor and stuff.  I mean, they just look so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The thing everyone likes to do is just go in one of the major cities,  take off all your clothes and run around with nothing on.  That's really what people like doing.  Okay, let's stop right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is a part of the game I've never actually experienced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is kind of something we shouldn't be discussing,  and Robert, you need to talk to the Super Mario.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  HR!

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I canceled my WoW account finally.  HR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you see that Second Life was down for two days?  I imagine the Jonesing that was going on.  You guys must have experienced this.  I know CNET had a rolling blackout, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We did have the blackout, yeah.  And GameSpot was one of the sites that was down  because it's hosted in NetColo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A whole, what was down?  Craigslist was down?  Second Life was down?  Netflix, Six Apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that why Netflix was down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Six Apart?  From what I understand, Six Apart was down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The Colo, yeah, a lot of people basically had to completely rebuild the databases  or servers behind their systems.  That's actually what happened.  OneUp had to rebuild their...  You're kidding.  Basically their database.  Myers and his Craigslist had to.  How come?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because it crashed the hard drives or what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, a lot of times, yeah.  Well, servers aren't supposed to, in some cases,  I don't know how much hardware damage might have been done.  Wow.  But we actually spent a bunch of time, Garnet Lee hosted DLTV this week with me.  And OneUp, he's the managing editor for OneUp, and he talked about exactly,  they got a really detailed letter because OneUp's hosted a 365 main  talking about the sort of chain of events that brought power down to a couple of the co-locations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why don't you guys explain to the people outside of California in the Bay Area what happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, so 365 main is a co-location center that's used by some enormously popular websites.  And a co-location center basically means it's got a whole bunch of power  and a whole bunch of locked rooms with...  And air conditioning.  And air conditioning with giant connections to the internet.  And in theory, a generator to back it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's supposed to be like impenetrable, impervious to any event outside...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, which brings up the running joke about why would anybody build a co-location center in San Francisco?  In San Francisco, yeah.  Or in Los Angeles.  And the reason they do that is because large corporations, they want immediate access,  they want to be able to send their IT staff out there.  It's like banks are the ones that have sort of the giant underground bunkers in South Dakota.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why you do a co-loc, because you own the hardware, but they provide the facility,  and you want it to be nearby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And co-loc means co-location for anyone who doesn't know that these buzzwords...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's also a form of rectal cancer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So bummer about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That puts a buzzkill on the whole topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So anyway, so the power goes out in San Francisco because it's so hot.  Is that why the power went out?  No, there was a...  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Basically there was an explosion in one of the underground...  Basically, I don't know whether it was underground cable centers or power switching areas for PG...  Is it Pacific Gas and Electric? I can never remember.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, Pacific Gas and Electric.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So basically there was an explosion underneath a manhole cover down on Mission Street.  That must have been cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Killed off the power.  The manhole cover goes straight up in the air?  Nobody really knows.  That would have been cool.  Maybe it's on Google Earth.  Street View.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we need to point out that Google is not constantly taking pictures of the entire United States.  They got a picture of you crossing the street, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We know that much.  That's the funniest thing I ever saw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was the most random thing.  They did? They got Tom Merritt?  They got Tom Merritt smoking, I think.  I think they just ran up and down Second Street from PC World to CNET to the Zip Building and back again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Anyway, I'm sorry I didn't mean to derail you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the power went up and literally the power went on and off south of the market six times.  Basically about 50,000 odd people and businesses had literally six mini power outages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well that's what would have killed the hard drives.  That's as bad as bad as you can get on a hard drive.  Yeah, that's really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they also have power conditioning in between and in theory the grid power, it's not in theory,  the grid power actually never touches the computers inside of the colo.  But we know that's not true because...  No, actually we do know that's true because they have a UPS system in between.  They have one of those inertial flywheel systems.  But what happens, a couple things happen, like the inertial flywheel systems start to slow down.  And basically if the power stops running, it's like power goes into a motor for the inertial flywheel system  that powers up either a generator that feeds a battery, not a battery but a capacitor.  And that's what keeps basically the current inside the building never touches the grid.  It's consistent, right.  Right, so if power stops flowing to the flywheel UPS's for 15 or 30 seconds, it kicks on the diesel generators.  So they have two backup diesel generators, like eight main diesel generators,  and they had like I think three or four generators fail.  Like the two primary generators went, they went to the backup generator, the first backup generator didn't go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You got to check the gas levels guys, fill it up all the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well you'd laugh, right, but you know there's lawsuits flying right now.  There should be.  The contracts, everybody, you know every major company that does work at a colocation center or any kind of ISP  or you know anybody who's paying for a connection to the internet, there are very specific standards of performance.  And you know one of those is a colo center is that the power doesn't go out.  That's kind of fundamental.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well and a lot of colos have a 99.9% uptime agreement, like a service level agreement.  But as far as I understand, 365 main had, because they're crazy, a 100% SLA.  Their service level agreement specified 100% uptime.  And they'd even sent out this big press release that said that Red Envelope had been up for two solid years without any interruption.  And you know what, there are no icebergs in the North Atlantic either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  They better get a bigger flywheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That ship can't be sunk.  They have to get a bigger flywheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Or more squirrels.  Well it kind of added to Netflix woes.  I mean Netflix announced that they had their first losses in their history.  Stock tumbles and then the same exact time, the power goes out for 24 hours.  Not good.  And nobody could get on.  I love those guys.  I love Netflix and you know I was watching Twitter and Jaiku and Pounce and people were saying I'm jonesing.  And it wasn't for Second Life, it was for Netflix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Is Netflix in trouble?  Is Netflix in trouble?  Is that a big deal that they got their first losses in history?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you work in Netflix, Netflix stock it is.  Yeah, it's bad for the stock.  It is for the stock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know what I heard today, just today a Buzz Out Loud reader or listener emailed us and said that he got a letter from Blockbuster saying that their online rental prices are going up.  Which I think is kind of because one of the things that hurt Netflix so much is that there was all this insane competition from Blockbuster and they were cutting the prices to practically zero and having the in-store returns and stuff and so some analysts speculated that Netflix could just wait it out and wait for Blockbuster to raise prices.  And they did.  And now they are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Of course Netflix lowered its prices which is probably part of the reason they had lower revenues.  Yeah.  I saw the Blockbuster ad on the Super Bowl and so I signed up because I'm a Netflix customer and I thought well I'm going to compare the two.  And the selling point on Blockbuster is you can take that envelope in and get another movie.  So you could really, if you're willing to go to the Blockbuster store you could kind of always be in movies.  But I never did that because I don't want to go to the store and it took a lot longer for the Blockbuster movie turnaround.  My Netflix turnaround is a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Same here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have a San Francisco distribution center but frankly most of the country is near a distribution center.  There aren't that many places where you can't get it in a day or two.  And Blockbuster just couldn't compete.  And frankly after a while, plus their interface on their website, I mean Netflix's queue system and everything is so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I like the Friend system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Friends is great.  I love the Friends system.  So that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's need to compare.  How does that work Robert?  You sign in and you can send your friends or anyone you want a little email link with a custom little link and when they click on that that adds them as well.  And then after you go through and rate a bunch of movies and your friends have rated a bunch of movies it does a comparison to see what percentage you are similar or not similar to each other.  And then it gives you trivia based on your friends likes and dislikes.  It says of these four movies your friends said this one was a two star movie and the others were four or better.  And it's kind of fun.  I play with that on Facebook because they have a kind of Netflix app on Facebook that does some of that stuff too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, how many movies do you guys watch anyway?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I never watch the movies.  Sound like a bunch of movie junkies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We just rent them and return them.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or they sit at my house for a really long time.  But it doesn't mean I like Netflix any less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I go through spates like I won't watch anything for a month and then I'll watch 10 movies in a month.  Are any of you one of those heavy users that Netflix slows down?  Have any of you been braked by Netflix?  You know what they are?  They're braked by Netflix.  You have Patrick?  I know people who have been.  You can tell that they're not responding to you as quickly as they used to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or at least it certainly feels that way to them.  That's kind of why I go to a local video store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have the least expensive plan that Netflix offers.  So there's no way I could ever fall into that trap.  I have the most expensive plan that Netflix offers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because you're already in it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's like I'm limited to the number.  It's not an unlimited plan.  And that keeps me in line.  I really don't need more than two movies a month.  A month?  Or at a time.  A month?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's four or something a month.  I don't even like movies and I watch more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Four or five bucks?  Well, I've also got a bunch of HD titles and stuff too.  I'm constantly looking at something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Speaking of Facebook, they've been in the news.  Of course, Mark Zuckerberg, who started Facebook as a Harvard sophomore,  is being sued by a company called ConnectU,  which says we were in the dorm room with Mark and we talked about the same idea.  And we hired him and he did some stuff for us.  And then he started Facebook and like killed us.  The founders of ConnectU, twin brothers Cameron and Tyle Vinkelvoss,  not making this up, and Divya Narendra, sued.  The judge says, guys, you know, if you had a contract written or oral, okay,  but just like you kind of talked, that's not going to do it.  Dorm room talk is not enough.  Although, I imagine that ConnectU is probably figuring at some point,  Mark will pay him just to go away.  And Mark has so much money, no?  You don't think so?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  You have to start paying everybody.  For some reason, the judge didn't throw out.  What I can understand is why the judge didn't throw out the case.  Because I think it was dismissed once and then refiled.  And then in this last hearing, the judge said, your case is ludicrous, it's gossip or thin,  you couldn't have less evidence.  Why don't you go get some?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's giving them a chance.  He's saying, you better come up with something here better than what you got.  They have till August 8th.  And I mean, I think you're right.  I think this is basically saying it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess so.  I don't know why you wouldn't just say it's over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think, you know, probably, you know, hey, John, what's that word for when you have  like legal things that are supposed to happen in a particular order?  But I mean, it's a process.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, how did your day in court go, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was fighting a traffic ticket or no, just speeding ticket, actually.  Did you win?  No, you had my lawyer.  By the way, if you're going to go to court for any of these things, because you want to just say,  get a lawyer, it's weird because they fast track you.  Oh, there's like 50 people in there and they all listed.  But with the guys with the lawyers, there's only like three or four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, because they don't want to hear the blowhards doing their own defense.  Well, no, it's because they actually have to also show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They show that this the word part was I haven't been had a ticket for so long.  I didn't know any half of this stuff.  But the weird thing is, is that first, before you can go up there and say you make your case,  they make you watch this long movie about your rights and all this other crap.  And it's like it's really, you know, America.  But anyone with a lawyer doesn't need this because obviously the lawyer, you know,  is representing you and they know by the fact that they have a you pass the bar.  So they rush all the people with lawyers in and out.  So you're you get there early and you leave and then these poor saps that are stuck there,  they'll be there like for four or five, six hours, sometimes into the afternoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did the ticketing officers show up in your case?  So I got up at nine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You got in there at nine and got out at nine fifteen.  I got, you know, I find a night.  So then they say you want, you know, you take you get traffic court because you want to do that.  Right. You want to point.  Is going to go flying high. Right. Right.  So they say to me, would you like online?  Oh, yeah. Online traffic or OK, or traffic school.  Oh, yeah. So I said, sure.  So they give you a sheet of paper and there's like a hundred and fifty choices of these online traffic.  Jim's Chuckle Hut Traffic School. It's unbelievable.  Oh, yeah. And so I'm thinking and they all do things differently.  You know, some of them make it come in and take a test and some do this and some do that.  But anyway, so I think I'm thinking now of reviewing them. Review it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's turned into a state welfare system. It really has.  It does seem right. Well, here, wait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why are you talking about that subject?  Just to get one last thing before, you know, we're done here to gripe about.  So my car is like needs a a smog certificate because for every two years in California,  they make you smog your car and it's a scam.  And so I go into this place, smog and test smog and repair.  It's our testing and repair shop.  So I go in there and I say, I need the smog certificate.  You know, what's it going to cost?  Let me see your sheet. And so I give them the sheet from the DMV and it says you have to go to a testing only.  Oh, yeah. Go to testing and repair.  Oh, yeah. And the guy says to me, no, you can't go here.  This is testing and repair. We can't do it.  You have to go to form twenty seven stroke B.  There's like it says there's two layers of small.  Wait, wait, wait. If he could do smog testing and repair, why can't he do smog testing without the repair?  Hey, John, you ever been screwed over by a mechanic?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I know you get no spam, but have you ever had a mechanic tried to do work that was not necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But why do they even allow smog testing and repair if they're going to require smog testing and no repair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, apparently one year you get smog testing and repair,  which depends on the car or whether you've failed the test before.  There's these two categories now, one smog testing only and the other one smog testing and repair.  That really makes no sense.  It does. It actually does make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And they do smog testing only on a lot of older vehicles specifically, I believe, to avoid the scam, to avoid being mechanic scamming, to avoid mechanic scamming customers.  Well, you figure any place that's advertised as a testing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, hold on, Patrick. What if I go and they got one of the most one of the most honest repair shops right down the street from me.  And he loves him and he knows him.  I love him. I know him and they do testing and repair, but they can't do testing.  Well, that's a little odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry. There's a couple of justifications I've heard for the test only centers.  I understand the test only centers is the question is why they have both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know. It's forcing us to waste gas driving to other facilities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I know what you're saying, Patrick, and the test only center makes sense.  I only go to a test only center because then if repairs are needed, I know they're not going to, you know, jack me around.  But why do they then allow testing and repair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It doesn't make any sense at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. My I'm just going to interject here to say that my baby's home, so I have to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, but we had so much more to talk about. All right. Thank you so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We could get rid of the girl if we talked about cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it worked on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You don't want to talk about the bus driver fired for thirty eight thousand text messages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Deserved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do like that one.  I did too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's Polish. It's a Polish joke.  He was trying to win a contest jackpot.  He has a tab of thirty four thousand dollars in text messages on his corporate phone.  All right. Thanks so much for joining us, Molly.  You can catch Molly Wood on Buzz Out Loud now, Veronica free at C a B o l dot C net TV dot com.  It's just Molly and Tom, two of our favorite people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll see you guys next time.  Take care. Bye bye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that makes it a little easier to talk about cars and other boy things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's this article and slash dot U.S. government checking up on Vista users?  Vista is is is connecting to Halliburton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I wanted to run this by you because this it I don't know who this guy is that claims this and whether it's credible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's a little I found it all suspicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It seems a little suspicious, but I'd love to get maybe Steve, you could look into this for us.  His claim is that Vista was slowing down and as he was using it.  And so he decided to, I guess, put a packet analyzer on it.  After all that file sharing he was doing with it, he'll slow down.  Yeah, something was going on.  So he puts a packet analyzer on it.  And it's it's by the way, the guy's name is Paris the pirate.  I just I just want to point this out.  The article is at white dust dot net.  But he says his logs say that Vista was connecting to the Department of Defense Information Networking Center, the United Nations Development Program and the Halliburton Company.  I don't buy this.  I think it's completely bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it just can't be the case.  I mean, if this were going on on any larger scale, we would absolutely already know it.  And, you know, there are lots of security conscious people running Vista who'd be looking at their logs or their firewalls would be, you know, screaming.  And yeah, I think they just can't be anything to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody should put a little packet analyzer on their system and tell us.  Get back to us.  Who is your Vista calling?  Nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's unplugged.  Nobody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe that's why yours works so well, Robert.  Smooth like a baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Politicians did charge on Tuesday that peer to peer networking poses a national security threat.  Oh, this pissed me off so bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Security threat for profit, maybe.  But government reform committee chairman Henry Waxman, Democrat of California, said he's considering new laws aimed at addressing the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's troubled by the possibility that foreign.  This is this is once again another story showing how clueless members of Congress are the possibility that foreign governments, terrorists or organized crime could gain access to documents that reveal national secrets using peer to peer networks.  Please.  Huh?  Yeah, you could use the you could use postal mail to a parent needs to be banned.  The chairman of LimeWire Mark Gorton was assailed for allegedly harming national security through offering his product.  Yes, the terrorists use LimeWire.  What an ignorant statement.  What an idiot.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The other thing is, it was funny.  It was like, you know, what's not a sale?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The corporate government IT department.  That's exactly right.  Or employees who are so bloody ignorant that they put peer to peer file sharing services on computers that are that carry, you know, secret information.  You know what I mean?  It's like, let's play.  It just it smells of like somebody like, you know, they're having a chat with the RAA lobbyist over lunch and the RAA lobbyist.  You know, peer to peer threatens national security.  And the senator went, I smell a headline.  What is it?  Dihydrogen oxide kills thousands of people every year.  Really?  What is that?  Senator, there's water.  Oh, 48000 Americans are killed every year by something that can be bought in any state, county or town in the union.  We need to stop these cars now.  You know, news at 11.  Nokia buys Twango.  For 100 million dollars, adding a social networking site to their portfolio for reasons no one can understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't get it.  Nokia, for some reason, is building these software services.  They're a cell phone company.  I don't know why they think they need software services.  Maybe they're going to get out of it.  Do Helio have an impact at all on these companies to where they feel they have to do these kind of offerings?  Maybe that's it.  But I think that's the biggest thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't understand why they think they need to...  Nokia is doing all sorts of odd things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They have a podcasting service.  Maybe they're ready to get out.  Nokia has changed.  One of the things if you ever visit these guys, or just go on the website and look at the history of Nokia.  It was like a coal mining company for five, six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then it was this and it was that.  It was a monitor company recently.  It was an electronics company.  It's been all these years.  It's been a lot of people.  It's been a lot of people.  It's been a lot of people.  It's been a lot of people.  It's been a lot of people.  It's been a lot of people.  I think that's the biggest thing.  I don't know.  It was an electronics company.  Maybe they're ready to get out of the cell phone handset business.  Maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because they bought Loud Eye which is a digital music distributor.  They bought Gate 5 which is a navigation software company and now they bought Twango.  They probably just have a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think you got that much.  Cash rich and strategy poor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, we didn't mention the quarterly results for Microsoft and Apple.  Apple made a ton of money.  Microsoft made like 10 times the ton of money.  Huge quarters for both companies.  Both almost record quarters.  I think Apple's 3 billion.  Net profit in the quarter was a record for it.  But Microsoft kind of dwarfed it by, I don't know, what is it, like 81 billion or some huge amount of money.  So it's been a good...  Ironically...  And the stock still doesn't move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the stock still stuck in neutral.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The story is that a lot of PCs were sold but profits were not up.  Profits were not up because...  Or not up as much as they ought to be because the costs of these PCs are so low.  The rates are thin margins.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Leo, this one story here that I just think is like...  It's got to be the dumb idea of all time is Cisco deciding to kill the Linksys brand name.  And they'll be selling, you know, $49 blue toy router.  That's a big mistake.  I think it is a horrible mistake.  I mean, at this point you can say, oh, that's a Cisco router.  And it actually means something.  Cisco's quality.  Well, exactly.  And Linksys is, you know, a blue toy.  Yeah.  I just can't...  I just don't what those guys are thinking.  Mixing up their high-end commercial networking, you know, brand with, you know, consumer end cap stuff.  Well, because the markets are so different than the markets that we have in the US.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then the markets, the targeted marketing and the way they would advertise those, the markets are so vastly different.  I don't think they consider it to be threatening to their brand.  No, I actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I agree with Patrick on this.  It's almost like when digital equipment came out with personal computers and they said, well, you know, everyone is going to know who we are.  The public doesn't know who these people are and the public doesn't know who Cisco is.  So I don't think there is going to be any confusion.  I agree 100%.  But I disagree with the fact.  I disagree with the fact.  Why would they take an established consumer name like Linksys and dump it?  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And throw it away.  Yeah.  That is much stranger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, it's strange on both counts.  There's no reason to do either thing.  Even if you don't believe it hurts the Cisco brand, I mean, if there's a chance it does, why get rid of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, none of us work at Linksys or Cisco or do marketing or do sales analysis or have a particular...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's never stopped us before, Patrick.  Well, that's a good point.  This is our job is to make up crap.  I wish my job were buying...  That's my job.  That's my job.  That's your job, John.  We're just following in your footsteps.  I wish I'd had the good sense to buy business.com when it was $9.50 a year.  R.H. Donnelly bidding against Dow Jones, the New York Times and News Corp. pays $345 million upfront cash plus performance based over the next three years.  For the name, business.com.  Three...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just for the domain?  For the name.  This pains us all.  How?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know that somebody registered it for...  Oh, maybe they paid 25 bucks some time ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unbelievable.  25 or 75, I think, early on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Even 75, I think they made some money there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think it's bounced around a few times.  I mean, Halsey was buying, when he was running CNET, he was buying these domain names like that for 40 grand apiece, which was kind of the going price.  I remember when art.com came out, I had the guy on my ZDTV show, and he said that they paid a million dollars for art.com.  For a while...  This was in 99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And sex.com went for a while, but for a while it was...  People realized that generic domain names, which everybody thought were going to be good, weren't that good.  You know, news.com...  No, this is an idiotic purchase.  Art.com, business.com, it's too generic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, business.com is currently, as of right now, profitable and is expected to generate more than 50 million dollars in 2007.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they bought the company, not just the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, business.com advertising network, or business.com makes money from its sites, including business.com, work.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it's more than just buying the domain name.  All right, I misunderstood. I thought they were just getting the domain name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's better.  Search and advertising provider, business.com, which was originally set up by Sky Dayton and Jake Weinbaum back in 99.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they paid seven and a half million for it.  A million for it, yeah.  Sky Dayton, now doing Helio.  Sky Dayton, no slouch.  Real quickly, before we wrap up, I want to mention there's a great study in Gizmodo about HDMI cables I'm going to ask Robert about.  But before we do that, I want to mention audible.com, our sponsor this week, sponsoring most of the Twitter network.  We really appreciate their support. They do audio books you can download.  It couldn't be more convenient if you've never listened to a book on your iPod or MP3 player or on your cell phone.  You've got to try audible.com. It's amazing.  They support hundreds of devices, including all the iPods.  And it's just a great way to listen to a book.  We've recommended many books in the past.  In fact, at some point, I've got to put up a page with all of our recommendations, including my, what is it?  My Life as an Economic Hitman, which I've added to my list.  That's John's.  Here he is. He wandered off during the ad.  He says, time for a drink.  But this week, I want to mention a great book from Malcolm Gladwell that I just adored reading on audible.  It was it's called The Tipping Point.  And it is a very insightful, I think very interesting insight into why some things become big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's about that's an auto.  That book is so small, you can read it in five minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Tipping Point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just read it and it's over.  No, it's like it's a really short book.  It was a couple hours.  But he talks about I mean, it's wonderful.  I just did you read it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you just looked at it and said, it's just it seemed like, you know, let me see how long it is.  I was not a fan of that book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, I loved it. Three hours and four minutes.  I loved it.  Talking about why crime drops in New York City in the mid 90s.  It has to do with the squeegee men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has to do with Giuliani putting getting it was Bratton.  It was Bratton.  Yeah. But I mean, basically whoever was responsible and maybe Giuliani can share share share share credit on that.  But they got they got cops out of the cruisers and put them on the street.  And when they did that, you know, for whatever sort of fascist environment it did create in certain neighborhoods,  it definitely cleaned up the streets and made them safer.  It did the disinification of the whole Times Square area, that whole mollification, disinification of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He also talks about how they get the graffiti off the you know, what they did to get the graffiti off.  It's the one thing I like is the broken window theory.  You allow one broken window in a neighborhood.  You're effectively telegraphing.  We don't care.  And so having a zero tolerance attitude towards even minor crime like squeegee men, broken windows, graffiti.  Cleans up everything because you're saying we care.  Anyway, it's a fascinating book.  I think it's really very germane to the whole issue of viral marketing and how things take off and what it is that makes them take off.  Malcolm Gladwell is the author.  John hates it. I love it.  But, you know, if you hate it, there are plenty of other books on audible dot com.  You get a free credit when you sign up using the code audible dot com slash twit.  Go to audible dot com slash twit.  If you decide you don't want to listen anymore, no cost to you at all.  Absolutely free of obligation.  But I think you're going to want to become an audible member with things like the wish list.  My next listen. It's kind of like Netflix for audiobooks.  I just love it. Audible A U D I B L E dot com slash twit.  We thank them for their support.  And I'll put a link to the tipping point in the show notes because I just I just think it's great.  Even if John hates it.  I didn't like blink as much as next book.  I thought that was a little obvious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, OK, OK.  I still agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I still have confessions of an economic hitman on my list.  I downloaded it. I just haven't gotten to it.  I'm reading Harry Potter right now or listening to it.  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I've seen so many people reading Harry Potter books in the last couple of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I realized I hadn't read the last one.  So I'm actually listening to the last one so I can catch up and read the my daughter has stolen the last book.  She took it out of my hands.  So did you see that she's reading?  Did you see that she's reading?  It is. Oh, she's looking.  My daughter is a reader as though she she actually our book bills are out out of control.  That's a good addiction, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Did you see the story, Robert?  And I'm curious what you think on Gizmodo.  And actually, they're quoting tests from another site, which I will quote to you in a second on HDMI cables.  I did.  Comparing the three hundred dollar monster cable to the fifty dollar mono price cable.  Exactly.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think they're right on the money.  They're stating the obvious.  But they did the test, which is nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And there is no difference between these cables.  Literally for the shorter runs.  There is no reason to spend extra on a specialty cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. The only thing they found on the really long cables that could make it.  And he was doing like everything wrong, like coiling it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the other thing is to say it's like it's a great test.  They were using, you know, monsters, lab equipment, and they were using thirty five and fifty foot cables.  Right. Really long cables.  Yeah, which is highly would be highly unusual to find in your home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The cheap cables worked every bit as well on the short runs.  It's only in the long runs that makes it.  You literally want the shortest cable possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And the short run, though, I mean, I want to make sure people understand that the short run, which like failed the meter test, did fine in the real world.  The short run was thirty five feet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. According to this test, basically the bottom line, it's short distances up to two meters or six feet.  You could pretty much get away with any cable.  You don't need to buy the expensive HDMI cable.  This is an old, old scam that's been going on forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You talk to audio engineers, they'll always tell you about this cable thing where they, you know, these very expensive cables are the stereo.  Oh, you get so many more decibels from our cable than somebody else's copper wire.  Well, the thing that bugs me.  It may have been that way back in the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  An analog.  But anybody who really knows what they're talking about says that you should.  That's the last thing you ever spend money on is the cable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like those tubes that are supposed to make you sound warmer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. What about those?  Jancy Dvorak.  Dvorak's on tubes today.  Thanks to Ted Stevens.  I'm on the tubes.  No, but you could make that case in analog.  But the thing that gripes me is that these companies are still charging those premium prices in digital cables.  Oh, yeah. Digital is where it makes no sense at all.  Makes no sense at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's a great way to make profit for when you've already bought the TV and you're about to leave the store.  They'll shove a hundred dollar cable in your face saying you need it.  And or you're just lazy.  If you're lazy, you deserve to get suckered like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's also, but I mean, if you think about it, right, even here in San Francisco,  and there's, I mean, where you have just an unbelievable number of sources,  both the high end and at the low end for buying electronics.  You know, if you're buying an HDTV, finding, you know, they're going to have this, the $65 six foot cable,  which is still unreasonably expensive, is far, far away from the HDTVs and all of the electronics that has an HDMI output.  And the cables that are right next to the televisions, so that you can grab them,  because, you know, you're going to need to connect your new high definition stuff to your new HDTV.  They've got the big collection of, you know, enormously expensive cables right there.  And you know what? If you just drop $3,000 on a TV, hey, it's not going to hurt twice.  Ten percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they are prettier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like that three year, it's like the three year warranty plan.  They try to sell you at the last minute.  It's like, no, thank you.  And then they really, you know, they're not happy when you say no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, the word that what's because they get a piece of the action, the sales people actually get a percentage.  But the thing is, those half those warranties, they don't, you know, if you actually had a problem late, they still won't.  They're they're fake.  It's a scam that's been shown over and over to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, some people have had an OK time with those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Guys, I'm going to wrap it up because we could talk forever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We love talking and and but at some point we've got to we've got to let John make a steak and get Steve back to work on his hard drives.  Patrick, of course, has to go home to his loving wife and Robert Heron to his empty soulless flat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the penthouse, baby, and his strippers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's not forget. I want to.  Thanks to Molly Wood.  She's taken off. But of course, you can catch her on Buzz out loud.  BOL dot CNET dot com and on CNET TV dot com to Slamdance industry.  My good buddy Patrick Norton and Robert Heron, both on DL dot TV,  where you can catch basically the closest thing to the screensavers ever since the attack of the show.  Twice, twice weekly on DL dot TV.  Cranky Geeks is a place you'll find John C. Dvorak and of course on his blog Dvorak dot org slash blog.  Steve Gibson is at GRC dot com.

This was a fun show.  Really good one. We'll catch you again next time.  Another tweet is in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Did Bill Watkins ever mention anything about that statement he made about how they're ultimately,  let's face it, we're not changing the world. We're building a product that helps people buy more crap and watch porn.  That was the one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know Bill, I've known him long enough that he wouldn't say something like that to me for attribution.  Because he knows, you know, that's for the, you know, little.  That's a good line, though.  It's a good line, but it's been around. He said it a lot.  That's the CEO of CEDEC.  He's kind of a wild man. He's kind of a crackpot, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, hard drive guys are all kind of coo-coo.  Isn't that true?  You'd think they'd be very sedate, and this is kind of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You'd think it's a weird business to be in.  You would think it's not. It's a real nuts and bolts industry, but I think it isn't. I think these guys are all nuts.  Al Shugart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well he's the one who set the standard.  Wild man.  Yeah, but everybody...  He'll be a bartender, hell with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's go round.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Round the board.
