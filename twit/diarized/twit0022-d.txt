Transcript:  This is Twit, This Week in Tech, episode 22 for September 11, 2005.  If you trained the audience how to make a lot of noise, then I forgot to turn my mic up.  We're at Newton's Bar and Grill in beautiful Larkspur Landing, California, the new home of Twit.  This is the new official Twit Lounge with the leather chairs for John C. Dvorak.  Hey, everybody's got a leather chair.  You look nice in that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, we have a leather couch over here.  We're on a bench.  You get your own leather chair.  There's another one there.  John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Four Go's, his Cow Bears game and his Niners game.  56 to 17.  That was yesterday.  That was yesterday.  Oh, Saturday's football game.  So that's a football game.  Patrick Norton, who knows about these kinds of things.  Roger Chang, who's at GameSpot.  Yep.  And I understand that...  Well, I'll talk about that in just a second.  And of course, I'm Leo Laporte.  Not with us today, missing in action Kevin Rose and David Prager, who decided to go to the Niners game instead of coming to...  Oh, man.  And Robert Heron, I don't know what happened to him.  But anyway.  But we do have a special Twit with us.  Alex Lindsay is here.  It's good to have you joining us.  Alex, of course, a regular on Call for Help.  And Al Bean who flies up to Canada to be on Call for Help.  Does the Photoshop and 3D stuff.  He's with the Pixel Core, which is the guild of 3D designers.  And Alex and I are going to do an IP.  What are you laughing at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Every time that John pulls the camera...  Yeah, bang the mic.  He bangs the mic.  So I kind of have to do it with the wrong eye.  Kind of, you know, like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, let me show you.  You can actually turn these mics around.  You just take the headsets and go like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It won't matter.  I'll still be banging it.  It's still in front of him.  That's the problem.  It's in front of me.  That's the problem.  Oh, yeah.  It really wouldn't work behind him.  You have to kind of...

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  At home, don't hear a big squeaking sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as my ear starts bleeding, once again.  Did you hear it?  Was that loud?  All right.  So today, this is the beginning of a new, another new chapter in the Twit, which is,  I think this is nice.  We got it.  We got nice leather chairs.  We've got a bar.  Can we have some Bordeaux for Mr. Dvorak?  Does it matter what kind of Bordeaux?  Any Bordeaux will do?  None will be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think so.  Single Bordeaux today.  Yeah, that's right.  Yeah, you got that down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Forty of Bordeaux.  I'm very...  You like the wide mouth of the...  Well, actually, we have Klaue here.  Spock Avriel, who is a viewer who came all the way from Reno, makes this stuff.  Well, can I come up to the red microphone, Spock Avriel, and explain what Klaue is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Klaue is a beverage which I throw together, which I start out with a bunch of cocoa powder.  Then I run the water through it about four times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're doing this in like a Mr. Coffee?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yep, in a Mr. Coffee automatic drip coffee pot.  Then after the chocolate water has gotten as dark as coffee regularly is,  I take it and I dump it through Folgers with cinnamon mixed into it.  It ends up becoming so strong that if it weren't in a plastic container, it would probably dissolve the floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we're going to have Patrick's wife, Sarah, be the official taster.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't worry, it is safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've asked for glasses of ice.  We'll have ice Klaue a little bit later on.  Thank you, Spock Avriel, for bringing that on the plane.  I'm surprised that the TSA allowed you.  It was the bus. It wasn't the plane.  Oh, you made it in the hotel.  No? You took a bus here?  Yep.  Oh, you're flying back.  I got the 4.30 this morning.  Oh, dear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I was up until 2 o'clock last night making all of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, dear.  And who says the twit army is awful?  He's a twit isn't he?  He's a twit isn't.  So this week in Tech, it means we talk about tech.  Of course, the big story probably is the Apple keynote on Wednesday where...  Oh, let's talk about something really scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's that?  Microsoft has decided...  Wait a minute, you're going to cut off the Apple story?  You're going to say...  Just like that.  Apple? Okay, Motorola Rocker. Sucks.  Alright, I'll tell you what. Let's do micro...  Nano! Great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alright, we have a couple of nanos here. Patrick brought one.  And that's pretty. I like it. It's very pretty.  And then Alex brought one too. Neither of these are black. Couldn't you get the black one?  They were sold out.  Didn't even think to ask for one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, see Alex brought one.  I thought of asking for one. They were sold out very quickly and they're waiting for more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to do a mod. We're going to color it with a black magic marker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I agree with you. The rocker is like... In fact, already people are complaining about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they can't get it connected to the iTunes.  That's been the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you know that the phone's hacked already?  Is it?  Yeah, there was a... On Friday I got a memo about it.  And somebody... There's a site, I guess it was in Canada or someplace, and they've got the whole phone hacked.  And now you can download the software and use it on older Motorola phones.  So you don't even need it.  You don't even need it.  You just need the software.  I'll put a link on my website about it.  That'd be great.  What is it?  .org slash blog.  I should take a bunch of flack every time I mention it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I'm going to play at the end of this show instead of the normal doing the twit that I play.  Ashley Twitt, who are doing the twit, has made a new song called I Get No Spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you heard it?  No, but I was expecting it.  I get ridiculed for the fact I get no spam.  And I understand that.  I understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're not ridiculed.  It's not ridiculed.  It's admiration.  High praise, yeah, right.  It's love.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's like Rambo Peel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody says what he says.  You know what it is?  It's a tagline.  You have a tagline.  It works for me.  You know, Gary Coleman had, what you talking about, Willis?  You know, right?  I mean, it's a tagline.  Donald Trump had, you're fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're fired.  Everybody needs a tagline.  I get no spams, man.  It's not a bad one.  No, it's okay.  It's very modern.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're talking with ThinkGeek.  They're going to do a whole twit line of merchandise.  And one of the shirts is going to be your face.  If this is all right, you have to prove it.  Oh, of course.  That says, I get no spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you're in the O.  As long as it's underneath it, it says www.therock.org.  I don't have a problem.  So the rocker's been hacked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was kind of a boring phone anyway.  And the thing that people wanted to do, which was download the iTunes right into the phone,  you can't do it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, but the thing is, it sounds like the phone companies want that to happen.  Yeah, because it's minutes.  Well, they also want to charge you two bucks a song or something like that.  So I'm kind of glad.  So why didn't that happen?  I bet you Apple didn't want that to happen.  Because they want you to go through the iTunes music store.  Well, I think also, if it's two bucks per song, it kind of takes the fun out of it.  It undermines.  Two bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It should be 25 cents a song.  It's a buck 99 a ringtone for a 30 second ringtone.  Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's amazing that that business is, you know, that's a $3 billion business.  Three billion dollars.  It's amazing that people's it's baffling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  My phone, my phone set to vibrate.  That's it.  I mean, I don't have any ringtone.  That's my ringtone.  Vibrate.  Yeah, I don't.  Well, I'm because I was one time sitting on on on air at Tech TV and my phone went off.  From then on it vibrate from vibrate.  Vibrate really works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm looking at the 4X watch the 90s game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just look at that.  I'm not watching.  I'm listening.  Now you were on radio here basically and now you're like telling me you're right.  You know, I mentioned the fact that Leo sitting here stark naked.  You don't have to tell me that.  We were supposed to say that at the end.  That was a surprise.  That was a big surprise.  We've been sitting here.  That's why I'm looking away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was looking at, you know, soccer girls ratings.  She does her podcast from the bathtub and I thought it'd be good if I did buy naked from Noonan's.  Have you seen soccer girl?  That's my new tagline by the way.  Have you seen Noonan's?  Have you seen Noonan's?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This will pack him in next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  People don't know that every radio station in the world now has two or three TVs in the studio.  And half the time people are doing the radio shows are like this.  Of course.  They're not paying any attention to the show.  The callers call in and you can tell.  You were on Larry King.  Yeah.  He doesn't pay any attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He fell asleep.  During the interview.  Yeah. One time.  Yeah.  This is when he was doing the radio show.  Wait a minute.  I never told you this story.  This is a great story.  Basically, he's interviewing me and he works all day.  So he's at night.  This is at midnight or whatever.  So he falls asleep.  And the funny thing was that he's running through these phone calls.  He's De Moing.  Albuquerque.  He's running through them.  He's cutting people off.  It's just unbelievable.  And then he falls asleep and there's some.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't understand.  He's sitting there.  You're doing a radio show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He nods off?  Yeah.  He's dead out.  Is his head on the table?  No.  He's just like out.  And so he's far enough away that you can't nudge him.  And you really don't want to.  He's Larry King.  So I got some guy who's a really boring guy talking.  And I look over.  Larry's out.  And so I mean, while everybody else is wondering why they got cut off with this boring dude  is going, why, you know.  And so I said to the guy, you got any other questions?  You know, Larry, this guy, not really.  Oh, no.  Geez.  You know, I got dead air here.  So luckily he woke up at the very, just snapped out of it.  You know.  Muncie.  Cincinnati.  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was a great radio show.  I think he's much better on the radio.  Yeah, I think so too.  Many people are.  So the rocker, I think Singular's benefit, of course, is they want to charge two, three  bucks.  And they get in the air your time.  And Apple won't let them.  Apple's benefit is it's a big ad campaign for iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I have to admit, I mean, after you see, did you see the ads?  Yeah.  It's all about iTunes.  It's all about, I mean, I have to admit, I was on the way here and my phone rang.  You know, while I'm listening to my new Nano.  And I was like, it would be really nice if it stopped.  The marketing started to sink in.  I was like, it would be nice if I just hit something on my phone, on my iPod, and was  able to answer the call and not have to switch all my headphones around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There have been phones that have done this since the year 2000, by the way.  This is nothing new.  I mean, MP3 playing phones.  Which you need as a prius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or one of the cars where the Bluetooth is in the car.  Exactly.  The phone rings, the engine stops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You coast to a stop.  Or you know what would be better?  If we could steer it to the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're a laugh riot today.  Right?  You can just leave that.  There's no substance in this show, I can see.  We're getting there.  We're getting to the substance.  I'm sure other people are too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Patrick has a story with substance.  Well, like a half dozen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's got some substance.  Anyhow, Roger's got a pointer.  Let me write that date down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think that a lot of people are waiting to see if we're going to see video.  You know, I think that was the...  Thank you.  That was the secret of it.  Yeah, it's going to be a while.  Yeah, I think it was more hope than...  I know it was one of my hopes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the problem is what are they going to play?  I mean, PlayStation's actually...  The PlayStation in Japan actually has a bunch of downloadable television they've created,  so there's something other than overpriced UMD movies available for the PSP.  Creative's going, we've got the ultimate player for your content.  Everybody goes, where's the content coming from?  They go, there are a number of legal sources.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you talking about playing video on the rocker or on the nano?  The thing is that Apple has had a video player floating around internally for years now,  and it's just a matter of when they're going to...  Steve's the roadblock, right?  Well, it's just a matter of when they're going to get it.  When the market is...  When the bottom line's the roadblock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  You know, when the numbers start to flatten, flatline, boom, here comes the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They always used to say in the mainframe business, IBM would do that,  that they would hold on to innovation so that they would continue to sell.  Yeah, it's a business.  You know, and then...  They're not doing it as a favor to us.  We've got to dribble them out.  And this is a great...  I mean, look, this has got three years of...  I mean, this is going to...  The nano is incredible.  Don't you think this is the product of the year?  I wouldn't call it that, but it's pretty cool.  What's a better product?  They'll sell 10 million of them.  What's a better product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think that when we see the limited release of the EVDO stuff  that Verizon's going to be putting out at the end of the year,  that'll be something that'll be in the ballpark if the interface is okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More than Vcast, something else that they're doing?  Yeah, well, I mean, the...  Because they're already doing Vcast with the EVDO.  They're doing video on a phone.  This is in LA. It's available.  It's actually... San Francisco is going to get it any day now.  And it's full motion, you know, 30 frames...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  2.4 megabits per second to the phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which you can't connect to your notebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  They wouldn't want you to do that, would they?  Well, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is this digital video, the handheld, that new standard, that DVD...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the EVDO is basically...  It's high-speed data to your phone.  But one of the things they're going to do is push video down it.  But it'll also be high-speed data, I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they're solving the content issue by making...  Amped Mobile was making tons of partnerships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've already got Discovery, they've got CNN,  they've already got some good cable channels on there.  I think they need Twitter.  Did you see, by the way, that Twitter was featured on the Nano site?  Wasn't that cool?  Yeah.  If you go to the Nano site, you know, they have a great flash...  Or actually, it's QuickTime demos.  And if you click Podcast, it plays Twitter.  Not sure why, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't mention this in the copy, though, which is kind of annoying.  No.  They didn't mention...  But they mentioned Adam Curry.  They did, actually. ABC News, Adam Curry, ESPN, KCO, Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple pays him to do that Podfinder podcast.  Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's why...  So basically, you're telling me that the little copy that was written there  is essentially corrupt self-promotion?  No.  No, it's profitable self-promotion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those are all the people that were supposed to be in the top ten instead of us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right, Patrick.  We have now drained the subject dry.  You may bring up something about Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Big shock. Disturbing shock.  No patch coming this Patch Tuesday.  But it's Patch Tuesday.  It's Patch Tuesday.  Which is kind of like...  It's like, yeah...  So there's...  It's not that there's nothing to fix, but this is one of my favorite Microsoft lines ever.  Occasionally, the testing process and our strict focus on quality  can result in a month where no security updates are released,  as is the case for 13 September 2005.  See, they missed the boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stop the presses.  Oh, they should say, no, it's all fixed. We're secure.  We're done.  We're done.  I mean, there's our opportunity.  Now we just invite hackers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I guess you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what's even more scary is if you guys have seen,  there's been a couple of really good articles floating around on Windows Vista.  There's two kind of themes for the articles.  One is that there's going to be seven SKUs.  There's going to be seven different basic Windows Vista products.  There's the one for Indonesia.  No, no, no, no.  There's the Starter Edition, the Home Basic Edition, the Home Premium Edition,  the Professional Edition, the Small Business Edition,  and my personal favorite, the Ultimate Edition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What happened to the Platinum Edition?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, apparently the Platinum Edition is the Ultimate Edition.  This is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean, who would they hire that comes up with this as a marketing scheme?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, what actually differentiates between all the tiers of the box, apparently?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, Windows Vista Ultimate Edition is a superset of both  Windows Vista Home Premium and Windows Vista Pro Edition.  So, it includes all of the features of both of those product versions,  plus ads, and I quote,  the game performance tweaker with integrated gaming experiences,  a podcast creation utility under consideration,  may be cut from product, online club services.  Wait a minute. Online what?  Online club services.  What is that supposed to mean?  Is that like blogging?  No, no, no. It's exclusive access to music, movies, services,  and preferred customer care, i.e. tech support.  That's just a money-making scam.  Yeah, it's a monthly fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From Microsoft? Doesn't this sound a lot like GM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I said this before and I'll say it again.  This company is dead in the water. They're flatlined.  They're looking worse every minute.  This is a desperation move, seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the good news is, no patches.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Security.  They probably took the week off.  Nothing was up to their ferrets.  They're at Burning Man.  They didn't have time to do the patches.  They should say, we're at Burning Man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Did you go to Burning Man this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought you had the fuzzy bunny from cars.  Here's the worst part.  I have friends who have gone since the first one.  And I think about going two days before Burning Man every year.  Like, oh, I should go and then I do some research and I...  You can't go two days before.  Well, you can't think about it two days before.  You can't find anything.  You can't...  Anybody here?  What do you need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Five gallons of water at Burning Man.  Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Step up to the microphone.  I've been to Burning Man.  There's a man who's burning.  Who here has been to Burning Man?  He was here this time.  Yes, how was it?  How was it?  It was great.  What's always great?  Cousin Bob.  Cousin Bob was at Burning Man.  Were you naked?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bob, you look like the kind of guy in the pot.  I just wanted to make sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not everybody at Burning Man is naked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  My wife describes it as naked men on bicycles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Actually, one of the biggest events there is naked women on bicycles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're all lit up, right?  They have lights in the wheels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no.  They're all painted up, actually.  They're all on fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The bicycles are the women.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So cousin Bob, is this your first Burning Man, or have you been before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, fifth.  Fifth?  Wow.  So you're just a regular.  Yeah.  Would you say, how has Burning Man changed over those five years?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I don't know how much it's changed as much as I've changed.  I got more and more used to it as I get to prepare better and have a better time up there.  And you're drug-tolerant.  I don't know what to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey.  Well, I had a problem about 14 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They discovered I had already done my lifetime supply of drug and alcohol.  So I go up clean and sober.  Good man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's great.  That's great.  And you can still have a good time.  Are you allowed to have a claw?  Because we'd love to have you have a cup of claw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll try it.  When the glasses with ice come out, I will try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or get the glasses with ice.  Meet the one guy who tries it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, it's just a highly caffeinated beverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So how would you characterize Burning Man for somebody who doesn't know what we're talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Burning Man, it's kind of a, I don't know, what you call the...  I mean, you could say it's an experiment in autonomous community creation centered around...  Basically, they go out in the desert and people...  How does he do that?  I learned it from you.  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you mean the voice or the...  No, the copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He just comes up with these like...  He read it from the website.  Marketing speed.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  At his desk, he probably just has like a list, a row of words that you can put together.  Marketing generators.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Basically, a bunch of people go out in the desert and get weird.  And just create their own little society.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of amazing.  It's a small town that just appears...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they create an infrastructure to support 25, 30,000...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I make the argument that it's actually a modern version of the Mardi Gras.  Yeah.  Essentially, it takes place...  And the irony, of course, is that New Orleans...  Hello.  New Orleans was destroyed as Burning Man was going on exactly at the same time.  I just thought the symbolism there was too much to ignore.  Coincidence?  Conspiracy.  I think not.  But it's a Mardi Gras-like celebration where people just kind of...  That's why they're machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let it all hang out.  One had too much water, the other one has not enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Venice is big in Carnival, too.  I wonder if there's...  Thank you very much.  The Niners made an interception.  The Niners must have done something else.  Yeah, they got an interception.  St. Louis...  I would like to ask the Niners to kind of coordinate their good plays with our jokes.  Things would go much more smoothly here in Venice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Until recently, their good plays were all jokes themselves.  So it's like, ooh, sorry.  How could I miss a softball like that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, five, six scusevista.  Seven.  Seven scusevista.  Do you think consumers are confused by all this variety?  Sometimes I think consumers just want a simple...  I still get a lot of calls on the show saying, what's the difference between Pro and Home?  Do I need XP?  What do you do?  On the other hand, people do want the Ultimate Edition.  They'll sell more because it's the Ultimate, right?  There's a certain group of people who will buy...  There's going to be the Bling Edition.  The Bling Edition, yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Golden Crusted Edition.  Comes with a watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Comes with a OnStar button on your keyboard.  OnStar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what we need.  That's a good idea.  Windows with OnStar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Windows with OnStar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've lost...  I've lost in this application.  How do I get back to Star?  I can't find my cursor.  I lost my password.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm locked out.  We'll lock you, unlock for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  That's the worst job ever.  What do you do?  I'm tech support for XP OnStar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you love those OnStar ads where the...  I just crashed my car down a ditch.  It's okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like the one with the kids.  Yeah.  What do they describe?  Yeah, there's kids trapped in the car.  Who will help me when my airbag's deployed?  It's like you're too young to be driving a car anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who will help me with the blue screen of death?  Microsoft OnStar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OnCall.  And you know you're going to be paying like $3 a minute for that phone call after your,  you know, 40 minutes of free connection time?  So what's the next topic?  I was setting you up for another softball.  You let it go, John.  He's waiting for the miners to have a good play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's plenty of softballs from you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Scary thought.  So how about the massive system requirements on Vista or the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What are the system requirements?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's the main memory?  The main memory actually, if you really want it to actually function,  for the 64-bit, they're talking about 2 gigabytes.  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Windows Vista 32-bit will work ideally at 1 gigabyte.  The minimum is 512, excuse me, 1 gigabyte.  The minimum is 512 megabytes.  And for the 64-bit, because of the way it's handling data,  they're recommending 2 gigabytes.  That's cheap nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's nothing to get worked up about.  But you can't upgrade.  The problem is, that's the problem, is that you're pushing the limit.  What's the max this thing will handle?  Will it handle 8?  I would hope so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, what's really actually kind of scary is the graphics requirements,  because it's basically rendering everything out.  Everything's a vector on the screen now.  It's not bitmapping, which means...  For performance on graphics, for 2D graphics,  you need 128 or 256 megabytes of memory.  Plus, it'll help if you have PCI Express on your video card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is that like Quartz Extreme?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's similar to that.  My laptop has 128 megs of VRAM.  I mean, it's not standard, but it's...  You actually had a special order, but that's because you wanted to use motion.  Right, right.  But it's not that far away from OS X, I have to admit, because it's...  I mean, OS X, I mean, you can send without a gigabyte of RAM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's just...  No, it works fine at 512.  It works fine.  Yeah, how much is in your notebook?  And how much is in the system at home?  And how much is in the other system at home?  No, I have a couple with 512, and it works fine.  Those are owned by the children, though, right?  Yeah, the children.  I just wanted to make sure we had that clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iChat works great at 512.  No, no, you can use it in 512, but you're right.  I mean, it likes more.  But I have to say, I mean, right now, both Mac and Windows XP, 512 is good,  and you don't get a huge bump, unless you're using high-end applications,  going over 512, you get incremental increases.  But this sounds like you're going to start at a gigabyte...  It's going to be interesting.  ...for decent performance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The other thing that's going to be interesting is, from what they're saying,  is none of the available TFT monitors are going to be able to play HDDVD or Blu-ray,  because they're all going to require an HDCP monitor.  Oh, then that's for copy protection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Oh, that's pathetic.  I'm telling you, these guys are killing themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think DRM is going to drag my copy of Hollywood all the way to the bottom of the sea,  because there's no way to... it's just not going to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's going to drag Apple to the bottom of the sea, too.  I mean, I think Apple is in the same boat.  Any big company that wants to be in bed with the movie companies and the record companies  is going to have to support this stuff.  I mean, I don't think it's a good thing, you're right,  but I think that it's going to hurt Apple as much as it hurts Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that depends on how fast IPTV expands.  There's a lot of people who can be successful without copy protection,  and if those niche markets start to explode...  I don't mean us sitting around the table.  I mean, if Wired magazine, for instance, decided it wanted to run its own little show, for instance,  they'd have half a million viewers on show one.  They'd have a million viewers on show two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's inevitable. I think the current structure is going to collapse.  It's timing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But for them, copying it around is just marketing.  They don't need to do any DRM. They don't need to slow it down.  And if magazines like that start to push down the path, it's...  How do they make money off it?  They don't need to.  The thing is...  They've got to pay for the bandwidth.  How do they pay for the bandwidth?  BitTorrent.  You do some kind of variant of BitTorrent, you're talking about a $500...  That raises an interesting question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree with you that BitTorrent makes everything cheap.  Do you think we're going to see peer-to-peer technologies be mainstreamed so that they're easy to use?  I mean, right now it's only geeks can use it.  I mean, that's key to this all working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think people are going to build it if someone doesn't...  It only needs another layer to make BitTorrent very usable.  Well, then you put it in...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what will happen.  Somebody will put it in a client and just say, don't ask.  Just keep running the client or always run in the background.  And then people are going to read the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, in the early days of Napster, there was a lot of people that didn't realize they were uploading and downloading at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think people will scream bloody hard.  Yeah, if you're doing 4.5 gigabytes of video, you might notice that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, at the Pixil Core, we're working on a player that just sits in the background and just constantly is uploading and downloading.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you think people are going to freak out when they say, well, wait a minute, you want me to run this all the time?  And our ISP is going to freak out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it just depends on whether it's throttled or not.  I mean, if you start...  I mean, I throttle my BitTorrent at 16 kilobytes a second.  That's fine.  Exactly. So if you throttle it, because you don't need...  If you have 2,000 or 3,000 people uploading at 10 kilobytes a second, it's going to be enough to supply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've never seen that many at one time.  But that's what I'm saying is that this isn't going to work unless it's universal.  Everybody's going to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one of those things where you need not just a small subset, you need a lot of people to kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look what happened with the video of our last Twitcast.  Because Kevin made a video, it's 500 megabytes.  And for the first five hours...  Couldn't they compress it a little more than that?  Well, it was an hour and a half.  But a lot of it was you.  Yeah, right.  They couldn't compress my ass.  I had a good line in that about the panning.  It was very funny, and I didn't get it until I listened back and I said, oh, I get now what he was talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They needed those wide screens.  Panoramic, panoramic lenses.  Yeah, panoramic lenses.  I get it.  A week later.  Trying to slip them in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that kind of a weird dichotomy?  I mean, everyone's pushing higher depth, but everyone wants smaller files.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is a big file.  This is what a 30 megabyte file.  But people have kind of gotten used to that.  But you go to 500, all of a sudden, there was a lot of complaints.  And the BitTorrent client in the first few hours is saying, it's going to take you 11 days to get this file.  Eventually, when enough people seeded, it's now pretty quick.  Three or four days later, it's very quick.  But in the first few hours, it's like...  And if it weren't very popular, and if you didn't have a lot of people who are leaving their client open...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Once you get used to cascading, though.  Yeah, once you get used to using BitTorrent, you don't pay attention to that stuff.  You just run it, and then you hope to God that when you come back, the thing is downloaded.  It's another Ron Popeel.  Set it and forget it.  It's a total crap shoot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's who needs to market it.  We need to get Ron Popeel for BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would do it.  In the Pixelcore, we'll actually send out as much as two terabytes to everyone.  Two terabytes of transfer.  It'll be up to two or three gigabytes to get it to the client.  It'll be up to everyone in the Pixelcore.  Hundreds.  To maybe a thousand to two thousand people.  And that all happens, but the thing is they all come to it almost at the same time.  You cascade it a little bit, so ten people have it, then a hundred people have it, and then you tell everyone, go get it.  That's how you have to manage the release.  You have to roll in releases.  If you have an automated system, you can do that automatically.  Instead of having the current dog pile.  Exactly.  You hit a ten, and then you hit a hundred, and then you hit a thousand.  You can measure bandwidth.  There's all kinds of ways to handle it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's certainly how systems being handled, but it's kind of a private system that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  An Akamai style distributed server.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, where you're actually basically using an Akamai style set up to seed regional servers or regional boxes that'll host BitTorrent for people to download from.  But it still also requires people to actually leave that upstream.  So they can get up after they get theirs downloaded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We found that 60% of... I mean, you would upload by the time you downloaded it, you uploaded 60% of what you had downloaded just in the period of time that you were downloading.  So it actually doesn't require...  How many people? How many concurrent users?  That was probably three, four hundred at a time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be interesting to see what happens when you get up to 30,000 or 40,000 and how it starts to scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's how it's going to have to scale. You just talked about half a million people a week. Well, you're going to have to scale very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, because we're dealing with this getting ready for MacBreak, because MacBreak will be a big...  How big is that going to be?  We're guessing it'll be four or five hundred megs. We're doing some tests. We may be shooting it...  MacBreak actually may be 960 by 540, which is bigger than broadcast.  Yeah, people are sticking to these four by three and you don't have to.  We're looking at shooting on the Sony Z1Us.  That's what I used.  Actually, their lenses are...  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's a really good camera if you just have it set up in a single spot and you have it pushed in.  But if you actually have it pull out a little bit, it's actually really hard to get a clear focus.  So the lens has some curvature in the corners?  Yeah, it's a Carl Zeiss lens, so it's like the last thing you'd think would happen.  Yeah, that's the Carl Zeiss that doesn't really exist anymore. It's the Sony front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a brand name that they...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of funny because I think the old X-L1 lens, the fluorite lens is actually better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the X-L1 lenses are by far better. The other one is the JVC, which is a little more expensive.  They've got all... You can really put on some great lenses.  There's also a JVC HD...  These are all HD?  HDV. The big one that everyone's waiting for is the HVX200 from Panasonic.  A lot of us are holding our breath.  I thought that was supposed to be out by now.  It might have been, but it looks like it'll actually hit stores in December.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't really want to do internet video in HD though, do you? I mean, the file section is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but don't you want to get it in HD just in case? You can always down...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not like you're recording a football game or the Olympics or something.  You know, your letterman just switched to HD, at least locally. Maybe he's nationally had it before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I watch HD.  Leno's been HD for a while.  Well, he was one of the originals.  So I'm watching this. The show is just so much nicer. I don't care. There's no reason to watch.  You're right. A football game is great in HD, but just to watch the regular show...  It's just a better experience. It's crystal clear, and you can see the lettering on the cup.  There's all kinds of details you can deal with. There's no comparison.  If you don't shoot it that way to begin with, there's no...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you can't go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and that's what John's saying, is shoot it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why the best stuff that's going to show up as HD in the follow-up market is going to be stuff that was shot on film.  These sitcoms that are shot on video, if they weren't shot in HD to begin with...  Look, they're fuzzy looking when you see them on it. I use a big projector, so I have like a 90 inch image.  And so, you know, when you look at anything, it's just like, this is so fuzzy.  What kind of projector do you have?  I use a Toshiba.  What's the resolution?  It's something ridiculous. It's hot looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love projectors. You have a dark room, and I mean, that's beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's two problems. One, you got to be... it's not during the day, you're not going to get anywhere.  You got to be within a...  Well, you have to be... there's a distance issue, but the other thing is they make noise.  And people keep overlooking the factor.  There's a fan, and that's projected. The better the lumens, the noisier the fan.  Because it's really hot when it turns on.  It's really hot.  So you have to turn everything way up, you know, to drown out the fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other reason for a tech show is because more resolution means the screens will look better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Screenshots are going to be key. And you have to be higher resolution than the screenshots.  So you have to be better than 1024x768.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or close to it. Like when we get to 960x540, we're getting an image that's actually reasonable to look at.  And that's what we're kind of considering.  But we're looking at 500 megs probably for half an hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're doing 150, and the number one thing we're getting is for the digital live TV.  And people want a 30 megabyte download versus 150 megabyte download.  What is it going to look like, a 30 megabyte?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to look good like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To get something that's small, you end up, even with H.264, you end up going down to a 320x240 screen.  For a 480x360, which is what we stream the program out live, getting anything below 100 to 150 megabytes is extremely difficult.  We get it floating around, 120 megabytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We started just doing HD of all our HD capable games.  You shoot HD?  For certain interviews I do shoot HD, and then for all the HD capable games they record them, the gameplay.  Add HD, why not? And they can always down sample.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kind of want to do it just because we can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It'll be interesting to see how many people download half a gigabyte of video.  I think they will. These are early adopters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's still a niche market, but you're still talking about 30 or 40 million people that have BitTorrent.  And more will get it. Like a Mac show, there isn't another Mac show to compete with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The ideal, though, I think is to have a dedicated client for the program.  That's where we're going.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That does all the BitTorrent for you, and it's just kind of automatic.  I have this horrible vision of the CNN client on my desktop, and the CBS client, and the Mac show client.  There's got to be a killer app client. There's got to be one. Maybe Colin will do one.  What about the DLTV software that's floating around? Have you used that at all?  Which software? Is it DLTV? Is that what it's called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not an Elgato.  It's designed for internet television.  I haven't played with that at all.  It's mapped only right now?  Is it mapped only? Yeah.  Is it an external box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it's basically software that runs on OS X right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we have some more stories that we want to cover?  Or should we go to our audience questions? I haven't even been timing this.  We're at 448. We started at 413.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, there's apparently a new hole in Firefox.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a big hole. But it's that IDN again.  It's the international domain name system with these non-English characters.  That's been a problem before. Safari had that problem. I think Firefox had that problem before.  There's a patch. It's very easy. In fact, you can just do it yourself by going about config in Firefox and turning off the IDN support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This one sounds more like a regular buffer overflow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is. It's a buffer overflow taking advantage of the fact that when you use these non-standard character sets in the URL, the range checking somehow breaks and allows you to do a buffer overflow attack.  It's serious. There's no exploits out there.  Firefox, and this is a good example of the difference between open source and Microsoft, Firefox had a workaround up within 12 hours.  They haven't got the patch as we speak, but I'm sure they will.  It's an easy thing to fix. It's not... well, I'm sorry, it's not an easy thing to fix. It's an easy thing to work around by turning off international character sets in your domain names, but that will break a lot of websites.  That would be bad.  Well, I don't know. There must be Arabic websites and Chinese websites, websites we don't know about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can cut out the Russian spam that way though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't get any spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Three, two, one. John Dvorak gets no spam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Of course, the question is, did you get all your email?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, it's a long story.  Yeah, don't get it started out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, this is a good tagline though. I'm jealous. I don't have a tagline. That's a good tagline. Look at this. People know it.  It's not your fault.  No, that's a lousy tagline.  So, if people have questions... Matt, why don't you... Matt's very comfortable and I don't want to get you up and everything, but...  But get up.  Time to be an intern. Matt Granowitzky, our intern and man about town is going to pass right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all we had for the news this week. Is that it? It's a light week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  eBay is trying to buy Skype is the rumor. China Telecom is blocking Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, didn't someone just buy IGN?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  IGN got sold, yeah.  IGN, Fox, basically News Corp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fox is going crazy buying up stuff.  News Corp buys MySpace. Now they bought IGN.  Rupert Murdoch is back in the net, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you remember that Murdoch built in New York City a giant internet studio like seven years ago and they never put it online?  Let's go use it.  It would be great. It was not just a TV studio. It was like a newsroom. He had this kind of massive crazy scheme.  I never heard this story.  I wish I could remember the... Does it ring a bell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You remember?  Intel sent a bunch of Ymax equipment or pre-Ymax equipment to Louisiana.  That was the other interesting story.  Yeah, that did a lot of good.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Thank you, Intel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How come it's not working?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No power.  ...the Ymax cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's crazy. That's like Intel saying, here's a chance to make an ad.  Or it could be Intel saying...  Maybe they'll set up the police department.  That's different. They have to do both ends.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think they were just sending a bunch of routers to a PO box.  If you find this box, use it to save people.  You don't know that fact.  No, I don't. They couldn't just send it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You don't know that fact. That's a possibility.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're the only person who thinks more cynically than I do.  Because they could literally send it to a post office box and say,  we've sent equipment to support the effort.  Hey, whatever works for their marketing department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a good press release.  Let's take some questions from the audience.  Matt, you've got the microphone?  Yes, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a question for the camera geek over there.  I don't mean John.  That's a 20D, right? Canon 20D?  This is Alex Lindsay.  This is the Canon 20D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a D70 before, and now I have a 20D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You dumped them just because of the ROF encryption stuff?  Let's talk about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let me talk about why I left my D70 in Africa.  It wasn't because Zimbabwe was taking it from me.  You were a Nikon user before?  I was. Here's the worst part.  He was the guy who got me to buy a D70.  It's a great camera.  I got a D70 right when it came out.  I was really happy with it.  $6,000 in glass. Totally committed.  You got some glass you want me to borrow?  I do. Talk to me.  I got a little less.  I bought a bunch of lenses. I was really happy with it.  going, can you give me the SDK for the camera?  The reason is we do a lot of camera control stuff.  everything else to shoot what we call HDRs.  That Nikon View program is all they gave you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What?  That was the only way they let you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was garbage.  The thing is, I gave them about a year.  It was about a year going back and forth.  Then finally, I just decided, what turned it was that  when I really started paying attention, Nikon encrypted the raw format,  which they opened up real quickly because Tom Noll whacked them on the head.  Tom Noll of Photoshop.  One of the Photoshop founders.  Between that and then I was actually visiting someone who had camera control  that really was working really well with the Canon.  I just decided, I'm moving over.  I have to say that I really like the 20D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My friend who shoots for Reuters dumped his Nikon,  years and years of Nikons and went to the Canon as well.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have been for a long time.  They've been around since the beginning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Their digitals are better than anybody's right now, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, at the high end.  Markov bought one of the little, I told him not to do it.  The G5 is okay.  an alpha, 4 megapixel, 5 megapixel.  The thing doesn't focus and he complains bitterly.  A lot of the little cameras are not very good.  This little one I've got is good.  Which one do you have, the Nikon?  I've got the little Minolta.  I've had that for ages.  Well, I've had it for a year because it's still one of the really cool little cameras.  It takes great pictures, always in focus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember Patrick of Dimash and loved it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody liberated it from me in Vegas at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Someone took my Nikon, not the same one, I had another Nikon,  and it got liberated in Vegas at NAB.  I was very...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it might be happy where it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you know anything about the astronomy version of the Canon cameras?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know nothing about it.  I think it's a 20D-A.  That's right, yeah, DA.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The CCD or the CMOS actually will record infrared.  They took the filter off this.  Yeah, they took the filter off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a lot of people wonder why.  If you go back, in fact, there's a whole school of people who shoot infrared with digital cameras,  and they either pull the filter off or they find one of the older cameras.  I happen to have one, which I kind of toyed around with,  that do not have the filter on them at all.  And you can tell usually by taking it...  If you can see a remote control gun in the camera on the CCD,  if you see a white light coming out of it, that tends to mean that there's no filter.  And there's a lot of Olympuses that are this way.  With that camera, you can take and put all those black filters on and make it...  So cool.  And you can take close to an infrared picture as you could possibly make with infrared film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jack Davis, the Photoshop guy, had one on the cruise and was taking pictures.  It's amazing.  But they look weird.  What are you going to do with it?  It's decoration.  How did you do that?  Chlorophyll looks different, so it pops out at you.  The trees are all white.  It's very interesting.  And of course for astronomy, you'd get a whole different view of the galaxy out there.  But you still would want to hook it up to a telescope, I think.  Oh, absolutely.  Oh yeah, they have mounts.  You mount it up to a telescope.  Well, thank you. Are you a photographer, sir?  Yeah, I'm a photographer and astronomer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's your name?  Todd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And where did you come from?  Seattle.  Yeah, I heard about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice.  I wasn't paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love the show.  That's great.  We'll be here every Sunday at Twits and Noonan's.  I'm calling it Twits.  I've renamed the bar.  I think that would be good, wouldn't it?  That's a good name for a bar.  Twits, yeah.  Noonan's Bar and Grill at Larkspur Landing.  And by the way, we're going to wrap this up pretty soon because Alex took the ferry,  and a number of you took the ferry.  It's a beautiful ride over from San Francisco.  It's gorgeous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the last one's 530.  I didn't even know it ran on Sunday.  We got buzzed by F-18s. It was great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How long is the ride?  About 45 minutes.  And what was the F-18s doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wait, Fleet Week, isn't it?  No, I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's next month.  There's a guy with the camera.  I was enjoying it.  Shoot him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any other questions before we...  Oh, yeah, they want your Nano.  It's up to you, Alex.  It's very cool, I have to say.  If it doesn't come back, it's not our fault.  Yeah, exactly.  That's my tagline.  It's not my fault.  Anybody else have a question?  Go ahead, Mr. Claw over here.  We still haven't had any Claw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've got to get our glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We were hoping you'd forget.  Actually, my question is a little bit Claw-related.  I'm wondering who's actually going to try some,  and how many of you actually are planning to eat here anytime soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I have to run, and I think probably...  but I hear it's very good food, so...  You're going to stay for dinner, yeah?  Normally I would, but I can't tonight.  We'll probably stick around once in a while.  Once in a while, we'll have a special dinner.  But we, frankly, didn't expect an audience tonight,  because we didn't publicize it too much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.  This was a trial run.  And what I don't have is a PA system,  But thank you all for coming, we appreciate it.  Any other questions, or anybody want to keep the Nano?  Well, that's Sarah.  By the way, that is Sarah, that's Patrick Norton's wife.  She's actually doing homework, it looks like.  She's doing homework.  Work, work, she's not in school.  She's not in school anymore.  It's grown-up work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay, well I guess that's that.  You want to wrap it up?  I think it's time to wrap it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's time to wrap it up.  Any other big stories?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We better have some better stories next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the damn tech world better do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's going to be kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, this is what we should do.  It's coming next week, John could like tease us.  There's a big announcement when? Wednesday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  From a major software or hardware?  Let's just put it this way, there's going to be a little more speed on your wireless.  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alright.  Oh, he won't say.  Is it cellular or what?  No, no, no, no, this doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you got the tip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what they do in the McLaughlin group,  Wrong.  It's always, whatever.  Dvorak's prediction of the week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just make sure you call him on next week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, we don't want to do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, there's nothing, it'll never happen.  Seriously, I mean, this is all, you know.  John knows all.  I got the teaser in advance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Alright, here's our claw.  Before we go, we really, we really do have to put,  do we need sugar?  We need sugar for the claw.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We need a lot of sugar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, not a lot, a lot could kill you.  A lot of claw, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're a coffee drinker, Patrick.  Why don't you pour some, are those glasses of ice?  Just pour some and hand it around.  I mean, we can't really leave without.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, unfortunately, I can't.  Clawing ourselves.  Oh, yeah.  I'm not allowed.  Where's that red wine that was supposed to go?  Yeah, we were supposed to, in Zimbabwe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've got a nice looking wine cellar.  Yeah, I'm looking at that.  I promise, what's your name?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, Dvorak, I promise.  I'm a witty banter.  I think it's time to wrap up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The banter needs a little more witty.  Alright, that's a very important thing.  But first, ladies and gentlemen, it's claw time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They brought over a full ice.  If you home brew hyper beverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you trip and spill that, your name will be claw.  And it does look like mud, doesn't it?  So again, this is a high caffeine drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's kind of a tribute to New Orleans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what actually this is?  This is from the Dragon Riders of Pern.  This is a drink from a novel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Give that to Roger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't drink coffee.  It smells like a coffee drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is a coffee drink.  This could be the last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would analyze it as a kind of a bitter chai.  It is chai because that's the cinnamon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I actually like it.  Daniel, it's delicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it wasn't Balls that sponsored the screen savers very briefly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, they also did the helper fund.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what happened?  We had some guy on who was the world's dumbest website.  Websites that suck.  He came on and he raped the Balls website.  I shouldn't say it that way.  And ripped the Balls website.  That sounds bad too.  He came on and he disparaged the Balls website.  And the Balls people got ballistic.  And they canceled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they had too much of their own drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It wasn't a very good website.  It was loaded with guaranar or something.  That stuff gives me a splitting headache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really?  Don't go to Brazil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's like all they drink in Brazil.  I think this is delicious.  You could put roofies in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Talk about a poor man's speed ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think we really have milked this as long as we can.  So I want to thank you all for being here.  We'll see you next week.  We'll be back at noon.  It's 4pm, our tape time.

Transcript:  All going into 75 homes scattered around North America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the same people downloading it again and again.  We thank whoever you are for downloading it half a million times.  We do thank AOL Radio for providing the bandwidth.  Right at the perfect time.  Exactly when iTunes Music Store started doing podcasting.  If they hadn't, I don't know what we'd be doing.  We'd be on iTunes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'd be on BitTorrent.  We were serving a fair amount of data over BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  BitTorrent is still a big...  A lot of people still get it by BitTorrent.  I think about 70% of our downloads are through iTunes and off of AOL.  We thank you all for that.  We thank all of you for being here.  Another tweet is in the can.  Bye bye.
