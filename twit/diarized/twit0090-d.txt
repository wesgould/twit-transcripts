Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and andy anotko is here who is very wisely decided not to be anotko dot com

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  believe it or not it was years before i reserved that domain because i  figured that  who the hell is going to be able to spell it even if they do want to nab it from me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i still have to look it up every time i send you an email i must confess  it's a security feature  but you know what he's got a great  url cwob dot com

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yes the colossal waste of bandwidth i like to deliver what i promise in  terms of web content

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  now there's yellow text but then that's your kind of like your blog right

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yes that's my blog it's written completely i use my own blog software written  completely with apple script  and now i'm starting to get a small yeah exactly i i wrote my first blog app in  nineteen ninety five before there was such a word  uh... and i've just been adding more and more features to it ever since  although i don't know why is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and you want to commercialize it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because it's apple script he can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  exactly well because i don't want to support it it's bad enough that i have to  support user number one  you know if you think steve jobs is a big jerk to write software for it you  know think about having me to say how come i can't do trackbacks  well any because it would take us ten days to write the software for it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's all  uh... i didn't realize this is running on apple script so it's not is it running on a  mac in your bedroom

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no it's it's entirely client-based it's just running off of a often f t p server  tied on to  uh... friends of mine's t one  uh... that's part of the fun and part of the challenge because i don't really  care about or know about actually more to the point  writing server-side software so this is in a web server-based  it's not any it you can run it off of uh... your i-disk you can run off of any  f t p account  it runs completely off apple script as a matter of fact the word for the text  editor is text edit  or bb edit or microsoft word or whatever you want to use

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  why don't you throw it into the open source community then you don't have to  do anything

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you know i'm actually thinking about what to do with this code because  my users for some reason they uh... i don't know what kind of perfume got  dropped in the air three months ago but suddenly they're saying why can't we do  comments and how come you don't like this and blah blah blah and yeah i mean that would

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  solve the problem you would have to do any supported because these guys once  they learned that the code they would start doing it themselves  and you'd end up and if it was done with a normal g p l ms has to be shared  you'd end up right even up your own blog software be great it's brilliant

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right exactly but but the part of the only thing that really has it that i'm  really hesitant about is that this the same reason why when like  companies needed to be giving a look at confidential briefing they don't get it  to come into my office to give it to me because i don't want to see how i live  yeah i also don't want to see it but people see how i write code it's almost  as a  underwear in the bottom underneath your printer server you know what bill gates

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  writes code like that i understand so i guarantee that's the main reason why so

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  much software is not open source is pure embarrassment

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no you know it's not yeah i don't even think is that so much you know that it's  the guys out there  and i don't want to call them weenies but there's a bunch of guys out there that  have really nothing better to do to then to be sh hyper critical about something  that's given to them for free  it sounds like that would be pretty  because i'm one of those hyper critical jerk-offs but generally speaking i'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not that mean you're not a weenie about it and and that which reminds me of  of merlin's former biggest fan brent  yes brent yeah what was it might your former number one fan your biggest fan

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah exactly it's the notion of the notional character that everybody has  who uh who now has everything they do  it's got a neck beard he kind of sits there next to the dryer in his parents  basement makes mountain dew and types types witty retorts  he's the guy. what does that say about your regular fans? no no no no. i like the idea of the neck beard

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  very very good looking so you think you grow in lieu of a jawline

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well yeah not all of us are lucky enough to have a jaw so did you register

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anotco.com or no? i do have anotco.com and the reason why is because i  realized that i have a cousin in australia who has a little boy and that  it would just plain kill me if one christmas he wanted to get anotco.com  for thirty dollars as a christmas present so i decided to dash all the hopes of  every other anotco in the genetic line are there are there are there are believe  it or not they allow us to breed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is it an indian tribe or is it hawaiian what is it we try to we try to spread

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  ourselves rather thickly because it's essential to the survival of our planet  that one anotco be alive to to slay balal in 300 years time really it's all  for you that we're doing this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  thank you and welcome to this week in genealogy. hey brother. i didn't i didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  want to come up and say it. that's a deteriorate from a nice open source discussion to some sort of a weird thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  i liked your openness i really liked your open source discussion i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah i think you're right on that there's so many i actually have some  friends who would like nothing better than never have to commit another  another another commission into into subversion they would love to open it up  and give it away but it's a little bit like the first time you invite the maid  over to come and clean your house so what are you going to do exactly and these guys  it's a Danny Danny O'Brien calls these secret scripts like every geek has these  little very embarrassing little shell scripts they never want anybody to see

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and you gotta get in shape. the community would clean it up eventually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bill gates code i've seen bill gates code there was a great book which i think  it's out of print microsoft press printed it but i i highly recommend you  try to find a used copy. i think it was barbarians and bill gates. no it was  barbarians at the bill gates. no barbarians and and bill gates. this one was  called programmers at work and they interviewed a bunch of programmers  including Charles Simonia who talked about his hungarian notation but which  is fascinating but then bill gates was interviewed and they actually have code  from the original basic he's very proud of that code. yes you would be talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about interviews with 19 programmers who shaped the computer industry by susan  lamers you have it all simonian i have it three feet away from me in my bookshelf

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's one of my favorite books. let's start reading some code from it. i think

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  gates' code is in the back but it's assembler code of course for 6502 i

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  think is the first basic. the first basic had to be for an 8080. no no no

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it was for z it was might be a z80 it was for the no no no it couldn't have  been a z80. it was for the iMSI. oh it would be an 88. yeah yeah yeah you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right yeah that's exactly right. i have to here it is he is in the in the  appendix a portion of the original source code for 8080 basic written by  bill gates and paul anan in 1975. i think paul did most of that coding. there's always a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  debate over that you've you've always been of the opinion that paul did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well there's two things I'm of the opinion of one that paul did most of  that coding and b that the code it wasn't a lot of original code in there  was all taken from deck 10 basic. oh interesting because bill was bill in at

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  least in that book is very proud of the uh uh brevity of the code and the  compactness of it and how much he was able to get done. i've heard people say  this was this is brilliant code but so that but you know you never know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but it was the truth about it. well there's a guy that was at the story i'm  talking about which is in one of these books i think it was barbarians and bill  gates which is written by one of the daughters of the Wagner etztrom people i  can't remember which that's which one of them and a guy who used to i guess he  who married her and he used to be a coder at microsoft and he was taking  bill gates's code and just shredding it for being just terrible. oh interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well maybe it was brent his former biggest fan. we don't know. large blocks

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of this large blocks of this are largely available in other places. i'll tell you where there is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  problem is microsoft's one care security suite once again now there have been a  couple of tests of this av comparatives which is an austrian project to test the  effectiveness of anti-virus code ranked it dead last and all the products it  tested it was the only one to do less than 80 but worse than 80 percent. i'm  sure which one was this? microsoft's own anti-virus. oh yeah. windows one care or  live one care. in fact they're not going to they may not even include it in  future tests it was that bad. virus bulletin also showed that one care failed  to completely protect users of vista that's another independent third-party  comparative test it scored 91 percent for windows viruses macros worms and  scripts 79 percent for detecting back towards trojans and other malware and 82

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  percent for its overall detection rate. very what was the best one they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  said? i think maybe kaspersky which is of course john's favorite or has been for a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  long time. well yeah i think it's i think kaspersky came in like third there was a  couple other ones you know what i'm using now though i'm you and i hate you  know i used to use kaspersky but i'm using the free version of avg. it ain't  bad. it's not bad it's free and it updates itself and it doesn't pester you  for to spend money and it doesn't screw up your system and i i put it on a  number of machines and it just seems to work fine and they have a spyware  version you have to have to install two of these things. here's the top here's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the top and by the way the best one only did 99.45 percent so they all  miss some viruses avk don't know what that is trust port avira f secure which  i've lost liked for a long time then kaspersky and escan then semantic which  is not the same as as norton i don't think then nod 32 avg is eighth on that  list now that's the first free one on that list i think although f secure does  have a free dos only product bit defender fortinet avast also free  norman oh there's the f prot that's the free one  mcafee dr web and microsoft at the bottom now the community has never

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  gotten together and produced one big armageddon style antivirus kit that the  entire community was going to support the entire community was the idea behind

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  clam av which is an open source antivirus you know they you know there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a slight backstory here now and i think it also explains why the community can't  get together first of all you're dealing with a bunch of the guys who are into  this business are extremely nerdy and they're in the get these guys to agree  on how to do stuff is pretty hard but what and they do have actually they have  these huge meetings of all these guys and they try to like make sure that they  all have a good product and microsoft used to be a member of this club of you  know these these high-end coders and they would share you know d they would  all share different kinds of detail and then when microsoft decided to do their  own thing i think they were blackballed from the group because i everyone i had  a number of meetings with some of these people who did nothing but bitterly  complain about microsoft coming into the game after stealing all their ideas  because supposedly everybody was opening the kimono as it were and telling each  other all kinds of secrets and then microsoft meanwhile has taken notes and  next thing you know they bring out a product this really steam these guys up  so i wouldn't surprise me if these guys aren't submarineing microsoft now

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that by the way the semantic was norton antivirus so it actually scored fairly  high i'm surprised because i'm not not been a family of norton and the avk  trying to find more information about that i'm not familiar with that one but  that's the one that that one easily it's it's a multi-way to me i'm sorry  avk contains is a multi-engine product that contains kaspersky plus a vast the  free antivirus so in a way kaspersky did win when it was it combined with a vast  interesting you know what microsoft acquired that any virus product they  didn't design it from scratch

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right you know you're right  they didn't design it from scratch but they did but they've obviously updated  apparently not much well you know everything that they buy of course they  tend to it'll deteriorate i just hate to keep them pointing the finger at  microsoft for doing this but with front page that's a good example of a product  that they buy was pretty usable when it when it just was just bought and then it  over time it just got worse and worse and i don't know what they do there but  you think that they would make the product better

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  front page still exists hasn't it? has it gone the way of public? it's been phased out in 2007 hasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah they phased it out something else instead but it's probably just front page  with a new name

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well i think they're gonna you know that aren't they trying to get everyone to use  word to do all that stuff now? no that's the worst that's the worst

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well there is good news no security patches on Tuesday so everything must be  perfect  oh wait a minute no that's not the case there are in fact at least five  vulnerabilities waiting to be fixed but they're not going to fix them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  don't they also have to send out a patch to get everyone's uh...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's been done that was done last... or the daylight savings time? yeah daylight savings time  and if you're listening to this and you think it's actually eleven it's really  midnight  just so you know  don't  no Microsoft and Apple both pushed patches in the last thirty days to fix  the daylight savings time zones

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well talking of Apple patches we've got the new iTunes as our... 7.1  which does  not a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well apparently you know we talked about this in MacBreak Weekly and by the way we  were gonna make a ground rule since we have two MacBreak Weekly fellas on here  that we were gonna kind of limit the Mac conversation and this will... this is a  Windows application too

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah we're talking about Windows version

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  does the Windows version do that full screen cover flow?  it must

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  don't they have the parity cross platform?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  apart from that yeah but it... what is it  it doesn't still quite work on Vista does it? oh really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I haven't tried it. Well apparently... oh for Vista, yeah they haven't... have they patched it for Vista?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought I saw something that they fixed that this week  some of it works but they still haven't fixed the problem where it might trash  your iPod if you try to update it. Okay don't do it. Don't do it!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that's a known issue  that's a... yes  yeah but it's not a fixed issue

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's less of a known issue than a way of finally selling some Zune players

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I interviewed in fact if you want to hear it, Dave Colton from the Zune team  on Windows Weekly on Friday and  he actually you know I have to say  and this... you want to hate Microsoft. It's easy to hate them when it's a monolithic  company when it's not real people it's easy to say bad things about them  but then you meet these guys and they're smart they're funny they're  intelligent and it's like it's hard it's... Dave... and then they quit  and then they get a better job. No Dave was great and I think you know  he... I said what's with welcome to the social would you explain it to me?  and he said well he was very diplomatic but essentially said yeah you  better ask the marketing team what that means because I don't know either

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sometimes it just seems like they're the Microsoft and I totally agree with you I  went on a Microsoft trip last year and I was just blown away by how intelligent  the folks I met were but sometimes it just feels like whatever the opposite of  Eggish Dalt is where it seems like they've got all these people who are  doing this amazing work but the pieces just don't sometimes don't seem to fit

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  together I think I've always found the Microsoft people at that level to be  great it's there's some layer of management that's a problem and I've  had talked to people about this and I've discussed it with in some columns which  is there's a there's one layer that formed at Microsoft and it's always  slowly forming which I think is corroding the company and you can talk  to Microsoft people about this and they most of them will agree with it of guys  who were in the company early and they were heavy-duty coders and they you  know and they're like most of the really best coders they're very introverted and  they burn out I mean they all tend to have followed the same pattern they're  really good when they're about until they get to about 27 years old and it  starts to fall apart so that by the time they're getting to the 30s they decided  that you know they want to be designers and then they move up and they decide  out of the blue with no experience or skills that they want to be managers and  they want to lead projects and you end up with this layer of these people that  can't manage their way out of a paper sack and making decisions in a  very strange structured company that that were the employee and the or the  the boss and the and the underling they grade each other on this five-point  scale that's just very complicated they force rank I think they force ranked  teams there what's that mean right what's that mean that's they they grade

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  basically if you got five people on your team two people get a big bonus one  person get does okay and two people are encouraged to find other opportunities I  mean it's I think it's am I wrong knives well yeah you're kind of wrong completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right you can you don't if you have a five-man team two of them don't get  fired I mean it depends on how the grading works out when they start to  grade each other so they end up kissing each other's asses to such an extreme  and then they're working for a guy who doesn't know what he's doing or can't make it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  assume I mean it's not that's certainly not unheard of in the in the tech field  but I mean it's supposedly that's a again this is I've never worked at  Microsoft it's just what I hear from people but that's that's within a team  now we're not talking within a BU we're talking within like that you know the  people that are in the next cube so I mean I don't know you're saying that  Microsoft eats its young basically well no they it's a it's definitely it's a  meritocracy and you get they measure the rings under your eyes each night and see  how you're doing yeah but that's not you know that's not a meritocracy that's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  some sort of sick

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean I stories that they would notice where you parked in the lot because if  you didn't come in real early you'd be parking George Costanza exactly this

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  is like the X-Files yeah I mean it's like the conspiracy theories actually this

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  brings you back to the movie office space yes which is movie everyone should  go see by the way I finally saw idiocracy what you think I liked it I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  loved it I don't know it I did I saw this for the first time on the video wall  of the Virgin Megastore in San Francisco I stood there for like eight minutes  wondering what the hell is this and I wound up buying it it's a really funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  movie is it by the same guy did office space is that yeah and it's been buried  he did this movie and if you look at it is obviously a high it was not like a  you know mega but I'm so high I it's a high-budget movie a lot of CGI very  expensive looking CGI that doesn't look like a cheap production by any means  it's a really funny story and it's another one of those things where it's  Mike Judge is just a studio it's just that they wouldn't even take a chance

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  apparently something like eight like something like eight or twelve theaters  made a hundred grand and then they just buried it it's very critical of

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  such a wonderful premise yeah the premise is tell him Andy well basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  on the video wall he bought it oh yeah okay so so you're basically dumb and  dumber guy from dude where's my car guy from from our generation basically gets  gets gets gets frozen he wakes up exactly Wilson then he wakes up center  centuries later to find out that society because of corporate mass culture has  become dumber and dumber and dumber with each generation and now he is in fact  the cell genius we're in overbreeding overbreeding by city breeding thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because they mentioned the video they show this very insulting scene where  they have this bunch of hicks that are breeding like crazy and this one girl who  has to be the our woman sorry that has to be the the career woman and doesn't  want to have a baby until they're older and they never have a baby and that  whole group people die off after thousands of years or hundreds of years  and they and all the dummies take over and they get so dumb that they you know

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's just hilarious they're watering their crops with Gatorade because this  corporation is mr. I made it I just put it on my blockbuster queue it's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  number one and the most the most popular TV show is just some guy getting hit in  the groin over and over again and exceedingly more and probably that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube over and over and over they predicted YouTube I'll know that there

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no kiddies going to the toilet while playing the Super Mario theme on the 12

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  stinker towers boil it down to guys getting hit in the groin that don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  worry you got it all boils down to that when you watch it did you did you end up  feeling I ended up feeling kind of melancholy because of how incredibly true  so much of what they were talking about already is that's why I didn't make it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in the full release no I didn't make you because there's some it offended  somebody and that you know I think it could have been a cult classic I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it would have taken off well well it probably will be most cult classics and  cult classics in the movie theater I mean an underground hit I mean I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in the night I don't mean a cult classic like you know a racer head I mean  something that's like you know they would have made money I think would have  made money would have earned back yeah if it would have get been given a chance  but you know and this guy needs to get more work because his stuff is great  meanwhile they're like screwing him over left and right he gets a movie every two  or three years he should be making a movie a year this guy he's really funny

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  needs to team up with the Serenity guy and maybe they could do something

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well then we'll never see anything that guy gets screwed all the time too  Weedon, Josh Weedon. Josh Weedon yeah yeah he's a geek hero yeah he is but I mean  he still he doesn't get enough work I mean you know his stuff is the same

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  thing it's really good stuff okay but he is responsible for the ending to Marvel  Civil War series so I really really have to ask him for $20 of the $100 I was

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  starting to sound like Brent what is the Marvel Civil War series I'm sorry  I don't know about my comic books is this the Captain America? You got a comic book guy voice no no Merlin does

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's below that we need the Frank voice there is a there is a September 11th

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  style disaster in Connecticut that kills several civilians including an elementary  school full of children when a battle against a supervillain group goes  horribly awry the the populace starts to insist that the superheroes become  accountable for their actions and passes the superhero registration act by which

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sounds a little more like the professor yeah professor Frank that's who it is  Frank you just got to screech a little it's a little like the Incredibles it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sort of like in the sense that the superheroes are kind of called to  account for themselves is that the idea right and basically this is a measure

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that like the entire United States citizenry with with reason support  because you know there's a reason why you can't just go out and buy a handgun  and shoot it off without getting a permit being checked out and saying yes  it's okay for you to use in this thing so Iron Man is one of the people who  supports the registration act and chiefly he does it by way of saying well  look we don't want the government making us all into police officers and  controlling us if we set this up and maintaining this ourselves as a  community we'll be able to get things done faster meanwhile Captain America  doesn't like the idea that everybody with superheroes has to tell the  government what your secret identity is and basically essentially they kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm gonna have to just turn over all the cards and play the rat hole  Rat hole!  Because there's just no way  I was waiting for somebody to stop

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do I win? What do I win?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was wondering if he was going to take a breath  Andy man even I don't open rat holes that big  That was good

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Coming from full circle Mike Judge is responsible for the bad ending to this?  No, Joss Sweeten is he responsible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that was swept in and I'll make this 20 seconds long  there was a big meeting where they're discussing  how this was going to go they had all their cards together  Joss Sweeten swaned in for 10 minutes  and I said no, here's the stupidest way to end this  and that's how they did it  Well we can blame Joss Sweeten then

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well maybe  Maybe Joss is a  Alright quickly back to tech  Quick quick quick  I got one I got one let's talk about the Samsung  finally somebody is shipping these hybrid hard disk

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hybrid hard drives you've been dying to see one of these  Do you have one yet Will?  Do you have one yet Will or is this just something you're writing about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No we just we saw that they started shipping them  we haven't actually seen one yet  I've seen like hard I've seen laptop hard disk drives that are entirely flash

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right but this is not that this combines flash with the flatters

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah this is like a pretty lame one  I want the ones designed for the desktops  that has like 500 gigabytes or terabyte  and four or five gigs of flash memory  and that is supposed to be the device that will make Vista sing  because Vista is actually designed to run  We're waiting  I'm telling you you can laugh all you want  but I'm under the impression that that's what makes Vista work

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vista is going to sing step in time step in time  step in time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm amazed that they don't put that on the side of the Vista box  once we get this imaginary technology working

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  fine you'll love it  Hey I'm just reporting back  I got nothing to do with it I'm just telling you what they're telling me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You saw the IBM guy who said that he believed that the Vista really for it to sing required four gigs of RAM

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah no I think that's true too

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So four gigs of RAM  Do you guys have like an activity viewer?  Can you guys like would you wait to see your resources?  You're filling up two or three gigs of RAM

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's why he says that it's actually something that Vista does that's new  It will load into memory more stuff  If the memory is there it essentially will run out of RAM  Not merely the operating system but your applications everything will run out of RAM  if there's the RAM there and it makes a big difference apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you try putting a flash disk into the USB drive because that does really improve things for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the ready boost as opposed to the ready drive  Have you noticed a difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah actually especially application switching  Little housekeeping things seem to work better  I'm actually not I don't have a whole lot of complaints about Vista  It's an improvement over XP I actually like it and is one of my running OS's here in the office  So I shouldn't complain that much

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know it's funny and John's mentioned this before  It's the Mac guys who seem to like Vista the most  True  I don't know why that is  Weird but true

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because Steve told us it's okay to like it because it's just like the Mac it does

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You may like it  BBC here's a chance for everybody to do their bad English accents  Sorry Will  I love you too  No Will you're getting this too  Yours is good actually it's quite good  The BBC was the only really major network anywhere in the world that YouTube could strike a deal with apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a bit of a funny deal though isn't it  Because it's not like we're going to put loads of BBC content on YouTube  As far as I can tell it's like we're going to put loads of promos for BBC content on YouTube  What kind of deal is that?  It's like well awesome so I can go and watch a five minute preview of something  And then go across to BBC and watch the full thing in WMV

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That drives me crazy  You know this is when in the first wave of people like NPR  I should say organizations like NPR putting out podcasts  That was their approach to everything  It was like here's four minutes from a Prairie Home companion  And it's maddening and I'm so glad that they finally came around to putting out full episodes  You know you got shows now like Wait Wait Don't Tell Me  That are seeing an audience base  But I mean but I think of Wait Wait in particular  Because that's a show that I just have to suspect never had anywhere near the audience that they've got now  And I mean you don't make this stuff great by putting out  What are they saying here? Clips like trailers and short features  You know what the nadir of this was?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was when they put a Family Guy podcast up  And it was one of the writers reading a synopsis of the plot

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Without the jokes

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like your local library reading the paper of the vision impaired

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I think the problem with the BBC thing in particular  Is that they're reluctant to put like full programs up on things like YouTube  Because YouTube is accessible from all over the world  And theoretically that stuff is being paid for by the British public  And there's a survey that they did last year that said that British people would be annoyed  If they felt like they were subsidizing the rest of the world to take them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey can't be annoyed

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well then why do they stream everything unreal?  Do you hear the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do not be annoyed  The flaw in this is  Oh my god  What have we done? Everybody in the world can now see the BBC  Oh what a horrible thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You wouldn't want to put BBC Worldwide out there  Oh no  Think about all the money  BBC Worldwide available worldwide?  Holy crap

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The exchange rate of American to the pound is 2 to 1  Believe me we're paying for it at some level  We know that UOS serves the media  Well in that case I'm annoyed

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't bring up the 2 to 1 thing that's really galling  That's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's so good  When you're floating around here  Just load up

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you saying that the pound is worth less than the dollar somehow?  Is that what you're saying here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No it's worth twice as much as it should be worth  So when he comes over here he can buy up the place  He's buying lunch and dinner and beer for everybody  And it's not costing him a penny

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah it's awesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know if you go to San Francisco the place is crawling with French, Brits and Germans  They're all just buying up everything  Oh the dollar's week

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're saying the dollar's week  Look at the hipster posers  There are too many of those in San Francisco

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody's walking around in their top hats and monocles  Hello can I have another scone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you have any tea, Govna?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Big chimneys

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Constantly sweeping, quit sweeping my chimney I say  I don't need your buying power

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We like to do this just to torment Will  And it seems to be weird  You know one thing I've started to notice

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe that's my superhero power is that I can sweep chimneys in like a single second  Oh man we need to have a little page that lists everybody's superpower  I think that's a good idea

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's go on with some more of our content free show here

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alright, Apple, do you want some real content?  Apple is filing a patent for the iPhone lanyard  The lanyard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're kidding me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well they're saying that they're going to build loads of different stuff into lanyards in the future  Like you can have a lanyard that flashes with your heartbeat when you're jogging and stuff  Oh that's interesting  Or you can have a lanyard that actually provides the telephone functionality  Like in the lanyard you can just plug it into your iPod  Do you think that's what that gives you like the phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Called the iLanyard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think that's what Steve's wearing in that surreptitious picture of him at the soccer game?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That really really fuzzy picture  Do you see a phone? Do you see a phone in that picture? Am I the only person who doesn't see a phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's wearing his iPod headphones, they're bright white  The thing is it bugs me because he's at a soccer game for his kid  And the poor guy, somebody's surreptitiously taking pictures of him with their cameras on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  20,000 views on that photo  50,000 when I visited

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What I'm concerned about is that he's at his kid's soccer game and he's wearing his keynote uniform  His superhero suit, he should be in a civilian uniform  Somebody pointed that out  People are going to figure out that he's not Clark Kent, exactly

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all he ever wears is black jeans and black sunglasses

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see the pictures of him having dinner with Bill Gates the other week?  He's actually a giant tattoo  And he's wearing the same thing, he's got the black polo neck

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well maybe Steve Jobs is like the dread pirate Roberts  He has the job for three years, then he finds someone to take over the mantle and the uniform  Convince him he's Steve Jobs and Apple lives and thrives forever

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Andy, I nominate you to be the official nerd historian of the show  I like your references

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  No, it's their new online world that's going to challenge second life  Oh please

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Didn't we talk about this last week or a couple weeks ago?  No, it just sounds familiar

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what they're doing is they have like, if you think of Sony's PlayStation 3  And they've got this big online connectivity  And what they're doing is making a virtual world online  That actually might be fun  Where you can build your own home  And in your home is all your achievements from the games that you've done  And you've got a virtual TV, it's called PlayStation Home  They have a virtual TV where you can watch trailers and you can go and interact with people  You can invite people into your home  This is their way to share stuff with them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It sounds like junk

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It looks more like a shopping mall that you pay $15 a month to go into

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The guys at Sony were really excited that, as well as the PlayStation Home  And as well as your little home  One day there could be a whole in-game world where Levi's could have a home  And Coca-Cola could have a home  You could go and visit Levi's  And I thought, yeah, that sounds fantastic  We're dying for them

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get out of the house  That sounds like idiocracy  It does  It does, sounds exactly like that  You know the one  Go to Starbucks  There's one  By the way, there's a lot of profane humor in idiocracy  Which also may have accounted for us being dumped  But it's very funny, funny, profane humor  But not for the kids

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's just say that Starbucks develops a new business model  That's all you can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that was, yeah, and there's also the evolution of Fuddruckers  You can kind of figure out what it's going to go to  One explicit tag a week  So there's been a lot of vandalism on Second Life itself  Have you heard about the liberation front  The Avatar liberation front or whatever it is  And they blew up a couple of things  Which of course are just explosions that are pictures  And they wanted rights for the avatars and this kind of thing  And they wanted voting rights  And it's crazy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  People are starving to death right outside their doorstep  But no, let's get the plastic friends some human rights  Way to go  I agree, yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then of course  Didn't everybody grief John Edwards  And then the John Edwards headquarters was blown up apparently  Or was tagged or something happened to it  I don't know  I don't go to this  But isn't that damage temporary

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, doesn't it go away  It's not permanent, is it

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the Edwards people were really indignant about it, weren't they  They wanted to go in and use  How dare they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How dare they put pictures of explosions on our site

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't it something a little bit more toilet humor than that  Than blowing up

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it was the flying genitalia again  They're good at that

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you do that  But like, you know, you go into this world  You go into this world  And you want to go in there  And you basically carpet bag your way into this  And then you're surprised that people are kind of treating you in this way  Well, that's exactly right

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's like carpet baggers  And people are saying, hey, you don't belong in here  This is our weird little geeky paradise here

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Not for you  I'll tell you what else isn't for you  Are all the deleted emails that Intel accidentally deleted from its court case

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're so cute when you try to keep us on track  Good segue

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was trying to segue and keep on topic at the same time  Did we owe you a dollar or something for that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was so cute

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, otherwise we were just going to spend the rest of the episode on flying genitalia  Buy you a Yorkshire pudding

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I actually was looking for a story and I can't find it  But I saw a story about a company that wants to  Its business model is rating second life avatars  You know, giving them ratings  This is how they're going to make a huge killing

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't that like second life escorts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, should we go there  What is second life escorts  It's like a rating that's all on second life  Maybe that's it  Avatar hookers

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's how many you guys how many you guys do the the second life thing  Really? You do the world of I have a second life avatar

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I've spent time in second life  There was I think he sold it but there was a twit amphitheater and the daily giz whiz warehouse and stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the gadget you other guys are you other guys doing second life

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have seen the greatest minds of my generation destroyed by second life avatars

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like World of Warcraft  I tried it because I figured like it's like I don't know drugs  Maybe you gotta try it  No, your friends are doing your second life. I have this thing on my house is called a door to the outside

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm really into that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it funny because you know, we sound like we're a bunch of old, you know, funny daddies  But I really think that second life is highly overhyped. I don't think it's interesting at all

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why do we sound like funny daddy? I mean and not go says he goes outside. I was outside today  You kids get off my virtual lawn

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because FedEx delivered a new server that wouldn't bring it to the house  So I put on the white wire suit  It burns it burns  Brave brave the giant day ball

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I had to use my egress affordance device in order to get out to the yard to collect my things from the FedEx

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Thought to myself my god, that's a high ceiling. This room must cost a fortune to eat  Those bushes look so real

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was out in the fog yesterday. It was very foggy around here and I was like driving around and I was like who turned down the draw distance?  Oh, jeez, that is a bad sign  That's a really bad sign  No, the worst thing is when I started downloading some salsa music because it was on a podcast and I was forced to do this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And unfortunately this tapped into a long buried memory from college  Wait a minute, you were on a podcast that forced you to download salsa music  Because it was just so damn catchy  You haven't heard that Leo salsa at gunpoint? It's one of the most popular shows out there  You must download or die

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey  Well the thing is I found myself speeding on the highway and I couldn't remember why but it turned out I remember because I used to play Out Run during college

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And there was the salsa music on that soundtrack and every time I was seeing a highway overpass it's like I saw the word checkpoint  I had a rush to make it to make an extra game  Wow  And I'm like hey I'm doing 85 miles an hour in a 50 mile an hour zone  I'd like to hear you explain that to the highway patrolman when he pulls you over  So since we're on the subject of drugs  Yeah, sounds like it doesn't it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you seen this thing, the future of work thing? This is showing up all over the store

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's this one particular drug that's used for narcolepsy that apparently is a brain enhancing tool  It makes you focus better, you stay awake longer with higher energy and you can learn faster  And I actually did a little research on this and there's a whole family of these crazy drugs  And the one thing I did learn is that I was actually in a drug store and I was actually in a drug store and I was actually in a drug store  And the one thing I did learn is that they tested them on old beagles and they turned out, you know, some old dogs  It turned out you can teach old dogs new tricks  We walked all the way down that road  I mean I have documentation for this, it sounds like a shaggy dog story

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This sounds like this is made for us Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is, the article I saw was a popular science and as you said these are drugs for narcolepsy  The US Food and Drug Administration has approved them, Pro Vigil is one  Air Force pilots use it, college students cramming for exams  Another one is a modafinil, a modafinil, which is the same idea, a modafinil  These are called eudgeroics, are eudgeroics, is that how you say it?  I don't know what they're word is  They don't simply jazz up the whole body, they tweak sleep specific mechanisms in the brain  They feel jittery or wired, just wide awake

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cognitive enhancer, I like the sound of that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every time I see something like this it sounds like, oh yeah, they're going to find out it causes cancer in about a week

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's been out for a while, it's not new, it's just recently discovered that it could be used for other things  Some people have been on these things for a long time because people actually do have narcolepsy  And so they haven't found any connection like that  But I did a little research and two things I found out, I don't remember the name of it  But there's a drug that came out some years ago that was produced by a French company  That actually had similar effects except for the fact that it would give you an orgasm after about an hour  Just out of the blue  What's wrong with that?  Nothing, but the FDA didn't like it because they considered it bad

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bad for people to ride the bus every day  I thought it would sell

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Can you imagine the warning label on that?  Caution  And then the other one is that if anybody thinks they're going to get a prescription for these things  And go off and take them as needed, they're about $8 to $10 a pill  And how long does a pill last?  You need like two or three a day I think  Oh it's expensive  So it's like $900 a month if you want to use this stuff

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well John, do you remember what happens in idiocracy?  One of the problems that they end up with is they end up spending all of the medical research on male ED problems and hair loss  That's how you end up  The future is spam  And just so you know, the visual of the monkey that they're testing both of those on is worth the price of the rental alone

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everybody out there has to rent this movie  Two movies, you have to watch both of them  But you should probably see Mike Judge's Office Space first  You should definitely rent that if you've never seen that movie

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you enjoyed Office Space, I think you'll definitely like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's an stunning movie in every way  Of course if you've never been in an office you're a cowboy or something, maybe it won't make any sense

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The production design also is incredible  I mean just the amount of care that's gone into recreating all these brands  On idiocracy?  Yeah, I'll find a link for this  There's a good link out there

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The one scene I like to do when he looks over the city and there's this city that is just falling apart  And they have these twin towers that are kind of strapped together  Because they're like falling over

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It looks hilarious  And like on the hospital, the Saint God Memorial Hospital  The letters are falling off the side because they didn't account for how much space it would take up  Right

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a lot of humor in that movie  So anyways, if you want to see Office Space then you want to see Idiocracy  Another reason to hate Fox

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we're just going to wrap it up right here because I think that's all we need to say  In fact, most of the audience has already gone off to rent the movie  It's hope  It's just the four of us, frankly  John C.
