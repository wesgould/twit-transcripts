Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, people go as close as they can to the beach.  So, yeah, there's a lot. I mean, there's a lot going on here.  I feel like people still think that they're not going to get anything.  So they're just continuing to live life as usual because it hasn't like even  though it's hitting California, we have spikes of covid.

Oh, I bet. You know, nor were any of the other dogs in the neighborhood.  You know, and I saw I saw videos that were posted this morning of of L.A.  You know, an aerial video of L.A.  with all these fireworks going off everywhere.

Start time: 352.52
End time: 440.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was it was insane.  It just shows if you don't have official fireworks,  people will make their own. Yeah.  And I don't know which is worse, honestly.  I watched CNN had a like three hour fireworks plus singing thing.  And I felt like it was in just this weird dystopian sci fi novel  because everybody's performing from their living room.  And even and the weird thing is the New York fireworks, the way they did Macy's  fireworks, they didn't want people to gather during the fireworks.  So they held them at random times over the past couple of weeks.  They would just have a pop up fireworks show and recorded it.  And so then what we saw was the Empire State Building,  I guess that part was love was shooting off fireworks  and then videos of the other fireworks.  It was it was, you know.  It's not merely that we're quarantining and, you know, and protests,  not merely all of that stuff.  It's. It's also how technology has combined with it.  To make this very strange, I feel like we're living in the in a weird future.  You know, like I feel like we're living in the deep fake future, kind of.  Like like all of this is simulated.  So what is real? What is real?  What is real? What is real?

Start time: 462.18
End time: 482.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's hard for me to take seriously somebody who wants to be president,  but couldn't get it together enough to file on time.

Start time: 491.92
End time: 508.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because neither he nor Kanye are on any ballots because it's too late.  So it's bizarre, just bizarre that I just feel like that's a little bit disqualifying.  Maybe it's just me.  But if you couldn't figure out how to get together in time to file.

End time: 587.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  Now that would never happen in this country.  No, that couldn't.  Yeah, I will never forget that great movie is worth watching with Robert Redford  is the candidate, it's called, and he busts his hump.  You know, they pick him because he's so good looking and he'd be a perfect candidate  and that goes through the whole campaign and everything.  And he gets elected.  And then he says, and then it's the end of the last line in the movies.  Now what? It's like we worked so hard to get here,  but we really needed to think about what we what we were going to do.  Once we got there, it is it's a weird world.  But I think that the salt, the technology salt is making it just weirder.  There was an article today in the Sunday New York Times about the Skype shirt.  You know what? When I read it, I go, oh, yeah, I do that.  Do you keep a shirt like just at a camera range so that when suddenly  you've got to do a zoom shirt, maybe they called it suddenly, you've got to  do a zoom call, so you throw it on and, you know, there's nothing below the waist.  But no one sees that you just have a nice maybe it's a guy thing.  It's probably a guy thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Although there was an interesting article, an interesting headline  I saw this morning.  I get the medium daily digest of articles I should be reading.  And I didn't read the whole thing, but the headline was, you know,  that the stock market has become a Ponzi scheme because so many of these  insanely highly valued companies, you know, are companies that don't have any  dividends. It's all just about the growth in the stock price, you know,  which really, you know, in a way, it kind of is like a Ponzi scheme.  You know, it's just, you know, waiting for the next sucker to come along

Start time: 838.72
End time: 995.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and tell you more of the stock you bought.  It doesn't seem related to the fundamentals of a company anymore.  No, Warren Buffett must be like, what's going on?  That was the peak of in October was the peak of the Dow  before the late 2000s recession.  Apple released Mac OS 10, 10.5 Leopard.  But, you know, the best part of 2007 was the Red Sox winning the World Series.  That's pretty darn good. That was good stuff.  Is that some kind of sports ball reference?  Sports ball. So Apple is now at OS, Mac OS 11.  They've gone to 11.  And some interesting, I'm starting to see companies, not companies,  bloggers like Neil Sybart.  This is his post from the first.  Apple is pulling away from the competition.  Now, I'm ready for you to argue against all that because  we've been talking, we've been breathing the Apple, the Apple  reality distortion field for the last couple of weeks after the WWDC  a week ago, Monday, but two weeks ago this coming Monday.  But honestly, this this move to all Apple hardware, Apple silicon  all the way down and all Apple software  seems like something that only a company like Apple could pull off.  Now, maybe a number of people wrote me said,  who cares? AMD is going to be great.  And I want to rise in and I don't care.  But it feels like.  Apple is filing, firing on all six cylinders right now.  And that's an interesting, by the way, they have a six cylinder car,  not a four cylinder or eight.  Right in the middle.  No, I say that because they have accessories, the watch and the pods,  the phones, the pads, the laptops, the iMac and the desktop.  Well, this is Neil's diagram.  He says Apple changed their product strategy prior to last year and the year  before they were a pull strategy.  The whole idea was the phone is so dominant, it's just going to drag  the rest of the products into success.  And then a couple of years ago, they said, no, we're going to fire on all six fronts.  We're going to make a Mac Pro.  We're going to make a top of the line iMac, top of the line laptop.  We're going to make best in class tablets.  We're going to. And then and you know, and then all of it supported by services.  And it seems to be working from an economic point of view.  I don't know if this is a Ponzi scheme to Sam, but from an economic point of view,

Start time: 996.36
End time: 1008.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, you know, the risk, you know, and certainly I wouldn't I wouldn't  necessarily include Apple in that Ponzi scheme group because they actually  have been paying dividends for the last several years.  Yeah, but they also are taking their cash and buying more stock.

Start time: 1009.00
End time: 1010.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So they are pumping their stock price.

Start time: 1011.00
End time: 1110.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, in that way, though, they're still returning  investors, providing returns to their stockholders.  So whether it's directly as a dividend or buying, doing stock buybacks either way.  But, you know, the risk, I think, you know, with what they're doing,  you know, with going all in on Apple Silicon is, you know,  they're they're literally are going all in.  There is no plan B.  There's no fallback position.  Yes. If something goes wrong.  Yeah, it's you know, we've seen Intel do this in the past.  You know, they've gone all in on some technology and and for years, you know,  x86, you know, they just kept churning and churning, getting faster and faster,  more power efficient until they stalled.  You know, it worked great until it didn't.  And, you know, you know, at least, you know, if you're  you know, if you're at least partially, you know, relying on other companies,  you know, if you're not totally locked into some proprietary technology,  you have the opportunity to shift gears if necessary.  You know, if things were, you know, things were obviously bad with Intel  over the last couple of years.  Apple could have gone with AMD, you know, as an alternative,  you know, and stuck with the x86 train and at least made progress.  They made the decision to not do that and go all in on on their on their  silicon designs.  And at least in the near term, it looks like that's probably going to work out  for them, you know, based on what we've seen so far, you know, benchmarks  of the developer kits.  It seems to have great performance, you know, even running, you know, stuff in.

Start time: 1117.50
End time: 1131.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, what happens three years from now or four years from now?  If suddenly they hit a roadblock with their silicon, you know,  then what do they do? That's a good question.  They could they could end up, you know, getting stalled for several years  trying to recover from that.

Start time: 1132.06
End time: 1143.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you kind of have to work to pull a negative outcome out of the year.  Like, well, it could all go, it could all collapse.  But yeah, but kind of have to work.  Admittedly, there are risks.  Nobody's saying that.

Start time: 1143.88
End time: 1174.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the thing is, we've seen it happen in the silicon business.  It happened in numerous times over the last 30 or 40 years.  Yeah, it's happened.  It's happened to Intel more than once with titanium and and more recently  with some of their X86 stuff. It happened with AMD.  You know, it's happened.  It's happened with every company at some point in time.  So there's, you know, a greater, a far greater than zero probability  that it will happen at some point with Apple.  You know, and then, you know, if that does happen, then, you know,  then they don't have an alternative to go to at that point.

Start time: 1175.56
End time: 1186.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that, you know, I think it is a lot more practically, I guess,  because, you know, the reason that they're doing this and they haven't said  we're never using an Intel processor again or AMD or anybody.

Start time: 1186.56
End time: 1187.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  No, I think that they'll continue in those high end machines  like those Mac Pros and iMac Pros.  Maybe, you know, they'll they'll continue to use Intel Xeon  or whatever makes sense for them, I think, for the foreseeable future.  Remember that the Mac,  I don't think Apple Silicon has anything to do with them  sort of dominating the world.  I mean, remember their market share in computers is still under 10 percent.  People are buying a lot more Chromebooks.  People are still buying a lot more Windows machines than they're buying Macs.  But they do need to have a place in that ecosystem  because that's where a lot of the creators are.  Those are a lot of the app makers that fuel the other parts of their ecosystem.  And so they need to they need to be  they need to serve that segment well, but it's not dominating in any sense.  It is the most valuable part.  It is the most profitable part of the market.  And I think they want to serve it well, but it's not a world domination scheme.  And they have plenty of other challenges in other parts of their businesses  that, you know, that they're they're having, you know, some struggles in.  Right. Apple TV plus is got serious, you know, struggle.  Yeah, but they don't have to.

Start time: 1265.34

Start time: 1273.00
End time: 1276.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Transcript:  It's true. And they're executing well on the things that they do.  But it's not that I think that it's a little overzealous to say,  that they're pulling away from the competition.  They have serious competition in a lot of the markets that they're facing, really  every market that they're.  Let me let me run through this because I agree with you.

Transcript:  I think it's more complicated.  But Neil is very smart.  Neil Cybart's blog above Avalon here is he says is by no means an all inclusive list.  But here's a list of competitors who are struggling a little bit.  Samsung, he says, remains rudderless from a product vision perspective.  No clear direction where to go.  They're just it's true. They're just throwing spaghetti at the wall.  Google. Good Lord.  Google, they say, he says, continues to prioritize technology over design.  They're having all sorts of trouble with hardware, but they're also just confused  about their I think about their mission.  Amazon's massive bet on voice turns out to be the wrong one.  The smart speaker space was a mirage because where he believes wearables  we're going to are going to take this not stationary voice input.  And he thinks Apple, as many do, is very well positioned in the wearable space.  Microsoft and their surface is they're really taking share from their OEMs,  not from Apple.  And I think Microsoft's heart really isn't in hardware or even operating systems.  Microsoft wants to be a cloud business.  And they don't care if Apple, it's Apple or Intel or anything else.  It's still going to use their cloud.  And there's their office in the cloud and all of this.  Facebook's Facebook's a competitor when it comes to advertising, there's no question.  But that's not Apple's business.  In fact, the more Facebook imposes on our privacy,  Neil points out, the better it is for Apple.  A message sent, he says, through Apple's messages is a message not sent through Facebook.  And for a lot of consumers, that's a plus.  Snap, Spotify, they seem to kind of dominated this competitive market space.  What happened to Intel, though?  You got to this was theirs to lose.

Transcript:  I mean, you can't get too much into this conversation, as you know, I'm not like,  I know this is a very geeky conversation, but I'm taking it in and I'm like, wow,  that's interesting, isn't it?  Yeah.  But don't you think like innovation?  I feel like how is Intel innovated?  They have just. Yeah.

Start time: 1449.24
End time: 1472.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Their last attempt at innovation.  Well, they had two that were flops.  One was, as you mentioned, Sam, I Tainium, which turns out they couldn't.  It was on an obtainium.  They couldn't make it work.  So they went back to X 86.  And then remember, they were trying to do the M scale processors.  They were desperately to get trying to get in a mobile and another.  They couldn't execute.  So maybe their whole problem is just they can't.

Start time: 1472.42
End time: 1518.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They actually had an arm business at one point, which they sold off the X scale  division, that's right.  So they sold that off.  It's never going anywhere that stuff.  Yeah, I mean, they're you know, they certainly have had struggles over  the last several years, you know, on the process side.  And there was another article I saw earlier today,  an interview with a former Intel exec, you know, talking about  Q quality assurance issues that they had, particularly with the Skylake  generation of processors, there was I guess there was a lot of issues  with the design of those processors that were getting through Intel's  process stream inside and getting to customers, particularly Apple.  And apparently that's what triggered Apple to make the decision  to go with their own silicon.

Start time: 1518.52
End time: 1522.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple was stalled waiting for Skylake.  Yeah, they were just stalled.

Start time: 1523.36
End time: 1603.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, one one interesting new technology that Intel does have  that hasn't really gotten a lot of attention yet is something they announced recently.  I first heard about it about a year and a half ago at an analyst event they did.  It's called Lakefield, which is their hybrid CPU.  It's a it's a 3D stacked processor system on a chip  where they're actually stacking multiple different types of cores vertically on the die.  So you've got a relatively small die and they've they've got  what they call their Foveros technology, which is an interconnect technology.  It's a really high speed internet interconnect technology between these different  processing elements on this chip, you know, so that you can transfer data back  and forth between these different processor types.  So you've got things like neural engines and, you know, an x86 core and some GPU type cores.  And you can mix and match a lot of different things.  And it's something that actually has the potential to be to do some really interesting stuff  with it, to get some really high performance out of it in different types of applications.  But, you know, I mean, that's that's only just coming to market now.  They just actually announced it a couple of weeks ago,  even though this is something they've been working on for quite a few years.

Start time: 1603.86
End time: 1630.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kind of interesting because Intel's innovation is all occurred  because they couldn't get clock speeds fast enough on single CPUs, single chips.  And so they they did multi chips.  They're doing stacking. Optane was a stacked memory.  They're they're trying to they're trying to eek more performance  by by increasing the, you know, the depth and count.  And I wonder if there was something that went wrong in there.

Start time: 1630.54
End time: 1657.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Remember, Intel had innovation struggles for years and they really got bailed out by the  their team, the small team.  Yeah, yeah.  That they came up with the, you know, the dual core, just much more practical, much more,  you know, really just innovative.  And and that that bailed them out for a while.  But, you know, this split with Apple, even though I don't think it's a permanent split,  I don't think it's a hundred percent.

Start time: 1657.76
End time: 1669.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's interesting. I think you're the only guy for seeing say that.  I thought everybody just said, oh, yeah.  Apple said, we'll have a few more Intel products coming out.  But they so you think they may not abandon Intel.  That's an interesting take on it.

Start time: 1670.18
End time: 1733.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't. I don't.  Just because, look, I think that the Intel thing was inevitable.  When Apple started making its own chips, this was inevitable  because the when Apple has to wait on a partner like Intel, they wanted they had  Max, they wanted to launch. They couldn't launch them because Intel was late with  their their processors, as you referred to.  And also, as you know, Sher talked about in innovation, Apple just has a team  this they've been out innovating Intel and that Johnny Suruji and his team at Apple  has just delivered again and again and again with the iPhone and the iPad.  It's just inevitable that they're like, look, we're making these chips.  There's no reason these couldn't run a computer, especially a laptop.  I think they will replace every Intel chip on a laptop.  Hundred percent. I think some of these other devices,  I wouldn't be surprised if they hedge a little bit and they still, if it makes sense,  will run or at least make them compatible.  You have the choice of having an Apple chip or an Intel chip.  That's an interesting. That's on some of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like it was very strange.  If you're around someone that you didn't trust and they were had them on,  you felt like they were just going to be spying on you  and just posting all this stuff with you.  So they've released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody was went to the pop up store in New York because you had a time  and you had to know when they were and bought it.  And I bought it from them. But I was proud.  I only spent like 20 percent of her list price.  But because I wanted to see what this was all about.  The reason I ask is these aren't it.  Google Glass wasn't it. But I think there and Cybert talks a little bit about this, too.  There is some credible reason to think we're going to be entering the age of wearables  in the next maybe three to five years.  And and the most sensible thing would be a pair of glasses.  Everybody seems to agree.  All the rumors are that Apple will actually ship its first pair of glasses  in the next couple of years.  And that's and I ask you, Shira, because I thought if anybody would wear these,  it would be you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like the idea because it does get to be a lot of work  when you have to document stuff and you have to keep on putting your phone up.  And if there was something that was a bit more seamless,  that you didn't have to do the work that would help.  But I just don't see it really like I don't see it being normalized  or unless like that's just us, like old school people talking and then like  the younger people, that's just how they would want to, you know,  have their tech like as on them in that way.  I just don't know. I could see it being really great for like protests,  things like that or content creation or festivals or events.  Or if you're walking or if you're a travel, you know,  travel person and you want to document that and you don't want to always have to  like go to your phone or your camera.  But then if we're just hanging, you know what?

Start time: 1896.36
End time: 1925.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just going to say, you know, certainly things like events,  you know, you're just saying are protests.  You know, I mean, that that would be amazing right now with all these protests.  You know, and a lot of what we're seeing, a lot of what's triggered these  protests, you know, is people documenting it with their phones.  And if you could make that process more seamless, like you said,  you know, reduce that friction, you know, then it would put a lot,  potentially put a lot more pressure on anybody that's doing something wrong to stop.

Start time: 1926.14
End time: 1932.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  You know, if I think about it, if I'm a woman and I'm walking,  oh, yeah, that's interesting as I'm walking or jogging, if anything happens.  But, you know, if I'm out on a date, am I going to want to wear those?

Start time: 1946.08
End time: 1972.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like, hi, hi.  Yeah, I'm your Tinder date.  Yeah, no, I just wear these because I'm worried about you being a creep.  You don't mind.  So I'm wearing the first.  This is the first generation.  And, you know, I think Snap made a point of making this  the camera have a big yellow circle around it, because otherwise you might not see it,  which is even more annoying.

Transcript:  The future ones are probably not going to have it right.  This is one of those like best quality, worst quality things.  That's something my wife says a lot, right?  The person's best quality is also often their worst quality.  You know, and your wife is smart.  Wow. I have to think about that.

Start time: 1986.64
End time: 1988.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to spend some time thinking about that.

Start time: 1988.70
End time: 2055.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Because it's like if your best quality is like you're you're very driven  and you're very, you know, ambitious and you're very sort of organized.  But that's also probably the thing that you're going to drive some people crazy with, too.  Right. Right. Like the person just they just don't quit.  They never let up. Right. Kind of thing. Right.  But it's true about this, too.  The best quality is that you could, you know, stealthily  record the police when they are doing something they shouldn't.  That you could, you know, catch, you know, people doing things that  maybe we're breaking the law or we're doing something unjust.  But at the same time, if everybody's walking around,  then all of a sudden you also lose some trust to the point which you never know  who's actually recording you or taking photos of you.  Then at the same time, that's a little creepy.  And now you're going to be a lot less  trustful of people when you're in the public, which I think is somewhat  inevitable in the world that we live in.  But, you know, that's just that's part of sort of the best quality.  The best thing about them is you could take video and nobody's watching.  The worst thing is you could take video and nobody knows where you are.

Start time: 2056.82
End time: 2073.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the issue is not a lot of people are as many people are using Snapchat.  I mean, younger people are. Right.  And so I think with this, like if people start using this more,  would they start using Snapchat more or if they were smart,  they would would they integrate it in some way where you can post it  to your Snapchat and then post it everywhere else as well at the same time.

Start time: 2074.44
End time: 2142.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I feel like I read somewhere that the rumor is that Apple's first  glasses would not have a camera per se.  They would have infrared sensing, LIDAR style 3D sensing.  But really, the point of the glasses is not to as these snap glasses  were to record the world around you, not just like a camera phone  that's always on your face, but really as a more informational heads up display.  There's a company that makes such a thing called North.  We did a review some how long ago was Anthony's review of the Focals?  It might have been as long as almost a year ago.  The Focals one North has been working on Focals to it was just announced  this week, Google bought them.  So I think what's shaping up is a little bit of a Silicon Valley battle  over the next generation of computing platforms.  And I do think they'll be wearables.  I don't think they'll be wearables by themselves.  I think they'll be connected to your smartphone.  The lot of the computing power will be on the smartphone.  But I think that you'll be able to know what are what are AirPods,  especially AirPods Pro, but a smart device in your ear.

Start time: 2143.74
End time: 2175.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So I was going to go ahead.  I was going to say, I feel like Apple, if they did it, they have the best  possibility to win, because if you think about it, you're like you're listening  to stuff like I think it would be really cool if you had your glasses  and you look down like if you had a food or, you know, ingredients  and you could see and it's connected to your phone.  And then you could like see how many calories are bad.  Yeah. Or the temperature check outside, like you would just look outside  and it says what the temperature is or or you're on a Zoom call and it says

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You would like to know a lot of what you just described, sure.  You know, it depends on having a camera to be able to see and classify  the environment around you.  And that seems like it kind of runs totally counter to what we both want.  Just as Jason said, we want it.  We don't want it. Right.  You know, so can you really do something that lives up to what Apple  talks about with privacy and actually make it useful?  That's that's the challenge.

Start time: 2208.24
End time: 2234.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What Apple is going to try to sell you on if they do this is  we will it will be on device.  It will be encrypted.  We don't have any look at it.  You know, trust us because we're we're not we don't sell your data for a living.  Right. Because because face from what we from our reporting,  you know, we have a number of people that do this.  Our reporting is that Apple and Facebook are the ones that are the farthest ahead  on this, like the next generation smart glasses.

Start time: 2238.16
End time: 2239.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a lot of Facebook. Yeah.

Start time: 2240.48
End time: 2350.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And then Google, Google knows that they're a little behind.  And so they bought more.  Because they've got to catch up to Apple and Facebook.  You know, Amazon wants to be there, too.  But they're still sort of finding their way in hardware.  But Amazon, Google, Facebook, they're all they all make money off your data.  Right. Apple is going to try to make the arguments that they don't.  I'd say the thing to watch for as to how close we are is if Apple this fall,  if they announce that they're getting in the camera business,  like they're going to do a smart doorbell or a smart camera  and they're going to sell this in the same way, right.  They're going to say, trust us, because it's all on device.  We don't sell your data. We don't want your data.  We don't even know what your data is. It's all encrypted.  If they start to do that this fall, then know that they're probably getting  pretty close with glasses, too, right, that they're they're already sort of priming  the pump, like if they get in the camera business, which is one of the things  that's sort of one of the open questions, do they want to do this?  Because they haven't been very happy with how well like smart home companies  are working with their ecosystem in, you know, home kit enabled devices.  So they might make their own.  But they obviously we ran a report last year that, you know, some sources  that we have that we know that they are working on this.  They have a group.  There have been mixed reports on that.  But, you know, this is something that's happening for sure.  And I think there are going to be some really interesting  things that happen because of it.  And I think we have to expect this idea of the government is already sort of  wanting to bear down on big tech and stuff like this is definitely a trigger  moment for for something, you know, for I think a lot of governments,  especially the EU, but also the U.S.  government is looking so much closer at big tech.

Transcript:  I want to take a little break, but I do want to come back to this conversation  because I think it's very interesting.  And a couple of weeks ago, Mark Gurman, who is very well connected  rumor guy at Bloomberg, had some interesting, very concrete rumors  about Apple's AR glasses and their plans.  I hope they don't look like the ones I'm wearing right now.  This was from this was from a time, a different time, wasn't it?  When Snap could do these spectacles, it was like it was a more innocent time.

Now, you know, the only problem with doing good teases on podcasts,  people just fast forward through the ad.  It's not like live radio, Shira, you see on your live show  and your radio show that you do over Alexis Ohanian.

Transcript:  Yeah, I know he's married.  He's very married to Serena Williams.  You can kick your ass married up.  She don't mess with don't mess with Alexis Serena.  Come over to your house.  And she's tough.  Anyway, let's talk some more about that in a bit.  Our show today brought to you by the LastPass.  You know, we're in the LastPass studio.  Thank God.  The last bastion, the quarantine last past studio.  And the only one who can use this is my studio now, baby.  I'm the captain of the LastPass studio now.  LastPass is something we started using years ago, back in probably 2007.  Actually, probably very close to that, actually.  I've been using it for more than 10 years.  So, yeah, it was my password manager of choice for years,  then started using the business version of Twit.  And now I'm glad, you know, as we send everybody home.  This is tough. Your IT department is a very big job.  There's more devices, there's more applications  and your workforce is remote.  That means all new threats, regulations.  Strong security has gotten very complex,  but LastPass is there to help your IT department with strong security  that your employees will love because it's easy to use, easy to use  and easy to manage, which is normally a kind of a contradiction.  LastPass makes you secure at every entry point  from shadow IT to apps to mobile and cloud services.  Their access solutions give you visibility and control  over every access point to your organization.  And really, if you think about it, you set your employees home  with the keys to the kingdom. They have your bank accounts.  They have your website.  They have logins to your databases, your customer records.  They got it all.  So you got to make sure they can stay secure.  LastPass unifies access and authentication.  Their single sign on, for instance, is so, so cool.  Employees love it because no more passwords.  They just say yes on their phone. They're in.  But your IT department also loves it because you get a simple  and integrated view across all access and authentication tasks.  They know who is accessing what, when and where.  You can also increase security without impacting productivity.  I know you want that.  Don't slow down your employees.  And it kind of goes hand in hand with making them happy.  They love it. Don't leave your business exposed.  Make your employees happy.  Make password security effortless.  It's not just not just passwords, but it also still we're stuck.  Most of the sites, most of the places, most of the apps  these days still use passwords and they're the entryways into businesses.  That's your weak link.  So make sure you secure it. No more sticky notes.  They also make it easy to share.  Employees can share passwords easily, securely.  256 bit AES encryption, the best you can get.  It is never your passwords are never, never available,  unencrypted anywhere, but on your device.  LastPass does not have access to the password.  The password is never sent.  It's just yours.  And I think that's so important.  It's your I consider it my secure enclave on every device.  iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, Linux, every browser.  That's where I put my most important information, notes, my SSH logins,  things like that.  Secure your business.  Give your IT department the tools to keep your business safe.

He and Steve Huffman, Huffman's still at Reddit as CEO.  Alexis is kind of left Reddit.  In fact, most recently, during the Black Lives Matter protests,  he said, I'm giving up my board seat on one condition.  You replace it with a black board member.  And they did, in fact, a really good new board member.  So Alexis is pretty hip.  He's pretty he's pretty with it.  He's done very well for himself.  And then he married Serena.

And and I think that Mark Gurman had the big scoop on that.  The AR glasses in the Bloomberg.  I mean, I'm going to see if I can find that.

Start time: 3191.78

Start time: 3200.26
End time: 3320.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then and then if your social score goes down, your life is ruined  by even one point.  So this this scoop came out a couple of weeks ago.  Gurman's well connected, often considered to be, you know,  when he says something, it's considered to be pretty accurate.  They've been Apple's been building a team since late 2015.  Now, a thousand engineers working on two products aimed,  according to Gurman, at upending the VR and AR segments.  There's a device codename N301  that would be an all encompassing digital experience for gaming and consuming content.  And then the real divide, and that's presumably coming out next year,  the real device, they'll be the N421, a light  wear, light weight pair of glasses that he expects.  Let me see. In a few years, like 2022.  And those would be completely augmented reality.  You think that's going to be the next battleground?  You know, one thing we learned from Apple's silicon announcement  is that they had been putting the pieces of this together.  In ways that didn't immediately become clear.  And then as soon as they said it, it was like, oh, that's why,  for instance, the iPad Pro is so overpowered.  You had to have this super power chip.  Oh, I get it. Oh, that's why you redesigned, you know, the the the the way  the iPhone worked so that it would be that's I mean, all of this stuff came together.  That's why you focus on service. All this stuff.  I think you can also say that we can see the pieces of the puzzle starting to come together.  I don't want to be caught out this time, so I'm looking ahead.  So I'm looking at it.  And for instance, the LiDAR camera on the new iPad Pro, it's the only new feature  on the iPad Pro from one year to the next is this LiDAR camera.  It's not that, you know, hold it up in the thing.  And then at WWDC, they talk a lot about their new AR kit.  And it's starting to look like maybe they aren't doing this.  Yeah, yeah. It's for developers to build apps.

Start time: 3321.68
End time: 3356.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. So now they've got hardware in the hands of people who are doing this.  They've got the software, the developer is going to teach them how to do it.  Yeah. Right. And so because all of the you know, those things Google Glass failed  because there wasn't enough cool stuff to do with it.  Snapchat, Snap Glass has failed because there was really only one thing to do with it.  Right. And so for for this to succeed, it needs to have some really killer apps  that are going to make people or really ultimately needs to have one killer app.  And the thing is, is you don't know what you know.  The thing is, is you don't know what you know what it is.  Yes. Yeah.

Start time: 3356.54
End time: 3421.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a smart enough Apple smart enough to know that they can't do it all by themselves.  So there was this video and we talked a little bit about this on Mac Break Weekly  AR Kit 4, which is the next AR kit that Apple showed off this week at WWDC.  And of course, this is a developer.  So there's things there's lots of code.  But there are some examples in here.  Street view, you know, the ability to map space,  geomassing geometry with this was this was an interesting image.  Let's see if I can get back to that, which was a heat map kind of looking picture.  But really, instead of measuring thermals, it's dense depth sensing.  So the red is the farthest.  The blue light blue is the closest.  And so they are learning not just the 3D geometry,  they're really learning a lot about the depth of this.  And this is powered by what the LIDAR scanner on the iPad Pro.  Sam, does that come from automotive technologies?  So, well, LIDAR driving, right?

Start time: 3422.06
End time: 3474.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, originally was created before self-driving,  but it's really automated driving development that has made LIDAR take off as a technology.  And it's like, you know, there's like 70 some startups,  you know, over the last decade that have popped up, you know, developing various kinds of LIDAR.  But, you know, the key to it is with LIDAR, you can do something you can't really do with cameras,  which is that depth measurement, you know, actually measuring the distance to those objects.  You can estimate it from a 2D image, but it's just it's never going to be as accurate  as you can get with 3D. And that's why, you know, when they added the LIDAR to the iPad,  now all of a sudden you have much more robust capability to place objects, you know,  to know where surfaces are in that field of view and place objects in that field of view relative  to those surfaces and anchor them.

Start time: 3475.10
End time: 3482.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you give us the one minute LIDAR technology?  Because there's terms like time of flight. Is it like radar? What is it doing?

Start time: 3483.22
End time: 3528.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it works a similar principle to radar.  Radar uses radio waves. LIDAR uses light waves, a laser beam.  And basically what most LIDARs do and the type that's used by Apple on the iPad,  it sends out pulses, laser pulses, light pulses that are reflected back off of objects.  And, you know, knowing the speed of light, you know, each one of those pulses is encoded  with a timestamp, basically.  And when it reflects back, you can measure how long it took and you can figure out exactly  the distance to that object.  And then there's also another type that's called frequency modulated continuous wave LIDAR,  which uses Doppler effect on that.  Interesting. And that's actually the way most radar works is using that Doppler effect.

Start time: 3529.14
End time: 3533.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes more sense if you're moving with regard to the object you're bouncing the thing off of, right?

Start time: 3533.86
End time: 3569.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. The advantage that has is, you know, every return you get, you can measure an  instantaneous velocity of that object.  Whereas with time of flight, you can measure the speed to that object, but then you  rather you can measure the distance.  And on subsequent pulses, by looking at where that object has moved, you can then  calculate the speed from that.  But so it takes you a little bit longer.  There's a little bit of lag in that and it's not quite as accurate.  So that's some companies are doing that continuous wave frequency modulated LIDAR now.

Start time: 3569.80
End time: 3579.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So in the early days of LIDAR, some of the issue, the big issue was the expense.  I remember there were LIDAR units that cars were using.  There were eleven thousand dollars per unit.

Start time: 3579.56
End time: 3615.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The early ones, those first Valedines that you saw on the DARPA Grand Challenge cars  and the early Google cars, those were about 80 thousand dollars each.  Wow. Yeah.  And now they're getting down.  You can buy, you know, there's a bunch of different LIDAR sensors that you can buy  now for anywhere from fifteen hundred to three thousand dollars for a 360 degree.  Still expensive, though, right?  Yeah. But there's also solid state ones that are getting down to the sub thousand  dollar level and in the next couple of years you'll get down close to one hundred dollars.

Start time: 3615.62
End time: 3626.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know Apple's, is it really LIDAR on the iPad?  I mean, are they just using that? Yeah, it's LIDAR.  So it's got to cost less than a hundred bucks.  Because the iPad itself is only, you know, nine hundred bucks.

Start time: 3627.48
End time: 3655.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And it looks like what they're doing is a very basic solid state LIDAR.  It's a low power, probably nine oh five nanometer laser.  It's just silicon.  There's no moving parts to it.  It's what it's what we call a flashlight are where it flashes the scene  with a scan of dots and gets the returns off of those.  It's not scan. There's no beam steering.  You know, it's very it's fixed.  Very low short range, probably no more than five to seven meters.

Start time: 3655.48
End time: 3660.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the same as the face ID camera in Apple's phones?

Start time: 3661.10
End time: 3718.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's yeah, it's a similar similar concept.  And I would guess it's probably based on the same technology as what they're doing.  I'm not sure exactly what frequency they're using on face ID,  but that one might actually be a different that might be a higher frequency.  That might be a 1550 nanometer.  Because the thing about 905 nanometer,  there's two basic frequencies of LIDAR that are used.  There's 905 and 1550.  905 is not safe.  So if you if you have a strong enough beam and get right in somebody's eyes,  it could cause eye damage.  Yikes.  1550 nanometer will not cause eye damage so they can use more powerful lasers and  get longer range. Right.  So it's it's actually it's probably a very low power 905 nanometer that they're  using for face ID and for the iPad LIDAR.  Just because if it's the power is low enough, it's not going to cause any damage.

Start time: 3718.50
End time: 3761.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the fact that this appeared in the iPad Pro, the most recent release,  tells you two things. One, as you said,  Apple is trying to get developers to try this, to use it, to start writing stuff  around it, to give them the capability.  So they're pushing ARKit 4 and all of that.  But the other one is it's a manufacturing thing.  The more this is what happened with the iPhone in 2007, they released it.  And suddenly China, they started making custom machines.  Apple did for the Chinese manufacturers.  They started really building these expertise and the prices of the components  dropped and dropped and dropped. The interesting side benefit is there  are all these industries that popped up.  I think Shiris started her own company all around.  I don't know. I'm just joking.

Start time: 3762.06
End time: 3766.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I'm wondering how people use this like regular people drones.

Start time: 3766.36
End time: 3787.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you use a drone, for instance,  the technology that the iPhone made cheap and widely available in Chinese factories  made drones, quadcopters possible.  And I think what Apple's trying to do with LIDAR is build that manufacturing base  so that they can make these cheaper and cheaper, better and better over time.  You agree, Sam? Is that what happens?

Start time: 3788.26
End time: 3812.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's absolutely part of it.  And I would not be at all surprised if what they're incorporating for the LIDAR  and the iPad and probably in some upcoming devices has evolved directly out of the  work that Apple's been doing on their automated driving program.  I have no doubt that they've been developing their own sensors.  The vehicles that are out on the road.

Start time: 3813.12
End time: 3819.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe the Apple car rumor was really  just misguided because they were making a LIDAR and people thought it must be for a car.

Start time: 3820.04
End time: 3904.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they actually were developing their own automated driving system.  I don't think that they were ever all that serious about developing a complete vehicle.  I think they were focused on the automated  driving part because I think that's probably where they think the real money is rather  because building cars is a low margin business.  But if you build an automated driving system and a service around that, now all  of a sudden you have the potential for some money if you can get it to work.  And I think given that that has taken a lot longer to get to maturity,  they probably took some of the ideas developed out of that program, brought them  into other parts of the company, into these mobile devices to use  and when it first came out that they were working on automated driving,  my first thought was, OK, well, they bought PrimeSense,  the company developed the original Microsoft Kinect.  They're doing their own silicon.  They're doing  they've doing all kinds of things with software.  It makes sense for them to develop all of this full stack, the hardware and the  software in-house running on their own compute platform.  And if they can get that to work,  it gives them a real potential advantage over some of the competitors.

Transcript:  Silicon is a risky move.  That's less risky.  They've been making Apple Silicon since 2007.  They kind of understand the business.  The real risky move and the move that you  have to do because you've got to find a successor to the iPhone is this move  to wearables. I don't think they're doing cars, but the movement of wearables.  I'm sorry I cut you off. You want to say something, Jason?

Transcript:  I was just going to say there also is there's another end game here.  One of the end games is making glasses  that are going to be one of the next great consumer devices.  I need the next iPhone. Yeah.  Right. There are challenges with that.  But also remember, one of the things that a lot of people overlooked with Google  was how important maps were, right?  Mapping the world for the digital sort of the next phase of the digital  revolution was critically important. It's the same with LIDAR.  So LIDAR putting LIDAR in the hands of people to map the world for them.  Although, you know, these they could do similar to what we've seen with maps and  send, you know, essentially people in these vehicles out to do it.  But they need it on a more  on a more detailed level.  So whoever gets this technology and puts it in the hands of their users and they  map the world for us in LIDAR, that is going to be absolutely critical to  just to name two things, the autonomous vehicles and robots and automation.  Because when you have the world mapped to that sort of 3D model level,  then all of a sudden you have this incredibly valuable data set that's like  probably more valuable than sitting on top of oil.  Right. Because so many people are going to want to build businesses off of that data,  that mapping data from LIDAR.  And so that's another end game, too.  Right. Because that's Apple doesn't typically, you know, get into that business.  But you can bet Google, Facebook, Amazon, others, absolutely.  Microsoft absolutely want a piece of that.

Transcript:  I mean, and actually, that's a conversation I want to have next, which is how the stuff  we're doing today with mixed success, globally COVID-19 related, like quarantining,  how it's going to definitely, I think, very much change the landscape in a way that  it's going to hasten some stuff along, it's going to kill some stuff that  wouldn't have happened if it weren't for that.  Here's, by the way, another interesting use of LIDAR.  It is being used.  We had them on the new screensavers a couple of years ago.  It is being used to map ancient ruins.  This is a Mayan city that is invisible, but LIDAR can actually take the forest  canopy out and reveal the layout of the city below it.  And they're doing a lot of this now in the Amazon forest and other places,  starting to see stuff that we couldn't see before thanks to LIDAR.  So it's a really interesting technology.

Transcript:  Yeah. And that's the sort of thing you can do with the frequency modulated,  continuous wave LIDAR, the higher power and much higher resolution than anything  we're using for cars or iPads.  You can go through and do that sort of thing,  take fly a drone or aircraft over it, map that, and then you can actually filter out  things like the trees, filter out a lot of things by comparing frame by frame  and seeing where everything is and you can actually remove a lot of things.  And there's a lot of potential because one of the challenges LIDAR has had is  when you have a reflection off of a snowflake or a raindrop  with some of that early generation LIDAR,  it couldn't see through rain, basically.  Not so useful. Yeah.  No. But now some of these newer generations of LIDAR actually can filter that stuff  out fairly reliably.  Yeah.

Transcript:  The comment too about sort of the effects of some of these things on  where we're at and where we go from here reminds me of a tweet that somebody that I  followed on Twitter and I recently interviewed Ruja Benjamin,  I believe has been on Twitter too.  I think you've interviewed her on Twitter.  She wrote the book Race After Technology,  which is really a tremendously in-depth and amazing  look at the alternate narrative of technology, especially on people of color  and how it has reinforced and worsened many of the challenges that we have  in terms of race, in terms of social justice.  So she's amazing.  But she wrote that she had a talk.  She tweeted about this.  There was a talk that she was going to be doing.  And they said, oh, and by the way, we're working on possibly doing it as a hologram.  Wow.  Which was amazing.  Like, that's where we're at, right?  All of a sudden, there are a lot of events that are not going to happen.  CES is obviously a big question mark.  But as we look into next year,  Broadway just announced they're essentially shut down through next March.  We have all kinds of things we might do,  might have normally done that we're not going to be doing.  And so we're having to think of different ways.  And this is going to, I think, is a point that you all sort of mentioned.  We're likely going to accelerate some trends that were already happening.  This COVID-19  pandemic is likely to accelerate in virtual meetings, in all kinds of things  in terms of events, in terms of shopping, in terms of education.  Last week, so I interviewed Ruja recently and that video is up.  But talking about her book and  her narrative, this alternate narrative on technology.  But I also just interviewed last week  Sal Khan from Khan Academy about what does all of this mean for education?  And that team is doing a lot of that.  And so, so, yeah, there's a lot of things in motion right now and a lot of things  that are accelerating and we're trying to deal with the acceleration.

Start time: 4331.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that interesting?  Yeah, education, everything is changing.  I feel like sometimes  that  we were just waxing nostalgic about 2007, even in the 13 years since then,  the train where Riden's gotten faster and faster and faster.  And it is a weird experience.  I mean, we cover technology.  So we're like the people strapped to the front of the train watching stuff come at us fast.  I don't know about you, but I feel like it's accelerating.  It is. I know it's accelerating and it's getting harder and harder to hold on to  that ideas come and there's another one, there's another one.  And kind of for me, it helps me understand a little bit why there is  definitely a trend in this country.  And it's a trend, certainly, that the president has kind of tapped into.  Well, slow, slow. What is going too fast?  Can we go back to 1853?  I mean, my nostalgia for 2007 is nothing compared to these people.  Can we go back to before the Civil War?  Because it's and of course, those are imaginary times that that nostalgia for  those times eliminates all the negatives and only highlights the golden glow.  It's like watching Gone with the Wind.  What a wonderful time that was.  But I think that that's kind of what's going on in this country.  And it's accelerating as the as technology and the and life starts to get  faster and faster, more and more of us just want to say, no, slow it down.  But I don't think you can.  Can you can you slow it down?  Can we?

Start time: 4432.34

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's not slowing down.  I think you have a choice as to how fast you want to go because you can't control  what's happening around you.  And so I think this is where like the ultimate individual choice comes into play  that like, you know, you choose in and then you choose out while everything is  going crazy around you and there's a lot of chaos.  So I think that we're going to see a movement of people, yeah, disconnecting  and just going in the other direction.  Nature, I can't take it.  I actually don't think it's about before this war.  I think it's like Eastern philosophy, Buddhism, caveman.

And like they're actually because it's like, what are you fighting for in the end?  Are you fighting just to keep up with things?  Are you fighting for happiness?  And a lot of us are realizing it's like there's there's more that we want in this  life we want for our children.  And I think when you're young, you get excited about all this because you're,  you know, you're all about all, you know, is change.  I have you all, you know, is change when you're little.  As exactly.  And as you get older, you're just kind of like, whoa, like this isn't really helping  me with my process here because it just gets overwhelming.  And then you all you all do nothing.

And well, yeah, in the process of doing my job, you know, in my research,  you know, I'm looking at a lot of things, but what I what I consciously try to  constrain is how much like politics, you know, I know what's going on.  I take it enough to be aware of what's going on, but I don't I don't obsess over  it and consume every story about Donald Trump or Elon Musk in their latest tweets.

So if you're fighting for, you know, freedom or truth or happiness,  like what does that actually mean in terms of things you do and what are those  things that are not bringing you that?

I just breathe in and say, I am here now and I'm OK.  And what are you grateful for?

She's a great gal that that Shira Lazar with the piece inside me and I love  peace inside dot live piece inside dot live.  All right.  Our show today brought to you by a big fish with sharp teeth.  Barracuda.  No, not that Barracuda.  Barracuda, the provider of cloud enabled  enterprise grade security solutions for every business to protect email,  to protect your networks, to protect data, to protect applications.  Everybody in business knows the name Barracuda.  They're just the best, just the best.  Well, let me talk a little bit about how  Barracuda can help you right now with your Office 365 inbox.  Suddenly, as we're all working from home,  you have dozens, hundreds, thousands of employees working remotely.  Every one of them is getting tons of email every day.  That makes them vulnerable because 91 percent of all cyber attacks start in an email.  That's the vast majority spear phishing,  ransomware account takeover, conversation hijacking.  You multiply that  by the number of employees, by the number of emails.  One click on one wrong email can cost the company big time money, customers,  reputation, Barracuda researchers.  They actually have a great blog at their website, barracuda.com slash twit.  That's where I found this stat.  They've seen a steady increase in the number  of coronavirus related spear phishing attacks at the beginning of the year.  In fact, since the end of February,  667 percent spike, 600, it's incredible.  The bad guys are just jumping on this.  It's an opportunity for them.  They know employees are at home and they know they can get them with emails  impersonating the World Health Organization or the CDC or, you know,  and offering print, for instance, information to help them stay healthy.  They use domain spoofing so it looks real.  How smart is your staff?  Are they going to fall for that?  Are you going to fall for that?  You need Barracuda total email protection.  It includes all in one email security.  It also includes backup and archiving,  which many businesses have to do for legal reasons.  You've got to have, you know, it depends on the business,  but sometimes as much as seven years worth of emails, you got to archive that stuff.  It'll help you with that.  They have AI based protection from spear phishing and account takeover  and email compromise.  You need AI because attackers are using different techniques every minute.  They're constantly evolving.  So your protection has to evolve.  They also have a great automated incident response that gives you options  so you can quickly and efficiently address attacks.  And we know that, by the way, the faster you address an attack,  the faster it gets fixed, the easier it is to fix.  You wait a couple of minutes and it could be curtains.  So this fast incident response is really important.  And of course, you got to keep your employees aware.  They offer security awareness training as well to educate your workforce.  They are, after all, the first line of defense and attacks.  So what can you do?  You can go to barracuda.com slash tweet right now and uncover the threats  hiding in your inbox. You can get a secure free email  threat scan of your Office 365 account right now.  Don't be scared to push that button.  You got to know, right? Ignorance is not bliss.  Find out. You might be shocked to learn,  but fortunately, Barracuda's got some solutions.  Barracuda.com slash twit.  Find out what horrible things are lurking in your inbox.  Look under that rock.

Something the chat room recommended this book by Cal Newport.  I'm not familiar with a digital minimalism.  Choosing a focused life in a noisy world, he said it's really the chat room guy said  it's really good. The New York Times says he's the Marie Kondo of technology.  Oh, I have to try that.  Oh, sure.

That's cool.  That's really cool.  And when I say a kid, I mean your age, Shira.  Anything that happened before my  in my before my 40s is when I was a kid, basically.  It's depressing, but it's true.  Let's see, what should we talk about right now?  A couple more Apple stories and we'll move on.  One of the things Apple also released is  betas of not only Mac OS 11, big sir, but Mac iOS 14.  And one of the fascinating things that's  happened is how much we've learned about apps on our phones that are spying on us.  iOS 14 has a lot more information when you  install an app, when you're using an app about what it's doing.  And Apple's really pioneered this.  You know, you've you've seen and it was so effective.  The maps warning.  Did you know that Facebook has checked  your location three times in the last 24 hours?  Here's what it knows.  Do you want to keep doing that?  I think that was huge.  Now they're going to start showing right  up front, giving you an opportunity to turn off the ID for advertisers.  Apple, like most devices, gives you a unique ID, which unless you turn it off,  it will be shared with advertisers.  It's a way that they can know if you've seen their ad,  they can verify whether their ad work, that kind of thing.  Google has one, too, called G aid.  G AID.  Apple's identifier for advertisers helps mobile marketers attribute ad spend.  But there's some real concern in the world because it will be now whenever you  install an app here it is, you will see this right at the beginning.  This app would like permission to track you across apps and websites.  Your data will be used to deliver personalized ads to you.  Now, you can say allow tracking, but advertisers now extremely concerned.  This setting has always been on the iPhone,  but it's never been put forward like this, that people are going to say, no,  ask that app not to track me.  Concerning.  Yeah, good news for privacy advocates, right?  A lot of marketers are very upset about IDFA.

Like I was actually having stomach issues every time.  It's bad for you.  I couldn't even physically eat it.  Like my body was not letting me eat it.  So I did vegan.  And then I went to pescatarian.  And then basically when Covid started,  just as everything felt like it was falling apart, we're just like not treating  animals or the earth well.  I just decided to cut everything out.  This is new. I didn't know that.  Well, I've been going back and forth on it for two years or a few years.  And this is the first time I went like really all in.  I used to be a bit more open to cheese and eggs specifically.  And I just cut everything out.

Transcript:  But, you know, I travel a lot, but Louisville is a great place to come back to.  But I got to a point where we moved.  We were here for a couple of years where I was like my allergies were so bad.  And I was on a lot of medicines and  my friend, I had a friend that we were both mostly vegetarian.  It was a college friend of mine that was from Louisville.  And when I moved to Louisville, we sort of reconnected and he he had an ulcer.  So we were both kind of mostly vegetarian since since college.  We'd eat chicken or fish that once in a while.  But  he he had an ulcer and he so he had to go off all dairy.  And he was he felt so much better.  And he told me he's like, you should go vegan.  He said, that's what you should do.  You're having so much trouble with all this allergy.  And he really wanted me to stay in Louisville because he's a good friend.  And and I was like, that's fine for you.  But look, my allergies are so severe,  it's not going to make any difference at all for me.  And so finally, I got so desperate.  I was like, I will try anything.  I will do anything if it would help me feel better.  And I I started going vegan and all of a sudden and I used to have these like  really debilitating headaches.  And when I traveled, I would never eat meat similar to what  I was saying, like my stomach.  The worst thing is you're going to give a presentation or have a meeting or  something and your your guts are killing you.  And so I I was already kind of on that path.  And then when I when I did this, when I got so desperate and I tried it,  all of a sudden I wasn't getting I wasn't getting headaches all the time.  Wow.  Like go off all of my medicine, my allergy medicine.  I had like five allergy medicines, went off all of it.  And all of a sudden I was like, this is what it feels like to be normal.  I have my energy.  I had so much more energy.  I wasn't feeling sort of sick all the time.  And I felt better.  I was in my 30s.  I was like, I feel better than I felt in my 20s because, you know,  I just didn't realize that all of this was making me feel so bad.  So that's just my case.  I probably had some sensitivity, especially like dairy and meat.  I have AB plus blood type, which is the newest blood type.  Yeah, you need to know your blood type.

You have a blood type that didn't exist till when?  Yeah, I can't remember the exact.  It's AB plus.  Is that weird? AB positive.  Yeah, because until so all four of my grandparents are different ethnicities.  And so that's partly why I have AB positive because the genetics sort of they  come together and they literally have to make a new blood type because they're  like, we can't DNA sort of less than 4% of the population has AB positive.

Transcript:  So  the other thing Apple's iOS.  I feel like the nerd at the party is like, so and then let's talk more about iOS  because I'm not done.  The latest privacy revelation in iOS, I guess it also will let you know if  something's snooping your clipboard and a bunch of apps.  First, it started with TikTok.  So it's actually our good friend from Emojipedia,  Jeremy Bruce tweeted, every time I type in another app,  Apple's iOS 14 is saying, oh, TikTok just looked at your clipboard.  Oh, oh, oh.  And  it turns out it's not just TikTok.  In fact, I think LinkedIn just apologized saying, yeah, our app does that too.  But that's a bug and we're going to fix that.  I don't know if it's a bug or they or people are just getting busted now.  Fifty six apps, I think at last.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But again, I think this is great.  You got to praise Apple because they're exposing bad behavior, whether it's  intentional or accidental, they're exposing bad behavior.  And people who use iPhones will now know  since iOS 14 comes out this fall, they'll now know what's going on.  Good thing.  Apple also last Apple, last one.  Apple also doing, I think the right thing.  This is a little more controversial.  They declined.  So the World Wide Web Consortium  proposes new APIs all the time for browsers to support.  Apple has declined 16 proposals due to privacy concerns in Safari.  This is Steve Gibson went through this  list on Tuesday and security now is kind of mind boggling.  This is not going to be in Safari, but  I think Chrome browsers may be the vast majority of these only implemented  in chromium based browsers, not so many in Mozilla.  So Web Bluetooth allows a website to connect to a nearby Bluetooth device.  What could possibly go wrong?  Web MIDI allows it to this is a website,  enumerate, manipulate and access many devices.  A website can now use the magnetometer  in your phone to access data about the local magnetic field around you.  There's an FCA API, a memory API.  You can the browser can actually you can  query the browser as a website and they will tell you how much device memory there  is network information, battery status.  Ambient light sensor, you can a website, you go to a website,  the website, you say, could you turn on the lights?  It's a little dark in here.  This is crazy stuff.  Proximity sensor.  This is all built into Chrome.  But Apple is not going to put this in here.  Also, a user idle detection.  So a website can say, hey, I see you're not watching.  Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me.  The real concern Apple has is not so much these individual capabilities, but  this is a very widespread now that the IDF is people are going to be turning that off.  People use these APIs to query the browser about a variety of  situate aspects of this user.  And it doesn't take very many, half dozen before you get a unique fingerprint.  And they could say, well, I know it's Shira because these are the Bluetooth  devices I can see, this is how much memory she has, etc., etc.  They could put it all together and it's a way to fingerprint you in a very sneaky way.

Start time: 5967.82
End time: 6044.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is this is all digital fingerprinting  stuff because all of these companies in the Internet ecosystem that rely  on advertising, which is huge business, right?  They know that the cookies are coming to an end, that users are not OK with it.  And so it's essentially they're looking for all of these little bits of data that  they can collect and that they can do to pinpoint you without a cookie.  Right. Without.  And so it is very consumer friendly of Apple to push back against these things,  because these are those things that slide in under the radar.  They make their way into technology like cookies did.  And people not the average consumer not  understanding how anti consumer and anti privacy it is until it's too late.  And so I don't think this will stop it because Safari is only a certain  percentage of the population, but it is Apple can do it because  they're something they can control.  You know, Chrome, I have to think, will adopt all of these things and it will  it'll essentially replace the cookie with these digital techniques.

Start time: 6044.60
End time: 6091.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's advertising friendly.  That's their business.  On the other hand, I want to make the case for it because what we are seeing  increasingly is websites and web apps that are as powerful as desktop apps.  And there is definitely a trend towards that.  We've talked a lot about the move towards  thin client computing and progressive web apps and the idea that, you know,  why do you why would we need a twit app if we could make the site a progressive web  app that has the capabilities of an app that you could even save a bookmark  on the desktop and even if you're offline, it would continue to work.  That would be a good thing.  And I think there's a lot of there's a strong case for that.  That's that's kind of where the world is moving.  So I think it's the dream.  I don't know. It's the dream.

Start time: 6102.14
End time: 6150.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't think the W3C is introducing  these APIs with an attempt to make fingerprinting possible.  By the way, there's a lot of fingerprinting going on already, for instance.  Oh, yeah.  In the ZDNet article about this, they point out the do not track setting is often  used to fingerprint because it doesn't do anything.  But if you've got it on, that's one more piece of information I have about you.  Support for custom fonts.  If I can list the fonts you have installed,  I know I can pretty much uniquely identify you again and again and again.  These are all things that I think are useful.  So who's to blame about this?  I think this is ad tech is to blame because I think these technologies would be nice  to have to be nice to have more capabilities for websites in your browser.

Start time: 6164.66
End time: 6178.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think rather than blocking these, what Apple should do is sandbox them.  There's got to be a way that you can keep  these technologies in the browser without letting them access the outside world  somehow. I'm not sure, though.

Transcript:  I'm saying an app versus the Web app, right?  Web app, you can maintain a little more control.  And some of these features would help companies build better progressive web apps  that are that's a good thing.  That's going to do sort of what we want.  But at the same time, when you do that, now all of a sudden you've enabled  the this tracking at the Web browser level or at least you've enabled bad actors  or even maybe some somewhat bad actors to have the ability to use that and exploit  that to track you in ways that you're not completely comfortable with.

Transcript:  I'm very aware, as you must be,  of the of the tension between privacy on the one hand for consumers and the need  to monetize on the other hand, whether it's for a website or a podcast.  I don't you know, we don't when we run our ads, we don't we, you know,  the nice thing about RSS podcasts and one of the reasons they're probably dying  is because RSS doesn't give us any information about our user.  They're just downloading.  We see, you know, we see the hit to the website, but all that gives us an IP  address, which we don't preserve and don't use.  But advertisers want to know more about they want to know.  They ask me all the time.  Well, how do I know that the last ad in the show was heard?  I don't know.  How do you know that the ad in the magazine was read?  I don't know. How do you know the guy's not  making a sandwich during your billion dollar football commercial?  I don't know.

Transcript:  On the other hand, I'm very glad Apple  exists and does kind of fight for the end user.  But it's a larger issue.  You know, you're stripping out capabilities and browsers.  You're stripping out the ability of sites like your old tech republic to monetize.  You know, this is happening in podcasting, too.  That's the reason Joe Rogan was worth  100 million dollars to Spotify and note that that 100 million dollar payday came  with Spotify exclusivity that you can't you know, he took his  shows will no longer be on YouTube, nor will they be downloadable via RSS.  You'll have to use the Spotify app to listen to Joe Rogan.  Why do you think that is?  Because Spotify app knows exactly where you are, who you are, what you're doing.  And it's not that they need to sell ads against it.  They can, but they have that information.  That's valuable information.

There are some of our shows,  older shows, long tail shows like triangulation  and then shows like Twig that don't have a lot of advertising.  Twig, for instance, is chronically short on advertising and we can't get anybody  to buy it. I don't know why, but they just don't like the name.  But advertisers are funny.  We talked to an advertiser the other day that said, oh, we don't want to buy  an ad on Twig because it's it's on Sunday.  What? It's on Sunday.  We don't want to we only want to advertise shows during the week.

Transcript:  They're so strange.  So it's advertisers.  Anyway, we're going to we are going to try something.  And I wanted to actually tell people this  because we started doing it called direct insertion ads.  And the way it works, we go through a company called Megaphone.  And the way it works, if a show doesn't have an ad, we don't work or do more ads.  We only do one ad per half hour on any show.  But if a show like Twig has one or two ads instead of three, the normal  we will put a little beacon, a little tone in that ad.  And if Megaphone can sell it, they'll insert an ad there.  And it's only an audio, it's not on the video because they don't have the  technology to do that.  So we're going to try that.  And but I have to say the reason that works is because at least in that case,  an advertiser can buy a geo located ad.  They don't know anything about the people, but they could say, look,  I only want to buy the US, you know, when we sell 30 percent of our  audience outside the US, they could say I only want to buy the US or only want to  buy the West Coast or only want to buy Nebraska or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to do direct insertion psychedelics.  Can I do that? Is that OK?  Anyway, that's you may hear that on Twig.  And honestly, we're just trying it.  It's an experiment. If you hate it.  I think it's interesting that you heard that, Sam.  And in theory, those are going to be, I think, geotargeted.  But I don't know.  You don't remember the advertiser.  And it's not as much as we charge for a host read endorsement.  And obviously, but if it saves the show, I'm all for it.  You know, and to be frank, advertising dollars have gotten very tight.  And actually, I want to take a little break.  But when we speak of ads, but when we come back, I do want to talk about  how quarantine is going to change is changing our perspective on a lot of things.  And it came to me yesterday because  we bought something at Dick's Sporting Goods, but it was a very different  experience. And I'm wondering if that experience is going to continue even  after quarantine. But we'll talk about that in just a second.  So today brought to you by Cashfly, quite literally brought to you by Cashfly.  They are our CDN, our content delivery network.  They've been doing it since 1999.  We've been using them since 2000, I'd say since 2007 or eight.  A long time when we first started doing Twig.  You know, we were doing the Web download and then that didn't work.  And we were trying to get to it.  And that Levine at Cashfly was so great.  He called me up and said, Leo, we can let us help you.  And we've been on Cashfly ever since the best experience.  And you may not notice it, but you would notice it if we weren't.  You know, when your podcast application  downloads our show without a hitch instantly or when you're going to the website  and you can watch that stream and all of that is because of Cashfly.  Cashfly is an amazing global content delivery network.  And now even better because they're so this is a little tricky.  If you use a CDN, you'll understand this.  The source material for the stuff on the cash servers comes from your origin.  And in our case, it's probably Amazon S3 or something like that.  That's where the files are.  And then when somebody goes to down that first person download,  the podcast goes to a CDN, a cash flow server somewhere.  It downloads a copy, keeps that copy.  It's cached there.  There's the name Cashfly for a while so that people can continue to get it fast.  You get it from a server that's near you.  It's cached much faster than the origin.  The problem is those origin hits can cost us a lot of money.  That's why Cashfly has introduced something called 100 percent cash shield.  With this feature, you're going to benefit  a drastic reduction in data transfer fees with sites like AWS's S3 and other cloud  storage origins because your cash hit ratio suddenly gets to 100 percent.  Instead of storing it on these third parties, you store it on Cashfly.  So there are you don't you don't have the no more cash misses.  Your origin spend goes down by thousands a month.  This is such a great idea.  I wish they'd done it this years ago.  So brilliant with 100 percent cash shield and cash flies guaranteed availability.  No more eviction for large one off  requests costing you a fortune in data transfer out fees.  It's a next generation content delivery solution for today and tomorrow.  A dedicated storage space just for you.  Cashfly just keeps getting better and better.  I love Cashfly shielding reduces your origin spend.  Also make sure that, you know, your the data will flow.  Customers want their 4K content delivered instantly anytime on any device,  anywhere in the world. Your web page should load like that.  There's no video buffering. Your game should download.  Your app should download whatever you're  storing content on the net for your customers.  You need to have it come in fast.  And that's what Cashfly does for us.  Lightning fast digital download speeds  for large digital digital files, no matter where your customers are.  Their global throughput performance dominance ensures any cash misses are  delivered five times faster than if you were getting it from S3 or some other origin.  I think this is a brilliant idea.  One more way Cashfly is amazing.  Here's the deal.  If you host content on the net and you whether it's a podcast,  music, games, apps, web content.  You need to find out what Cashfly can do for you.  They can probably save you as much as 20 percent on your bill.  They sure did for us.  They could probably speed things up.  But here's the way to find out.  Go to twit.cashfly.com and they will give you a no pressure,  complimentary detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and your usage trends.  Twit.cashfly.com.  We thank Cashfly.  So much for their support.  Couldn't do it without you, Cashfly.  So I went so Lisa wanted a volleyball  net so we could play volleyball.  And oh, cool. Yeah, right.  Because we can't go outside.  So we put it out in the yard and we could have some fun.  We're not going to go to the gym.  So.  We could order it on Amazon.  It would come.  And I think she looked and it would come in a few days or a week.  We wanted it to that we wanted yesterday for the fourth of July.  The local sporting goods store, you go online, you order it.  They say, OK, it'll be ready in 30 minutes.  You drive by when you do the order, you give them your car, make and model  so that when you drive up, they go, oh, there's Lisa.  They put the volleyball in the car and then she drives off.  Now, that's obviously curbside delivery.  A lot of restaurants are doing it.  A lot of businesses are doing it because of covid.  But after that experience, I thought, you know what?  Why would they go back?  What if a lot of brick and mortar stores,  because they're one advantage over Amazon, it's not price, it's not convenience,  is that you can get it today.  What a convenience.  Well, that's the big convenience.  Yes. Yeah.  So, I mean, convenient in the sense that you just go to the web and you order it.  And if you're not in a hurry, getting it in two days from Amazon is fine.  But what if you wanted it today?  I can imagine brick and mortar stores,  which are struggling anyway, turning into essentially instant pickup  warehouses and restaurants to I wonder, you know, we're getting used to having  takeout. I wonder how many restaurants I mean, we'd like to socialize.  We'd like to get together.  I'm sure. Sure.  You can't wait to have a nice dinner date.  But I  have a feeling a lot of a lot of businesses are discovering a new form.  What do you think? A new form of business.

Start time: 7417.58
End time: 7476.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. What do you think?  Yeah.  I've done the curbside delivery  quite a few times now over the last several months from places like Petco to  Dogfood and Best Buy and a few other places, as well as some restaurants.  And it works.  I think.  I suspect that a lot of maybe the locations that maybe have lower revenue,  lower foot traffic may shift to doing that, going to a smaller footprint store  where they don't have to have all the inventory out, basically just a smaller  warehouse and do just curbside deliveries.  But for a lot of products, there's a lot of times when you actually want to  go and browse and try stuff out.  You got to try out that Zoom shirt before you buy it.  I understand that.  Exactly. You want to make sure that it  matches the color of your back drop that works for you.

No, there's a lot of them now, aren't there?  This was Taylor's store.  You put the phone on the ground and it takes pictures of you.  Wow.  That's cool.  Well, I've gotten shirts from them.  That's fine. But now they have suits.  And I thought,  I thought I need a funeral suit.  OK, this is a little creepy.  Is this for real?  Nobody's dying.

And I figure if this goes on a lot longer, we might come to see you invited some funerals.  So anyway, I know it's morbid, isn't it?  Well, actually, no, you probably wouldn't.

There's a fairly elaborate Facebook boycott.  But you know what?  I think I think Mark probably wasn't prudent or politic of him to say that.  But I have a feeling he's right, right?  It's very convenient during summer, during COVID, that Pepsi and Unilever  and a bunch of advertisers boycott Facebook.  They say till the end of summer, the end of the year, they'll be they'll be back.

Start time: 8011.32
End time: 8038.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, no, I guess I think a lot.  I think what we'll see is a scaling back of a lot of the say full service stores.  The kinds of stores that we know traditional stores, you know, some, you know,  some of those will remain as places where you can go to check out products in person.  And, you know, a lot of them will shift  towards this, you know, this model of basically a drive up warehouse, you know,  where you show up and they put stuff in your trunk.

Start time: 8039.42
End time: 8047.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 8073.60
End time: 8152.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It just accelerated these trends that were already happening in retail.  And I think we knew things we knew were going to happen.  The challenges, the challenges with it speeding things up is there was going to be,  I think, some natural  transition points for this, right, because there are parts of the retail experience  that we don't want to give up and we've been slowly kind of figuring that out.  And it enabled it has enabled some companies to stay in business as they're  figuring it out.  I think the challenge is this is going to be such a shock to the system, right,  that it is moving more business, transferring more business to Amazon.  Right. And so putting more stress on some of those traditional retailers.  And so as a result, as consumers, you know, that could it could give us fewer  choices and it could provide some challenges that we're not necessarily going  to have the opportunity to start to think of, you know, our buying habits in terms  of, OK, here's how I want this and here I want to be able to go and try on some  of these things and then either have them shipped to me or pick them up at another  store or, you know, delivered locally, you know, next day or those kinds of things.  And so that's what I worry.

We'll see how the suit is.  They do send you and I think I'm unaware it.  They do send you a white canvas Sizer suit first.  So you can put that on.  But I think that's like I'm getting two suits for the price of one.

I do think there's going to be a movement to people that don't want to support  the Amazons, just like people don't want to support Facebook and that want to go  local and that also people that are environmentally friendly that don't want  transportation that want to just like minimize all of that.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, during this period, we've been  we've been consciously trying to do more business with locally owned businesses,  whether it's restaurants, getting takeout where we can or local hardware  stores, opposed to going over to Home Depot or Lowe's whenever I can.  The stuff the stuff that I know that they're going to have there.  And that's that's the challenges.  They  a small locally owned hardware store is never going to have all of the stuff  that I would necessarily need to get from a Lowe's or Home Depot.  But when the stuff I'm confident that they will have there, I'll go over there

Start time: 8287.96

I'll go because this is so you go.  So what do you think?  You think you want a 32 bit auger for that drill or maybe something a little smaller?  And they go, oh, yeah.  Well, you know, let me tell you, what are you going to be hanging there?  It depends because you might need a twist clasp to insert on that and spring loaded.

Start time: 8452.76
End time: 8754.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so we're going to wrap this up first.  So let me tell you about our great sponsor wasabi.  This will get you hungrier.  And I'm not talking about the little green  ball of hot stuff they put next to sushi, although that would be delicious right  about now, I'm talking about something else.  Hot cloud storage wasabi founded by a good friend of mine, David Friend.  He's a serial entrepreneur, brilliant guy.  He and his partner  came up with a way to write data on a disk sequentially as opposed to in sectors  that is much faster and much more efficient.  And as a result, they he started carbonite because of that.  Now he started wasabi.  It's cloud storage.  He's learned a lot about cloud storage over the years.  Turns out there are a lot of people,  modern times, people who are creating a lot of data.  David told me about this.  He's in Boston, wasabi is in Boston.  There's this Boston high rise where they put in security cameras as one does.  But what they realize is those security cameras are spitting out like a terabyte  or two of data every day, day after day after day after day.  And they were buying a lot of on premises storage, like a lot of it.  And when they found out about wasabi, they said, wait a minute, you mean we could buy  cloud storage, kind of an infinite amount of cloud storage for less than the cost  of our on prem.  In fact, it's actually significantly cheaper than on premises storage.  It's about the cost of the maintenance fees for the on prem storage alone,  not including the hardware, 80 percent less expensive than Amazon's S3.  But so much better, faster.  It's a disruptive price performance model.  It just makes cloud storage a natural addition to what you're doing.  The cloud is there.  Take advantage of it.  It's a great deal if you're a managed service provider,  if you're reselling storage, because you can earn more while charging less  because wasabi is so much less expensive.  But let me when I say that, I want to tell you about some of the benefits.  You're not giving up anything.  It's more secure than on prem storages.  They they host your data and premiere tier four data centers, highly secure and  fully redundant. They do active integrity check and every object stored is checked  for integrity every 90 days.  You're there offering 11 nines of durability,  so much more than an on premises hard drive can do.  On average, you'd lose one file every 649000 years.  They also are secure.  They every bit of data is encrypted on at rest, even if you don't request encryption.  They follow all the industry best security  models and design practices like access control, mechanism,  mechanisms, bucket policies, access control lists.  My favorite feature I use all the time, your data is immutable.  You can say nobody can mess with this data, not ransomware, not a fumble  fingered employee, not even me, protects your data from being erased or altered.  So it's super secure.  That's why it's FINRA compliant, HIPAA compliant, CJIS compliant.  Now, it's also very affordable flat rate, five ninety nine per terabyte per month.  You do not pay for egress.  That's another thing that bites me with S3 every time.  As soon as I want my data back, I have to pay for it.  You do not pay for egress with a Sabe.  They have the same API as Amazon's S3, but they don't charge for API requests.  So you can use all your S3 software, but it's less expensive to use it.  And they don't have those fancy complex  storage tiers, just a flat rate, although they do have another way to pay.  They just added, which I love.  It's called reserved capacity storage.  And this is specifically for like that high rise in Boston that knows we're going  to have four terabytes a day forever.  You can buy cloud storage up front.  So if you're thinking about buying more  hardware storage, compare the price against, let's say, five years of reserved  capacity storage, you can actually purchase it in one, three or five year increments.  The discounts go up the more you buy and for the longer the term.  So you're going to get great discounts.  You're going to save a ton of money.  You're going to have reserved capacity.  You just know.  I don't know why more people aren't using wasabi.  Everybody knows about Amazon and Google and Microsoft.  They're the big names.  But please do yourself a favor.  Add a fourth name to your shopping list.  Tell the boss, show the boss the benefits.  You can try it yourself for a month free.  Go to wasabi.com.  Click the free trial link.  Enter the code TWIT, then join the movement.  Migrate your data to the cloud with confidence.  I think when you explain the benefits and show the price,  it's just a no brainer. Wasabi is the greatest.  These guys really know what they're doing.  Next generation cloud storage that's  disrupting the industry wasabi.  W A S A B I dot com.  Don't forget to use the offer code TWIT when you do the free trial so that they  can know that you saw it here wasabi.com.  We didn't talk much about the Facebook.  Oh, Jason has.

They have pledged to, quote, upskill  25 million workers in the covid economy  and they're going to do it by the end of this year.  So there are a lot of people out of work.  There are a lot of people unemployed.  There are a lot of people delivering food or Amazon packages who really could be  doing a lot better.  Microsoft has got a really cool free service for you.  They've identified 10 jobs that are in the most demands today and they've got the  training, they call them learning paths that you can do online  to learn.  It's part of the GitHub learning lab and  Microsoft's LinkedIn learning.  And I think this is really good.  They're putting a lot of money into it.  Twenty million dollars in grants to nonprofits.  These are these are really great.  You don't have to have proof that your job is impacted  by covid-19, but if you say it has there, you'll pay $15 for these exams and classes.  So which are normally $100.  Yeah, isn't that great?  I want to see more corporate  companies step up to train  underemployed people to help black people rise and get better jobs.  I mean, there's just so much companies can do.  I think Microsoft's really in the forefront of this and I'm really proud of them.  I think that's great.

But it will also, I think, attract the  the people that want to support those companies in ways that they haven't  totally thought about in the past, in terms of how they  they can draw more people into their customer base because that's what they're  all about. They do obviously have to think about continuing to keep the lights on  and those types of things.  But there just hasn't been enough of that from Silicon Valley companies.  And we've started to see the unfortunate negative consequences of it.  So I'd love to see them turn that around.

It was 60 mostly young, mostly nonwhite people working at companies like Facebook,  Instagram. I'm reading from The Wired story about it.  Twitter and Stripe.

Transcript:  This is a weird story I saw in the Wall Street Journal  and it's hitting commerce sites of all sizes.  There is somebody going around using the name John Smith and loading up the shopping  cart and then abandoning it, which you might say is, well, that's just kind of silly.  Here's the lead from the journal.  John Smith started shopping early on a recent Wednesday and didn't stop for days.  He visited an auto supply store.  And didn't stop for days.  He visited an auto supply site where he  loaded his cart with a replacement turn signal, lever, emergency strobe light  and two dozen other items.  He hopped over to a home goods merchant for another 10 items, including wood,  picture frames, address plaques, a towel rack and mailbox.  He ordered one of every kind of baby bundle ranging from 80 dollars to 500  dollars from a site that sells infant sleeping boxes popular in Finland.  And then walked away for more than a year.  Online merchants have been noticing somebody named John Smith doing this.  But it's more than a nuisance because it skews the analytics they use to decide  where to advertise and what products to sell.  He uses bogus email addresses  and they find that out because, as you know, if you abandon a shopping cart,  you will get an email saying, hey, you didn't buy it.  Can we give you a 10 percent discount or something like that?  And they get those bounced back.  It's apparently going around.  Anybody know anything about John Smith?  Is it you, Jason? I think it's you.  You're doing this.  No, I don't have that kind of money.  No, he doesn't spend any money.  I know it's more like time.  I don't have any of that time.

They're specialized in helping you, helping website operators deal with  abandoned shopping cart, abandoned shopping carts.  Figure out how do you fix your site to get people to go ahead?

Sure. And then they sort of they carve out  their most valuable assets, which is sometimes their real estate and that kind  of thing, and then they sort of make the company, you know, rent real estate from  them, you know, the company that they used to own.  The private equity firm.  Exactly. The private equity firm.  Thank you. And then and then when the company, you know, sort of hits a bad bump  in the road, they just like, great, you know, they get rid of them and all the  workers and then they keep the most valuable assets for themselves.

It was the most powerful experience I'd had and really just artistic experience  being in the audience.  And I really I really thought that it was going to be hard.  I was looking forward to the movie, but I thought it's going to be hard.  Live theater is such a powerful thing.  Right.  That's why you can only do it.  Thirteen hundred people at a time because you really do sort of as an audience  member feel like you sort of have this relationship with the people, you know,  on the stage.  But but they did they did really terrific job of filming this because it  I got things out of it.  I didn't get, you know, being in the audience.  Yes.  And I thought that it was one of the one of the most powerful things that I'd seen  being in the audience.  But as a movie, it was actually one of the most enjoyable things  that I had seen, certainly for live theater on film, which is a really hard  thing to do and almost never goes well.  I thought it was maybe one of if not the best version that I'd seen.  So they did it well.  They did it right.

But I have to say, I couldn't cry as loudly as I did yesterday on the couch.  I was bawling my eyes out from beginning to end in the beginning of joy because  it's such a great work of art, it is perhaps one of the greatest works of art  of all time and to have it preserved on film, I'm so, so grateful.  And then, of course, because it's terrifically sad.  So I'm happy for the first act and then I'm just bawling my eyes out for the last act.  So that was really, really good.  I've only watched it once, but I'll be watching it again many,  many times, I'm sure, because it's so good.  We've seen it in New York and San Francisco.  But I have to say, you're right, Jason.

But, you know, there was there was nothing that they did in this  VR presentation that wouldn't have been pretty much the same thing,  you know, just on a flat screen, you know, in a, you know, in a WebEx or Zoom  presentation. And, you know, it was worse because  wearing, you know, wearing the set of VR goggles, I couldn't take notes.  I couldn't record what was going on.  Oh, yeah, that's true.  So, you know, as a media event, it made no sense at all.  And, you know, I've talked to them and they said they'll probably never do that  again. It was, you know, they tried something.  It didn't work, you know.  So but, you know, their cars are all now they all have all their new cars have  over the air update capability like Tesla does and a lot of other manufacturers are  going that direction and they're looking at new business models for, you know,  to allow customers to pay for stuff, you know, if they don't want it all the time.  You know, if you only want to pay for your heated seats in the wintertime and not  pay for it in the summertime.  That's crazy.  They're not they're going to adapt that to different markets.  So, you know, in the U.S., they're probably not going to do that.  They may, you know, they're going to experiment with it and see how the idea
