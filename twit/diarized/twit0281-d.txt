I'm Leo LaFord and  frankly we didn't really want to work the week after Christmas so  we're just going to do a best of episode this week.

Felicia Day  accidentally revealing her  wow account.  And that moment with Chat Roulette.  And let's not forget when Amber had her technical difficulties.  So without further ado,  let's get to the best of TWiT.  Happy holidays from all of us.  Also with us from BoingBoeing.net, the great Jenny Jardin. It's so good to see you, Jenny.  Hi Leo.

End time: 169.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_20

End time: 185.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  It's, if I can put on a wine snob adjective flow for a moment here, it's like a really  fine fresh lemon with hints of jasmine and undertones of fruit cake.

Start time: 185.88
End time: 187.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  And undertones of death. I want it.

Start time: 188.70
End time: 201.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I want it. Well Cthulhu, you know, entices you into your death. That's right.  My very serious point is, and I'm with you Brian on this, is that that's, I think that's  going to be progress when people just go, this is how we are.

Start time: 201.26
End time: 216.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is bull crap. This is a passive attitude toward privacy which is going to ruin this  country. That's why people are walking through that x-ray device. They don't give a crap  that they're getting essentially a chest x-ray.  Well, I got violated.  And they get it off out, they get patted down and their nuts get grabbed and nobody complains  about it.

Start time: 217.66
End time: 221.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I had my nuts grabbed and I was not excited about it.  Look, look.  No.

Start time: 222.20
End time: 255.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Well, let me say two things. First of all, first of all, I'm with you on the x-ray thing.  If I have to choose between the peep show and getting felt up, I always choose being  felt up. It's awkward and they're ashamed to do it. And that's the way an invasion of  privacy should be.  You want to make them feel bad.  That's right. That's right. That's right. You are grabbing my junk and it's awkward for  both of us. And that's how it should be.  But, but let me say what I'm trying to say about the warts and all and understanding  who people are. This is a manifestation of the high definition culture that we're joining  into. And it's not just our privacy on Facebook. It's the fact that we watch high def TV and  you can see the zits on people. You can see the makeup that that Jay Leno is wearing on  the Tonight Show.  Because the truth is.

Start time: 256.34
End time: 282.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  We see things the way they actually are.  In the first hundred years of media, it polished people. It made it lied about people. And  I think that we all agree that the magazines and television and movies created a false  standard that that was unattainable and has caused great pain for normal people for the  last hundred years. Media has misused its ability. This is an opportunity for media  to say, and this is kind of what we do here. Boy, this is warts and all media. If you ever,  if you ever.

Start time: 282.44
End time: 292.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a false argument. You're equating somebody to having a lot of makeup on on a  TV show with 250 lines scan with an invasion of personal privacy.

Start time: 292.10
End time: 313.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  No, no, no, I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. Because I am fundamentally opposed to the X-ray machines.  And in fact, I don't know, they had recently or is it coming up Wednesday, November 24th,  2010 is National Opt Out Day. Now most people don't know on the X-ray machines, you can  always opt out. All you have to say is I opt out and then they give you a pat down  search. And if we all did it, I do that air traffic.

Start time: 313.48
End time: 336.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Regardless. Well, listen, maybe I when I just flew here this weekend, I wore the same sweatpants  I wore last week to go to L.A. This year, this weekend when I came in, he's like, oh,  they just changed the rules this week. Do you want a private screening or do you want  us to pat you down out here? And I'm like, what do you mean? He's like, well, do you  want us to take you in the back room or do you want us to do it? What does it entail?  I have to go in your waistband, put my hand down your pants. I'm like, do it out here.  And I stood in front of everybody and he did it.

Start time: 336.34
End time: 338.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And what's the alternative? Can I go through a machine?

Start time: 338.46
End time: 380.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  No, no, the alternative is for him to go in the back room and pat.  I had he's going to put his hands down your pants no matter what he did.  Yes. And I said, I'd rather have him do it out here in public because just what Brian  said, he's he's already ashamed to do it.  And I feel like he's not going to go as deep. When did this happen?  This weekend, they're required to put their hands down your pants.  Change the rule. Well, I put his hands on his hands.  Wait a minute. I'm not necessarily put this is the this is the new TSA.  Is that you have to get if you're wearing sweatpants or baggy clothing or baggy  clothes, I was wearing sweatpants and not baggy.  There's sweatpants. He put his hand.  This is my waistband because I have to get my hand on my pants.  I'm not playing around the ring of my waistband and then padded the front  and then padded my butt and then in my crotch.

Start time: 382.88
End time: 395.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  That's the part that kills me is that is that for all of the federalization,  for all this giant bureaucracy, for the five dollars that you have to pay  for every single flight going and coming back everywhere you go,  we get not one percentage point bump and insecurity.

Start time: 395.52
End time: 399.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, so there's a blog where somebody's been capturing screen grabs  of really embarrassing or funny autocorrects that happen on different smartphones  where people are texting back and forth to each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is Twit this week in tech episode seven hundred seventeen.  No, that's wrong.  Christ.  iPhone four has been jailbroken already.  Didn't take long.  Yay. You can now go to jailbreak me dot com.  And it has it kind of like an all in one push button jailbreak.  And now it's legal.

Start time: 543.88
End time: 545.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure they waited until it was legal.

Start time: 545.64
End time: 561.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah, right. They were very concerned.  Yeah, it's legal.  So what is like my path with you?  No, they can't cut you off.  Could they cut you off? Sure.  They could just that.  So the FCC rulings doesn't mean that they couldn't just say, well, OK, but we.

Start time: 561.74
End time: 578.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you can do whatever you want.  It's totally legal.  But, you know, we're not going to give you any service.  You just broken your warranty.  That's the old excuse.  Oh, you can do that. But then you ruin your warranty.  That's what Apple said on the back.  It's legal to unscrew your cell phone.  But if it's got a little of a sticker saying, if you remove this screw,  you lose your warranty.  That's what Apple says.

Start time: 578.38
End time: 621.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  That's what's weird about the fact that.  Go ahead, Baratunde.  Here's my key question about this, because I got the original iPhone  and jailbroken to work on T-Mobile.  So I didn't break my plan and I loved it.  I had Syria apps running.  It was it tasted like freedom.  And I like freedom.  But I also just ironically felt like a fugitive  because I was running, you know, week to week, month to month  in fear of the latest software update.  So I'm kind of like sniffing around.  I don't want to have my my phone on jailbroken by Apple's latest push.  Does this new ruling that jailbreaking is legal  now prevent Apple from undoing your jailbreak in its latest software updates?  Are they still going to have that practice of sabotaging  your phone at their own whim?

Start time: 621.92
End time: 637.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does jailbreaking make it work either as a phone or an Internet device?  Because mine is literally an operable brick.  And I don't know if anybody else is in L.A., but I I think I'm pretty close  to actually swapping it out because it just does not work.  I've yet to have a phone call that didn't drop.

Start time: 637.78
End time: 642.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But you don't want phone calls, Felicia. This is a feature.  That's a feature. That's a feature.

Start time: 642.42
End time: 651.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  This is like the iPhone 4 is like a girlfriend who drives you nuts.  She won't pay attention to you.  She never listens to you.  She breaks everything.  But oh, my God, she's so hot.

Start time: 651.36
End time: 658.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I can't I can't give her a ladies and gentlemen.  This is why Coed magazine says NSFW is a must listen to podcast.

Start time: 658.66
End time: 659.47

Transcript:  Dude, the iPhone is so messed up.  The reception's up and down.  And but but have you had a boyfriend like that?

Start time: 680.64
End time: 693.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, and I'm about to give him the boot.  I mean, it's just it's ridiculous how much money I pay a month.  I feel like, you know, they I should be able to pay a percentage of my bill  for the percentage that they actually the phone actually works.  Too bad that's not legal. Wouldn't that be nice?

Start time: 694.00
End time: 718.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, now jailbreak is not going to fix that.  This is cool, though. You go to the site  and basically it's a Web page and it says jailbreak me.  It works on all the iPhone devices and you slide.  It's on the phone. You slide to jailbreak.  Nice. That's pretty.  Who has an iPhone for here that they want to jailbreak it?  Anybody in the studio? I do.  I'm looking around like a fugitive.  I'm getting a lot of money.

Start time: 719.04

End time: 735.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  There's this awkward moment like, are you serious?  Are you really?  I don't know.  OK, back it up before we need some jailbreaking.  By the way, in answer to my original question,

Start time: 735.16
End time: 740.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_17

And the great thing is that they really let us make our show.  Like they really don't, you know, impose their it's not like branded  entertainment, but it's what I'm saying, because a lot of web video is going  the way of basically an extended narrative commercial.  And I feel like that doesn't really push the medium forward in a way that  that allows, you know, the most creative.  You know, there's some really good branded entertainment shows out there,  but they're definitely two different sides of the entertainment coin.  And we're just really lucky to be able to have a sponsor who's been, you know,  this is our third year. It's just fantastic.

And a woman accompanied me and in the middle of it running,  I was like, I got to pee.  So this woman takes me to the bathroom and and then we go back.  And then the next day when I get home, I get an email saying, hey,  we're not allowed to do this during the hours.  But I just want to say I'm a huge fan of yours.

These self-driving cars are pretty cool.  Autonomous vehicles.  The article in the New York Times, Google cars drive themselves in traffic.  I wonder if there's an ice cream truck with Eric Schmidt not driving.  The idea behind this, Dmitry Dolgov is a Google engineer.  I just do it because I can do a Russian accent.  Google golf.  He's a Google, Google golf.  Is it driving?  Well, no, I guess they put an engineer in there just in case it crashes.  Well, to make it legal, to make it street legal.

And if I were to see a Toyota Prius with a curious funnel like cylinder on the  roof and no one at the wheel, I think I would freak out.

Start time: 1651.40
End time: 1680.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they have to put somebody at the wheel.  So that's why nobody was freaking out because I couldn't tell he wasn't driving  it, but to actually make it street legal.  They did some, some look at the rules of the road in California and found out  that you can have automatic systems as long as there's somebody there monitoring  them.  So they had an engineer who could turn off the automatic driving by hitting the  brake pedal, by speaking a word and one other way.  And they said they only had to actually do that, you know, half a dozen times on  this long trip.

It's a sensor on the roof that scans more than 200 feet in all directions to  generate a rise.  For lying radar to generate a precise three dimensional map of the car's  surroundings.  It then has four automotive radar sensors, three in front and one in the back to  determine the positions of distant objects.  It has a position estimator, a sensor on the left rear wheel, which measures  movements made by the car.  I guess it's giving you kind of a dead reckoning.  There's also a video camera in the front windshield near the rear view mirror  that's detecting traffic lights.  So there and then there's computers.

They even went down Lombard Street, which is the twistiest street in the  world in San Francisco.  The only accident was when one car was rear ended while stopped at a traffic  light, wasn't even the car's fault.  And they also said a lot of the time when they had to go ahead, Tom, I say a

End time: 1764.98

Start time: 1785.10
End time: 1803.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's the actual story is that Steve Ballmer and the CEO of Adobe  had a closed door meeting.  It's reported that they talked about ways of partnering and then somebody  somewhere speculated that maybe they talked about buying because, well,  there's one way of partnering is Microsoft buys Adobe and then it just  all went off from me.

Start time: 1803.91

They've done like some small acquisitions that they haven't made a big deal about,  but there, there hasn't been anything newsworthy that they've acquired all year long.  Saving up for Adobe.  I don't know.

Start time: 1839.26
End time: 1845.14

The, the, the Apple has, uh, and you know, they're, they're so far behind in the, on  the curve, even though they invented the entire market, which is the irony here.  Uh, they're so far behind on the curve with the new, you know, the new, uh, the  paradigm for these things that I don't see how they can catch up.  And I think it's already too late.

Rovio said, Hey, they didn't ask our permission.  We aren't currently developing for windows phone seven.  We don't know if we will develop for windows phone seven.  We think it's foul play to show the angry birds icon and an ad for windows phone seven.  I'd kind of agree.  This is the hottest app on, on iPhone, on iPad, and now on Android.  And, uh, this is obviously a Microsoft saying, Hey, here we got that too, but they  don't, they tweeted it's, they are not presently committed to bringing the game  to windows phone and the icon is being used in Microsoft marketing  completely without permission.

And it makes it harder to do or yeah,  it makes it harder to do something fake.

Because we know she's driving through northern Ontario.  There's a lot of bears and maybe she doesn't need help.  So, of course, you know, I'm on the phone with the RCMP.  We try to call her. We can't get through.  There's no signal.  And so all of a sudden, you know, like three hours later, we get through  and her mom starts laughing her head off.  But because we couldn't establish the tone that it was a joke, right?  If she had called and left a message, we would be like, oh, there's no tone.  And so we got an embarrassing speaking of lack of tone.

We should have told you.  Google also ended its week long suit.  Well, we don't know. It's probably going on for longer the week.  But the rumors have been going for a week that they were going to buy Groupon.  Apparently Groupon walked away from it.

Start time: 3123.30
End time: 3134.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, that was six billion or 40 million, I think.  I don't understand anybody walking away from six billion dollars.  If that deal for that, I think it has everything to do with the Justice Department  and nothing to do with money.

Transcript:  A Groupon, by the way, if you don't know, it's pretty popular.  So I imagine most everybody knows, but it's a way to get discounts.  Right. It's a coupon site.  You know, one deal per day per city.

Start time: 3150.48
End time: 3174.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't think it was bogus, though, because everybody else is doing this.  Amazon put that money into whatever that one.  That was six billion.  That same thing.  But no, everyone is getting into a way to try to localize search results  and localize reviews.  So there's no question that Google should want something like this.  I just maybe they didn't want to pay that much in the end.  I cannot see Groupon being like six billion.  I don't think so. I agree.

Start time: 3174.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I heard some good reasons why Google would want to have a company  with a huge local sales staff that could help out with that.  It has like 3500 sales people.  And then and Google doesn't have very many salespeople.  They kind of rely on on AdSense to just work on its own.

Start time: 3191.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So Amazon invested one hundred and seventy five million dollars in living social.  eBay invest or bought some other company that does Milo dot com,  which also does niche like localized searching.  So everybody in Google space is starting to play in the local playground.

Start time: 3209.34
End time: 3218.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Maybe this was a move for Groupon to get all of their competitors bought.  So they could be the only remaining independent.  That's convoluted.

Start time: 3218.06
End time: 3240.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, the other day, if you're going to go along that line of thinking,  there's also the possibility because we've seen Google do this before,  you know, try to bid something up to make some sucker, AKA Microsoft,  come in and overspend on something that Google really didn't want in the first place.  And I think this may have been like, you know, one of those deals  where you have the dollar bill hooked to a little fish line, you know,  and you throw it out there, see if Microsoft tries to pick it up and you pull it away.

Start time: 3241.32

Transcript:  There's just six billion dollars for Groupon.  I think everybody agreed that that was just an outrageous amount of money  for this company, at least right now.  Does is this a sign that there is a bubble in venture capital in investing?

He's the one who set me up with a slow pitch.  So nobody can do an IPO.  And so you got all these people, they got money, they want to invest,  they want to throw it at companies and they can't.  So they have to buy these companies because these companies can't go public  and get some some money to grow.  It's it's ruining the economy.  It's ruining the country. It's ruining the business.  We're screwed because of this.

Start time: 3282.62

Transcript:  I think there's a venture bubble, though, too.  I mean, I think there's a there's a way everybody is overrelying now  on purchasing smaller companies to build up your portfolio.  And as a result, venture capital guys are just throwing money  at these tiny companies that are wanting to get bought.  And I just just yesterday had wait Friday  had lunch with somebody who's going to work at a startup and said,  it's warm body time again in San Francisco,  where they're just pulling people off the street,  giving them a hot meal, cleaning them up and putting them to work,

He actually did an article called Microsoft's can a eulogy.  And that was the one feature that he actually said, look,  all phones need to have this.  This needs to be in Windows Phone 7.  This needs to be in future versions of Android and iOS.  It's truly like a great example of something that you just that just works,  that you don't really have to touch.  Now, the other aspects of the can, obviously, that that's why it failed.  But the idea behind this, that, you know, you take photos,  everything you do is just stored in your own personal account online  that you can access from anywhere.  That is kind of cool, right?  Because ultimately, at the end of the day, that's what we want.  We want all of our content on any device, anywhere, anytime.

Start time: 3559.28
End time: 3580.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Yeah, but you still had local storage of information, right?  Well, yeah, but then why do I need the cloud?  It's for convenience, right?  So say you're away from your phone or say you're on someone else's notebook  and you're like, oh, hey, I took these pictures on my phone.  I don't have to show you on the phone.  I can pull it up on my notebook or on your notebook or on your TV.  I mean, it's it's just that added flexibility is very nice.

Transcript:  Jason Chen was the Gizmodo reporter who had the stolen or found iPhone.  Authorities searched his house in April.  And they wanted to keep the information that they found on those electronic  devices that they they confiscated.  Chen agreed to submit information that was on those devices.  But the search warrant drew heat from critics and me and many people on this  show because they violated shield laws that protect journalists.  Mr. Chen's attorney went to the district attorney saying,  if you agree to withdraw the search warrant, we will grant you access to the  information you're looking for.  Eliminating.  What does that mean?  Well, and this is why there's a shield law, because you get the computer and  yeah, you're looking for one thing, but it could be a phishing expedition.  You could find maybe if this is a journalist that you are targeting,  you could find other source information.  So the attorney said, look, you're going to have problems in court with this  shield law, why don't we give you the information you're looking for and  protect the rest of the information on a system?  They said yes.  And they dropped the search warrant.

So they made a good, they made a deal.  They compromised with the, with Chen's attorney.  I think this is actually good news.  It means that those shields laws do carry some weight.  And, and, and I think as mono did the right thing, they said, look, you know,  we just want to protect our other sources.  We'll give you the information from about this specific thing.

Unfortunately, I happen to be more successful, well-known and richer than your dad.  So just because I'm so rich, don't expect your father to be rich because he's  probably a struggling actor who no one has ever heard of until recently.  So you'll have to keep playing with those old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old, old.  But if I were your dad, I'd buy you anything your heart desires.

Anyway, so yeah, I think success and congratulations to Isaiah Mustafa, who has  now been on every TV show and he's probably got a great career ahead of him.  And, and, and again, credit to really the creative behind this at Wheaton and Kennedy  because they did a great job.  That was fun.  You know, Lisa Bettany has been a long time friend of the show and I have some  very good news.  At least and I are going to do a photography show with some of our favorite  photographers, including Trey Ratcliffe and many others that's going to be coming  up.  In fact, it'll probably be the first show to come out of our new studios, more  about those new studios coming up in just a little bit.  But before we go much farther and in just a second, we're going to find out what  happens when somebody plays chat roulette live on the air.  Don't know who that would be, but before we do that, I'm going to have a sip from  my giant bowl of Michigan.  I did that for Ken and, um, mentioned carbonite pro, one of our longtime  sponsors, we've talked about carbonite consumer backup for a long time now,  easiest, simplest, most effective way to back up your data off site, uh, automatic.  Uh, you can get it back anywhere.  A lot of people started using carbonite consumer for their small businesses.  That's when carbonite said, well, we really ought to do a business version.  That's where carbonite pro came from.  Same ease of use.  And the nice thing about carbonite pro is you don't pay per user.  You just pay for the amount of storage you use.  So whether you've got two employees or 200, all you pay for is how much you're  backing up and it's very affordable prices started $10 a month.  That gives you 20 gigabytes of backup enough for 10 desktops, each with two gigs.  That's a lot for 10 bucks a month.  It's automatic.  You have a centralized dashboard.  So you know which systems are backed up and which aren't, and your users can  restore the same easy way they restore with carbonite consumer with the iPhone  app, the Blackberry app, or just by logging into the net from any computer.  Carbonite pro.com.  I want you to try it free in your small business, 30 days, 30 days for free.  Carbonite pro.com.  We do think carbonite for bringing us, uh, for keeping us a float for the last year,  uh, this great programming.  Now back to the best of the holiday special.  Yes, that explains why I'm dressed like this.  Uh, we are going to find out in a moment what happens when Leo decides to play chat  roulette live on the air and mirth and merriment in Sue watch.  Even my wife knows about chat roulette and she doesn't know about anything.  So I'm going to go to chat roulette.  So what happens with chat roulette is what you're going to go to chat.

In the article in The Times yesterday,  Stephen Johnson quotes Harvard's Jonathan Zittrain,  who talks about...

Transcript:  Really neat, interesting guy.  He talks about generative, the generative power of the net.  He says, when you don't have to ask permission to create  and share new ideas,  when small innovative startups can compete  with giant multinationals,  I think of us as a good copy of that.  I'm competing with Rupert Murdoch.  Even though he's got all this power,  thanks to the Internet, inexpensive consumer electronics,  I can create television  that anybody in the world can see.  So that's the generative power of an open, a free Internet,  the kind of thing that we want to protect,  whether it's through government regulation,  which I know some people don't like the idea of,  maybe through free markets, but we need to protect it.  You'd agree with that, right, Brian?

Transcript:  Okay, so then if you believe that,  then you look at Steve Jobs and Apple and you say,  well, this is the opposite, isn't it?  It's a walled garden, it's AOL, it's MSN,  it's CompuServe all over again,  where we control everything rigidly,  and you didn't see any innovative stuff happening  on those platforms because you couldn't.  It was their way or the highway.  Well, here's an interesting thing.  Steve Jobs has created this app store,  I think maybe against the will of Apple.  It certainly wasn't their original plan.  You know, when the iPhone came out, they said,  oh, you don't need apps, you got web apps,  that's great, you should be happy.  That didn't work, so they created the app store.  He said, we will never, da, da, da.  Probably did.  We'll never have apps.  I'm sure he had some reason why apps were a bad thing, right?  And why you would never want them.  You wouldn't want an app.  So people demanded an app, year two, they made app store.  Years three, they've got 175,000 applications.  There's no one who could say  that it hasn't been innovative,  that it hasn't been generative.

Start time: 4650.02
End time: 4716.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  Nothing's black and white.  It certainly isn't, and that's sometimes a cop out  in an argument, but I think in this case,  it is true because Apple has opened the doors wide enough  to let a lot of non-Apple innovation in  while still retaining control enough  to maintain a user experience that meets their standard.  So not everybody agrees on that intersection.  There are people who want apps and capabilities tethering,  routers, voice in the background, true multitasking  that doesn't meet Apple's standard.  And so they draw a line that is closer to home  than what some innovators want.  So not every type of innovation can happen.  What Apple has decided is,  well, we can't do it all ourselves.  I mean, there's a benefit to the platform owners  in opening up because they can't solve every problem.  They can't write every code.  And so they've drawn a compromising line  which satisfies the vast majority of their audience.  And the more purists, the more geek oriented  are less happy because they'd love to do a lot more.  They see potential where others might not.  And so you get this frustration at that margin.  But overall, Apple's been relatively open.  I'm someone who's pushed for a lot more from them,  but I also recognize a lot of what Stephen's written.

Transcript:  No apps crashed.  There was no blue screen of death.  It's an interesting combination

Start time: 4745.42
End time: 4769.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because you have this walled garden  where you can create applications  and they work really well.  And Apple has this set of standards that you develop by.  And on the same token, if you don't like that,  you can go to a more open operating system  like Android or Palm OS.  And then you can have that experience.  And it's like, do you either want to make applications  that you can sell millions of copies on in the Apple store  or do you want to develop something that's more open  and cross platform on Android or Palm?

Start time: 4769.52
End time: 4796.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's true though, let's point it out  that there is a very good web browser  on the iPad and the iPhone and it's Safari.  And you can even run web apps that I can design  and anybody can design.  But now here's the monkey wrench.  Because in iPhone 4.0 agreement,  Apple did something that I think the tent poles  are meaningless compared to this.  They said, going forward,  you may not develop applications for this platform,  iPhone, iPod touch or iPad  with anything but Apple approved tools.

Start time: 4828.82
End time: 4852.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_15
Transcript:  By the way, this is a really interesting face off  because on the one hand,  Apple has first mover advantage.  It has all the momentum.  It currently has most of the software.  But it seems like in the long term,  I mean, I believe Apple was pretty far ahead  in the PC days early on  until Microsoft was completely open to everyone.  And I wonder, it'll be really interesting to see  if the Android completely open architecture allows for,  I don't know, allows for ketchup.  I don't know.

Start time: 4855.40
End time: 4893.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  I think it could be good  but I think Apple's learned from the past.  They're not repeating the same mistake.  First of all, they integrated a lot more  and the big step is commerce.  What Veronica was talking about with,  you can go to Android or Palma West  but you can't get as large a pool of money  at your footsteps as a developer,  as a content producer or seller  than you can get in the iTunes apps.  Or they've made the friction between you  and getting that app and money in between really slick,  super smooth, super fast.  So if you want to, you can get a web app.  If you're a developer, it's pretty good.  Monetizing that web app is a lot harder on an iPhone  than selling it in the app store would be  because there's no payments.

Transcript:  And plus, as Gruber said,  it's really dangerous for Apple to rely on something  like Flash when if anything happens to Flash and it breaks  and suddenly all these iPhone apps no longer work  or iPad apps, then that's going to be a bad experience  for the users.

And although it's a great honor.  But Gruber said some interesting things.  Gruber did in that same blog post point out  that Apple, it's a lock-in for Apple,  that Apple is, it's good for business.  He says it's mostly good for users.  And this is the question.  Is a move like this for Apple's benefit or our benefit?  I think it's-

I'm not saying developers as a group should like it,  but what I am saying is that they've segmented,  they forced the segmentation in the developer market.

Start time: 5219.28
End time: 5276.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Well, that's why Blippi's in the news.  And somebody told me one of them was mine,  but I don't think that's the case.  It wasn't.  Yeah.  So what happened with Blippi is they strip out,  they take the raw feed from your credit card.  They are using the same service that Mint uses,  which is the same service that a lot of banks use.  What is it?  I can't remember what the name of it is.  It's some silly Web 2.0 whoopie, whoopie doopie name.  But all the banks use it.  So you're not giving your credit card information  to Blippi per se.  You're giving it to this third party  that banks and Mint use.  So it's not like you're revealing anything.  But the information Blippi was getting back  did include credit card numbers  and a lot of other raw information.  Their automatic system strips it out  and then posts this kind of bowdlerized version  of what you bought.  But apparently Google was caching full information.  And if you did a Google search for Blippi,  you could get these credit card numbers.  But it was only four numbers, right, Becky?  Is that right?

Start time: 5277.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_19

And by the time he returned my call,  the information come out  that it wasn't all users' credit cards released.  It was a pretty minor.  It was just four or five.  He was doing a lot of damage control.  And at that point when I said,  okay, if it's only four or five people,  then we're not going to do the story.  And I could hear this feeling of visible exhale  of just this incredible relief.  And he said, my day, which already sucks,  just got less worse.

Our next segment, she will have already had the baby  and the proud papa will appear.  But before we get to that,  I would like to mention our good friends at Ford  who have been such a great supporter all year long  for all of our shows.  Ford has such great vehicles.  We've talked a lot about the Edge.  We'll be talking in a moment about the new Focus,  which Ford's very excited about.  But don't forget the Ford Fiesta,  the brand new 2011 Fiesta is such a beautiful car  with elegant lines, state of the art technology,  a great engine, and of course the Ford SYNC as well.  If you haven't test driven a Ford Fiesta,  I think you should take a look.  Amazing mileage.  I think it's the best mileage in the class.  40 miles per gallon highway, according to the EPA.  40 miles per gallon and a peppy, fun engine.  I test drove one the other day and I really enjoyed it.  I invite you to visit your Ford dealer.  Test drive the brand new 2011 Fiesta.  Take a look at the Ford SYNC built in.  I think you're gonna like that too.  And now here's the deal with the Ford Focus.  You could test drive that.  The new 2012 Ford Focus comes out early next year  and they're doing something kind of special  to give some of our viewers and listeners  a special early chance to test drive the Ford Focus  in Madrid, Spain.  Here's what you do.  Go to twtfordfocus.com.  That's a Facebook page.  And you'll see all the instructions there.  Lucky winners will get to go to Madrid,  to the National Institute of Standards there in Madrid.  I think I'm going to.  Test drive the brand new 2012 Ford Focus  and you'll get $10,000 donated to the charity of your choice.  Isn't that great?  Ford's donating a total of half a million dollars in all.  So if you wanna get in on this,  before December 31st, 2010,  and I hope you watch this before the end of the year,  you've missed out.  But before the end of the year,  go to twtfordfocus.com,  read the instructions,  make your two minute video explaining  why you should be going to Madrid with me  and should get that $10,000 for the charity of your choice  and why you like that charity.  Two minutes total, twtfordfocus.com.  Isn't that great?  That sounds like a great contest, a great prize.  Anyway, thank you Ford for your support.  We really appreciate it.  Make sure you check out the Ford Fiesta,  Ford dealer new you now.  Let us head back in time to this fall.  Clayton Morris lives in New York,  but was born in Philadelphia,  is a natural born, bleeding red Philadelphia Phillies fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That would be amazing.  Let's fast forward to the year 2010,  where Aaron Sorkin writes a movie.  A movie kind of loosely based on Facebook.  Finally, a man named Mark Zuckerberg,  who actually lived that, sees the movie.  He's asked at the Y Combinator startup conference  what he thought of the Facebook movie.

Start time: 6346.06
End time: 6357.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One of the biggest ones.  I mean, I don't know.  It's interesting what stuff they focused on getting right.  Like every single shirt and fleece that I had in that movie  is actually a shirt or fleece that I own.  Um.

Start time: 6358.68

Transcript:  Um.  But.  Um.

Start time: 6361.38
End time: 6425.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Um.  But.  You know, so there's all the stuff that they got wrong  and a bunch of random details that they got right.  The thing that I think is actually most thematically  interesting that they got wrong is,  they, the whole framing of the movie,  kind of the way that it starts is,  I'm with this girl who doesn't exist in real life,  who dumps me, which has happened in real life a lot.  And, um.  And.  And basically, the frame it as if the whole reason  for making Facebook and building something  was because I wanted to get girls  or wanted to get into some kind of social institution.  And I mean, the reality for people who know me  is I've actually been dating the same girl  since before I started Facebook,  so obviously that's not a part of it.  But I think it's just, it's such a big disconnect  from I think the way that people who make movies  think about what we do in Silicon Valley, building stuff.  Right, like they just can't wrap their head around  the idea that someone might build something  because they like building things.

Start time: 6430.36
End time: 6466.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the most eloquent I've ever seen him be.  And I have to say his point is really, really accurate.  I think that the perception of, I mean, you can,  look, if you've seen Aaron Sorkin talk about these characters,  you can tell that he has a tremendous disdain for people  who do the kinds of things that Zuckerberg did  and the people around him do.  And I do think there's a real disconnect there.  He's right about what the perception from the inside  versus the outside.  And he thinks like, of course,  he's motivated by his hatred for women.  That's why he started Facebook.  And that's a very childish way to think about  why somebody would start something  or work on something like Facebook.

I wanna thank everybody who went to twit.tv  and voted for your favorite segments.  I hope yours made it in there  and look forward to a whole year of miscues,  dirty subjects and crazy stuff happening  in twit in years to come.  You know, we do twit every Sunday.  You're always welcome to watch it live.  That's when you get the full brunt of the onslaught.  We do it live Sundays at 3 p.m. Pacific,  6 p.m. Eastern time at live.twit.tv.  And of course, after the fact, you can download it  and listen or watch at your convenience.  Now I mentioned earlier in the show  that we are going to be moving to a new studio.  This is something I've always wanted to do  is have a little time here out in the fireplace.  We're out in the main offices of the twit cottage.  As much as we love the twit cottage  with the addition of Tom Merritt and Sarah Lane  and Becky Worley, we've just started  to run out of room, frankly.  So we found a great place down the street.  Now the cottage is what about?  1500 square feet, 2000 square feet.  So the new place we thought,  we should get a little more room.  10,000 square feet plus a 10,000 square foot basement.  So we're moving to a place  that is essentially 1000 times bigger.  I think my math is correct.  It's big.

We will be in the twit cottage for a few more months,  but sometime in late spring, early summer,  we will move to a new facility.  We hope to kind of recreate some of the feeling  of the twit cottage.  We know that that's part of the appeal of this.  Certainly we're not gonna be any less inept down home.  But folksy, we can promise you that.  Thanks very much.  Have a great holiday season and all the best for 2011.  We hope to see you right back here next year  on this week in tech.  For all of us at the twit cottage, good night.  And God bless.
