Transcript:  It's time for TWiT This Week in Tech.  It's the show where we grab tech by the ankles and shake it until sense falls out of its pockets.  I'm your host, father Robert Balazair, the digital Jesuit.  I'm in for Leo Laporte, the tech guy who is currently having an Aussie holiday down under.  You know, going on walkabout with some dingoes or maybe throwing a shrimp on the bavi with a koala.  And Uncle Leo wants you to remember, TWiT, it's Australian for podcast.  Of course, I'm not alone.  I'm joined by a fantastic panel starting on my right with Mr. Brian Brushwood.  That's right, Schwud himself, the magician extraordinaire, the businessman who raised,  what was it, $33,000 in Indiegogo?

He brings inspiration out of people and of course host of Weird Things and well, our own NSFW show.  Justin, thank you for coming in.  Pleasure to be here, Robert.  And what, wait, I'm sorry.  You remind me of somebody.  Just looking at you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how much we know.  I'm closer to Blade Runner than Battlestar.  I'm not that old just yet.  But really, this is all complete nonsense because we have yet to introduce our final panelist.  Who's really the anchor, our clean-up hitter here.

Transcript:  I'll tell you, I've gotten that a couple times.  This has been the curse of Justin Robert Young.  He sounds like Charlie Day as well.  And in fact, there was a time on NSFW where I played a clip of Charlie Day and Justin actually thought it was himself.  So this is a play.

Start time: 285.80
End time: 295.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's definitely happened before, despite the fact that I adamantly say I don't sound like him.  But Shira, I feel like every time that you come on a show, people should just aggressively ask you what's trending.  That's how every conversation should begin.  It is.

Start time: 297.80
End time: 326.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The meetings I have, you'd be like, and that's trending, huh?  It's like the constant joke.  But yeah, we have a daily live interactive show at youtube.com, slash what's trending, where we curate the videos on YouTube that you should be watching,  including all these stars and celebrities on the platform.  And we describe it as what MTV was to music videos.  We are to YouTube videos and the culture around it.  So it's really fun.  We have a blast.  It's a brand that we're just growing.  It's just the beginning.  And so I encourage everyone to check it out.  No, you guys do a great job.

Start time: 354.76
End time: 360.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We could set that up.  Fantastic.  Let's start off with the first big story, which is also a story that I think a lot of us are sick of.

Start time: 362.06
End time: 381.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but again, a lot of people who listen to Twit, this is their wrap up for the week in tech.  They don't have time to just stay on the stories like we do here at the network.  If you listen to Tech News Today and Windows Weekly, obviously the big story is Steve Sinovsky out at Microsoft, the head of Windows, now no more.

Start time: 381.26
End time: 407.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it's one of these stories that everyone talked about ad nauseum for the past week.  There are a lot of rumors about why it happened, about people who liked him, didn't like him, about his business strategy,  that he's been with Microsoft since I believe 1988, 1989.  Shira, what have you heard that you can share with us?  We know that there's some conflict between him and Bomber, but the rest of it is really just the stuff of rumor.

Start time: 407.96
End time: 458.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I feel like the whole company needs a new beginning in a way.  Like Microsoft, the relevancy of the company, it's just not relevant anymore.  And when you have people and employees and leaders that have been around since the 80s,  I mean, things aren't the same as they were in the 80s.  And to really innovate this day and age, you need to bring in some new blood.  I mean, even Bomber, like at CES, whenever he gives us CES speeches, it just doesn't, it feels off.  I mean, and he tries to be, they try to be new and hot and relevant.  And they're just not. And I think that with him out now, obviously we're all sick of this,  but hopefully it will allow for some new blood to come in to really kind of give it some revamping.  Right. I mean, it's so crazy. Like Microsoft, we're in Venice right now where Google just  created headquarters and how Microsoft is moving in in this area as well, which is wild.

Start time: 460.00
End time: 465.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so they did their big surface announcement initially in LA, right?  In Culver City.

Start time: 466.40
End time: 483.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was big. And even John Chu, who directs all of Justin Bieber's movies and music videos,  he directed their commercial. And so you see, they're trying to have that cool factor to them  right now. And that said, that involves changing up the executive level players.

Start time: 484.28
End time: 502.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In the context of what's happening now, though, the question is, and I don't know if we have a  good answer for it, what is, is this a referendum on a Windows 8, the sales of Windows 8, or if  where they want to go with Windows as a platform? Brian, do you think that this is?

Start time: 502.38
End time: 523.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, no, that's exactly what I was going to ask is if, I mean, obviously I think we probably are  all on the same page that if Windows 8 was a breakaway success, we probably wouldn't see an  upheaval like this. But it makes me wonder behind the scenes if there were certain decisions that he  took personal responsibility for and that now that Windows 8 has had a relatively soft launch  that he's having to pay the price for.

Start time: 524.02
End time: 600.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I did hear something from a source close to the matter who mentioned that even if Windows  8 had been a first day blockbuster success, everyone in the world decided to dump the Windows  7 computers and upgrade to Windows 8, that Sonofsky still would have been out. His take was  this has been building for a while because there's so much resentment of the guy, the fact that he  set Microsoft divisions against each other. He wanted live to compete with Office to compete with  Windows to compete with what other divisions that got on campus. And that doesn't meet, that doesn't  match the new Windows 8 philosophy, the whole one UI multiple platforms. This source of mine was  essentially saying they didn't want to change Sonofsky before the Windows 8 launch because,  well, he was the guiding force behind it. But once it did launch and once they saw that it wasn't  going to be a runaway success, but it's still going to sell millions of copies, they didn't see a  reason to keep them out.  Don't let the start button hit you on the butt on the way out.  Exactly. We've actually got a clip here from Windows Weekly. So this past week, Paul Therod  on Windows Weekly talked about his interactions with Sonofsky and he described him as basically  a petty and vindictive man. Let's take a listen.

Start time: 601.18
End time: 627.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He was talking to somebody over on the side after the event or in a break during the event. I walked  up and I kind of waited and they stopped talking for a second. I said, I'm sorry to interrupt,  I just wanted to introduce myself. I'm Paul Therod. And he did this thing where he kind of  stepped back and he looked me up and down and then he just went right back to talking to the  other guy. Didn't even just completely blew me off. And I thought to myself, well,  I'm never going to be buddies with this guy, I guess.

Start time: 628.76
End time: 632.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yeah, that's just one story. What were you going to say, Brian?

Start time: 633.70
End time: 652.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, no, no. I mean, it sounds like petty and vindictive. I saw that in the doc and I was  wondering where that came from. But firsthand account like that, I mean, we live in an age where  personality definitely matters. And in a world where one bad mistreatment can have ripples  throughout the blogosphere, you can't afford to be that D bag.

Start time: 654.44
End time: 692.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can you not though? If you're delivering the numbers, I mean, we are rife with stories of  the warrior CEO who makes the hard decisions and ticks people off but does it for the greater  success that comes after. We lionize, we mythologize these people, including most  notably probably Steve Jobs. Sure. So Jobs, yeah. Yeah. I mean, that would be the person that you  would immediately think of. So, I mean, if he had success, I mean, I can't imagine that if everybody  was like, well, clearly this is the way forward. We're seeing clear lines of success, not only with  Windows 8, but 10 years down the road that Sanofsky would still be there. Yeah. You're saying,

Start time: 692.56
End time: 748.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah. I mean, I think, yeah, if you see success. And I wanted to say something. Someone tweeted me  at tech AU goes, Shira Lazar says Microsoft is no longer relevant. Completely disagree. And I think  it's not saying that they're irrelevant at all. We work actually, you know, I work with a lot of  people at Microsoft. So I'm just saying that's not what I'm saying. I just think that any company  that's been around for years, you're constantly dealing with, you know, obviously other huge  brands like Apple who are innovating and they're like the cool, hot company, right? That everyone  and you need to find ways to innovate. And it's hard also when you, what you said, when you're  siloed so much, I think with a company like Microsoft, there's so many parts of it. You  have the Xbox, you have Windows, you have the Android, you have Bing now. I mean, like, I think  the real success of the company will be when you see all these different divisions of them come  together and take advantage of each other. And it's about having a leader at the helm of that.  So that's what I really meant. That's the angle.

Start time: 753.58
End time: 809.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but when you, when you consider it, I mean, let's look at one example that I use in enterprise  all the time. Windows Phone. Windows Phone is actually a really good UI. It's a clean device.  It works relatively well. They could have one major advantage and that is that business runs  on Exchange Server. But to make a Windows Phone work properly with an Exchange Server, it's a  multi-step process that involves additional licensing, that involves additional purchases.  And that's because the Windows Phone division competes with the Exchange division. What they  want to do, and I think one of the reasons why they dumped Sanofsky is because they want to say,  look, we don't care how each division does. We care about how Microsoft does. And if we can give  people a compelling reason to buy a Windows mobile phone, being if you buy it, it automatically  works with Exchange. No additional settings, no additional purchases, no additional licensing.  The company as a whole will do much better. Yeah. Yeah. It's ease of use, right? Everything,

Start time: 810.12
End time: 830.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  consumers want something easy that will be seamless with all the other gadgets they have. And so you're  more likely to have a Microsoft lifestyle. You can say if all those tools you use connect with each  other very easily. But if they make it harder for that to happen, then it won't be as easy for

Start time: 830.14
End time: 852.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  people to do that. So let me ask, has anyone here actually upgraded to Windows 8? Or I don't know  how many of you guys are just all Mac, because I mean, I'm PC on everything. You have done the  upgrade. Do you derive any benefit from the fact that the formerly known as Metro interface is  the same one used on the tablets? Or is that just annoying? Or do you wish you had your start button

Start time: 852.20
End time: 884.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  back? Right. So I've got it on several different computers. I have it on a Acer W700, which is an  actual tablet. It's designed to be a Windows tablet. It's a full on laptop in a tablet format.  It actually works really, really well on that. I've also got it on an all in one also from Acer,  and it works exceptionally well on that. I upgraded this laptop, this is an S3 to Windows 8. And about  two days later, I downgraded to Windows 7. Wow. If it doesn't have the touchscreen, it just,  there's no reason to have Metro. And that would be your enterprise market.

Start time: 884.30
End time: 917.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be your enterprise. And that's the thing is when we look at Windows sales,  it's not like what Apple does. Apple is a consumer focused company. They deal with the lines that  stretch around the block that's big for a company that deals from them to people on the street.  For enterprise markets, you know well before a launch what your numbers are going to be,  because they sell these things in bulk and it's a person to person contact. You would know better  than anybody in terms of covering this stuff on Twyatt. But you will know long before the release  date of this, whether or not it is likely to be a success on the enterprise market, which is such

Start time: 917.80
End time: 980.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a gigantic part of the lifeblood of Microsoft. Right. Now, one thing I will say is there's been  this sort of hushed murmur in the crowd, in the enterprise crowd that Windows 8 is actually a  decent operating system. It's well done. It is Windows 7 with that additional, what we used to  call Metro interface over the top. You could make it suitable for enterprise if you did one thing.  That's put the start button back on the desktop mode. If you did that, it basically turns it into  Windows 7 with the additional advantage of having the Metro interface. Now, whether or not that's  going to happen, who knows? It depends how much Microsoft wants to push 8 into the enterprise,  which they really don't have to. I mean, enterprise is going to stick with XP and 7. They've actually  made the switch. There are now more 7 machines than there are XP machines. But I think who made  the comment? Apple goes for the consumer level. Me. I made that comment. Yeah, that's right.  Jerry made the comment. And Microsoft, they make their bread and butter in the enterprise. And I  think maybe they got caught up a bit too much in saying, we want the rest. We want that 7%, that 5%.

Start time: 981.34
End time: 1000.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's the sexy part. The consumers are the sexy part. And I think they want a bit of that.  And that's why they're going, becoming a bit more mainstream in the way they put out their  products and in terms of how they publicize them. I definitely think there's appeal to that to them.

Start time: 1001.94
End time: 1046.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and keep in mind, of course, that whether it's a pretty niche or not, what you want to do  for your business to thrive and survive as a brand, you need to own exactly one niche and  completely dominate it. And whether they like the fact that they're the nerdy guy with glasses,  essentially the character from the Mac ads, that's who Microsoft is. And that's where they make  their money. And I think you're right. I think there's this perverse desire for them to want to  go toe to toe and to show the Apple that they can play their hip stylish cool game. And essentially,  it muddies the water. It puts them in the mushy middle to where you don't know exactly what you're  getting from it. It's like that when I think Windows 8, I think of one thing, I think of tiles,  and I cannot name to you a single other benefit to the operating system.

Start time: 1047.38
End time: 1051.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Well, I mean, a lot of it is behind the scenes. One of the big things about Windows 8...

Start time: 1051.70
End time: 1056.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It shouldn't be behind the scenes. That's my whole point is they give me something besides

Start time: 1056.22
End time: 1061.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  tiles to get motivated about. There's a killer mahjong game.

Start time: 1062.64
End time: 1070.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  More tiles. Always put the tiles, you. I think that little girl who likes painting  pictures with her fingers and print it out for her dad, that seems like it's working really well

Start time: 1070.98
End time: 1083.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  for her. This is terrible. What they should do is they should say we're Microsoft, we're about  making money and getting your business done, not about being pretty, stylish, hip or cool.  And yet that's what all of their marketing and advertising is saying. So it doesn't surprise me.

Start time: 1083.52
End time: 1113.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to throw this to Shira because I want the trending idea on this. Microsoft is, I mean,  at their core, they are an enterprise company. They're all about being the business company.  But I think they've been scared by the phenomenon of BYOD, bring your own device.  You've got all these business people, these execs, and even mid-level managers who are bringing in  their devices from home, their iPhones, their iPads, their Macbooks. And I think Microsoft  freaked out. And so that's what Windows 8 is in response to. But the thing is, I think you have

Start time: 1113.70
End time: 1175.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to realize while you're saying, oh, they need to stay with what they're known for and how we all  knew them, I don't think that's the right way to approach business. It's like the culture is  changing. People are changing. Like you said, companies used to buy computers en masse. They  would just buy a ton of computers or laptops for their company and just give them off to different  people. And they would keep those computers at the office. But like what you said, people are  bringing their devices, what they like working with, from home. So the culture is changing.  And so they need a change with the culture too if they want to be creating something that's  relevant, which in turn drives revenue. I mean, I don't think it's about staying in the same model,  but it's about creating something with that shift that works for them and not trying to just go  after what they think everyone wants based on another company's success. I think it's just  about finding their own identity with that pivot. But it's not about staying the same. Like no  company has succeeded in staying the same as they've always were. Well, and I don't think it's

Start time: 1175.16
End time: 1185.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  necessarily a matter of staying the same, but certainly recognizing your core competency and  more importantly, what your brand is exceptionally valued for and then going and targeting that like

Start time: 1185.26
End time: 1222.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a laser. And instead, you know, but it's not like Microsoft was never a consumer brand, the people  that consumers had a relationship with, you know, before Apple's resurgence in the late 90s, you  know, Windows was a, there were people like their Windows operating system because it added  functionality that they didn't have before. You know, it was a big thing to the masses. So I mean,  like, and in that sense, they were far hipper then than they are now. I mean, Apple became a much  sexier company, but it's not like they weren't a consumer brand. I want to evolve the story a

Start time: 1222.42
End time: 1254.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  little bit. So let me add in a little tidbit. So when sales figures, so sales of Windows machines,  of PC machines have been adjusted, people had previously thought that we'd continue to see  growth until about 2014. Gartner just adjusted their sales figures to show that starting in  2012, extending to 2016, we're actually going to start to see the PC market shrink. Now, before  there's any panic, you got to know that there's about, I think, almost a hundred million tablets  sold a year. There's about 355 million PCs sold a year. There's about 650 million smartphones sold

Start time: 1258.32
End time: 1268.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a year. So the PC figure is not including tablets, which I know has been an issue where  some people count tablets as PCs and some people don't. Right, right. So I mean, you can play with

Start time: 1268.42
End time: 1293.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the numbers. It's not that much of a doom and gloom scenario, but my question to the panel would be  this. With the release of Windows 8, with the fact that we're still waiting to see whether or not it's  really going to change the game with this cross-platform UI, what would you expect to see? What do you  want to see out of Microsoft as we head into this, again, post PC era, which we've been promising

Start time: 1294.12
End time: 1349.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  since 1994? I mean, I don't know necessarily what I expect. I mean, it's hard for me to even really  want to chime in on this until we get the... I don't feel like we've seen the main act on the  surface yet. I feel like until we have a full version of Windows running on a surface tablet,  that's when we're going to start to see the opportunity. Because I think there's a lot of  people who regard a lot of value to their iPads in enterprise, but they regard them mainly as toys,  because you're not going to sit down. You're not going to work with Excel. You're not going to do  anything in Apple numbers or whatever in there. It's not a grown-up enterprise object yet, but  the surface does have that opportunity to completely replace the functionality of most of  these road warriors' laptops.

But if we look at the service as something that's  for the professionals and they use what they brought to professionals back in the day with  the PC and they translate that to the top, to the surface, that could create a huge market.

Transcript:  Leo, what's going on? Leo? Excuse me, just a moment. I know this is a serious program and I'm here to  talk about a serious problem. If you're in the IT business, you got a serious problem. Let me tell  you, that is not a fun job. I understand people are moving all over the place. You want to go  somewhere. You tied down. I have a way that can make your life so much easier. You can be more  effective. If you want to make more money, you can. If you want to work less, you can. You get the  choice. This is GoToAssist and it is simply the most important tool for any IT or support  professional. It is so awesome. Wait a minute. You say, I know about GoToAssist. It's remote access,  right? Oh, well, it's, yeah, sort of. It's much more than that. It is, in fact, the number one  remote access remote support tool used by more people than anybody else because of its speed,  but also you can do eight sessions at once. You can do unattended sessions. It's got a lot of  features for IT professionals, but that's just scratching the surface. Remote support is just  part of what GoToAssist does. The good folks at Citrix keep adding features. I guess that's why  people are sometimes confused about what you get with GoToAssist. Sure, there's remote support,  live support for PCs, Macs, and mobile devices from PCs, Macs, and mobile devices,  but you can also use their new service desk functionality that easily manage, track, and resolve  issues. You could build a beautiful branded self-service portal. The service desk is amazing,  and they've also added monitoring. I gotta tell you, this is an incredible value. If you're an IT  guy and you want to build your business, you become a managed service provider, for instance. That's  what our friend Russell does, Russell Tammany. He's got three guys. They handle 350 plus clients,  and the way they get it done is this. So here's how it works. GoToAssist, you put the crawler on  your client's network. It tells you every bit of hardware and software, network devices too,  attached to the network, everything. Then you can track its performance. This is really important  to being effective in IT, is kind of tracking what's going on. It's this dashboard. You can  use standard modules or create your own customized ones. Keep track of everything. Plus, you'll get  instant message, text messages, or emails when there's something that crosses a threshold. Let  you know so you can immediately fix it. Be proactive in support. Nip a problem in the bud  before it becomes a big one. Then the remote support's very handy too, right? I think you're  going to love this. If you're in support, you've got to try this. GoToAssist.com.  GoToAssist.com. Click the try it free button right there and use our promo code TWIT. You get 30 days  free. By the way, you can try all three modules for 30 days free. So do check those boxes. They  say you want remote support? Yes. You want monitoring? Yes. You want service desk? Yes.

Transcript:  TWIT. Thanks, Leo. We appreciate that. I do want to move on to the next story and that is about,  well, Zynga. Y'all remember Zynga. That's right. It's that gaming company that made its name because  they basically tied themselves to Facebook. They IPO'd for $10. They're now down about $2. They  just lost their CFO. Down $2, $2? Down to $2. Yes. Two, two. Lots of twos there. Yeah. And well,  their earnings are between zero and one cent per share on sales of $300 million for the quarter. So  they're not doing well. They lost their CFO who has been with them since the beginning. And  ironically, they lost him to Facebook. So they've lost about 78% of their value since the IPO.  Zynga plans to cut its workforce by 5%. They're going to, they closed its Boston studio. They're  thinking about closing their offices in the UK and Japan. And they're taking a 50% write down  on their $183 million purchase of OMG Pop. Now part of that was stock though, right? Part of that was  stock. Right. So, you know, it's not pure cash, but still, I mean, that's horrible for a company  that just bought what at the time people were thinking was like crazy, crazy overpriced

Transcript:  see. But, you know, I hold on. This is, this is something Justin and I were actually talking  about earlier today, as a matter of fact, and there is hold out for this possibility because  Justin kind of blew my mind. There could be a single switch that gets flipped and all of a sudden  Zynga becomes the most profitable, the most important gaming entity in all of PC and the

Start time: 1754.02
End time: 1808.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  social media world. Can you even say it? I heard from, and this is so second hand from second hand,  but the rumor was that Zynga is kind of holding out hope that their knight in shining armor is going  to be some kind of either they find a loophole so they're able to do it or a legal change in  online gambling, that they are perfectly positioned for gaming online, especially if real money  can be involved and they can get into what, you know, poker stars and sites like that were  that based, you know, in Facebook, they are perfectly nested to do that. Now, whether or not  that happens, whether or not they can open up those functionalities in countries like the UK,  where these things are closer to legalization, or whether or not we see the culture change politically  here, where that is more likely remains to be seen, but that seems to be what they would be

Start time: 1809.92
End time: 1972.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  perfectly positioned for. Well, yeah, it goes back to companies that base their whole success and  revenue off of, you know, off of Facebook, or you could say all the companies that were based off  of Twitter also that once they constrain those APIs, and once they make it more restrictive,  and they don't let the floodgates open for traffic or for discovery, then all these companies find  that they're not succeeding at all, and then not driving any sort of traffic. I mean, I don't think  that obviously, Zynga used to spam everyone, I don't think it happens as much because Facebook  probably created some regulations, rules around that. And the same thing goes for some of these  video platforms that were coming up a lot, like, you know, whether it be the Vidi's or the touts,  or the one that Justin TV recently sold, I forget what it's called, but a lot of people were saying,  oh, like they felt spammy because they were popping up in feed. And then suddenly,  Facebook restricted that and all of them saw a decline in users and in social, you could say,  around the product. And so with Zynga, I mean, it's one of those things that it had its hot  moments and people obviously still use Farmville and all these things. I mean, I was never really  into that. Were you never a farmer, Shira? I believe in the earth and in nature, but I was not.  There's more coffee, of course. Yes, you got me there. Yeah, but I was never into it,  but it's also that they never really changed. They never really added features or games. It's  kind of like a lot of these companies have their big year and then they don't really evolve or  innovate after that. It's kind of like they expect that that's it. This is the thing and  everyone's loving it. And so I find they don't end up innovating or evolving at all. And I think  that's what happened with Zynga and also the draw something thing. I mean, I know Charles Foreman,  he's awesome. But, you know, yeah, if they had waited a week, it was literally 10 days later,  and then draw something like lost all of its users and there was a huge decline. But it goes  back to we're always trying to find these hot companies this day and age and we want to find  the next Facebook's and the next Twitter's. And we do believe as entrepreneurs that that is  possible. There needs to be some sort of competition. However, these types of companies,  you know, these types of things happen once every, you could say decade. You know, it's like an Apple  or Microsoft, like very few companies ended up pushing through. Right. And I'm sure there are  other little computing companies. But I think we're trying to do that in the social world as well.  And obviously building our companies on top of these huge social networks. But it's hard to push  through when you're on top of someone else's. You're like basically creating a party room in

Start time: 1972.84
End time: 1991.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  someone else's house. We want innovation. We want them to evolve. But here's the problem I see.  And that is Zynga doesn't have that in their DNA. I mean, we're talking about a company that  has essentially made millions on making again, how do I essentially they're making bad copies,

Start time: 1991.92
End time: 2005.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bad copies of other games. I mean, you can say I mean, bad, bad subjective. And I mean,  I think it would be it'd be harsh to say that their entire roster is just, you know, borrowed  product. But, you know, they certainly have gotten a reputation for it, you know, around the industry.

Start time: 2006.20
End time: 2047.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what they are known for. Yeah. If they were smart, they would have hooked up with like an  EA games. The problem is there's like there's a big there's a lot of politics between these Zynga  types, which created very simple type of games that were going up against these amazing, you know,  huge franchise. Yeah. And so I think if they had played nice a bit, EA, all these gaming companies  who are driving millions of dollars and constantly are creating better and better products,  they would have said, OK, let's let's come together and collaborate. But that collaboration  ever happened. And so you have like the Facebook gaming world and then you have the real gaming  world. And like, well, they're ever will we ever see the, you know, the convergence of those two

Transcript:  people were saying that the Facebook gaming world, the Zynga gaming world was going to take over  because people wanted the Farmville. They wanted the little game they could play for 30 seconds  every couple of minutes and that consoles were dead and PC gaming was dead because,  you know, only serious gamers actually went there. What we're seeing with this is, you know,  you can only go so far selling virtual goods. Now, maybe if you turned on the gambling feature  and actually had real money in real skin in the game that would change it. But this seems to,  for me, this kind of validates that the business model that Zynga is built on,

Start time: 2088.38
End time: 2136.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's not of sound ground. Well, I mean, but I mean, is it an indictment? Is Zynga's experience  an indictment of the entire social Facebook gaming community? I mean, I don't know if it's  fair to say that. And real quick, just to put an addendum on the gambling thing, almost more so  than the legality of running stuff like that is your ability to be able to make sure that people  from other places where it is not legal are not interacting with it. Because if it were just a  legality issue, they'd be able to turn it on for the UK. They'd be able to turn it on for, you know,  parts of Europe where not only is this legal, but also Facebook gaming is very, very popular.  The question is, can somebody, is it too easy for somebody in Idaho to, you know, go and spend their  money like that? And now are you legally culpable, especially as a company that is based in the

It's like a Pokemon with a  little power peanut. All right. So we've got in the last two weeks, two huge titles that were released  and one new console accessory. So we've got Halo 4, which did gangbusters. It went $220 million  in the first 24 hours. And it's the latest installment of the Halo saga, which is it's big  for Microsoft because it's not just about games. The Halo 4 universe has games. It's got spin-offs.  It's got books. It's got a fantastic short on YouTube right now called Forward on to Dawn,  which if you haven't watched it, you really should because it sort of fleshes out the mythos of the  Halo universe. And they've got a potential movie in the making. I mean, it's something that people  are actually invested into. So $220 million there. By the end of this first week, it'll be $300 million.  And you've also got Activision, one of these companies that Zynga sort of poo-pooed.  They released Call of Duty. They made $500 million on their first day. Five-fifty, I believe. Five-fifty.  So together, these two companies in more or less 10 days made more that Zynga will make the entire

Start time: 2215.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  year. Yeah, in many ways, these stories are the exact inverse of the Zynga story because Zynga,  you have something that's massively popular that over time, they seem to be trying to squeeze blood  out of a stone here and they're having increased trouble. By all rights, Halo 4 should be just more  of the same because you're moving from Bungie to a different studio. There was an arc for the first  three Halo games that was pretty much completed. Halo 4 coming back just to get to the same  characters and same everything seems like a really bad idea, but I think it's 343 Studios,  as I believe it is, by all accounts has knocked it out of the park by adding a new dimension to  the game. They're telling a new type of story. They're making Master Chief a more compelling  character and they're crushing it from a financial point of view. I saw some retweet of somebody who  was on a bus and somebody asked, you know, oh, video games, have they had their Citizen Kane  moment yet? And the guy responded by saying, I don't know, has movies had their Tetris moment  yet? It's like video games. When you think in terms of dollar for dollar, I would be shocked  if there ever was a Halo movie because there doesn't need to be. Halo the game is what it is  and we understand that older generations think in terms of like, oh, now this is a legitimate,  I'm using air quotes for the audio listener, audio or a legitimate IP and now it can get a  legitimate form of entertainment with a movie. I think that it wouldn't even be worth it. It  would be a waste of time and actually diminish the brand. Video games are what video games are  and that's the end of it. And the finances speak clearly. We're playing our goofy movie draft on  NSFW and frame rate. $500 million overnight makes the stakes that we're playing for in movies look

Transcript:  like chump change, looks idiotic and convincing. I mean, yeah, the video game industry, no doubt,  is making a ton more money than the movie and TV industry. And if any of these games became a movie,  it becomes just like a marketing play. Right? Sure. Well, I mean, they could be good movies.

Start time: 2348.62
End time: 2423.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all the cast and we work a lot with Machinima in terms of having a lot of the gamers and the  people that are doing these scripted shows based on these games on our show to talk about it.  And yeah, it's amazing. I mean, what Machinima has done on YouTube and with the gaming industry  is just incredible. There's the video right now as everyone is watching on Machinima Prime.  But I just think, yeah, it is funny. I think we've underestimated the gaming community and the fact  that five years ago, probably, or maybe three, we thought that a company like Zynga would tear apart  these types of games, which are so complex and detailed and beautiful. I think it underestimated  the community in general and users and thinking that they would want something so simple,  buying products and working with the visuals that is a Farmville versus something that's like a crazy  interactive experience. I think it's proven that people that are using these games and the gamers  are much more sophisticated than the creators thought. And I think that's an amazing thing.  When you realize that communities are sophisticated, it raises the bar of the creators and the companies

Transcript:  creating this. I want to go back to one of the points that both Shira and Brian made, and that is  a movie would be a fraction of the profit that they make off the video game. But it's fan service,  and that's one of the things that this adds that Zynga will never have, and that is you've got a  community that is actually invested in the story. It was the same thing with Mass Effect. It's people  who have actually played all the games who came back to finish the story. There is no story in  Farmville. There's no story in a gambling game. That doesn't mean, though, that there's not

It wasn't that complicated in terms of the animation,  but yet it is a company that used that brand, and they really did something with it. And they had  fun with it. They didn't take themselves too seriously, and they continue to evolve it as  well, partnering with movies, with even, I think, nonprofits. And they're continuing to  have people use it, and they're not really invested in it like a story. It's not like  we're playing the characters and be like, oh, I'm the pig.

Transcript:  I'll tell you what, if you want a testament to how strong, and you always see this, whenever  there's an emerging new art form, nobody knows what it is, nobody knows what the value is,  and people have a tendency to discount it right off the bat. And I think we're seeing  the last vestiges of that. Of course, the social proof of how much money these video games are  making is a big testament to it. But another part of it is Call of Duty Black Ops 2 shipped  with the ability to flip a switch and instantly live stream your gameplay over on YouTube. And  we were talking about this before the show. Machinima was first to realize that people love  watching other people play video games. And to me, that is a remarkable facet of this whole puzzle,  is that there's something about the interactive narrative to where you don't even need to be  playing the game yourself to get that experience. Your mirror neurons will fire watching somebody  else noodle through stuff. For example, as soon as we're done here, I'm playing through the Walking  Dead series, and we'll get hundreds of people to tune in just to watch me make the agonizing  decisions that you have to make in that game. I think that gaming is obviously financially  matured at this point, where all of a sudden the Call of Duty franchise, I believe, is bigger than  the Star Wars franchise, dollar for dollar at this point. I'm almost certain of it as far as...  It's gotta be. It's gotta be. Well, merchandising might be... That might be a dangerous topic.

Transcript:  No, but I was agreeing with you. I loved that point you made, how now they're allowing people  to stream it and they're realizing the power of... The social network is the user. It's the fan.  It's the community. It's not necessarily the platform. The game in itself, having people  share it, that's the word of mouth. That's the domino effect. And the fact is it becomes like  a choose your own adventure itself. It becomes like a movie. This is a next generation movie,  these games, because every time you watch a different person play it, that person,  they are a star for this community. Whatever gamer that's a star in, shouldn't have playing it,  giving their commentary. But then every time you watch it, you see and discover something different.  So it's like watching a movie probably a hundred times and every time you watch it,  you're discovering something new. And that's really cool.

Transcript:  Well, I recently had a conversation with somebody who works at a major video game company that has  a couple of very big franchises. And the point that they made, and they were very, very adamant  about it, is they don't want to be looked at as a company that makes video games. They want to be  looked at beyond the context of interactive gaming and in the larger context of entertainment.  It's storytelling.  It's storytelling.  What was that?  Storytelling.  Yeah, absolutely. But specifically in that point of view, then you're not looking at this  necessarily saying like, well, video games are it and movies are not happening. They want it all.  They want to have the head start to say like, all right, well, listen, just because we have a very,  very valuable intellectual property that people have invested themselves in and invested hours in  and want to see continued evolution of these people in interesting, different narratives.  So they just want to say like, if Disney makes the Avengers and they have a crappy video game tie-in,  they want to just go the other way and say, listen, we have a successful video game franchise  and we also want to have an amazing action movie series. And we want to do something like that.  In the same way that now you're looking at what Disney bought Star Wars and now Disney wants to  do three Star Wars films a year, not necessarily all following like the Luke Skywalker story,  but just using that universe to make entertainment that people want to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So I'll tell you what, man, think about it this way. Not only is it remarkable,  the level of success that video games have on launch and how valuable these properties have  become, but this is also a polarized type of entertainment. You don't run into a lot of people  who say, what's this? What's a Star Wars movie? Oh, no, I don't do movies. Nobody says that.  Movies are universally beloved and everyone does them. Whereas you do get that with video games.  And so as this generation ages and starts to push out the communities that just,  you know, games are just this thing somebody else does, I think the numbers are only going to  get bigger and these immersive world and properties are only going to become more valuable and more  legitimized. I mean, I'll say this much, the experience of playing through all three Mass  Effects games was as rich and as detailed as any novel I've read and as any movie trilogy I've  ever watched. And I think that you're going to see, have this sea change as more and more people

But the Wii U, at this point,  Nintendo tends to be really smart and savvy with their launches. And I'm not seeing this go around.  The announcements built up a tremendous amount of hype when they said that their TV service  was essentially going to be like the ultimate set top box that would allow you to access  all of your cable programming and an awesome interface. And you'd be able to, you know,  use Amazon Instant, Netflix, Hulu, and all those. And of course, it was announced that that was  delayed until December. And on top of that, when you get this thing home, you have to sit for a  five gigabyte firmware update before you can even use the dang thing. I don't know. I don't want to  call it a misstep just yet. But man, this is not the launch of the Wii U that I had expected.

I mean, it's not, I mean,  granted, and this is something I just want to say to all of this discussion, as much as we want to  talk about the big numbers that are being reported by Halo and Call of Duty, we don't exactly know  what that means to the profit bottom line. We don't know. I mean, the difference in developing  a game and let's say developing a movie, if we're going to go apples to apples on those comparisons,  are two completely different things would do completely different bills at the end of it. So,  you know, I don't know. I don't exactly know what 3.5 million units means for the Wii U, nor do I  really know whether 500 million in one day for Call of Duty is, I mean, it sounds like a big  successful number, but we don't know exactly how much it costs to make. Brian, how does it compare?

Transcript:  game and in the console game, it's not necessarily about selling the consoles because you will sell  the maximum number of consoles eventually. It has always been about the attach rate and the Wii has  always lagged behind the Xbox and even now the PS3 in attach rate. So it doesn't matter if you're  selling 20 million Wii U's if they're only buying one or two games each. There's so many little

Start time: 3007.18
End time: 3097.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  missteps that drive me nuts. For example, the fact that the Wii U can't play, it will not upscale  existing Wii video games, which is something the Dolphin emulator is already able to do. You can  play the Wii games on your PC using the Dolphin emulator and it'll upscale it to the highest  resolution. As a matter of fact, my assistant John Dilton was saying that on his Macbook with  retina display, it's utterly gorgeous and it was confounding to him that... Now, John is about the  biggest Nintendo fanboy I've ever encountered, but he's so annoyed that he says he's going to hold off  on the Wii U purchase. What's the bee in his bonnet specifically? I mean, just all of the...  It's all these little missteps and the fact that there's not a compelling game, the fact that the  new Super Mario Brothers is a retread. There's not that Wii Sports moment where it's like you  played the bowling once and you're like, I've got to have this. I'll do whatever it takes to do it.  Instead, there's a bunch of minor annoyances, everything from the sparse memory that comes  with it to the... In some cases, they used cheaper inferior parts for the speed of the memory.  The fact that they're promising all of these partnerships that haven't come out yet with the  TV service, the fact that it won't upscale old content. Again, all of this is just very  un-Nintendo and I think we've seen a number of missteps continuing back with the 3DS launch and

Start time: 3098.00
End time: 3132.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so on. I think we've come full circle with the Wii, with Nintendo, because you remember when they  released the Wii, people smashed it because it didn't compare to the next generation consoles.  To the PS3 and the Xbox. Right, PS3 and the Xbox. But then it started selling like hotcakes  because, oh well, it's getting the non-gamers. People who don't normally game were picking up  the Wii controllers and doing the sports game or the tennis game. But the story that wasn't being  told was that's the only thing that they did. They bought the Wii with the included game and then it  either sat in a closet or underneath an entertainment center. But that's enough, man. These are people that aren't the loyal

Transcript:  gamers. You're saying like that's great for a one-off success. It's like having a one-night stand.  Okay, it's great for your ego. What's that?  So they had that one-hit success with the non-gamers, which is great when you appeal to  that broad audience. A lot of brands have huge success off that and build their company off that.  However, I think with gaming, and listen, I'm not a huge gamer and I'll be honest about that,  but with gaming, it seems like it's not about having just the non-gamers play once in a blue  moon. It's about having those people that are like super obsessed, loyal gamers and users.  And that's where you really build your business and your credibility in the gaming world.

Start time: 3227.38
End time: 3272.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  that they are positioned to do the second screen experience right. They are positioned to be that  all-encompassing entertainment console that goes beyond the video games that you play.  And instead, it also is how you surf the web. It's also how you watch your television.  And I think I got totally swept up. We talked about this on framerate. I went from zero interest  in a Wii U to 100% interest in a Wii U. Because if I could get a Wii U and have it do the things  that I would expect from a Google TV instead and do it with a polished Apple-like kind of interface  where they secure the deals and they take me out of the miserable Time Warner DVR experience,  for that alone, I would totally buy it. Realistically, you're the nerd. You're

Transcript:  who want to have that interactive second screen experience to use internet on their TV, they're  either the Google TV, the Xbox, even now there's the Vizio TVs and the Samsung TVs. They're not  getting the Wii U for that. I think they associate Wii with gaming. They don't associate it with

Start time: 3307.14
End time: 3364.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  using it for other reasons. But the one thing that the Wii set-top box element had that no  one's really been able to crack is the idea of, and Google TV attempted to do this, that it's not  only just the place where you can access Netflix and Hulu Plus and stuff like that, but it's also  the filter for your television signal, for your cable, for your satellite, and to add  an actual functional user interface on these services that we interact with so much. I think  there is a great benefit to that if you can do it right. But is it enough for people to buy  a Wii U, especially in this era when you see those commercials and you see the big,  stupid, clunky controller and you're looking down at things and flicking them onto the television  and it's like, really? Is that where we're at in an era when we have this kind of processing power  on iPhones and iPads and people are already doing stuff on sleeker devices that they can take

Transcript:  Twitter where John C. Dvorak usually gets up and searches for stuff to steal.  Stealing is such a harsh word. To borrow from the Twitbrick house. I mean,  inevitably after the commercial, John will sit down and say, you need that? You want that? You're  going to use that? Can I take this? He has taken microphones. He has taken stakes. He has taken  bottles of vinegar. I think it's just part of the deal is that John gets one thing every show.  One thing he gets to take with him during every show. So John, be my guest. Wander about. I'm  going to talk a little bit about Ford right now. Our show brought to you as always by the Ford Motor  Company. I love my Ford Mustang. Can I buy, I'm asking Lisa, can I buy the Fusion, the 2013 Fusion  Energy? Can I buy that? That's, that's, you can have the Mustang. You want to, you need a, you need  a bright red muscle car. She wants the new Mustang. You see, we're, we're a Ford company. We love Fords.  As long as it's got that sink built into it, I, I, I'll take any Ford. And I have to say one of the  nice things about Ford now is all 2012 and later model Fords sold in the U.S. have sink available.  So there's no reason not to get sink in, in your Ford, your next Ford. I got it. It's, it's fantastic.  What is sink? Well, you can go to ford.com slash technology and find out more about  sink. What it does and what I really like about it is it, it keeps you, keeps your attention. This is  it by the way, just Lisa, you're paying attention. That's the one I want. The Ford Fusion 2013.  It's a plug-in hybrid. Oh, I didn't put it up on the, I didn't put it up on the screen. There it is.  This is, this is the car. Yeah. I don't know. We'll figure it out. Bright red. So it'll match  the Mustang. How about that? And I'll keep the twit plates. If you go here, you can explore the  sink commands. The idea is you talk to your car for everything. Climate temperature, 70 degrees,  play artist, Grant Mormon. You call mom, call school, call office. What's the traffic like?  My destination is nightlife. Take me there. I'm hungry. I'm not kidding. You can tell Ford  Sink, I'm hungry and it will provide a list of nearby restaurants. You can also say,  find a pizza parlor and it will find you. I love that. The things this can do. Now, of course,  it's really great for keeping in touch with your entertainment. You can browse your music collection  by genre, by album, by artist, by playlist, by song. You can voice activate and control your media  player. It'll even play a list of music you're in the mood for. You could say, play similar music,  for instance, and it'll play, it'll play similar music to the song you're listening to right now.  No matter how your music is stored on your smartphone via Bluetooth streaming on a USB  drive, you can actually load a USB drive up with music and listen that way. Of course, the iPad,  the iPod works great with an iPhone 5. You could say, read me my text messages, call my voicemail,  reply to a text message, browse all audio books. Available sync with MyFordTouch and HD Radio lets  you do iTunes tagging. You can tag a song as you listen to it on an HD radio station, transfer that  info to your iPod and purchase a song directly from iTunes when you get home. That is cool.  That is so cool. Best of all, Ford Sync is available on all new 2012, 2013 Ford vehicles sold in the US,  so there's no reason not to have it. Here's what you do, go to your Ford dealer and say,  I want to test drive Ford Sync. Oh, and yeah, I'll throw a car in. I like that fusion, but the new  focus, that's nice too. Ford.com slash technology to learn more. Go further in a Ford. Now, if with  any luck, John hasn't gone too much further and we can continue with Twitter. Thanks, Leo. Thank

Transcript:  The fastest you can get from Comcast right now is about 305 megabits per second. And that's if  you live in a very specific area right next to one of their offices. And I think that plan costs  something like 300 bucks. It's ridiculous. It's crazy. It's a lot of money. Google was offering a  plan of $70 for one gig synchronous. That's one gig up one gig down. You did have to pay a $300  installation fee. But they also had a $120 plan that included the one gig up the one gig down  and HDTV, which would price it way below slower offerings of Comcast's infinity or next finito,  whatever they call that thing. They also had a very mega megafinity mega. That's right.  Marlestein. And they also had a plan where you could just pay the $300 installation fee one time,  and you would have five megs down one mega for life never on another fee for freezes,  or freezes just because they were being nice. Well, Google lit it up. It is now active. If  you ordered Google fiber to your house, you are now getting it. And it's it's fantastic because  it's creating a brand new market in Kansas City. The story I found was about a man named Mike  DeMiro, horrible with names. But basically he bought for $48,000. He bought a home in Kansas  City. And he's turning it into sort of a vacation for people who want a broadband and a place for  startups to congregate. They're talking about how the addition of Google fiber to Kansas City  could now possibly turn it into an Internet hub. Now, this has been an idea that's been bouncing  around a lot of enterprise geeks heads for a while. And that is if you put high speed Internet in the  middle of a cornfield, you could recreate the Silicon Valley. What do you think about that?

Start time: 3939.14
End time: 3993.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What's what's anyone's take on that? Dude, I'll tell you what, man, there's no doubt this is one  of the most awesomely disruptive things we've ever seen Google do. And if there was ever a question  of whether or not their your whole goal was to just stick a finger right in the eye of cable  service, it's not just the fact that they're offering an infinitely superior service at an  amazing price. But on top of that, if you look at the Google fiber blog, they talk about the other  little things they're doing stuff like they guarantee that the service people will show up  at the on time. Like they'll give you an hour. Yes, they'll show up at the beginning of that hour.  What a crazy idea. And then they bring their own vacuum so that they can clean up the drywall that  they put all over your carpet. It's almost as though they got roused out of bed and they came  down and they're like, all right, you a-holes, you want to do this? This is how you do it. Right.  It's called service is called superior quality product. Now we're out. We're Google. Yeah.

Start time: 3993.82
End time: 4032.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And which is easy, right? It's like, duh, just bring customer satisfaction and then more  people are going to want to support you. It's not that difficult. However, it is definitely  a hit to all the cable companies. And this is just an example of what's to come. And I do think it  has to do a lot with it. It's going to go also back to possibly content, the Comcast, Time Warner's,  those bundle deals that we're going to see, oh, what bundle deal can you get with the  Google fiber with Google TV and the shows that come with that? And it's going to be that domino  fact as well. I know someone that worked that was an exec at YouTube that actually ended up moving

Start time: 4032.20
End time: 4122.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on to Google fiber. Hold on. I mean, and this is amazing and this is great. And like Brian said,  disruptive is the key word. However, it's a lot easier. It's way easier for them to do this in one  medium market than it is for, let's say a Comcast or Time Warner to spread this over the gigantic  footprints that they have, no matter how awful they are. And believe you me, I think we can all  agree that if we look at the pain that we feel as consumers, much of it is from these kind of  companies. However, what I love about this is that they are doing everything right. I hope they  continue to spread out. I hope that this is not the only market, that Kansas City just doesn't  become Google fiberville and we don't see this in other places. And what I wish is that they took  more disruptive kind of element like this in other super pain points, including there was a  story this week about them maybe looking to do a wireless service to pair with Dish Network. But  I'm afraid that that won't be as possible because of their relationship with these companies that  they've had to make for Android and that Android relies upon. Because this is, I think, this is what  as a fan of Google, I love to see Google do is take their big gigantic wad of cash and roll into  town like a Happy Feelings Johnny Appleseed and just toss smiles amongst the villagers.

Transcript:  Still at work in the chat room, he says that basically Google walked on stage,  made their announcement and then dropped the microphone. And that's pretty much,  that's the kind of disruption here. I mean, it also includes one terabyte of Google  cloud storage and there are absolutely no caps. Now, this is supposed to be a dry run. Google is  just testing. And the reason why they chose Kansas City is because it's near one of their big data  centers. So for them, since most of the traffic on the internet is a Google service, either Google  search or Google YouTube, Gmail, it really doesn't cost them anything to run the service over the  pipes they already own. Like Brian said, I want to see what happens if this lands in Los Angeles.  And suddenly, suddenly you've taken an entire market away from the traditional telcos.

Transcript:  And keep in mind also that there's an opportunity here for there's a fantastic book. I think it's  called the Walmart effects talking about how Walmart not only vastly improved the supply chain  for their goods, causing a essentially an increase of standard living of thousands of dollars for  people nationwide, but more importantly, by virtue of figuring out and solving those supply chain  things, that's because of Walmart, you no longer have to spend an extra nickel to 10 cents for  packaging for deodorant. And that's not just a Walmart, that's at all stores by virtue of  eliminating say, this is stupid. Why are you wasting money on this packaging? Then all of a  sudden everyone's like, yeah, no, that is stupid. Why are we wasting that money on packaging? Just  to remain competitive. So what I'm hoping is that we get a Google effect, a halo where  because of even it is just in this one market and yes, what they're doing right now probably  is not scalable to the entire country. But again, it's that disruptive element. It's that it's that  opportunity to show people that yes, you can give exceptional customer service and show up on time  and provide everything at a reasonable price that hopefully we'll see improvements in other services.

It's obvious that Kansas is a case study that if it  works and people hear of it, they'll ask for it in their cities as well. And people will fight for it.

To me, this kind of stuff is, like I said, exactly where I want Google to go into  because I think that their aims here are aligned with the customers in the same way that when  they were initially thinking about bidding on the open spectrum auction a couple years ago,  I thought that would have been a great place for them to get into. And I think in terms of the  over-the-air stuff, I don't know if their relationships they've had to make for Android  have not curtailed their ability to do stuff like this in another area where I think we would all be

Transcript:  very happy for them to get into. I was listening to a CEA talk in DC not too long ago and it was  interesting because there was a telco representative. I won't say which telco, but we'll just say that  they're really big and they have a lot of cables. We'll just leave it at that. The vision of these  cables is amazing. One of the questions that they posed to him was, well, what do you think about  the Google fiber? What do you think about the rollout in Kansas? And his response just sort of  boggled my mind because he was saying, well, we're seeing that Google is unfairly leveraging  a competitive basis that they shouldn't have that has been given to them unfairly because they're  not regulated like a telco. And here I'm thinking, wait a minute, the telcos for years and years and  years have been saying if there was a cheaper way to do it, someone already would have done it. And  that's been the reason for lagging behind on rollout of high speed internet. Now that Google's  doing it, they're sort of switching bases and they're saying, no, no, no, no, no, no, we need  more regulation because you need to protect us from these new little players. It just strikes  me again that this is, as Brian referred to, is that disruptive force. They've been kicked in the  teeth. And I think Google doesn't actually want to be the national ISP. They want more ISPs to be

Transcript:  Absolutely. Just knowing a thing is possible is what it takes to make happen. There are things  that there are examples, for example, in the juggling world, to use a stupid example,  where if you want to throw, we'll say, you know, 12 rings or whatever, you know, nobody can juggle  more than 12 rings at the same time. But then all it takes is one video of a person doing it.  And then all of a sudden, it's, you know, it's possible. And then all of a sudden, in the next  two weeks, 20 people now post a video of them juggling 12 rings or whatever, simply by virtue  of showing that it can be done. It does two things. First of all, it sets an expectation on  the consumers, which is extraordinarily important because it gets them asking their local cable  providers, why are you not providing our YNC? And number two, it lets those providers know that it's  possible and that they could arrange their management in order to make it happen.

Transcript:  The problem is a lot of these contracts that these companies have are like five to 10 year  contracts. The change and disruption can't necessarily happen from the traditional companies.  And that's why a company like Google can do it. They can change things every month if they  really want to. So that's the big problem that's happening right now with the other companies like  the ISPs that you're talking about is they're in packages that, you know, you're dealing with so  many layers of politics in terms of people trying to keep their jobs, trying to keep things the way  they have been because they're trying to control the value of something that maybe doesn't have the  same value as it used to have. And so that disruption might not be able to happen in the next  even five years in those companies because they need to get through the contracts that they've  signed to keep things in order and what they think works, even though it doesn't work for the

But like what Brian said earlier about the idea of retailers,  changing how they distribute stuff, and then all of a sudden there's a ripple effect there.  If Google is making money on this, then I think telcos will look at it and say,  okay, well, it's possible that we can have huge signup rates and consumer happiness  and we can charge X amount for this kind of product. That's great. We'll make money off it.  If they are not, and it's looked at as this is Google's hobby where they're just looking to  stir the pot, but they are losing money on their fiber stuff, then I don't know if telcos look at  that and say, well, yes, there's an opportunity that we could lose money and give people things.

They just want to drive more  people into Google services. And they're doing that in a big way. If they're giving you one  terabyte of free storage, if they're giving you TV channels for just a tiny bit more over your  broadband subscription, they're going to get more people using Google services. They're going to  get a better bottom line. That's what they're going to show off. They're looking at the long

There's a few rumors that maybe Google wants to get into the mobile device business.  They've been talking to DISH, DISH Networks, about purchasing Spectrum so that they could roll out  their own nationwide network. Now, this is a fantastic story because it extends on what we  were just speaking about with Google Fiber. Google has in the ground privately owned more fiber than  anyone, any of the big telco players. They have the backhaul that Verizon and Sprint and T-Mobile  and AT&T wish they had. Now, this could just be one of these things where they only deploy where  they have data centers. And again, because it's cheap for them. But what would having something  like a fifth carrier charging $20 a month because they're not trying to make money on the service,  but they're trying to make money on driving you to Google products, what would that do to the

And right now,  though, it's hard to watch on mobile devices with other carriers. So yeah, if they controlled that  as well, you would say a lot of the people, if they're getting, who knows, all their video on  YouTube and they know that they can even get now full out movies and it will be really quick,  because the service is better, then why wouldn't you use that and go with them as well?

Transcript:  I would love for this to be available. And I'd be very curious to see what Google looks to do  with it, because I think that there is an internal debate within Google on where they are best served,  specifically when it comes to the mobile platform, that now we're going to see the release and they'll  be very telling this week or next week when they finally release the iOS Maps app, which apparently  is now close to coming out, on how good that is, because there's been obviously a great consternation  in that company of what they wanted to give functionality wise to the iOS platform. And there  are people inside Google that want to make it as good as possible. They want to have everybody  possibly using Google services, because ultimately that is what makes them money. AdWords makes them  money. That is their cash cow. And the more people that are, the more real estate they can have to  show you AdWords, the better off they are. The debate is whether or not on mobile, that is better  served through going through everybody. So let's say if they had a wireless carrier, do you want  iPhones on that? Do you want Windows 7 devices on that? So you can have more of a relationship  with people and you can know the data that they are sending and you can track that and add that  to your participation graph for which is Google's lifeblood. Or do you restrict it only to Android  phones and make it an incentive that, hey, if you buy the latest Google device, the latest Android  phone, it comes on our awesome ISP and now you'll be better than AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, whatever.

Transcript:  Let's take it to its awesome conclusion. And that is to say, look, we already know Android owns 75%  of the market. So three out of every phone, smartphones being bought today is an Android  phone. We know that the Nexus 4 sold out in what, 50 minutes or so. So it's a hot device. People want  the latest and the greatest. They know that Android is now a mature mobile operating system.  We know that Google has been bundling service with every single one of their products. So  you buy, for example, they just released a brand new $200 Acer Chromebook with 100 gigabytes of  Google Drive. So let's now say that they sell you an Android phone that also includes two years of  service on Google's ISP and also includes 500 gigabytes of cloud storage space. Again, they're  capturing people, they're bringing them in and they're showing them why it's great to stay with  Google. At what point should AT&T, Sprint, T-Mobile and Verizon be pooping in their pants?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that they would be pooping in their pants to use your inelegant analogy. I think they would  be doing more of that if it wasn't, if it was, split your phone now. If it was go on google.com  phone switch and you were able to sign on to their service no matter what your mobile carrier was,  or sorry, no matter what your phone is. I think that's where you see telecoms really,  really, really start freaking out because now that's disruption. That is showing like what Brian said,  we can have the Google kinds of offerings when it comes to no caps for what you are  looking to use and stuff like that. That to me is the ultimate nightmare scenario for the telcos.  If it was an Android phone exclusive kind of thing, I don't know because a lot of the reason why so  many Android phones get pushed is because they are the favorite thing for these telcos to push out to  their people. How well would Android do if all of a sudden Verizon, AT&T and Sprint didn't have an  incentive to push Android phones and getting them into the Android ecosystem was now harmful to

We've got to be careful with  this story because I don't want to actually show the page because it gets pretty bad.  People who were calling out Obama after his election win. I'm not getting political. This  could be anything. This is not just racist election tweets. This could be sexist tweets. This could be  homophobic tweets. Whatever it might be, imagine that. Now imagine somebody has decided that the  way he's going to call attention to this problem of people anonymously trolling the world is by  posting their information along with their offensive tweets or Facebook posts to a blog.  Now he's not breaking the law. He's not hacking. He's only using publicly available information.

And he just started posting pictures of people who have  made racist remarks about the president. It's created sort of an outrage because there are some  people on one hand who are saying it's about time. These people should know that what they're saying  is public. On the other hand, there are some other people who are saying, look, these are  teenagers. These are young adults. They did something stupid, but you're pointing out the fact  that what they wrote is going to live in infamy. There have been many of these Twitter accounts  that have been deleted because people were ashamed of what they wrote. And there have been at least  three people that I counted who lost their jobs because someone read the blog and realized they  didn't want that person working. They couldn't say something racist and have it be private.

Transcript:  Well, let's say it is that. I think the reason the Padre introduced this is because it's more  of a philosophical question. Is it a nice thing? Absolutely not. But even if it was somebody making  hay out of targeting racists and he's got an agenda and holding these people accountable for  what they say, even if that's a bad or mean terrible thing to do, I got to think that in  general, anything that raises the awareness, especially for young people, that what they're  saying is in public and on the record and they should act like it is going to have a net benefit  to society. I mean, it's still amazing to me how many things people say and do online as if there's  no chance of it coming back to bite them. I mean, think about this, people posting pictures or  whatever, figuring that they're pretty much anonymous. What happens when 10 years from now,  20 years from now, facial recognition algorithms get good enough to where retroactively they can  set robots loose on Flickr, on Twitter, on YFrog, all these image hosting services, and all  of a sudden know exactly who every nameless face in every photo is at that point and piece  everything together. I mean, this is coming and I think this is another piece of the puzzle where  people need to figure out that they're going to be held accountable for all of their behavior,

But let's extend this because there actually was  a similar case not too long ago of a group that they posted addresses, pictures, phone numbers,  all publicly available information of public servants that they disagreed with. In that  particular case, it was some Tea Party people who really did not agree with policies of some  more liberal types of public servants. Along with these people hate America, these people are trying  to destroy America. There was this, well, is that a threat? Are you putting these people up  like a hit list? Are you asking someone to do something about it? When does free speech and  asking people to realize that they live in a public society cross the line into you're now trying to

What is happening with this particular site is that a big thing happens, like the election,  or just randomly. Let's say it's eight o'clock on a Sunday night and they type in the Twitter  search function the N-word. They find out how many people are using the N-word. In the river  of the internet, they cast the N-word net into there and then they pull out the fishes that are  using this particular term. They then take the embed function and they put it on their blog.  Then there are people that retweet this kind of stuff. The point is that right now, these people  are saying this, or within the last however long it was, because it's obviously chronological,  in the search function. That's what's happening. This is publicly searchable. It is easy to embed.

Transcript:  We can celebrate. I find we're in a place, a time, even though we do the internet,  is there a lot of time sometimes to put people down. We do it very publicly.  Then it's also very much a celebratory place where it's like, oh, these are the most awesome this.  We're curating this. Suddenly when people curate the worst this, the worst that, it's like, how dare  you? You're encouraging people to talk back to those people. What's your responsibility in that  then? I think we're figuring all of this out right now. I think curating stuff that's horrible  and things that those people should take responsibility. A lot of people tweet things  thinking that, oh, no one's really listening or they just put it out there and it doesn't really  matter because there is- Because 90% of the time no one is listening.  The thing is, I don't think that's a good message to put across or promote because the fact is,  even if you're an unknown person, you don't need to be a celebrity or an internet star,  you might say something and whether it's amazing or not so amazing and it's incriminating of some  sort or it's negative, it can have an effect. That's, I think, not making those people take  responsibility. That encourages people to start trolling, saying, oh, well, no one's really  listening to you. That's when you see those types of people go back and back and back and push and  push until it's literally harassment and cyberbullying. I think this is an interesting  use of Twitter and curating these tweets to do it not just for good things like curating the best  of moments, but to say, oh, these are the best of moments in that thing that we should talk about.  It's not always fun to talk about these things, but it's happening. It's part of our culture.  We've done it in the past by putting talking heads out there in media. This is our version of

Start time: 5515.80
End time: 5584.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  it, of doing it online. In many ways, this is the evolution of social norms on the internet.  I think that small structural changes can have a big impact. For example,  I have no actual hard data to back this up, but on YouTube, I think most of us agree,  I would much rather get paper cuts to the eyeballs than read YouTube comments about videos that I  post because there's something about the total anonymity and just the hateful things people say  on YouTube. It seems to me that since, I think it was two months ago, they allowed you to flip  and start using your real name associated with your Google Plus profile on YouTube.  That structural change of it being your actual name on there, of the hateful comments that I see on  YouTube about my idiotic hairstyle or what have you, it seems like almost never those come from  somebody whose real name is being associated with it. I think in that regard, this website,  the hellotheracists.tumblr.com, is another structural change that reminds people that  what you are doing is in public and associated with your identity.

One person looks more credible than the other person and now that we've normalized the idea  that online communication is a thing and it's a thing where business transactions happen,  people propose to each other.

I'm not saying that it's the authentic  identity that necessarily corresponds with what's printed on your social security card,  but it's a persistent identity that you continue to cultivate. I think you nailed it, Justin,  when you're talking about there's an advantage to having a persistent identity, which is why we see  characters on Twitter and Facebook continue to build up this identity. Now there's nothing to  say that you can't have four or five different identities and behave differently on all of them  and none of them appear to be connected to each other, but I think for the most part,  anonymity as we knew it in the dial-up days of AOL chat rooms is completely dead.

But let's say you, okay, let's say you got an iPad. You bought it seven months ago.  And now Apple comes along with a new iPad and you want it. Boy, it'd be nice if you get something  for that old one. How about 525 shmackaroos? Whoa, see? Whoa. This is a profit deal.  Gazelle, it really is the best way to recycle. And yes, mostly Apple stuff, but they do take  BlackBerrys, old HTC or LG phones, Motorola's, Nokia's. I got that Samsung Galaxy S3.  It's factory unlocked. It's just gathering dust. I don't need it anymore. Let me just see what that's  worth. 16 gigabyte. It's in good condition. By the way, you can be honest about the condition.  And they have their data experts assess it. And if you underestimated the quality, if you said  it was good when they consider it flawless, they actually will send you more money. I don't know  why. It seems like that's bad business. But really, they're very honest. They're great. Free of water  damage. Yes. Calculate. How much is that? What? 241 bucks? I'm rich. Now throw that all in a box.  Actually, they'll send you the box. In fact, anything worth more than a buck, they'll pay  the postage. So put it aside. Then when you get the box, throw it in there. You have 30 days.  Like I said, that quote's good for 30 days so you can decide later. And then boom, you're going to  get a check. You'll get cash or PayPal or you get an Amazon gift card. I recommend that because you  get 5% additional on the Amazon gift card. G-A-Z-E-L-L-E. It's the best way. You know, somebody  wants that gadget. Why let it gather dust when you can have money?

Transcript:  but this next story actually does come back into a little bit of our Google discussion.  You may have heard about this. If you watch Twit at all, we covered this a lot because this is a  huge, huge issue for us. A few weeks back, there was a decision by the South Carolina Supreme Court  that they ruled against the 1986 Stored Communications Act in the case of this.  It was an adultery case, a divorce, where they said that emails that you've looked at,  but then not deleted or not copied somewhere else, they are perfectly game for someone  to go through them without violating the Stored Communications Act. This sent shivers through  the industry, but at the time, a lot of us were saying, okay, this is one state. This decision is  going to be overturned. I had a lawyer by the name of William Shapiro come on, and he basically said,  look, don't worry about this. It's a little case that will go up against the Ninth Circuit.  Last week, the DOJ, trying to justify their raid of mega upload, they responded to a lawsuit by  a man, Mr. Goodwin, whose data was confiscated with all of mega upload servers. They argued  they didn't need a warrant to go through his data. I'm going to summarize here, because  essentially, they didn't seize data, they seized a server. Therefore, he had no recourse to complain  about the fact that they went through everything he had stored. The reason why this is important is  because if you do anything in the cloud, if you're an enterprise or small business that has come to  trust the cloud, this has a huge chilling effect on a $1 trillion investment. That means Gmail,  Yahoo mail. It means that Dropbox. It means that anything that you use in the internet that  resides on a box that doesn't specifically belong to you can be searched through if anyone on that  box does something illegal. I want to throw this to Brian first, because Brian, I know that you are  a stalwart defender of the government's ability to do anything they want. You believe that they're  trying to protect us. You believe that they should have the right to go through this data without

I try to wrap my mind around the very question, and I just want to curl up in a  ball and start weeping, because it's like, this is not only a question of what does the government  have the right to do. This is a question about the very nature, about what constitutes property.  Is your intellectual property a physical thing? Is your private, is your secret a physical thing?  And it's like, I don't even know where to begin this. It makes me sad that it's going to take so  long to hash it out in so many tiny court decisions like this. But I think you're right. We're seeing  a massive... You probably heard a couple of weeks ago, I was saying that in the future,  we're going to start to see not physical objects, but virtual objects be treated as real property.  We're going to see people go to jail for stealing a digital sword that doesn't actually exist,  because it's a virtual environment. We're going to see people go...

Transcript:  Well, now mind you, we're still talking about exactly what the limits for property rights are  for physical land. We have eminent domain cases about what the government can and can't tell you  that they are now buying from you at whatever price they want. So this is really... I mean,  Brian put it very eloquently. This is just a new front in a conversation that we've been having  for as long as the concept of property has existed. This is just something that we're going to have to  hash out. And the way that these conversations start is by saying, well, this guy is breaking  the law. So it's easy for us to just take this. And it is hard for us being... I'm speaking as  the government. It is hard for us to delineate exactly what is your stuff where you've done  nothing wrong and what is the bad stuff before we go through it. And is the act of going through it  a problem?

Start time: 6181.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think about the government taking initiative on this or the companies, like a drop box saying,  okay, this is an issue. Our lives are going to be more in the virtual world in the future and in  the cloud. And so we need to start creating the rules and regulations for that now. I think it's  sometimes if the government is not going to initiate it and you can't expect them to,  because obviously why would they want those rules and laws to exist? Because it'll be easier for  them to go in and kind of take other people's stuff. So I think it is the responsibility of  all of these companies to band together and say, okay, we're going to create a regulation together  that makes sense for what is owned if it's on our server, but versus if it's in your little...  It's like saying your storage area. Obviously someone owns the building, but the stuff in your  storage area is still yours, right?

Start time: 6249.94
End time: 6266.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why are we expecting them to define it? Shouldn't we all come together? Shouldn't all the main  companies who are building these clouds come together at a certain point with the government  and say, okay, we need to create this. This is the standard right now. Tell us what you think  would work, but the fact is this needs to be established.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I mean, yes, and a lot of these companies do have their own restrictions on what can and  cannot be seized by the governments and the warrants or requests, even less than warrants,  or the requests that they will respond to.  The question is when the chips are down and when the government comes to them and says, listen,  there is XYZ on this and it looks legitimately terrible, will they give up the ghost and will  they succumb to these kinds of requests?  We just saw a super high profile example of this with the whole General Petraeus issue where they  were using a technique that is apparently very popular with terrorists where they don't send  each other emails. They would just write drafts in Gmail and just leave the drafts in there and  then exchange the username and password between each other.  So they would just log into their other Gmail account and look at what the written draft was.  And that's how they determined that they were in a relationship.  Google gave up the information on that, or they somehow found a way to figure out what these things  are. So, you know, the question isn't whether or not people, companies draw lines in the sand.  The question is whether or not they stay to those and whether or not they hold to those  behind closed doors.

But he basically gave a really good analysis of why  we shouldn't freak out legally. That legally, this isn't a big deal as I was making it to sound.  But the problem is the cloud. So when we talk about storing things and sharing servers in the  cloud, it's not about legality. It's really about perception.  What business, what enterprise, what small business, what individual is going to put  valued data up into the cloud if he knows at any given time his data could be seized for something  that someone else on the server did. Or that his data could be looked through by a government  agency because they're on a fishing expedition.

Transcript:  And back to Justin's point, I mean, we kind of have that issue already with physical property  when it comes to, you know, ever since the last 20 years, as the government has decided it's  okay to seize property wherever it finds drugs. And you have all these cases of people  where it's like they had nothing to do with the crime.  Their car just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.  And all of a sudden it's seized along with a bunch of other stuff.  I mean, it's a terrifying issue from an abuse of power perspective.  But as a, more importantly, as a PR thing for the cloud in general, because people are already  nervous about storing their stuff in the cloud because they for the longest time perceive like,  wait, it's just out there and I just have to trust some company that it'll be around.  And of course, you know, here we are a decade into this cloud experiment.  And I, for one, have finally come to associate that my data is safer in the cloud than it is on  my own computer because, you know, they do things like back up their data responsibly.  But now you're right. And that introduces this second,  completely different issue where it's like, okay, is it safe to have it on the cloud  where it could be nabbed for wrongdoings by other people? And I don't know what the answer is.

So you've got a Prius, you've got a Volt, you've got a Leaf, whatever it might be.  The big drawback, at least in theory, has always been,  well, what are you going to do with those batteries?  They're toxic, they're bad for the environment.  And depending on who you ask, you're supposed to swap out your battery pack every  five to 10 years.  Well, there's been a group that has come up with a pretty novel solution.  And what they suggest is that long after a battery has stopped providing enough power to  drive an electric car, it could still be the battery backup for a house or a building if  you combine them in several packs.  I really, really like this idea.  I think it's a really good use of battery cells.  I think it's a nice idea to think about using them here rather than dumping them into a  landfill.  Thoughts?

Start time: 7185.38
End time: 7242.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's legit, but there were a few questions about exactly how you would do this.  I mean, we've for a while spoken about having the ability to say on something like a Volt or a  Tesla, be able to drop out a battery pack and swap it.  So that you could continue going without having to buy a separate hybrid gas engine to power  your vehicle.  But there's so many unknowns about the conditions of battery packs.  Actually, a really good story is Sandy, there were what are those the Fiskars, those super  high end electric cars?  There were a bunch of them that ended up underwater during Hurricane Sandy and they basically  exploded because their battery chemistry just was not able to handle salt water.  When you start taking battery packs that have a hundred thousand miles on them and you put  them into a home with four or five other battery packs, what I'm concerned about is, I mean,  you could get some serious issues.  You could have houses.

Start time: 7242.22
End time: 7275.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, there's no shortage of things to worry about, about putting massive battery electrical  power.  I mean, not only in the car, but in the home, I got to imagine that for the most part, you  know, proper safety procedures would be taken care of on this.  I mean, essentially, this is a really good judo move to take what is, I would say, relatively  universally thought of as a negative associated with electric and hybrid cars and turning  it instantly into a positive.  Is this anything that's been implemented though, or is this just some gums flapping from some  guy who has an idea?

Start time: 7276.25
End time: 7311.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that's the thing.  This is really heavy on the geek culture because there have been people who have done this  with their Prius.  In fact, they did it during Sandy.  People who took the, what is it?  It's like 400 volts coming off the battery pack in your Prius and they inverted it or  they used it so that they could power their houses during the worst of the hurricane,  during the worst of the power outages.  So has it been done?  Yes, on a one-on-one geek basis.  But could you do it on an organized basis across many different houses with people who  really know nothing about technology?  That remains to be seen.  I mean, it's super cool.

Transcript:  It's bringing more value to having those types of cars.  A lot of people go, you know, obviously a lot of people are going hybrid and all that.  Now it's not necessarily the geeks anymore and the environmentally friendly folk.  It's people that see the value in it from an economic perspective and also from an  environmental perspective, but to show that it can bring more to the table.  And it's not like you need to be a DIY expert to use it in that way.  I think it's about making those things more practical and accessible.  I think now we're seeing people experiment doing something like this.  But if someone could create a standard where that's possible and it's easy, I think that's  definitely a great thing.  A lot of people are using generators like right in their houses and didn't even realize  that it creates carbon monoxide and died when Hurricane Sandy happened.  A lot of people don't like we don't understand what to do in these types of situations.  And I feel like hopefully we're not going to see this more and more, but natural disasters  might happen closer to home more than ever before in the next few years.  And we need to learn how to deal with that stuff and buy things in our lifestyle that  help us with those types of situations.

Transcript:  I like that philosophy.  Yeah, you know, it may not incur an immediate net gain, but yeah, if we have our philosophy  set on getting things that help us as we move along, as we continue, that's not bad.  I've always imagined equipping our Prius, my family Prius with a really nice voltage  converter so that I could essentially run a camping site off of my Prius engine.  It makes my go bag my car.

Transcript:  Well, I listen, you know, battery tech is the backbone evolution that has, is and will  completely reshape culture.  You know, it has been not only revolutionary in terms of automobiles, phones, computers,  the better we get at it and the more charge we can get on a smaller footprint, the more  we are allowed to do, the more we can let our dreams kind of become realities.  And you know, the more that we take now that we've got these classes of high capacity  batteries and figure out how to repurpose them, the better off we're going to be.

Transcript:  I mean, we always have red carpet things coming up.  We have a bunch of big specials coming up.  We're going to be doing a big live stream special from YouTube.  They're opening their big studios on the 28th of November.  We're also on December 2nd going to be hosting the red carpet for the Trevor Project, which  is an amazing nonprofit helping with bullying and suicide prevention for the LGBT community.  A lot of youth.  So it's honoring Katy Perry.  I'm sure a lot of the tech nerds are excited about that.  And so anyway, there's a ton of people that go there, but it's a great cause.  I've been involved with their organization for the past year or so, and they do a lot  of great work.  And then we're going to be doing a big charity special, which we haven't really announced  fully with someone on the 13th.  A big variety Christmas celebration.  And so we're just thinking about outside the box of how we power content with using technology.  And we kind of blend those two worlds because the same age, as you know, the future of Hollywood  and media isn't just content based, but it's powered by the people that are innovating  the tech around that.  So how do you bridge that gap?  And we're always thinking about how to do that.

But you want to know what?  It's the holidays coming up.  You ain't got time for an entire hour when you're dealing with family.

And we put, if you got somebody, if you're trying to figure out what to do for Christmas,  we made this little thing called the Scam Pack, which is,  it's got 17 different gizmos and doodads that'll allow you to perform  over a hundred different tricks from scam school.  And we included a premium deck of Theory 11 cards from Shepherd Ferry,  the guy who does Obey Giant, the guy who created the famous Obama picture.  But anyway, it's really rad and it's good value.  And we're going to make them.  We're going to live stream my whole family.  Assembling for them and send them out to you.  Just head on over to scamstuff.com.  And it's pretty awesome.
