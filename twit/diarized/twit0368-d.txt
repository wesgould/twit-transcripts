Isn't that the, what are those, the most scary words you'll ever hear? I'm here from NoAgenda and I'm ready to help.  We're here to help. That's right. That would be your government, Leo.  Oh yeah, them. Oh yeah, them. Adam is ready with his rain stick. So everybody be nice.  Also here with us from New York and The Verge, Neelay Patel.  Neelay is an attorney, but also one of the great writers at The Verge, one of the founding editors at The Verge, and been covering the Samsung Apple trial.  We'll be talking about that and using his expertise because he's also a lawyer.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's funny. That piece of paper comes in handy all the time. You don't practice though, right?  No, I haven't practiced in years. But you passed the bar.  I did. I'm on a bar in Wisconsin and Illinois. So you could if you wanted to.  I could, but I definitely don't want to.  I don't blame you.  Doing other people's paperwork is not fun. Covering the trial is fun, but actually being part of it, not fun at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's nonsense. Especially when it comes to this patent stuff. It's pretty nonsensical.

Transcript:  So actually the topster will lead off with a story that is not Apple Samsung. Shocking to everybody.  Yesterday, Neil Armstrong passed away, the first person to walk on the moon at the age of 82.  Adam, do you actually believe that he walked on the moon? I just should check probably before we talk about this.

Start time: 266.96
End time: 288.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I have to be honest that I do not believe that he walked on the moon.  I guess I was right.  During that landing.  Good call.  I hate to say it. And unfortunately, he took the secrets of that with him to his grave.  Well, Buzz Aldrin's still alive.  NBC.com posted a story where they said first guy to walk on the moon, Neil Young passed away.

Start time: 289.88
End time: 293.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They were the first with the story and I guess sometimes typos happen.

Start time: 294.81
End time: 296.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These people make a lot of money to do that.  Wow.

Start time: 297.42
End time: 307.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had a lot of... I was out at a bar yesterday and I heard a lot of people wondering if it was Lance Armstrong who'd passed away.  There's a lot of confusion. Really, really depressing stuff.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 308.62
End time: 321.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, the good news is I'm sure there'll be quite a few documentaries and people will be talking quite a bit about it.  And I think as we begin our exploration of Mars, it's really good to remember back to Neil Armstrong in those first words.

Start time: 321.14
End time: 338.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's another one I really don't believe in, Leo.  You know, if you put a picture of what the Curiosity Mars rover has taken, which always seems to take pictures of itself,  you put a picture of that into Google, the Google API will say, would you like to see other pictures from New Mexico?

Start time: 339.26
End time: 342.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it looks a lot like New Mexico. All right. Admittedly.

Start time: 344.38
End time: 359.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Regardless of whether or not you think we landed on the moon or the Curiosity landed on Mars,  you have to admit that the effect of inspiring a whole generation of scientists and people interested in space, that's a good thing, right?  I mean, even with all the other doubts.

Start time: 359.38
End time: 361.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't say Adam has to admit anything, but let's ask him.

Start time: 363.29
End time: 379.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, it's nice to get people's imagination rolling.  And I like all the 3D renderings that we saw of the sky crane and the parachute and the landing.  Of course, we never really saw any of that. We just saw the 3D renderings. They were beautiful.  Well done. The seven minutes of terror. I'm impressed.

Start time: 380.08
End time: 397.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You really don't believe what would be the incentive for the government to or NASA to fake this?  Oh, just more money.  It's a tiny bit of money compared to, you know, air conditioning the troops in Afghanistan, for instance.  I mean, really, it's a few billion dollars that way.

Start time: 399.66
End time: 422.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've put a lot of work into the moon landing.  And, you know, there's just a lot of different theories about how that would work if you can get through certain parts of space to actually get out that far.  I'm just not wholly convinced.  You know, people call me a crackpot. So be it. I have to really keep to my guns on this one.  I'm really just not completely convinced.

Start time: 423.00
End time: 432.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am dragging pictures of from Curiosity.  And I'm not getting New Mexico yet, but I'll keep doing it.

Start time: 432.53
End time: 445.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Adam, let me get your input on this one.  I got accosted by a few YouTube users who are trying to convince me that the Mars we see in the sky is actually just a big inflatable place there by the government.  So we don't actually know where Mars is.

Start time: 446.87
End time: 448.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, I'm not on that.

Start time: 448.34
End time: 467.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I actually knew that there are bases on the moon and on Mars, not necessarily ours.  And who knows what the what the ultimate agenda is.  You can Google Project Blue Beam. That may be one.  There's a number of different theories out there.  So, you know, it's hard for me if I haven't seen it with my own eyes.  I have a hard time believing that I can respect that.

Start time: 468.28
End time: 502.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I choose to believe it because I think it's cool.  I think it's cool that we walked on the moon. I think it's cool.  We landed a rover with a huge complex sky crane thing that ditched itself into the recycle bin.  But but I totally understand.  I mean, it's if you if you actually broke it down and considered all the technical achievements that needed to be made to get us to the moon and back to get a rover to Mars, it it really could be considered science fiction even 10 years ago, 15 years ago.  So, yeah, well, what bugs me then is, you know, now we have these I'm sorry.

Start time: 503.00

Transcript:  Go ahead, Neal.

Start time: 505.18
End time: 517.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was just saying, you know, I saw a tweet from somebody that said it.  It took 66 years and the Wright brothers, you know, flying a Kitty Hawk to Neil Armstrong walking on that amazing, which is no time at all.  Yeah, well, you know, it's depressing.

Start time: 518.04
End time: 531.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And of course, is if you think about it, it was 46 years ago that he walked on the moon and we haven't been back.  We haven't been back.  Yeah, so pretty soon that that number is going to be more significant.  All right, well, we'll move on.  We'll agree.  We'll agree to disagree, Adam.

Start time: 532.43
End time: 559.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, that's cool.  What is interesting, though, in all the reports, there is actually almost no picture of Neil Armstrong walking on the moon.  He took most of the footage, if you would believe that he was there.  It's all Buzz Aldrin.  Right.  There's, I think, one picture of Neil's butt, where kind of like a half shot.  And then there's one from some top shot.  But all these pictures of, you know, the guy in the spacesuit and the dark sky behind him, that's all Buzz Aldrin.  None of that is Neil Armstrong.

Start time: 560.42
End time: 564.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, sometimes happens that Neil was the shutter bug and Buzz just, you know, having fun.

Start time: 565.36
End time: 569.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's astounding to see how many news reports show that picture of Buzz Aldrin.  Right.

Start time: 570.97
End time: 580.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't know what to make of that.  Let's talk about Apple versus Samsung.  Maybe we can.  Is there do you believe there is a product called the iPhone, Adam Curry?

Start time: 580.52
End time: 596.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, OK, so you can make fun of me, Leo.  I'm actually very jealous of Nile because I would love to be a lawyer and I looked into it.  I thought maybe at an older age I could still do this.  But it's a lot of work.  You know, like seven years and you have to do apprenticeships.

Start time: 598.06
End time: 601.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of a drag.  And, you know, ultimately it's a pretty dull job.

Start time: 602.53
End time: 607.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I went to law school at the University of Wisconsin.  It was I had a lot of fun.  Yeah, party.

Start time: 607.12
End time: 654.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So just for those of us, those of you who are not, did not know this.  Shockingly, we were preparing for live coverage of the Apple Samsung verdict sometime later this month, maybe in September.  Shockingly, the jury came back after mere three days of deliberation on, you know, there was almost three weeks worth of trial.  A hundred and nine page jury instruction from the judge, a 20 page, 20 page, 33 question verdict document.  And apparently the jury just went into the jury room and said, guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty.  Check, check, check. What do you think it's worth?  I don't know. Billion. And came back.  Nile, were you surprised how fast the jury came back with that verdict?

Start time: 656.17
End time: 660.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was very surprised. I thought it would be this next week.  I thought it would be the 31st, I think.

Start time: 660.38
End time: 662.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They obviously wanted the weekend off.

Start time: 663.84
End time: 730.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, they I think what they just what they talked about and, you know, the jury has now talked a little bit to The Wall Street Journal, to CNET, to some other people.  I think what they did was they asked themselves, did not we're going to answer these 33.  It was actually 700 individual, more than 700 individual decisions they had to make in these 33 groups.  But, you know, they're not lawyers and the jury is not supposed to be lawyers.  I think they asked themselves not let's answer these technical questions, but did Samsung copy Apple?  And once we make that decision and once we decide that Apple's patents are valid, then it's really easy to fill out the form.  Right. And you can say, well, does this phone have bounce back scrolling, which is one of the Apple patents?  Yes. So you just mark. Yes.  And, you know, then it's easy to pick up 28 devices and say, does it have you could do that in 15 minutes.  So I think they spent their two days arguing about that.  That seems to be what they did that the first day and a half or so they argued did the prior art that Samsung show and validate the patents.  OK, does the evidence show that Samsung deliberately tried to copy Apple?  Yeah. You know, Apple did a good job of presenting that evidence.

Start time: 731.10
End time: 741.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In particular, they were convinced by the emails from Samsung executives saying we've got a crisis in design.  We've got to respond to the iPhone. I mean, that was damning evidence.

Start time: 742.00
End time: 848.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, and I was always you know, there's a lot of Samsung's response to that was this is what every company does.  But they never produced the document from Apple saying we have to respond to Samsung.  So, you know, the jury looked they did their job, right.  They looked at the evidence as laypeople on a jury.  You know, it's a jury of your peers and the peers are just the people from the community.  And they said, this is the evidence we looked at.  We made these decisions and we're going to check the boxes.  I think they got a little.  I think once they decided that Apple had won, they blew through Samsung's case against Apple pretty quickly.  So they, you know, they ruled that Apple didn't infringe any of Samsung's patents, which to me is a little, you know,  they some of Samsung's patents are about how you connect to three G networks and Apple's phones clearly connect to three G networks.  So unless you're like an electrical engineer or something, I don't know how you make that.  It's A to B and logic. So I don't know.  They didn't answer the antitrust questions.  The other stuff that was presented to them, I think they said Apple won.  We're going to take the form. And then they said Samsung lost.  And so Samsung lost its entire case.  The one big victory Samsung had, and I think this is a little kind of underreported,  is that none of its tablets were held to infringe the iPad design stuff.  Right. So Samsung has been saying you can't patent a black rectangle.  You can't have exclusive ownership of this black rectangle device.  It's ridiculous that you're saying the iPad is the de facto black rectangle.  And the jury agreed with them. Right.  They said these Samsung tablets that look a lot like the iPad don't infringe on this design patent.  And I think that's a that is ultimately a big victory for Samsung.  It comes next to it. And, you know, it's they won that battle.  They lost the war, but they did win that battle.

Start time: 849.04
End time: 885.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But did the jury do its job?  Because we found out that almost immediately they reduced the amount of the awards  because the jury had awarded damages for devices that they had determined were not infringing.  The tablet, in fact.  Yeah, tablet and a few of the phones.  So they had to go back and say, oh, yeah, we awarded a hundred thousand for this and a million for this.  Oh, and we had ruled that it wasn't infringing.  So it seems as if they I mean, maybe they made the the unconscious decision that, yes, Samsung did infringe.  They just went down and forgot which phones they had agreed to to penalize.  It's a little sad.

Start time: 886.20
End time: 940.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  An opinion here. Sure.  As we've established, I'm not a lawyer.  I have been sued under the Lanham Act.  And to my understanding, this was initially a case of trade dress, which is a part of the Lanham Act.  And correct me if I'm wrong, obviously.  So under the Lanham Act, the entire idea is if the consumer can become if the consumer can reasonably become confused  by the product service, et cetera, that may or may not be infringing, then that pretty much clears it up for everything.  And it was much less under really specific patent law.  But they looked at the iPhone with the bezel around at the original iPhone from 2007, then looked at the what is it?  The Galaxy S, I think was the Galaxy S, which had the bezel, except for the name when it's not on.  But even when it was on with the icons, which I believe Apple doesn't have a patent for.  So let me stop you.

Start time: 943.12
End time: 952.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, yeah, so the Apple does have a design patent on the grid of icons that was they called in Susan Care, who designed the original Mac icon.

Start time: 953.64
End time: 956.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, not the rounded icons or it is for the icons.

Start time: 956.46
End time: 1058.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's for the grid of icons.  Actually, at this point, I know the patent numbers off the top of my head.  It's the D3 is the design patent on the grid of icons, the iPhone's home screen.  So Apple presented this huge case, this monster case.  It was trade dress. Like you're saying, it was a collection of design patents, three or four design patents and then three iOS software patents on pinched.  It's not pinched to zoom exactly. It's knowing the difference between scrolling and pinching, tap to zoom and bounce back scrolling.  So it's this monster case. So you're right.  There's this whole big trade dress stuff and the specific thing the jury had to decide was not does this infringe the trade dress.  Our consumers likely to be confused.  But does this dilute the distinctiveness of Apple's trade dress?  So the value of the iPhone, Apple saying the value of our brand and the iPhone look is people know it.  They see this product. They know it's an iPhone from Apple.  Now, Samsung flooded the market with all these other products.  Does that dilute the distinctiveness of our design?  And the two big factors, you know, Apple, one of the two main factors that the case focused on was Samsung's intent to copy the design and actual confusion.  And so Apple leaned hard, obviously, on intent to copy.  They showed us documents and Samsung leaned hard on you cannot tell me anyone's actually being confused in the market.  And I think that you think there's something to be said for both ways.  Yeah, those are those are there's five or six factors.  And those are the two that were kind of most at play in the case.  And I think ultimately, the jury decided that intent to copy trumped actual confusion.

Start time: 1058.58
End time: 1061.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that's precedence. That's precedence there, is it not?

Start time: 1062.06
End time: 1071.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, those are the factors.  So if this gets appealed and all this stuff, then it will become precedent.  But for now, it's just a very powerful jury verdict that Apple can point to.  It's not it's not quite the law.

Start time: 1072.20
End time: 1097.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Neely, what was the name of the icon expert that Apple brought in Susan Care?  She said that she was waiting in the waiting room and she had this phone and this phone and iPhone for us and a Nexus next to each other.  And she accidentally reached for the Nexus because they look so alike.  Are you kidding me? Are you?  They do look somewhat alike.  Well, they're yeah, they're both ovals.  Yeah, one's a lot bigger.  Seriously, I mean, this is the thing I can't get over.

Start time: 1099.28
End time: 1102.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's go back to the iPhone, the original iPhone, not the four.

Start time: 1102.18
End time: 1108.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The three GS and the Samsung Galaxy S.  Hold on. You're holding. Those are different phones.  You've got an iPhone 4 and Galaxy Nexus.

Start time: 1109.02
End time: 1123.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, this is this is this is one of the phones that actually did fall under.  This is the two, the two.  This actually was in the in the list of the three GS that they said it.  Right. I mean, come on.  You can use this for three GS.

Start time: 1124.31
End time: 1125.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which phone is that?  This is the Galaxy two.

Start time: 1126.32
End time: 1129.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the T-Mobile T989.  That's the vibe.  Pretty similar.

Start time: 1130.43
End time: 1157.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. That phone.  I believe that phone, the vibrant and the fascinating on Verizon were deliberately engineered to look as much like the iPhone as possible.  Maybe not even at Samsung's behest.  But the I think the carriers knew they didn't have an iPhone and they needed something to compete.  So, yeah, I mean, I do think that there is again, we know one of the big factors is intent to copy.  Right. And I think there was a huge intent to copy to make to say to consumers, this thing is an iPhone.  They're just as good as an iPhone.

Start time: 1158.08
End time: 1159.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Pamela Jones. I totally agree on that.

Start time: 1160.54
End time: 1191.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pamela Jones writing in Grok Law said that this two million dollar error where the jury awarded Apple two million dollars for  inducement on a patent that they in fact had determined that was not infringing is going to be is going to undercut the jury's decision.  And she says this is why I don't think the jury's ruling will stand.  Do you agree, Nilay, that this could at least maybe on appeal?  I don't think Judge Coe is going to overturn the verdict.  But on appeal, this could be a problem.  We're going to see a flurry of motions now.

Start time: 1193.02
End time: 1253.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Samsung has to decide what places to attack and the appeals court will decide what arguments to hear.  So we'll see how that shakes out.  But, you know, a lot of this criticism of the jury is lawyers who are mad and Pamela's great.  I'm not saying that this is her criticism is valid and they did make some mistakes.  But there's a lot of lawyers who are mad that the jury isn't lawyers.  Right. Right. Because these arguments are fascinating.  And I have now spent a month dissecting them in detail because to me there's all this legal rambling and interpretation to do.  But the jury isn't lawyers.  Their job is not to be lawyers.  Their job is to say, here are the facts and evidence that were presented to us and we're going to decide what happened.  And so, yeah, they made some mistakes.  You know, the judge that this is the reason the judge had them read it.  And then she reviewed it and sent them back because she knew she anticipated that they would make some mistakes.  And particularly when it comes to damages, it's nine people in a room who have no training in this stuff.

Start time: 1253.24
End time: 1268.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Especially given how fast they work.  You might think that they just kind of made up those numbers.  Aren't the damages supposed to be not punitive but reflect the actual commercial costs to Apple of Samsung's infringement?  Yeah.  That's a hard thing to determine and certainly not in three days.

Start time: 1269.68
End time: 1301.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a combination of what the reasonable royalties Samsung would have paid if they'd licensed the patents plus Apple's lost sales plus all the stuff.  And, you know, they heard from just a variety of competing experts, right?  Here's we're going to pay for some accountants to stand in front of you and present some paperwork to you and say a bunch of numbers and now pick who you think is right.  And, you know, I think what they did was they looked at Apple's sheet.  They saw Apple one.  They looked at Apple's sheet of numbers.  And then they cut most of them down, right?  To get to whatever their final sample was asking two and a half billion.

Start time: 1301.32
End time: 1303.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They got one little more than one billion.

Transcript:  So the jury decided the Samsung and willfully infringed the patents.  And, you know, the elements of willful infringement, we've been talking about it diverge a little bit.  The elements are one of the big elements is how the Samsung's legal team did right today.  Basically waste the court's time.  You can punish Samsung for willful infringement if basically the goal is to make people settle.  Right. So if the jury finds willful and the judge is mad at the lawyers for pushing a case forward, she can.  And in this case, we know we've been saying the judges really wanted Samsung and Apple to settle.  So we'll see how she lands. She could she could triple the damages.  That's the maximum. I don't think she'll triple it.  I think she will adjust the damage number a little bit up with these types of multibillion dollar lawsuits and awards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. How much money they lost? I don't know. But to me, yeah, I think that the judgment is correct.  I mean, how you calculate the award is another thing. But yeah, I'm pretty sure.  And even thinking back to the, and I was in London and someone actually sent me an iPhone because you couldn't get them.  It was like a year later, I believe, before you could get it in Europe.  And there was a huge trade actually in iPhones in those early days, unlocked, etc.  And I remember kind of the marketing unit, if you walked into, we had these mobile phone stores in the UK, be like, oh, you might.  Well, this is just like it. Look at this one. This is beautiful.

Transcript:  Right. Yeah. You can't make that argument unless you have something that you can't say this is just like an iPhone and then show somebody like a kangaroo.  You know, like that would be different.  You've got to show them. Yeah, would be different.  You've got to show them something that reasonably is like the iPhone.  And this I'm saying, I think particularly with some of these phones, the Verizon fast to me is the the example of Verizon didn't have the iPhone.  They needed to compete with AT&T and the iPhone.  They got Samsung to make their phone look as much like the iPhone as possible.  And, you know, Samsung, I think for it, I think Samsung has come a long way.  I think they I don't they're not doing it anymore. Right.  The Galaxy S3 doesn't look any like an iPhone.  So in many ways, it's like I don't think we're going to see this this level of activity again.  I don't think Apple's ever going to have it as good. That's what Matt McCarrie and our team, who is a patent attorney, has been saying.  Apple's never this perfect storm of events for Apple is never going to occur where Samsung is actually copying the iPhone's design.  They're actually in stores saying to consumers, buy this.  It's just as good as the phones look just the same.  The software features are just the same.

Start time: 1538.03
End time: 1676.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's so confusing. I'm confused. It is.  Actually, I think that this is a perfect example of the fact that Samsung has now moved on.  I mean, the note is clearly not an iPhone copy. I mean, it's huge.  It's five point three inches and the and the iPhone's three and a half inches.  If anything, now Apple might copy the the Samsung.  Let me I thought the most interesting take on this was Farhad Manju writing in Pando Daily saying that, in fact, this was a business decision on the part of Samsung that when the iPhone came out,  he said, actually, the real crux of it was in the fall of 2008 when Apple became the most profitable phone manufacturer in the world.  They'd only sold four million iPhones.  They'd made one point three billion dollars compared to number two Nokia, which sold one hundred thirteen million phones and only made one point two billion dollars.  And when that flipped, when Apple's iPhone became that profitable, companies had to say, we this is it.  We've got you know, we have three choices and he gives you the three choices. One was do nothing.  He says a lot of firms opted for this path. Nokia and RIM, for instance, seem to have decided that the iPhone was a blip device.  That would never reach mass appeal. So why bother taking it on?  Yeah, obviously that doesn't work. RIM is practically out of business and Nokia is struggling now becoming a Windows phone company.  He says another option was try to leapfrog Apple.  You could spend many months, maybe even years working on devices that aimed not just to match the iPhone's innovations, but to beat them.  That's what Palm did with the pre. Yeah. How'd that work out?  And that's what Microsoft did. And three years later, Microsoft phone ships and is in fact innovative, clever, but it's three years late.  Right. He says then there was a third choice. You could just copy Apple.  You could borrow the iPhone's key ideas, make a halfhearted attempt to dress them up in your own brand and bake them into your product line.  And he says, in effect, this was a business decision. Samsung probably expected down the line they'd be paying a fine to Apple.  Maybe they'd be compelled to license. Maybe they'd be compelled to change the design or the technology.  But for the time being, that was a risk they were willing to take. And maybe that billion dollar or three billion dollar fine is just the cost of doing business.  They have, in fact, made twenty one billion dollars since then on their phones.

Transcript:  So, you know, it's far out is great. I mean, that's I think this is a really good take on it. He might be right.  But but there are some huge clutch like omissions from this piece, which is that copying Apple didn't work out so great for a whole host of other companies.  Right. So you're going to copy. You have to do a good job.  HTC does a great job of making its own phones. Right. And they're not doing so well. Why not?  I'm doing really poorly. Dell tried to make phones that ran Android that looked a lot like the did completely failed.  Sony struggling for years to compete using Android.  Samsung was in a really Samsung is a unique company.  I don't think the lesson here is copying works.  I think the lesson here is a little bit more subtle.  It's Samsung had the resources because they're this dominant manufacturer and they were given this gift of Android from Google.  Right. And they were able to put it together and immediately start mass producing copies of the iPhone.  You know, or devices that were substitutes for the iPhone in many ways and for many customers.  That is a hugely unique situation. Right.  And so they were able to make that business decision.  But all these other companies, you know, LG makes a lot of stuff, right.  Their phones are not as good and the customers don't want them.  And they're, you know, I the joke for me is always Samsung copied Apple and LG sitting there trying desperately trying to copy Samsung.  It's not as good as what its generational loss.  Right.

What you steal is not the idea.  You steal the inspiration.  You steal the essence.  You steal the spirit of that problem, that solution.  And you make it your own.  That's what stealing really means in that case.  They didn't they didn't steal the Xerox user interface.  They didn't they didn't copy it and ship it.  They said these are the ideas that we want.  We're going to steal the entire spirit of this product.  We're going to do whatever we want to it and make it our own.  But didn't they? Didn't they?

Transcript:  Because, I mean, the spirit of the iPhone was it made all other phones look boring.  It made them look so blind.  It made them all look like the same functionless squares.  In a way, Samsung's done that to Apple.  I mean, yeah, OK, iPhones still sell by the millions.  There's there's no doubt that they're making a mint off of them.  But you look at them, what are the really exciting phones out there?  It's not the iPhone 5 because, well, OK, it's going to be a bit bigger.  It's going to have all the same functionality.  It's the next Note.  It's the next Galaxy.  They're really sexy phones.  And they do things that you can't do with iPhones.  That's stealing the spirit of what what Apple had.

Transcript:  I agree. I think Samsung got there.  I think they're there now.  I think they have learned their lesson.  I think in many places, their execution can struggle,  but they understand what the task in front of them is.  What I'm saying is that just saying copying works as a business decision is I I think it's you're looking there.  There's a forest and trees metaphor here.  It's more than just copying.  And there's the way more subtle.  All these companies.  Yeah, it's Android had to exist for Samsung to pull this off.  Right. And without Android, which which begs the next question.

Transcript:  Right. But it's a Samsung products, right.  That actually shipping gets sold and are the competitive threats.  I think ultimately.  Apple and Google have to to license it out.  They have to they have to stop this.  You know, Apple has a lot of money and they can afford the lawyers, but they're still going to pay for the lawyers.  You can't be Tim Cook and say, all right, we're going to spend one hundred million dollars a year on lawyers.  Like, that's a lot of employees.  That's a lot of talent.  That's a lot of that's a lot of development.  Right. And, you know, they have a really great deal with Microsoft.  They have a patent cross license that says we won't clone each other's products.  I think they can get there with Google.  And, you know, this is the sort of victory that they need.  Maybe this is the catalyst, you think, to a deal to walk to walk into a meeting and say, look, Google, you're next time.  It's time to just pay like it's time to make this happen.  We'll see if it happens.

Transcript:  Is that accurate? You think I think that was their opening.  We have a lot of slides and this is another sort of thing that's under reported about this case is, yeah, there's all the Steve Jobs trash talk in the past.  But the company Apple is the most valuable company in the world.  Right. They're run by rational people.  They're not run by the emotions of somebody who's gone.  And there are slides.  We've published the slides.  It says Apple saying to Samsung, we would have preferred that you licensed our patents and here's a price.  And Samsung said, well, that price is too high.  And they've been obviously they they couldn't achieve a price in a negotiation that was suitable to either party.  But I think that number has come down significantly since the initial thirty dollars.  I think it's pretty obvious that in the future, Samsung Samsung can appeal this for all they want.  But what they really need to do is start paying the appropriate license fees to Apple and end all the litigation around the world.  I mean, this is just one lawsuit.  There's lawsuits in Australia, Germany, South Korea.  There's another lawsuit in a few months over the Galaxy Nexus.  Samsung can't keep risking this domino effect of lawsuits going against them.  And I think the smarter move for both parties is to end all this litigation, do some sort of cross license worldwide settlement and move on with making products.  And I think that's kind of what everybody wants them to do.

Transcript:  Neil, I got to ask if you look at the judgment and you look at the patents that were ruled to be infringed,  how many of those translate directly into what we would call the Google Android experience?  So when you look at, say, the Samsung Galaxy S3, how many of those could be used against the current crop of Android products?

Start time: 2072.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, I mean, they can't run this lawsuit anymore.  I mean, they'd have to come up with an entirely new docket, an entirely new set of complaints for for them to continue.

Start time: 2085.94
End time: 2156.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, yeah, I mean, you can't Apple pays its lawyers too much to have them cut and paste the complaint.  They'll write a whole new one.  They'll come up with some new arguments.  But yeah, you know, I've heard from a few people that Google thinks the newest version of Android Jelly Bean does not solve solves the patent problem.  So we'll see. But again, it's like, you know, jelly bean is a pretty highly differentiated product.  Like I look at the Nexus seven that I have, which I really like.  I think it's a terrific little product and it's really different than the iPhone.  Everything about it is different than the IP.  You don't you don't use it and say this is a copy of an Apple product.  You say this is a really unique and different product.  And that's the goal. Like, ultimately, that's the goal.  We shouldn't you can complain about the patent system and intellectual property, all this stuff.  And yes, our system is has very meaningful flaws and is broken in some ways.  But the whole idea is that Apple made one thing and Samsung has to make another thing.  And having more different things is good. Right.  And so if this all this noise pushes these companies to make different kinds of products, I think we actually do benefit.

Start time: 2156.94
End time: 2176.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But if if Google is saying that jelly bean solves all the patent problems, why would Samsung be forced to the bargaining table?  I mean, couldn't they just say, OK, fine, all of our phones from now on are the Google experience, their jelly bean and above.  If if that gets rid of all the patent complaints, I don't see what what makes them any more willing to settle with Apple.

Start time: 2177.52
End time: 2205.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because what you want is you want certainty. Right.  Businesses run on certainty, not on risk.  So you want Samsung and Apple need to have an agreement that says we agree that we will cross license our patents.  The legal technical phrase is freedom of action.  So we'll be able to have freedom of action.  Maybe Samsung has to pay Apple.  Apple can use a three G patents.  Samsung can use the other patents and we can both make products and not worry about probably legal issues in the future.  And that's what you want. You want that certain.

Transcript:  I mean, let me specifically respond to the car thing.  And because I hear that a lot, you can make a car before and Ford won't see you for doing four wheels and a steering wheel.  What they will sue you for is making a Mustang.  Right. And that's really important.  That's a huge difference like in cars.  And yes, some cars like family sedans to my eye, they all look the same and they're not distinctive and innovative.  But the Mustang is like a classic icon of automobile engineering.  The Corvette, you know, there's all kinds Ferrari.  You can't run around making cars that look like Ferraris because Ferrari will see you.  They'll say that's our mark.

Start time: 2320.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not. It's not a billion dollar lawsuit.  So it doesn't hit the front page of Wall Street Journal.  Those companies could sue left and right.  Right. They all have licenses to these designs because that's what you need.  You can't take somebody else's investment into.

Start time: 2339.22
End time: 2355.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But again, you are really talking about a look and not not necessarily OK, built a Mustang.  By the way, I don't think Ford would sue anyone.  They're such a friendly company.  You can't take.  So you can't design the Mustang and rip off the design.  But you could put a 500 horsepower engine in.

Start time: 2364.86
End time: 2444.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it comes down again that the specific thing here that was really important, I think, to Apple was we invested all of this time.  We took this huge risk to make the iPhone.  This is a story they told the judge.  They told the jury rather.  It took us five years and millions of dollars to invent the iPhone.  And it's famous.  This is the everybody knows it.  Samsung took three months to copy it and didn't bear any of the risk.  So that's wrong.  Right.  I mean, we should be rewarded for the risk and the money that the risk we took in the money we spent.  Now, it's not one to one with cars.  Obviously, it doesn't match.  A car is in a smartphone.  It doesn't make a lot of sense.  But what you can say is, yes, there are certain fundamental necessities of a car.  There are certain fundamental functional necessities of a TV or smartphone.  And those things are written out of the law.  Right.  That Samsung's argument to the jury was, you know, let's not they literally said, let's not pretend you can patent a grid of icons.  But what the jury said was Apple's grid of icons is distinct.  It's not determined by functionality.  It's it's you can make different kinds of grids of icons.  And Samsung copied Apple's grid of icons.  And their design.  You can you can I characterize the case the entire for the entire month the case is running.  The case that Apple's argument was always just look at this and Samsung's argument was, let's look at it in painful, exhaustive.

He says, I'm sitting in a Starbucks while I'm waiting for my drink.  I watched a guy with his friend pick up a newspaper.  They were talking about the Samsung Apple verdict.  Guy says, wait, so what they're saying Samsung is the same as Apple?  Friend says, I know, right?  Makes me think twice about how much I paid for my MacBook.  Seriously.  Then a husband and wife 10 minutes later.  Samsung's iPad is the same as Apple's iPad and I haven't paid how much for the Apple one?  Honey, I told you they were a ripoff.  He says this is the best ad campaign Samsung could possibly buy because effectively the jury has said Samsung and Apple, they're the same by the same song.  Isn't that interesting?

Transcript:  OK, one last question, one last question, and then we got to move on.  I know I've been trying for a while.  Does Apple does Apple now get an injunction and stop sales of these phones in the US?

Start time: 2621.05
End time: 2647.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, most of them are on sale.  So they're old stuff.  The vibrant, you know, it's like who cares?  But the Galaxy S2 is in the case and the Galaxy S2 is still a huge seller.  I think it's like Boost Mobile or somebody just actually announced the Galaxy S2.  So, yeah, it's there already within two weeks.  There's another hearing on injunctions for these phones.  And then in a few months, you know, the Galaxy Nexus is there a precedent set?

Start time: 2647.95
End time: 2654.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Could app could Apple then say, well, we won this one.  We won this one.  So you should block the Galaxy S3 and the Galaxy Note.

Start time: 2655.36
End time: 2687.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, they're different findings.  So they can't. OK.  Yeah. I mean, you you have to sit in front of a jury again.  What the judge can say is, you know, the standard for a preliminary injunction is irreparable harm.  Right. Right. So Apple can say and likeliness, the judge has to decide your case is likely to win.  And there's going to be irreparable harm.  So Apple can say now the likely to win factor here is really high.  Right. And this phone is directly competitive with our phone.  So there's definitely irreparable harm.  Give us the injunction. So it does. It does influence that.

Start time: 2688.28
End time: 2690.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2694.30
End time: 2700.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. But it but it does lend some weight to that argument.  If you want to go back to court and say, OK, now you got to stop the note to in the Galaxy S3.

Start time: 2701.88
End time: 2724.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, we'll see if I mean, again, Apple and Samsung, they need to come off there.  You know, this weekend was probably intense.  Everyone got really drunk for different reasons this weekend. Right.  I think they need to, you know, brush off their hangover, sit down in a room and figure out an actual agreement to make sense for both companies moving forward.  Because all this extra litigation, like I'm saying, it's just additional risk and uncertainty.  And it's not good for either company. Right. They've got it.

Start time: 2725.18

I know some of these guys and I'm very proud for our association with the Ford Motor Company, that blue oval.  I'm proudly drive a Mustang and love it.  Now, let me tell you, if you are a Ford fan, you've got a new site just for you. Social dot Ford dot com.  This is a great place to read articles about Ford technology.  In fact, I have a little one there about an interview I did with Jim Boczkowski, who's a Ford technologist,  about kind of some of the stuff that's coming to Ford and Ford Sink in the future.  I thought it was very interesting stuff.  But there's also got a an ideas section where you can post your ideas, read other people's ideas for ways that you could improve the Ford automobile.  Bring back the Capri. Yeah, baby.  The Capri MK3. Vote on the vote on the ideas.  Let us let the world know what you think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think that's original equipment.  But OK, OK, you can have that.  You can add that there's an aftermarket thing you can do.  They also get a badge here while you're there.  I don't I don't know this badge thing.  The kids the kids love the badge thing, I guess.  But you can have a Ford fan badge.  I could get the Mustang badge.  I like the classic the retro.  And they also say if you're a tech geek, there is a tech geek badge now.  You're not just ahead of the curve.  You're the one leading it.  It looks like an NFC tag, actually.  It's kind of cool.  Ford is doing this at social.Ford.com.  Take a look at the latest vehicles from Ford.  Drive one today.  2012 Ford Focus Electric.  Just love that the Ford SYNC, the my Ford Touch.  They're doing some really cool stuff.  Go to social.Ford.com.  It really was one big story next week and the week after big stories.  I'm sure that the verge is you know, you don't get to rest at all, Neelai,  because this week the Galaxy Note 2, Samsung and IFA will announce that in Berlin.  The week after we've got announcements from Nokia, from Motorola.  Nokia will probably announce the new Windows 8 phone from the next Lumia, I guess.  I don't know if they'll call it that.  Maybe Windows RT tablets.  Amazon's got an announcement.  What are they going to do?  That's September 6th.  What are they going to announce then?  A new Kindle Fire?

Start time: 2889.38
End time: 2907.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think they're going to announce a number of media overtaken by Kindle Fire puns.  I think it's probably Amazon's.  No, I think they're going to do a new tablet, something a little smaller, thinner, not smaller, but thinner.  And I've heard a lot about a phone.  A phone?  Yeah.  A phone?

Start time: 2909.15
End time: 2916.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  An Amazon phone?  How would that work?  Would they have a deal with a carrier or would it be unlocked?  How would that work?

Start time: 2916.04
End time: 2959.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they definitely need to have a deal with a carrier.  I don't know how Amazon adds value to a phone platform.  I'm assuming it'll be Android.  So I'm very curious to see what they're differentiating.  I mean, right now the carriers drive the phone market, right?  If you want to make a phone, you can't just show up.  You have to get in bed with a carrier in the United States, which I think is hopelessly broken.  I actually think, to Adam's earlier point, you can't be a startup and make a new phone.  Yeah, patents are one problem.  The bigger problem is that you've got to sign a deal with the devil, right?  You've got to go and get AT&T to sell your phone.  And Amazon's got to do that.  So I expect them to be on every carrier.  They have the clout to do it.  I just don't know what their value proposition the consumer will be.

Start time: 2960.04
End time: 2971.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you could see the value proposition of the Kindle Fire was basically a very cheap tablet.  There was a portal to Amazon so people would buy Amazon stuff.  Yeah.  They don't need to add a phone to that to make it any more valuable.

Start time: 2972.22
End time: 2983.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, the only feature I can think of, which I think is kind of funny,  that you could put on an Amazon phone is that the camera would automatically detect all the barcodes,  the products around you in the store, and then tell you how much cheaper it would be on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, you go into stores now, they say no cameras, no cameras.  They know very well. That's exactly what people do.  They go in and there is actually a Jewish Talmudic law, I think it's Talmudic,  the shopkeeper's law, or maybe not.  It's more of an ethical conundrum where, I know, I'm looking at you, Father Pablos.  Dr. Mom? Dr. Mom?  The thought is, it's unethical to go into a shop, to get a shopkeeper to show you everything,  you know, talk with you, go back and forth, and then go out and buy it from the guy next door.  You have a certain moral obligation to buy it from the guy who showed it to you first.  But that's exactly what people are doing now.  They go into a camera store, they'll play with the camera, they'll look at it, they say thanks, and they go out and buy it.  Buy it on Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I get it. There was a Microsoft phone of the same name.  We need a rim shot because I'm slow. I'm slow.  All right. And then, okay, so then that's the silly season where all the little guys, Nokia, Motorola, Google, Amazon, Samsung, announce their stuff.  And all of that is almost like an opening act for September 12th when Apple, we still don't know,  but everybody seems to agree will announce the new iPhone.

Start time: 3097.67
End time: 3105.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's going to be a really busy month.  It's crazy.  You know, it's funny that Apple, Apple's setting a date or rumors of a date. They haven't set a date yet.

Start time: 3105.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 3107.93
End time: 3131.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah, I'm pretty confident about the 12th.  But you know, once that starts to get locked down, it's funny to see all the other companies start to lock down their dates as well.  And they all fell like seriously dominoes.  Like after Apple, after this date, the 12th kind of started circulating.  Invitations for the week before it started flooding out.  And it's funny because nobody wants to compete with Apple, but they're all perfectly happy to step on each other's toes.

Start time: 3149.04
End time: 3168.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's what it is.  But you know, Motorola, I think their event is probably the Droid Razor HD.  And it's like, OK, yeah, you can definitely probably do that on the same day as Nokia or whatever.  Like, you know, I don't need a full day to process like a higher resolution screen on a Droid Razor.  Like, here it is. You could probably just send it to me in the mail.  You know, like we don't need to do this dance.

Start time: 3169.00
End time: 3231.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I respect that.  They're saying the news cycle will be dominated once Apple makes an announcement.  So we're not even going to bother.  Yeah. After September 12th.  And now here's the other thing.  And John Gruber and I don't know whether to think John is being disingenuous or is just an idiot savant or what.  And I say that with respect because Gruber publishes a blog post this week saying, you know, I've been thinking, he says.  He says, I've been thinking about this Apple announcement.  And, you know, after a lot of thought, I've decided Apple probably won't do a mini iPad announcement the same time as they do the iPhone.  Why would they? Why would they do it?  They'll have a separate announcement at a different time.  I've been thinking he apparently came up out of nowhere with this thought.  The next day in all things, D. John Pachowski says, yeah, that's actually what Apple is going to do.  Have you heard anything about that?  And has Apple called you with that rumor?

Start time: 3232.93

Both Johns in this case, I trust them, especially with their Apple sources.  Yeah.  But Gruber didn't imply it was an Apple source.

Start time: 3258.24
End time: 3259.96

Start time: 3260.08
End time: 3265.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, it makes sense.  I mean, Apple doesn't have a long history of announcing anything along the iPhone.

Start time: 3266.04
End time: 3272.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it makes a lot of sense.  And I don't know if Pachowski is thinking or if he's got a tip.

Start time: 3273.06
End time: 3314.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And particularly with Apple likes to be very focused.  Right.  Right.  And if they're going to do a whole new product like the iPad Mini, I don't think they're going to be like, well, we've got the iPhone and here's this other.  Here's one more thing.  I think they're going to say this is here it is.  Like, here's here's some big deal for the iPad Mini.  We'll see.  I think I mean, to answer your specific question, I think John Gruber really was just riffing.  I mean, he's a columnist, right?  His side is basically his column.  Right.  So I think he really was riffing.  They're in fireball.net.  Yep.  And I think John Pachowski actually went and reported it out.  And I, you know, that's that's actually very that's both of their styles.  Right.  Exemplary.  I think that's what happened there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I have big hands.  So that works for me.  I do get a lot of laughs when I hold it up to my head.  Do you use a stylus?  You know what?  I use it in two instances.  Sometimes I want to take a screenshot.  And if I'm sending something to someone who's developing something, I'll say, look at this,  circle it, and like, this is no good.  And I do find it handy when someone says, take down this number.  Or my wife says, oh, here's the confirmation code for UPS.  You can fire it up pretty quickly.  And I just write it, you know, just use the stylus.

Start time: 3408.06

Start time: 3411.10
End time: 3421.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I use that surprisingly often, actually.  I didn't buy it for that reason.  I bought it for the size and the speed.  And of course, silly me, you know, they're coming out with something.  Now they have the quad core or whatever.

Start time: 3646.96
End time: 3656.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's RFID, which has a much greater range than NFC.  I'm sorry?  RFID has a greater range than NFC.  NFC is a passive technology.  NFC is almost contactless.

Transcript:  But doesn't NFC work off of an RFID chip?  So if I shot confetti into the air and had little RFID chips on it and it had some instruction,  I could make Times Square all go to my website on New Year's Eve?

Start time: 3671.31

Transcript:  You are right that NFC is the same.  It's a subset of RFID.  But the particular subset it is, is it limits the range of communication to four inches.  Yeah.  It's kind of almost exactly what NFC is about.  Yeah, we'll do our RFID, but you've got to be close.  And I've never got it to work with four inches.  I almost always have to tap it.  That's why the NFC antenna...

Transcript:  Yeah.  The Nexus 7...  Everybody should buy a Nexus 7.  You know what it is...  The interesting thing to me about the Nexus 7 is that it is...  It's like finally the real answer to the iPod Touch.  Because Android has never had a device like the iPod Touch where it's like, I don't want  to get a phone, I don't want to contract, I don't want to do all this crap, I just want  to play with the apps, right?  The Nexus 7 is that device for Android in like every reasonable way.  It's...  You know, it doesn't run tablet apps or all the great tablet apps.  It runs all these great phone apps for Android.  It's 200 bucks.  You can just buy it.  You can consume a bunch of media.  You can screw around with it.  It's virtually disposable.  Yeah, it's great.  I mean, it's a great product.  And you know, it really shows like...  That's why Samsung should stop making touchwiz, right?  Because the stock Google experience now is so good that they could just give it to people  and it's different and meaningfully better than some stuff on iOS.

Start time: 3784.68
End time: 3796.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In fact, I would say touchwiz and sense and blur and all of these other kind of carrier  and phone add-ons are really a negative.  People want the...  I think they want the plain Google experience now.

Transcript:  I think Samsung finally has the clout to do it too.  They've started doing that with the S3, which is...  It used to be they were just trying to get their phones into the window.  And so they would do whatever the carriers asked them to.  Now there's such a big manufacturer and they've got such popular products, they can say, look,  this is the product.

Transcript:  Take it or leave it.  Who makes this...  Let me just ask the audience in our studio.  I think we have 40 people here.  Who makes this 7 tablet?  Does anybody know?  Who?  I wonder if anybody knows.  Because I'm thinking after this trial, it looks like a Samsung and Apple world, doesn't it?  The chat room knows it's Asus.  But I think the general world probably thinks this is a Galaxy tablet.  There are a few people back here that were saying...  He knew, I knew, I knew.

Start time: 3881.19
End time: 3969.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, they do.  They make terrific stuff.  I think if I had to buy an Android phone on a carrier, I would probably...  Aside from the Galaxy Nexus, I'd probably get a One Series phone.  I don't know, man.  I think they played a little too fast and loose with their carrier relationships.  I think they don't manufacture this stuff.  They can't bring the prices down.  They can't make the profit margins go up.  And the stuff they were doing with Sense, the last version of Sense particularly, was  really over the top, heavy-handed.  And I think Samsung just is their...  You know, Samsung's best-selling phone in America is not the S2 or the S3 or whatever.  It's the Galaxy Prevail, which is like a prepaid phone.  Really?  Yeah.  Really?  Yeah.  HTC doesn't compete in that huge piece of the market that we never think about.  They tend to compete at the top end.  So I think HTC is going to turn it back around.  Their phones are really good.  I think they understand their structural problems.  But yeah, Samsung dominates because they're able to produce so much stuff.  Samsung dominates in volume.  They're like, here's a thousand phones.  One of the funniest parts of this whole case, when the jury was reading the verdict, they  had to read the names of all of these phones, like infringed and infringed patents.  And just, I kind of wondered, like, if you're Samsung, you're in that room and you're listening  to somebody say, mesmerize, vibrant, fascinating, gem, Galaxy S4G, Epic 5 Touch.  It's like, are you finally embarrassed?  Has it finally hit you that this is stupid?

It was funny, we were on our podcast when we were at the Vergecast, we were talking,  Josh made a joke about the impact of the Samsung vibe and what he meant was the impact on the  market of Samsung's, like, their aesthetic.  And then we discovered that Samsung actually makes phones called the impact and the vibe.  So people were getting confused.  And it's like, you've got to calm down somewhere.  But that's why they're winning over HTC, because they flood the market with these devices.

It was given to me in Salt Lake City, Utah.  I had it in the back of the trailer.  I took it through three states and these were severe drought states.  Every single state we went through, it rained between nine and 12 hours later.  Came to Austin, shook that stick.  We had a rainstorm right over the house.

Transcript:  Wasting cactus thorns.  This show brought to you by our friends at, hey, this is perfect.  Go to assist.com.  If you're in IT, I know Father Robert Balliser has been praying over a few computers lately.  You might want to try Go to Assist from Citrix.  It lets you take control of your IT world from a cloud-based platform.  We've talked about it before because, of course, Go to Assist is the number one remote access  solution out there with a big, big chunk of market share.  But now the folks at Citrix have added a feature to Go to Assist that I think makes  it even better.  It's remote.  In addition to remote access, it's remote monitoring.  So here's how it works.  If you visit go to assist.com, you can actually get all this kind of explained to you.  You put the crawler from the Go to Assist remote monitoring on your network.  It will not only identify all the hardware, including every network attached device and  it will also identify all the software.  So now you have this great setup where you've got all the stuff that's on the client network  monitored for you.  Next thing you do is you can set up a dashboard and you can use custom or built-in little  plugins for the dashboard that do things like analyze server and network performance, display  stats, track key metrics like CPU load averages, disk utilization.  So you know what's going on.  And then you've got these proactive alerts by email, by SMS on your mobile phone, by  instant messenger to let you know if things like, you know, well, hey, the server performance  is down, you know, the Wi-Fi is not working or the toner, even things like the toner cartridge  is running out or disk space is false below 5%.  And you can get in there and fix it either with a remote support or if it's something  like a hard drive, you can go in there and put a new hard drive in and you're now a support  hero because you knew ahead of time what was going to go wrong with the network and you  fixed it before it became a big problem.  It is a tool that anybody who's in support should have in their tool belt.  And if you are in the managed support, managed service business, this is a must have.  By the way, it lets you support via iPad as well as by computer, Mac or PC, any kind of  hardware.  This is a great solution.  Try it free for 30 days.  Visit gotoassist.com, G-O-T-O, assist.com.  You can for 30 days free try both the monitoring and the remote access.  You just have to use the promo code TWIT, okay?  T-W-I-T.  Click that promo code link on the Try It Free page and use our offer code so we would get  credit and you are set to go.  And I think you will find this is absolutely the best.  Our own IT guy, Russell, is actually about to convert over to it because it's so much  He pays a lot more money for this stuff.  He uses it.  It's not nearly as good.  Go to assist.com.  Offer code is TWIT.  So the other big story this week, and I don't know if it's too inside baseball or not, but  we can talk about it a little bit, is Twitter and the developer space.  And what's happening at Twitter?  Twitter seems to have decided that it's basically saying, hey, thanks for all the help developers.  Thanks for all the help third party clients.  We'll take it from here.

Transcript:  Well, this is just proving the same thing that we talked about last time was on the  show with Facebook, Leo, that the display ad business does not work.  And they're doing everything now desperately trying to give value to their newsfeed.  And a lot of that is the layout.  And this, I think they've still taken the wrong track.  They should have completely become infrastructure, licensed their API.  They would have made a lot more money longer term, being a long infrastructure player.  And I think that this is a death warrant for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, Scoble.  But people don't understand...  And I've been in the internet advertising business for a long, long time.  And I started my first company in 93.  People don't understand when it comes to advertising, there's a scarcity of inventory that really  drives the pricing.  It's extremely important.  And maybe I can just break it down very simply.  Which is because I don't understand what you're talking about.

Start time: 4475.48
End time: 4475.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tell me what you mean.

Start time: 4477.38
End time: 4507.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay.  So when it comes to display ads, basically a banner or a link, there is unlimited inventory.  Facebook...  In fact, the more people on Facebook or the more people are on Twitter, the more inventory  there is.  Supply and demand...  I don't make these things up, but markets kind of work that way.  If there's a lot more supply than there is demand or unlimited supply, the price automatically  goes down.  It's different when you have a television show or even actually a...  Twitter is a great example.

Start time: 4507.64
End time: 4511.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We have limited ad inventory.  We can only run four ads in a show.

Start time: 4512.08
End time: 4529.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  And so let's just do the numbers real quickly.  You have an audience that is defined, not just people and maybe we have some social  graph and we might know a little bit about what companies they like if they're complete  idiots and they click on the Coca-Cola like button, whatever.  But we know what your audience is.

Start time: 4529.32
End time: 4532.10

Start time: 4532.53
End time: 4602.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm telling you.  This is why you have companies like Ford who know that there's a technology audience that  is interested in this stuff.  Go to My Assist for the IT professional.  Yeah, that's targeted.  They know what they're getting.  Let's just say...  Yeah.  Just...  There's only, what do you say, six slots?  Is that what you have?  Not even that.  Four.  Four.  So let's just...  I'm picking numbers.  I have no idea.  You have a CPM cost per thousand.  I'll just pick a number.  $40 for each thousand people that watch or listen to the show.  Now you're talking some serious money.  Now you just made 20 grand for one spot.  I don't know if this is true.  No, that's about right.  That's exactly right.  Very different numbers.  That's very close.  But these are television numbers get much higher than that.  There can only be one company that has the beverage on the desk of American Idol.  It's limited inventory.  So when it comes to display ads, it has no value because there's no scarcity in this.  And this is exactly the same thing that Twitter is running into.  Display advertising is not a business.  It's a remnant inventory.  It's throwaway.  It's trash.

Start time: 4603.00
End time: 4609.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and it's even worse for Twitter and Facebook because more and more people are  using those sites on mobile where they're not even seeing display ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 4612.98
End time: 4616.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So they have trash ads on the website and they got nothing on the mobile.

Start time: 4617.10
End time: 4680.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  And if you really look at the intrinsic value, I know we're talking about Twitter, but the  intrinsic value of Facebook, which you know a lot about because of their S1 filing in  their most recent quarter, they're probably really only worth $7 a share.  So that's why it was very easy for me to say, oh, you know, this is $17 in five months.  We probably have five or six weeks left and it probably can still go that low.  Right.  But...  And Twitter, you know, they're desperately trying to control everything, control their  messaging, control the display, if you will.  This is what this is about.  If you look at the API requirements, it's all about display, what you can and cannot  display in a view of a tweet or a list of tweets.  They're trying to control it and they're trying to control it for advertising messaging.  Even if everyone is delighted with ads popping up in their tweet feed, it's not an end to  any.  It does not pay off at the end.  The more people join, the more useless remnant inventory they've created.

We make high quality content.  When we left to start the verge, we I was complained about the ads.  I was putting on end gadget.  I at one point, I think it will even threaten to fire me because I was complaining so loudly  that our ads were crap.  And so when we left to start the verge, we said we want to have a great publication,  that has great content and it also has to have great ads in it because that's part of  the user experience of our product.  So we've been very, our sales team is very motivated.  Yeah, sorry.  You know, our sales team is motivated to get good ads.  I don't know anything about that.  But I just know that it pays my bills.

Transcript:  I'm looking at the front page of the verge and you have literally two, not one, just  two, no more ads.  You have one at the top and one here and that's it on a very large page.  And so in a way that you are, they are constraining the inventory, Adam, and I think that's a  smart move.

Start time: 4811.70
End time: 4820.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they're not, Leo.  They're constraining the amount of ads on a page.  The inventory is the number of page views.  And that is not constrained by definition.  Well, I understand.

Start time: 4821.42
End time: 4831.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And you're taking a model that was based on print where there literally was a constraint.  You have this many pages in the magazine and you're applying it to the web where there  is no constraint.  So the model doesn't work.  I understand.  I agree with you.

Start time: 4843.80
End time: 4854.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's rightly so because editorial and advertising should not mix.  And I agree with that.  But it's very germane to the conversation about what do you do if you're Twitter to  monetize or...

Start time: 4855.48
End time: 4899.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Adam's point about Twitter, we actually just ran last week, ran a piece called Introducing  Twitter's New Business Twitter by our guide Peter Brown, which is great.  You know, Adam's point about they should be the infrastructure, they should be the...  They should license the API is that's great.  But you know, you can look at sort of the Android model and say, well, this is the problem  with Android.  Android said we made the infrastructure, here we go.  And they're improving the infrastructure as fast as they can, right?  Android updates are great.  And then the API partners, the phone manufacturers aren't taking them.  So for Twitter to say we're the infrastructure means you're giving up a high rate of innovation.  You're saying now we're the utility.  Once you say something is utility, it doesn't...  There's no more innovation.  I disagree.

Start time: 4899.88
End time: 4915.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the innovation was in the developers who were using their API and creating amazing  things.  And once you've got these guys in, you can do all kinds of deals with them for their  access to the API, to the Friend Finder, all of this stuff.

Start time: 4916.40
End time: 4923.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're not exactly...  But they're not saying to those developers, you can't do it.  They say if you want to do it, you got to come talk to us.  And that's...

Start time: 4924.20
End time: 4964.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no.  I disagree.  They're saying here are very specific guidelines about what you can and cannot display and  the way a tweet has to be displayed, completely stifling any innovation on like TweetDeck.  TweetDeck, you know, that was something completely new, completely different.  innovation now with these developer guidelines that have been sent, you know, the new law.  And above and beyond that, they're saying you can have this many accesses to the API  without coming to us and making some kind of deal.  So basically, you're just a slave to Twitter and you're not going to win anything.

Start time: 4964.68
End time: 4993.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm with Adam on this.  I mean, they're really constraining what developers can do.  You look at something like Clouchebag, which, you know, we've shown.  It's a funny...  What's Clouchebag?  That's the one that looks through all your tweets and it finds out how Clouchey you've  been.  Have you abused the English language?  Have you abused retweets, etc., etc.?  Oh, I have to...  It's a...  It's a Clouchebag.  I've got to try this.  It's making fun of Clout.  I wonder how I'm going to do.  But something like that, even though that's supposed to be a joke, that won't exist under  the new infrastructure that Twitter is creating.  I'm a bit of a pratt.

Start time: 4993.90
End time: 4997.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 5005.78
End time: 5027.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Retweet abuse.  But, I mean, that odd stuff was what made Twitter interesting.  It wasn't all the tweets about, yo, I'm about to eat a burrito or, hey, I'm in the bathroom.  It was what people could actually do with the information that people were putting out  and open on the internet.  Well, if you get rid of that, developers aren't going to have that fun little hook anymore.

Start time: 5029.42
End time: 5052.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree on a lot of that stuff.  But let me give you the counter example that to me is the danger, which is email.  Email is an open standard.  Everybody can use it.  You can do whatever you want.  There's supposed to be all this innovation in email clients.  There's not.  But there's not.  And the core email standards have not evolved either because there's nobody driving them  who can extract value from the effort they put into updating them.

Start time: 5052.78
End time: 5070.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But why does there always have to be that kind of value?  I think email has been around for a long time and there's been a heck of a lot of innovation  from the days of Elm and Pine up to the Gmail interface.  But then it stopped.  There's been a lot of innovation.  I'm sorry.  At a certain point, it's what it is.

Start time: 5071.32
End time: 5104.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That innovation, the innovation is not in how email works.  It's in an email client and where the client lives.  But that's not the kind of innovation.  There's no infrastructure innovation.  The spam problem for email has all been solved by Google and the cloud, not at any level  by the actual utility of email.  Twitter faces a similar problem and on top of that, they're trying to feed themselves.  So they need to take control of the utility they provide and say, this is how we're going  to get value out of it.  Because otherwise, you have to pick something.

Start time: 5104.42
End time: 5123.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  But that's a back end process.  So that would be perfect for them to say, we'll reduce the spam.  There's tons of Twitter spam.  They could also say, we'll reduce the fake accounts.  And there's tons of those.  All kinds of things that they could do.  And I think that there's probably 20 years of innovation in that type of back end infrastructure.  Wow.  I'm sorry.

When they assess it for its condition, because they want to make sure they pay you fairly  for the condition.  By the way, sometimes they do bump the price up as well as lock the price down.  29 gigs.  29 gigs.

By the way, this offer is good for 30 days.  So now this is the deal.  You should go to gazelle.com now if you're thinking of getting rid of your old phone,  your iPhone or your Samsung phone.  Or they take HTC, Blackberry, LG, Motorola, and Nokia.  Let's say you want the new Windows phone.  This is your chance to move on.  Get the quote now because as soon as the new phone comes out, the value is going to go  down.  This is one thing we know for sure.  Value never goes up on these things.  They only get worth less and less.  But this quote is good for 30 days.  So get it now and you'll get your money.  You can get a cash check, PayPal, or, and I recommend you do this, an Amazon gift card  because they'll bump it up 5%.  They'll kind of rebate you their Amazon affiliate code.  So 5% more when you get an Amazon gift card.  These guys are good people.  Really great.  They have sold, let me just see.  I have the number here somewhere.  Over the last few years.  Oh shoot.  What did I do with it?  I put it here somewhere.  300,000 customers, $50 million.  $50 million they've paid out.  Hello.  Yeah, hello is right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  But then Diller bought it, you know.  It's like they have a really weird philosophy about what has value and I don't, I mean I  don't know the numbers of About.com.  I think it probably was a good idea.  I like the idea of a directory that you can browse.  Browsing anything is going away with the internet.  You know, just browsing an encyclopedia, browsing a dictionary and About.com had a little bit  of a browse concept to it.  I don't know if it's really worth $300 million and maybe it's just his early ploy  into buying the New York Times itself.  I mean that could be his endgame.

Start time: 5632.94
End time: 5653.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the reasons that Times is interested is he's apparently offering cash.  So $300 million cash for About.com.  That's an interesting story.  Diller, is he not the guy behind Aereo?  I think IACO.  Yeah, yeah, the mini antennas.  Yeah, this to me, he could make all that money back end then some with Aereo.  Really interesting.

Start time: 5654.08
End time: 5689.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Aereo is the most hilarious hack I think in technology today.  Because, you know, it's the idea that they've invented some tiny antenna.  They've got a warehouse in Brooklyn full of antennas for people.  It's just like, we've got to do better than this.  I mean, it's a great idea and the product is interesting and it works well and it delivers,  you know, to the end user delivers what you want.  You go to a website, you watch TV, right?  That's what people want.  But they've got to, we've got to adjust like how we regulate television in a way that like  doesn't require a warehouse full of tiny antennas in Brooklyn.  Well, and that's why he won that court case, right?

Start time: 5689.86
End time: 5700.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because he was being sued by the cable and the broadcast channels to say you can't do that.  And the court said, well, of course he can't.  He's just renting an antenna.  It's one antenna per customer.

And if anything, that's probably him just going, I got you.  But I don't think it has any long term values.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love it.  I just there's something about it.  These antennas are about as big as a dime.  I've seen it.  Dr. Ma, and we can't you can only get it in New York City right now.  Which means Nellie's you've seen it.  But Dr. Ma brought her iPad here and she did a little hack to sell her.  She told her iPad.  I'm in New York and I played with it.  The picture quality is excellent.  It has DVR built into it.  And you and what it is, is kind of the last mile for cord cutters because you can be a cord  cutter and watch everything on, you know, your Internet access except for live TV.

Start time: 5770.98
End time: 5830.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's also like just think about how remarkably stupid that is.  Well, I understand.  Yeah, like if you're a cord cutter and you're like the last thing I need is broadcast TV.  I'm going to hope that Barry Diller builds a warehouse full of antennas for me so I can  pay him 12 bucks a month or I can go to Radio Shack and pay $12 for an antenna.  I guess it's like it's just that's a problem.  Like that's I think that we'll see a real.  I think the thing that area will accomplish is not being a successful business.  I think they will ultimately fizzle out because just what they're doing is so silly.  But what they're going to push the whole market towards is a real over-the-top cable service.  Right.  Where this is, I think that's the real thing we need, you know, and that's where you can say to  whatever company I want to watch television on my computer over the Internet and you can buy  channels all a cart all the stuff that people have been wanting to do for years and we'll see  television get really delivered over the Internet.

Start time: 5830.86
End time: 5898.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's something else going on in the and kind of the the crazy antenna Wi-Fi community.  It's very analogous to this people now buying these you have these little Wi-Fi like $25  repeaters that can actually take a USB storage thumb drive and they're setting them up.  You can hack them.  I think this was probably the original software hack was the or the blue boxes the the  routers match the link says the original links is the RTV and the setting of access points.  Yeah, and they're just dropping them in places and you can share files.  There's a little web server that they put on them and now with WDS.  They're starting to connect to each other and creating larger nets 100 megabit per second Wi-Fi  networks that essentially are completely decoupled from the Internet and is kind of an over-the-top type of system.  There's a lot of interesting stuff going on this when it comes to RF and Wi-Fi is actually being built outside of the Internet  with connect with connections to it.  And you know when you talk about little tiny antennas that that is kind of exciting to me.  This is some good stuff going on.

But it's just it's one of those things where it's like because we're so focused on the internet and streaming and distribution,  we often forget that these companies, their real business is running these massive broadcast operations.  Right.  And I think, you know, that's really valuable to a lot of people.  It's funny because what I really want is a DVR that does broadcast.  I can watch live sports and then has a host of Internet services connected to it.  And nobody builds that product.  And I kind of don't know why.  What do you want to pay for it?  I don't want to pay anything.  That's why nobody's building it.  But like, can you imagine what that would be like if you could get a box that runs Netflix,  everything runs Netflix as like Amazon Video, you know, hooks and all these other services and has,  you know, three three tuners so you can record live TV off ABC, NBC and Fox.  You can build that box.

And sports is extremely expensive, not just because of the licensing, because of the entire machine that's behind it.  And, you know, the players in the stadium and the teams, et cetera.  But it's also expensive to produce.  I mean, if everyone really wants to pay their share, which they don't, then it would be possible to do all this with commercials, without commercials.  There's all kinds of hybrid models.  But it really is still too expensive to do.  So what happened?  No, the stuff.

A lot of that is to promote it obviously and television is getting very close to where they can actually just say,  okay, if we have X amount of people paying 199 or 399 that all the effects etc.  Will deliver the entertainment experience people want but he even and he was pretty accurate on the electric car.  And if you look at those documentaries, he says we're still seven to ten years out before we're really there.  It all has to do with processing power or we can do with video etc.  At the end of the day, there's a huge union issue in this industry.  And as I'm not saying it's a bad issue.

I think that people still want a level of quality and you know, there's going to have to be incentive or people just won't go into those industries.  Those should be doing something else.  And of course, there's going to be some YouTube stars, but we've all seen South Park and the you know, the Department of Internet Money, you know,  Where's where's the real money?

But in television, we have a long established history of something called Nielsen ratings and Nielsen ratings is based on a percentage.  It's an it's an agreed to standard essentially.  And we have something similar to that on the Internet.  I would say com score probably comes the closest and these things really aren't representative unless you have a industry wide agreed to standards,  all kinds of competing standards.  And even for for tweet, you probably use pod track or something like that.  If anyone really says they know exactly how many people are watching any medium, they're full of crap.

And, you know, they have named like Web Monopoly and all kinds of obscure brand.  You can't even find them if you're looking for them.  You go and buy traffic, you buy clicks and they may be bots, but they're more and more likely people sitting in Singapore, perhaps India,  clicking away, following a script.  And this is known.

So if people are on there on an iPad or an iPhone or a 27 inch monitor,  it's always going to look great.  You don't have to worry about it.  You don't have to think about it.  It just works beautifully.  Great connections too with all of the major and even some of the minor services  like Facebook, Twitter, Google+, LinkedIn, stumbled upon, Reddit, Twitter, Foursquare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm certainly not believing that number.  And it's a horrible metric for them.  They're trying to get away from this.  They do not want it to be measured by how many people there are.  You always see them moving away from that.  And by the way, the way they calculate what a user means is someone who has  interacted on this monthly user number.  So if you've clicked on a like button, then you count as a user.  There's a whole bunch of tricks.  And they're really trying to get away from that because the bottom line for  them now is money and how their quarter is and more importantly how they can  predict.  You can have less revenue as long as you predict it.  That's what the market always wants.  I ran a public company so I know what this is about.  And again, I think the more users is just more bad news from them because  they have not cracked the code, which is what I keep hearing all the  analysts talk about, is cracking the code of making all of this display  advertising valuable.  And they're trying to come up with the social graph and what are the things  you're connected to so they can know more about you and therefore put a  value on you.  It was funny.  I was watching Mark Zuckerberg and what's her name?  Sandy?  Sheryl Sandberg.  Sheryl Sandberg.  Thank you.  They were at Walmart and it was a company meeting and someone who listened to  No Agenda had actually sent me video of this, which is very verboten in the  Walmart culture and Zuckerberg was on stage talking about his customers.  That was the biggest joke ever.  Yeah, our customers meaning the users.  It's absolutely just not true.  So it's not good.  Peter Thiel selling his stock is very normal.  I mean, this is his business.  His business is to invest early and then at the IPO get out.  He didn't sell all of his holdings, but that's a very normal process and very  expected and I think the market reflected that appropriately didn't drop like a  no like a bombshell.

Even if we say that they don't have a they don't we know they don't have a really  good mobile strategy because they would have rolled it out by now.  We know that they don't have a really good strategy for for monetizing the views,  but they are making revenue.  They are profitable.  So to say that there it's a failed idea.

They finance that leasing amount their cost, you know of pushing.  What is it?  A 10 terabytes a day or that's just for picture sharing.  It's incredible that what their cost is.  I do not think that they are like a product company that sells widgets where actually  all of their cost is less than what they're bringing in.  I don't think they're profitable in that manner.  They have intrinsic value.  They have cash on hand and that if you just look at the numbers that puts them at about  $7-$8 a share that would be their actual value.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's the you know, I think Adam's argument that the numbers is very convincing  but I think Facebook is the internet for a lot of people.  Oh, no, it really is.  I mean like it is that's what they go on the internet to do and there's that they'll be  able to figure out how to extract value from that.  I mean it people go on the internet to look at Facebook interact with their friends and  then they go out from Facebook to the world.

Transcript:  When I worked at AOL I used to hear a lot of grumpy old dudes by the vending machines  say things like Facebook is just us again.  How come people don't give us any credit?  Dude you work at AOL and like I don't I don't know that parading around saying you had this  idea that you were the first Facebook is really going to get you laid in the bar tonight.  You know, you can try.

Transcript:  At the time AOL was absolutely it kicked ass.  It was amazing.  You had the oh you've got mail and it was exciting.  And then what happened is you had this gateway to this internet thing, which is like, oh,  you're outside of the safe zone the safe area.  I remember it all really well.  And we had a lot of services like this when you try to centralize the internet.  It does not work.  The network sees it as a bug routes around it.  Witness Twitter's deal with NBC.

Start time: 7222.88

Start time: 7228.16
End time: 7269.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but the thing but what the internet does prioritize over everything else is data.  Right.  And Facebook is an amazing engine for generating data.  Raw direct data from people and that's where it lives.  So you can route around it that the piece a will never had was people dumping in gigabytes  of information and there's one thing the internet will will work to achieve.  It's getting that information out and I don't think Facebook has as long as Facebook has  that card.  They're going to be in the driver's seat of how they make money because you're not going  to get people leave Facebook and start dumping their photos to share with their entire social  networks that don't exist on Google+.  Like that's not happening yet.  It's maybe that's all fine.

Start time: 7270.40
End time: 7278.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I still don't see a real business model with actual value making more money than you're  spending.  I just don't see the numbers.  I agree.

Start time: 7278.38
End time: 7293.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I completely agree with you on that piece of it because they got to figure it out.  It's kind of important.  It is but I eventually but there's a way the internet is not going to route around being  centralized because that's where the data lives and is this fundamental debate though,

Start time: 7293.68
End time: 7299.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  isn't it?  Will Facebook figure it out or not?  Right.  It comes down to that.  Does it not?

End time: 7366.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  So Leo is clearly making money.  He's figured out the inventory, which is embedded within the programming, which is extremely  valid and works and we've opted for another model, which is value for value.  Like we give everything away.  We have no copyrights, no trademarks.  If you like it, send us some money.  When you talk about we, you mean no agenda, of course.  Yeah, no agenda show.  And we have clearly an outstanding product because people support us enough for us to  just get by on the donations from the program.

Start time: 7366.44

Transcript:  So let me ask you this, Adam, because this is the question I always want to ask.  What would you estimate the value of your personal name and your brand is in raw marketing  cost for the show?  Because if I'm a kid in college and I just start a podcast, it's just as good as your  show.  I won't get the audience, right?

Start time: 7411.24
End time: 7423.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because I think that's a red herring.  I think that's absolutely people don't know me anymore.  I'm going to be 48 in in two weeks.  You think that people still people walking around and remember you from headbangers  ball.

Start time: 7425.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I do value from coming out this week at Tech.  This is where people say, oh, this guy's nuts or DeVore acts a grouch.  What he's doing a show over there.  Let me go check it out.  I just say 80% of our initial audience came from this show.

Start time: 7441.73
End time: 7455.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure.  No, I was literally asking me you estimated zero.  I think that's fair.  But I you know, I I'm wondering how you know that model of we're going to give it away  or give everything away and people can just pay us if they like it.  There's not a lot of certain that's different.

Start time: 7455.04
End time: 7525.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  It's not exactly the same.  It's we're providing a product and we ask people the question.  Did you obtain value from this and what do you think the value is that's different from  we're giving it away and send us something if you like it.  We're asking that question specifically and we do provide some very set pieces like  mentioning thanking people for their donations on each episode making people executive  producers or associate executive producers.  It is a model that I think will work for for other products that are out there on the  internet.  It's not the only one.  But for sure for sure display advertising is not the way to go embedding the commercial  message, which was the original idea behind podcasting the original idea people out there  still remember if I burped that that's the sensei.  Oh machine.  That's right.  Right.  The original idea was embed the commercials in the programming and you can even with a  small audience make enough money to get by.  I'm not saying that that we're going to see the day the days of big companies making  hundreds of billions of dollars, but maybe that's just not the future in general.

Start time: 7525.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But to kind of bring it back to where's the money being made there are most definitely  models, but we still have a lot of breaking to do.  We've seen the print model is completely obliterated and I think I know nothing about the  verge.  I don't know if you're making money if you're profitable.  I have no idea whatsoever, but I don't know if this type of display advertising is viable  long-term.  I really question that and unfortunately with written content.  It's very very complicated.

End time: 7712.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about where the value is coming from right for Neelai his organization creates great  content.  That's where the value comes from for Facebook.  It's the fact that their users are willing to to dump in all this data, which can then  be sold to advertisers.  That's where the value comes from for Adam.  It's the fact that he's willing to do this wonderful just I don't even know what to  call it orgy of weird things and people are willing to give money for it.  That's what the value comes from.

Start time: 7715.06
End time: 7786.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All I'm saying is yes, of course, there's value.  There's money.  I just don't think that the business is based on display advertising have a viable long  term future is Facebook making money.  Yeah, well, they make a lot of money moving forward.  Maybe not.  How will this work?  You know this exact same model with editorial sites like the verge.  I don't know.  I mean, but I don't I'm just my opinion.  I don't think it has a long term viable future think something is going to have to  change.  We see how Kickstarter has changed what people think about products.  They want to be in control.  They're more than willing and Leo you're a big fan of this.  Here's 50 bucks go make the product and I'll buy the product for $300 from you.  That's the future.  That's where it's going.  People want to be in control of the products.  They're consuming and they will pay for it.  We just have to figure out, you know, what is the ultimate amount that people are going  to pay if you took away if you look at the cable cutters 200 $200 a month is probably  a little bit above average, but it's somewhere between 100 and $200 that people are paying  for entertainment man.  That's a lot of shows you can get for $199 an episode once those costs are in line with  the amount of people who are willing to pay for that.

Start time: 7786.92
End time: 7804.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Facebook isn't entirely visual advertising.  I mean a lot of the Facebook business models the fact that you can build social advertising  and get enough people trouble for that and they keep getting in trouble for it.  But that's why they keep doing it because they know that's that's something that no  one else has.  If I can get enough friends to like my product, you'll like my product.

Start time: 7806.04
End time: 7809.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't you think we're going to end this anyway, we're almost at a time, but I got to show  my gun and it's a great and it's a great topic and which I would love to go into but  don't you think that it is possible that it really what really matters is the engagement  of the audience the commitment of the audience and whether it's display advertising or selling  producerships if you have an engaged audience if you have an audience that loves the verge  or loves no agenda show that they will make it work somehow.  I mean they click on display ads because they want to support the verge.  I mean, I do think that that's not great for the advertiser.

Start time: 7840.94
End time: 7844.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  They people buy products because they like the verge they go.  Okay, if Ford is associated with the verge I like Ford because I love the verge.  I do think that there is some value in that.  I understand what you're saying that display ads there is a model that's brought over that

Start time: 7859.14
End time: 7869.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  doesn't it's a part of an overall strategy Leo the Ford doesn't only advertise on no  twit, you know, no enhancement and it's a part of their overall package to reaching

Start time: 7869.98
End time: 7897.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a very specific audience precisely and it's tied very much to how that audience feels  about the product they're consuming whether it's Twitter the verge and that's important  and that's a way of maybe that makes display ads more valuable than just a display ad.  We're not we're no longer talking to magazine with a full-page ad for Macy's in it.  There's something else going on here and you're you're brilliant at exploiting that.  I mean no agenda show clearly shows how valuable and engaged audiences and I don't know how

Start time: 7897.94
