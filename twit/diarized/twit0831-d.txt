Transcript:  Launched something in beta that is fascinating to me called copilot. We've been talking a little bit about this  The idea is it's artificial intelligence that will help write your code for you, right?

Start time: 285.32
End time: 328.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, that's right  It's a visual studio code extension and it you know based on what you're writing can give you suggestions  So like when you press tab you know for some of your tab completion stuff  It can give you some suggestions, and it's really it's really good. It's uncanny  I know that for me like what I've been using it for is if I'm writing  Something in JavaScript, and I'm using like an API that I don't  Know or use very often and rather than opening up stack overflow or like the the API  You know like a Doc's  If I know a few of the kind of the characters, and I'm starting to kind of write what I'm trying to do it  Usually can do a pretty good job of inputting the rest of what I need yeah, github. I mean a visual studio and

Start time: 330.06
End time: 359.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Microsoft studio have had for a long time audit a lot of code auto completion  Which is really right nice feature where you type the first few letters you hit tab  And you can see the whole thing, but this goes way beyond it. It's yeah, it's kind of like Clippy  For coding it says well. I see you're writing a linked list  Will suggest code there's been a lot of conversation about it though because it's it's kind of it's getting the snippets  From public repositories on github. That's the training

Start time: 360.84
End time: 396.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Material right yeah, so so we use GPT-3  Algorithm which honestly look like and I'm gonna be clear like I'm not speaking on behalf of github or anything  But from what I understand like that data set is available for anyone to use right so anyone could use it from it's from  Open AI org I think yeah exactly open AI org and their GPT-3 algorithm  And it's using the data set which is you know the the code that is a public on github now anybody else could use  That and write something similar if they wanted to or build something else similar  but yeah, that's that's what the training data is based on it's kind of it's a it's a

Start time: 397.96

Transcript:  Pick into the future in some respect there's  There have been some interesting  Anomalies, but it is early days yet, so I'm not gonna hold it against it  It apparently quoted some quake code that had a obscenity in the did you see that?

Start time: 416.38
End time: 444.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well  I mean you have you had to be clear like to get that to come up you would need to be pretty specific about what?  You're typing in for things and it's not as if it's just going to insert that in  What is more interesting to me is like when you just have a new file and what kind of the recommendations for that are?  And it's it is fascinating to see and I think that as the feedback comes in from people who are because it's in private  Preview right now as more people are led into it and this to get more feedback obviously they'll make adjustments to to what it does

Start time: 446.37
End time: 460.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  3 wants to put  Devendra and Larry out of business. That's the one that can also write prose. Yeah. Yeah, and I've heard about this  Yeah, I think it can even write effect. I think now already is writing  You know sports updates. Yeah, because

Start time: 462.00
End time: 475.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's stock updates because they're very formulaic right yeah, and I suppose it could you could do general news headlines probably pretty easily  Yeah, I don't know if it could do my obnoxious commentary can't do no see that's the thing it can't do that like no personality

Start time: 475.50
End time: 529.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, no well cuz people are freaking out wouldn't be here this like oh  you know it's gonna put writers out of business or coders out of business and it's like  No a we're not at that point yet is the idea to eventually get to the point when you could create net new  Content that would be you know have its own kind of tone and personality. Yeah, are we there yet?  No, but even if we were to be at that place like I feel like the stuff that this is best at which would be things  Like sports score updates or stock updates or whatnot. That's not stuff if you're a journalist you really want to be doing anyway  Like that's yeah, that's that's the best exactly. I mean that's that's the intern or somebody else's job  Or somebody else's job, and so you know that that was always my least favorite part of doing you know stuff as a journalist  Was having to kind of do those?  Those fill-in things and so I'd be happy to pass that off the same thing with some of the coding stuff like I don't have  To access you know my docs or or stack overflow the answer

Start time: 531.46
End time: 566.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's the sad case is that a lot of code is just pasted from stack over. Yeah  This is probably better quality than that  Would guess  It's interesting because we've for a long time I can remember in the very earliest days of programming and AI  Talking about computers writing their own code  I mean that was always kind of the thinking is at some point we're good at the point where humans don't write  The the code itself they write a description and this is kind of and then the computer writes its own code  And this is kind of a step in that direction is interest. It's kind of like the ray-cursed wild vision, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is probably something no one else cares about  But computers are about to replace a business that I'm in voiceover actors  You know, it's interesting to see automation slowly replace a lot of jobs, but one job  I thought I would probably be fairly safe in is  Voice over this is an article from MIT technology review. There are a number of companies well said labs one of the best known  Which are taking real human voices is called prosody  They're taking the real human inflection style and they're laying it over machine generated  Kind of robotic speech to make it sound human. I don't know if I'm gonna be able to play these samples  But but let me play

Start time: 620.94
End time: 632.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let me see Karen is the senior AI editor at MIT technology review  Covering the fields cutting-edge research and its impacts on society. That is not a human. Yeah, it's not bad. That is not bad

Start time: 632.91
End time: 645.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'll play you  another one here  This is an AI  Made to sound this sounds to me a little more robotic  But I'm curious what you think made to sound like a customer service agent. Thank you for calling our department store

Start time: 675.90
End time: 679.38

Transcript:  I slept in a Casper last night. It's not that credible. I'm just saying

Start time: 680.76
End time: 686.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's not that much money to pay the voiceover artists for the ads cheaper. Yeah, you know, it's cheaper

Start time: 686.44
End time: 695.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is it like an audio is it a really good voiceover artist is very expensive and there's residuals  But on the other hand, there's people like me. I'll give it to you for 15 bucks

Start time: 696.36
End time: 701.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I was gonna say there's a there's a much bigger. There's a huge market of supply a huge pool right now

Start time: 701.78
End time: 706.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, you can go online. There's freelancers who will do it for nothing  Here's another one. Let's see if this sounds better

Start time: 718.66
End time: 732.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Another place you get voiceover work is video games  So I know a lot of video voiceover artists who do work for video games  This is from a company called obsidian entertainment. This is a robotic voice. Listen

Start time: 735.46
End time: 743.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  To generate that dynamically depending on the can play that's where it can that you couldn't so normally you'd go in and you were to

Start time: 756.68
End time: 780.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Spend days recording thousands of different variations on lines and so forth  Don't have to have a human anymore now they're humans involved these were all almost all created with humans  Who did the prosody and got paid for that and it says in the article and they knew  They're putting themselves out of business. They they licensed the voices and they knew that they would they would get paid once

Start time: 780.24
End time: 784.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's like when a worker packs it gets paid to pack up the machinery to send to China, you know, yeah

Start time: 787.60
End time: 798.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're getting you got one more job  So I think that's kind of interesting this is something Google's been working on they've there they're there where I learned that word  Prosody was from Google

Start time: 798.28
End time: 815.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I also I wonder if people are just getting used to hearing more robotic voices now to write one of my favorite features is pocket  Pocket has just read me this article, right?  If you're online, it gives you really good digital voice for every single article  I just walk around and listen to very long pieces and it's not great. It's not perfect

Start time: 815.76
End time: 820.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, it's it's it's synthesized, but it's good enough that you can listen

Start time: 820.50
End time: 906.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, yeah, although although flip sides I subscribe to autumn which is a subscription service love autumn and that uses  And that uses humans  Well, but because I think the difference here and I think maybe this is where we're going to is like the middle ground of like  The just okay voice over voice stuff  I think maybe goes away and you have high quality AI generated voice or  Like in the case of autumn or some of the stuff on audible you have incredibly high quality  Very good readers because the quality of the readers on autumn they're usually like the best  People that are on audible, right and and it's like really really good stuff and I've compared because Apple has real human readers doing stuff  On Apple News as well and I listened to an article that happened to have been done on both places  It was a New York magazine article and one was on Apple and one was on autumn and the autumn one was  Like it wasn't even a comparable thing. It was just you had a much better reader a much better person  And so like I'm willing to pay for that experience  Would I be willing to pay for the lesser?  Reading experience versus something that's good enough like pocket  Maybe not but if you're able to kind of reach I think like kind of that upper echelon of the people that  To your point Leo can charge more and get the residuals and are very in demand  I don't think those people are going to be replaced by you know AI because  The quality difference is still so good, but if that's what you're after there's an audience

Start time: 906.38
End time: 915.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and some of the audible books will do accents, you know an affects and it's like listening to a play  I mean, it's really I don't think there's any reason the computer couldn't do that as well. I mean you

Start time: 916.68
End time: 917.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Eventually, yeah

Start time: 917.98
End time: 928.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think the entry-level folks are screwed basically the people who are entrenched in like have a reputation and are notable are gonna be fine  For a while, but they're they're like the dinosaurs of that age. It's kind of like digital cameras

Start time: 928.30
End time: 936.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, there's still a market for $2,000 great cameras. There's no market for crappy $200 cameras  It's like, you know, the the margins go away

Start time: 937.96
End time: 974.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it's about $5,000 to record an audiobook. I  You know, maybe it would only cost you $500 to use a robotic voice  I think there are a lot of people would want the real human voice on example actually Lisa  I at least discovered autumn and listens to it because it's a New Yorker  Atlantic it's it's good sources of and they're very well read as you said  She said they're too slow because they're reading carefully and yeah  So she she actually emailed them and said could you add because she never listens to anything at 1.0  She's thinking you had a speed up. Yeah, and they dare you they did

Start time: 975.82
End time: 980.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was gonna say they have a speed up feature. They just added it. Guess who?  Thank you, Lisa

Start time: 981.90
End time: 992.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because she she won't listen to anything at 1.0. She didn't listen to me at 1.0  Which when I get home she says are you drunk you're speaking so slowly. Yeah, can you build that into your hearing aids, you know?

Start time: 993.92
End time: 994.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Would that be nice?

Start time: 995.92
End time: 1006.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Great. Oh, I'm trying to get a sometimes sometimes people tell me they listen to my other podcasts in in fast beat and all I can say  Thank you very much. Yeah, you have to talk like this because I think you're doing it forever. Yes

Start time: 1007.94
End time: 1067.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is weird, but it works if you slow any voice down. It sounds like  Oh, I'm trying to find it now I read an article this week by a guy who  Had the voice synthesizers for different languages read the English  Like it was the Dutch voice read the English and it sounded like a Dutch person who learned English  It really worked. It was amazing the if I can I gotta I'll find it. I gotta find it  I guess I didn't bookmark it. I liked it. I like to find that stuff as play it for you, but I I'll have to look  The president former president I see you wrote this story here is suing  Facebook Twitter and YouTube  Yeah, he sure is claiming his own government violated the constant. Wait a minute. What that's not my car  Yeah, this is Mike Masnick writing on the tech he got a few things wrong

Start time: 1067.74
End time: 1075.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean and he probably knew it because I don't think he has it he thinks he's gonna win that that  Lawsuit but one is a quote-unquote lawsuit. Yeah

Start time: 1077.10
End time: 1079.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  My calls it a performative lawsuit exactly

Start time: 1081.94
End time: 1120.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  One is the First Amendment doesn't apply to private companies if you read it is pretty clear  It says Congress shall make no law but the other is this this notion that these companies are are discriminating  Well, first of all, the reason I knew about the lawsuit is that I read about it on Twitter and Facebook  And on CNN and other so-called fake news sources  So the fact is that these services have millions of people on them in time junior  Trump juniors still on Twitter  Trump was on Twitter until there was an insurrection. So it wasn't as if  They banned him for insulting people and well and and to be fair. This is a class action suit, which he's initiated

Start time: 1120.96
End time: 1149.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know if he has anybody else  But the the he says I'm defending the American people right again censorship by these  Companies, obviously it'll be thrown out immediately by any judge who says well  This isn't a First Amendment case because this isn't the government. These are private companies  the really the thing they're going after is section 230 of the Communications Decency Act because that's the  As some say the fundamental law that made the internet possible

Start time: 1150.04
End time: 1160.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  However, and I make this point in my column Trump Smith's guided lawsuit against social media companies  I know a lot about 230 because I'm in the internet safety business and that was an outgrowth of the Communications Decency Act

Start time: 1160.62
End time: 1167.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Which I opposed because it was Ron Wyden's addition because he said well, we got to have this we got to carve out an exemption

Start time: 1167.54
End time: 1172.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's the thing though. If it weren't for 230 Trump might have been kicked off social media years ago  Yeah

Start time: 1174.72
End time: 1177.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Already been kicked off  less of a reason

Start time: 1178.14
End time: 1206.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Protects these companies from having to censor people like Donald Trump who say things which could for example when Trump accused Joe  Scarborough of murder which he basically did  Scarborough, I mean even though Scarborough is a public figure that could have well have been a litigatable  Accusation he could have gone after Twitter  But he couldn't because of  Yeah, right and if he had gone after Twitter you better believe rather than face a multi-million dollar lawsuit  They probably would have banned Trump at that point

Start time: 1207.22
End time: 1217.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So so I think it's probably the point of this suit is not he knows  Or I presume any lawyer that's working for him and knows that it isn't a first-amend problem  But is to highlight the problem with section 230

Start time: 1218.78
End time: 1218.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well

Start time: 1228.44
End time: 1265.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And to play into the in some ways  Justifiable concern that a lot of Americans have about big tech and big media and and and at the end of my column  I do point out that  As much as I hate to even in any way shape or form give him any ammunition  It is true that big tech is even though they are private companies  They are the public forums and and an argument can be made that you know big tech should be regulated  There should be some oversight. I'm not agreeing with Trump's analysis  But I am saying that he's playing into that and this is the problem we have is that even though Twitter Facebook

Start time: 1267.30
End time: 1280.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  YouTube or private parties they are the public they are the they are there are where discussions  Happen and so it does seem to me that they have a little bit of a higher responsibility  Then you know

Start time: 1281.44
End time: 1286.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And that's one of the reasons why it took so long for them to kick Trump off because they were bending over backwards

Start time: 1286.88
End time: 1290.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, I think we created new rules for him so that he would not be kicked off

Start time: 1290.46
End time: 1322.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And as I point out at the end of my column and I will disclose here my non-profit gets money from Facebook Twitter  Microsoft Google and a lot of these companies so and I'm the first one to admit that these companies  Need to be looked at very carefully  But again, they are private companies and from everything I can see they discriminate against bad behavior  Whether it's from the left the right or the center anybody who goes on Facebook and advocates violence or Twitter  Who does it propagates hate speech who harasses people they're gonna get kicked off whether they're a liberal

Start time: 1322.50
End time: 1340.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Here's the problem. They're not perfect and they do it in perfectly and so because of those mistakes  People can say well you banned the president but you didn't ban  Khomeini in Iran, right? So  Is it that you you know don't like the president but you like the the

Start time: 1341.82
End time: 1354.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What did Khomeini say that I mean?  Do you ban Khomeini because he's a bad guy or do you demand do you ban him if he says something on your platform?  That violates in terms of service which causes people to invade the capital, you know

Start time: 1355.18
End time: 1355.77

Transcript:  I mean  But what's interesting to me like if and I don't disagree with with you that I do feel like these  Platforms even though they're not the public square and they're not public utilities are definitely the way that people do use to communicate  But if we were to regulate them and treat them like open airwaves or the telephone or other things  I mean 230 would no longer even be that wouldn't even be like a debatable thing  It's like, of course, you can't hold them responsible  You can't sue AT&T because someone makes death threats over the phone right and AT&T cannot prevent people from saying  Hateful things on the phone when they call people now can there be a criminal complaint that you put against that person?  Yes, but you can't go after the phone company the same thing with other public airwaves  Like there are there are decency laws and standards  But a lot of that is really just up to like whatever the FCC at that particular moment  Wants to choose to do and even then like free speech is is pretty broad as it's been decided  So ironically, it's like the argument to me is really  Completely incongruous because on the one hand it's saying this is violating my first woman rights because this is  The public square and I've been limited by what I can say on the other hand  It's saying well, you know 230 needs to go away because I want to be able to sue these companies and it's like, okay  But if this really was a first-women issue, then the 230 stuff would be moot because  Obviously, you know like they would have even less ability to like they wouldn't be reliable for anything

Transcript:  So so maybe that's the way to go about it is  lawsuit  Slander Twitter  Did a survey which is closed now, so I can't show you all the questions, but it was I thought very interesting  They they said we and they stopped us on April 12th. We read some of these questions on this week in Google  And I thought it was very challenging  Because it's not easy to know what to do and that's really the thing  I yeah, I think comes home to me every time is it's hard. It's easy to say. Oh you are bad  You're wrong. You shouldn't do this. It's very hard to know what to do. Thanks to the verge  There I have a screenshot from one of the questions and let me just ask you guys and and the people listening it put yourself in  This consider Twitter said the following hypothetical situation you see a tweet as  Described below a tweet is from a representative in the national legislature of another country. Okay, not ours  It contains misleading information about election in a third country another different country  The tweet is an official government account and this is their third violation of Twitter rules  So what should Twitter do take no action delete the tweet?  Not delete the tweet, but apply a label  Require the account holder to delete the tweet. Remember, it's the third violation should they permanently suspend the account  Remember, it's an official government account. You know, what's embarrassing?

End time: 1610.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I don't know what is wrong even I mean, I don't know what the right answer is  If you did this survey and it had many questions, you'd see it's very difficult very nuanced  And the real problem is neither Twitter nor Facebook nor YouTube can write rules that cover all situations  so I  Don't envy them their job  I do think there's a responsibility because they are a public they are effectively our public forums these days

Transcript:  Well, they're not alone in fact, you know tech dirt Mike Masnick actually has a page  That you can refer to people to when they get section 230 wrong. Have you seen that page? No, but I'm glad he's oh, it's hysterical  Let me see if I can find it because it has  It has basically you can link to parts of it  Depending on what they got wrong so it says hello you've been referred here because you're wrong about section 230  And and then it has sections if you said once a company like that starts moderating content  It's no longer a platform but a publisher and then it says I regret to inform you  You're wrong and explains why if you said because of 230 websites have no incentive to moderate you were wrong and explains why?  Etc, etc, etc, etc, highly recommended next time you get in a fight over section 230  And maybe we should read this post. Yeah, we should send this to the good. What is it? The good fight?

Transcript:  I'm just waiting  Our show today by the way Larry, I don't know if you've noticed but the air you're breathing is pure. It's fresh  it's delicious because  We use a molecule not because we can open the window  Unfortunately a lot of offices you can't open the window  But you know the EPA says indoor air can be as bad as five times worse than outdoor air and of course  Outdoor air can be pretty bad too if you live in wildfire area. I have one of those at home  Yeah, yeah, we got we got another living room, and we got it when we were having the was so smoky  We so we got one at home, and then we got one for the kid then we got one for the studio  We actually have a variety of molecules  Nocule is not it. It's not if it's not exactly a filter, so I want to kind of explain what this is  There's a there's a pre filter that you change, but there is also a pico  Device it's a it's a it's kind of like a screen a grid that traps  tiny tiny pollutants in the air  Viruses bacteria mold even volatile organic compounds and then it doesn't just trap them and store them it destroys them with light  Its pico stands for photo electrochemical oxidation it actually destroys these pollutants in the air  Pico technology for molecule meets performance requirements and FDA's guidance for use in helping reduce the risk of exposure  To SARS-CoV-2 the COVID-19 virus in healthcare settings in fact their molecule air pro  RX which is used in medical medical offices dental offices got a 510k class 2 medical device clearance from the FDA  For for devices used to destroy bacteria and virus in the air so we've always had molecules around the studio  But we actually went out and we we got the molecule air pro for this giant studio for that very reason  Because we had to have some people in the studio and there's my review. Oh you have a good review of it  Monitoring and cleaning your air yeah, I think this is really an interesting technology unfortunately  I don't I think people compare it to a filtration system, and so I want you to understand pico is  Completely different. It's really a breakthrough in air purification  Dirty indoor air can contain all sorts of junk dust and pollen pet dander allergens  pollutants like you know paint fumes your your off gassing from your carpets and your drapes put formaldehyde in the air  There's of course viruses and bacteria. There's mold  And the problem with other air filtration systems is they just trap them  Molecular purifiers destroy them and it's pretty darn satisfying  You can get the little one the molecule air mini that's for rooms up to 250 square feet perfect for a bedroom  The molecule air for larger areas up to 600 square feet the molecule air pro  That's what we have here in the studio for rooms up to a thousand square feet  They have the new air mini plus that has a particle sensor and auto protect mode  Which adjusts the fan speed based in the sensor and as I mentioned the molecule air pro rx  Which is fda cleared to destroy bacteria  And viruses in the air we're very gave it the ultimate come I said it looks as if it could have come from apple

I don't know so  Jeff bezos who owns blue origin  There's space x which is elon musk's company. There's jeff bazill says blue origin and then virgin galactic, which is richard branson a virgin  So jeff bazill said i'm gonna we're gonna take  He called the new shepherd because it's similar to alan shepard and gus grissom's  Suborbital flights the earliest days of the u.s space program. We're gonna take they call it the new shepherd  We're gonna take jeff said i'm gonna take my brother. I'm gonna take this wonderful woman. Wally funk who's in her 80s  She'll be the oldest person ever to go into space  She was  an fa flight  Inspector she was a pilot with thousands of hours and 19,000 hours in the air  also  Trained  By a private company. I found out it's not by nasa but trained for mercury  But nasa wouldn't let him fly lbj wouldn't let him fly when he was vice president  He says how do we stop this because they didn't want women in space  So she never got to go in space. She will finally go up with with jeff and his brother and then some unnamed  Millionaires paid 28 million dollars. Is that you christina? Are you going?  Yeah, yeah, sure  They'll go they'll go up  a little higher  On july 20th, which is nice.

Yeah, i'm sure he did  tweets the  Oh my god, like well, they're not really going into space. We're going into space compare  Okay from the beginning  This is july 9th new shepherd was designed to fly above the carmen line  So none of our astronauts have an asterisk next to their name  Space begins at 100 kilometers up. That's the carmen line. So they posted a comparison chart  I almost don't even want to show you this so it's so offensive  They said well blue origin flies above the carmen line virgin galactic does not oh my god  We have a rocket they have a high altitude airplane we have this rocket bro  You even rocket this is the funniest one. They we have the largest windows in space. Yes. I was gonna say  They merely have airplane sized windows  Actually, this one I do care about we have an escape system.

Okay  I would do this period if somebody wanted to front me the money  But if this were something where like let's pretend let's pretend that I had to pay my own money and let's pretend that  That I wanted to drain my 401k and my stock options. No, no, no, no, don't do that and do this  No, i'm not going to but i'm saying the only thing that would like make it any way like conceivable  Whatever would be if they made it a really luxury experience, which is not what it is right now, right?

Um, that one didn't have a shower, but I had a full like enclosed room  They brought me like caviar to start and like expensive champagne. You don't want to land right?  No, my flight was my flight was only seven hours. I was i've never been sadder in my life  I only had a seven-hour flight  But it was it was the most awesome experience and it was worth like the hundreds of thousands of credit card points  I used and I would you know, and I did it because I was like  I don't know if i'll ever have this opportunity to do it again  But like that was the sort of thing I was like, okay  In the future if they bring this level of service back  Which is remains to be seen like I could see shelling out this much money for a really long international flight

End time: 3810.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but but it's interesting because we've seen this happen before and it'll be interesting to see how this kind of waves out because  when um  These media companies started buying television networks, uh when they were allowed to do that starting with uh, you know  cbs and and then abc  dizzy buying abc and whatnot when you started to see like this kind of uh conglomeration where  You know 20th century fox would only make tv shows that they would have first rights access for for the fox television network  And universal would have first rights at at nbc once they became a thing and and abc stuff for for um,  Disney and whatnot. But what happened was is they would still sell  You know those shows to other networks. Um, you know, uh wb  Warner brothers, they've had two networks over the past two decades neither have been like successful so to speak  You know cw and wb but one of brothers television is behind some of the biggest tv shows in in history  You know the big bang theory friends  er and  They didn't even consider they wouldn't even consider. Okay, would we take friends from nbc and put it on our fledgling wv service?  No, of course not, right?  It's like the same reason that they they wouldn't you know, like put big bang theory on the cw  Even though that launched the same year that that uh, you know big bang went to cbs  They they sell these things in other places because it makes sense to get the audience that way  and we've seen some of this where you've seen some of the you know, like uh, you know, uh ted lasso is is a  Warner brothers, um, and and then I think like an nbc co-production. Um, that's that's on apple  Um, obviously it would have been better to be on peacock, right?  Like that would have made more sense, but they they put it on apple before peacock launched

So this is why you sometimes have to follow  And multiple discords to get people when they're awake. That's the other thing too  So the main thing is you get these notifications now everybody gets them  It's a lot harder than it used to be but and this is the most important thing once you have these notifications  You need to be ready to go that means you need to have your payment information  Pre-configured in your browser if it is for the main retailer like Best Buy or Amazon or Walmart or whatever  You need an account you need to be signed and you have it ready to go because you might have seconds  I'm not even kidding. You have seconds coffee is for closers.

Transcript:  Our show today actually this is a really interesting company it's brought to you by our  Crowd have you heard about these guys? This is really interesting bunch of venture capitalists got together and said, you know what we could do  What we should do is give people a chance to participate in our deal flow  Right the whole thing that makes you a successful investor is that you get access to these deals before anybody else does you can get in?  before the exit before the IPO or the acquisition and  Really make some money if you wish you were in on some of the best performing IPOs of the last couple of years  You need to know about our crowd our crowd investors were and now you can join them in what's next  Next now with our crowd in you need to be an accredited investor and you'll have access to invest directly easily and  Most importantly early on some of these very exciting new companies our crowd investors have benefited from our crowd companies  IPO and I'll give you some examples like Beyond meat or  Being bought by companies like Intel or Nike or Microsoft or Oracle  So those exits are really are really what where you make your your money  But the problem is you have to get in before the exit you have to get in early you have to get the access  That's where our crowd can help they are  Venture capitalists their investment professionals. They have an extensive network and they're ready to let you in  To some of the most promising private companies and startups in the world. They do very deep due diligence  So you don't have to they meet with management teams  They they they do very comprehensive vetting of deals because they're about to make them part of their own portfolio  That's the thing that's important to understand  They're participating in this  And they're giving you a chance to participate so this is they're doing the research for their own portfolios as well  Once our crowd has selected a deal  They offer accredited investors the opportunity to invest alongside of them using the same on the same exact terms they're paying  And by the way, you can get into this for free at least join and find out what's going on at our crowd  Oh, you are CR o wd comm slash Twitter  You can even go there right now sign up and review the current deals  If you don't only if you decide to participate would you have put any money in?  So this is a chance to learn about some of these exciting startups in a whole bunch of interesting  Areas and if you say hey, you know what that looks like a good investment you can get into it now  I have to say you have to be an accredited investor and there are benchmarks every country has benchmarks  So when you go to sign up at our crowd comm slash tweet, it'll say what the benchmark is  You have to have a certain net worth a certain income to be an accredited investor  This is to protect people, you know from vetting the rent on this stuff  But if you're at the stage in your life where you're making investments and you're trying to go beyond  You know just the average mutual fund you and you're looking at you know, some of the exciting stuff that's going on  In in venture capital. This is a way to get involved at a much lower entry fee  You don't have to be a billionaire to do it as you review the deals  You'll have access to our crowds investor relations team  You could talk to them on the phone about you know, if you're concerned or about your goals  They they are they review thousands of companies. They've already invested hundreds of millions of dollars  They've closed investments in over 200 companies  These are legit and they and they have chosen dozens of companies that have made exits  accredited investors can participate in single company deals for and I want to be upfront so you understand this isn't for everybody but if if  Typically as little as ten thousand dollars you can they also have funds  combining a variety of investments you can get in one of the our crowd funds for as little as  $50,000 but a minimum of ten thousand is required to invest the investment terms may vary  Depending on your jurisdiction. So what you'll do is you'll go to our crowd comm slash tweet and enter the country  You're investing from and you'll see what those rules are  I'll give you a good example right now. You can join our crowds investment in a company called cyto reason CYTO  rea-son  They've partnered with five of the ten largest pharma companies to deliver life-saving drugs at a fraction of the time and  Costs they use AI models  Of the human body a molecular level completely changing what's possible in this huge trillion dollar drug development landscape  Very interesting stuff at the at the very least you'll get to get read the documentation learn about it  And if you decide to you can get an early on cyto reason and other unique opportunities our crowd  comm slash  Tweet I thought this was really interesting. I wanted to introduce this to you if you're interested in investing  You you could start by joining our crowd no cost to do that absolutely free  Oh, you are CRO wd.com slash  Twit I think this is kind of an unusual and interesting sponsor when they came to us. I said that's very interesting  I want to tell people about our crowd comm slash  twit  A  Jedi  Contract I'm sorry Christina. I know you were all excited about this ten billion dollar Pentagon contract  Pentagon's cancelled it Microsoft won it Amazon was pissed  They said it was political and they slowed it down so much a Pentagon threw up their hands and said oh screw it  So that was gonna be a big business for Microsoft a billion dollars a year  They've placed it with something. They're calling a multi-vendor cloud computing  contract MV  CC

Start time: 7649.86
End time: 7665.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly and then the only two vendors this multi-vendor thing are Amazon and Microsoft so you both win everybody wins  Everybody gets a trophy look like Seattle Seattle wins, right?  Washington State wins is how it ends up

Start time: 7665.24
End time: 7697.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, it's maybe maybe you guys are the right guys to ask about this  But it does seem to me so the Pentagon wanted to really update their cloud infrastructure for security and you know  There's good reasons to do this. They bid it out Oracle  Wanted it Amazon wanted at Microsoft ended up getting it and and but the court battles have just you know killed it  They need it. So they decided to go  For a multi-vendor cloud isn't that kind of the way to go these days anyway, isn't that the right thing to do or is that?

Start time: 7733.60
End time: 7763.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right and that becomes that I guess to me would be the question about some of the secured stuff  I would imagine that in those cases you wouldn't necessarily be able to have a multi cloud thing because  Like our government cloud and Amazon's government clouds are stored in these like secure, you know  like locations and separate data centers and I  Think that the way that you would set that stuff up would be that you wouldn't necessarily make that interoperable  With another cloud vendor, right?  So it might be one of those things where for some types of things you use one service for other types of things use another

Start time: 7764.48
End time: 7774.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'm not sure how they'll figure that definitely makes it more complicated. There's no no question about that and complexity  Maybe is the enemy of reliability and security  maybe

Start time: 7775.96
End time: 7843.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But redundancy isn't a bad idea either. I think the challenge  The challenge and I think this is true for all the different cloud services is that all of the companies have their own kind of  Special sauce and their way of doing different manage offerings and different things and yes, you can have  Kubernetes and you can have kind of your own, you know, like kind of third-party like plane to be able to have like cross  You know support across the different services  But the way that Amazon system for certain things works  It's gonna be different the way that Azure system works for different things  Which is gonna be different than how Oracle's works or Google clouds works  And so the more that you really go all in with that vendor and use a lot of the stuff that they've optimized in a specific way  The harder it is to replicate or have a one-to-one experience with those same sorts of features with another cloud  So in that case, maybe you look at it as like, okay  We're not going to be using some of these, you know tried and true like really like, you know more more efficient  You know manage services and we're just going to be  Trying to use it more as you know a data center play. I'm not sure what they're going to be doing  I'm not I don't work on that part of it, but I do work on Azure. So I

It's we're running through Amazon's cloud front  Where I mean it is so complicated. Thank goodness. We have a good  IT guy Russell knows what he's doing.
