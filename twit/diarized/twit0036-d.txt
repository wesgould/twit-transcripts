Transcript:  This is TWIT This Week in Tech, episode 36, for January 1, 2006.  Here we are once again, all gathered, well, some of us, well, a couple of us gathered together  for the first show of 2006.  Let me introduce the people at the panel, and just say right up front, Patrick Norton couldn't make it because it's raining too hard.  Kevin Rose couldn't make it because he left his lights on.  But Robert Heron, undaunted by the weather or auto-mechanical difficulties, he's here.  I rely on my Nissan.  How are things going on DLTV? Going well?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Good, busy. We're prepping for CES.  Are you going to do shows down there?  Yeah, we're actually going to stream a live show. I believe that's the current plan anyway.  So we'll be doing that.  It starts in just a couple of days.  When do you go down, Sunday?  Exhausting. Actually, I'm taking off, I think, Wednesday morning.  Oh, you don't have to get down there that early then.  No. The show officially opens on Thursday, so I get down there a day before for some of the pre-events too.  There's actually press events starting Wednesday morning, so I'll be going nonstop till Saturday night and then leave Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A man who is proud to say he actually says it every year. He's not going to CES, but will end up going no doubt.  No, I will not.  John C. Dvorak, dvorak.org slash blog. Why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know, before Comdex folded, I would go to CES about once every five years.  I think it's more fun than Comdex though.  It always has been, but I would go once every five years because you got to see everything.  Nothing really changed that fast at the show.  Now, of course, it's absorbed some of the Comdex stuff, but it's still to me basically CES,  which is a show you have to go to once every five years.  So they're going year after year to this show, which is a miserable show.  It's too big.  It's hard to get around everything.  It's hard to see everything or even see what you want to see.  There's too many side events that keep you busy.  You collect way too many cards, or far too many as it were,  far too many cards that you can never follow up.  Everybody you meet at this show, they say, oh yeah, no, I'll do this, I'll do that.  So you rely on them.  They never follow through.  None of the PR people follow through at the show ever.  And I'm talking about 10 or 15 years ago into this show or 20 even.  They never follow up.  So the whole show is a complete waste of time as far as I'm concerned.  The other thing is nowadays, now I'm boring everyone stiff.  Boy, it's like grumpy.  The other thing about the show is it's over covered.  So what am I doing?  Right.  I like to dig stuff up that people aren't, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can read it online.  I think with the internet, trade shows are a silly thing to begin with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the little ones that don't get a lot of coverage are worth going to  because you find things out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's always been really about meeting, seeing people and socializing, don't you?  That's the part is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There is a social thing involved and Comdex used to fill that bill.  CES doesn't have quite the concentrate.  I mean, they have a lot of techie guys going, especially since the folding of Comdex.  But it doesn't have the intense concentration of techies that Comdex had  where everybody was in the same business.  This thing's a little spread a little thin with way too many car stereo speakers,  chrome rims, strange phones.  I mean, all kinds of weird stuff that, you know, that got nothing to do with me.  Right.  On the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Aren't you glad you asked?  I am so glad.  On the right hand side of the table, the right wing, we call them, of course, Alex Pixel,  Alex Pixel from Lindsay Core.  Alex, Alex Lindsay from the Pixel Core, who can't take off his hat today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I, you know, once you put the hat on, you can't put it on backwards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't wear caps for that very reason.  Okay, put it on, put it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice plane to the camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't know how badly it was raining outside, folks, but it was monsoon.  And we also want to introduce a new member of the panel who's actually been in here behind  the cameras a number of times, Kenji Kato is, is it Kato or Kato?  Sorry, I was thinking Kato, the green hornets.  He is with, among other things, he's a Pixel Core member, but also the Center for  Homeland Defense and Security.  Can you imagine?  The CFHDAS.  I feel safer.  Kenji, good to have you on the Twitter panel today.  Could be a target.  So we'll talk a little bit about the news of the day, but also  towards the end, you could start preparing.  I want to talk a little bit about what's ahead for 2006.  This is our first episode of the new year.  And then what you gave me that you roll your eyes to work.  What's I don't know what's ahead.  No one knows what's out.  You know what I'm reading that I'm really enjoying and you're going to mock me for this.  Ray Kurzweil's new book, the singularity is near.  What singularity?  I'll do a quick synopsis of this, which will probably not be as good as it could be.  It's a long, thick book.  And Ray, you know, Ray, for those who don't know, is an expert in artificial  intelligence.  He's a very smart man, created this synthesizer for Stevie Wonder, speech  systems, speech synthesis systems, recognition systems, and wrote a couple of books on  the age of spiritual machines, the age of intelligent machines, and his new one,  the premise of a number of his books, besides the fact that he doesn't ever want to die.  Which I think taints him a little, a little bit.  But the premise of this book and really of both of his machines books is that there's  a singularity on its way any day now, next couple of decades where machines become as  smart as humans and then start designing themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They have no motivation.  And then no motivation.  Well, we just we tell them to that you can't do what you tell them.  They do what you tell them motivation when somebody slams a hammer into your hand.  You can't do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I was ripping off 20 year old Terminator story with Sky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of like that.  Well, I mean, you know, it's been in science fiction for ages, but he says we're at the  knee of the exponential curve, which now you got to admit the rate of change has increased  considerably.  Did you actually read this thing?  I'm reading it right now.  It's pretty good.  You're actually reading.  It's actually quite entertaining.  You know, I have to.  Well, you and I interviewed Ray when the age of spiritual machines came out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  And big thinkers.  And we tried.  I mean, I used what he calls in his book.  One thing he's done in his book is a whole section on arguments against me.  And he calls he calls my argument the ontological argument, which is that there is something  ineffable that's in a human being that no machine could ever duplicate.  And maybe it's motivation.  Maybe it's spirit or soul.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's also a function called life that's somewhat life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But he says it doesn't matter when these machines are indistinguishable from humans.  But the main thing is once they start designing themselves, these things go very fast.  He says it's just evolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't like the him and the build joy at the bar, you know, back in Aspen, wherever  it was.  And they're talking about how they're both worried sick over robots taking over the world.  And nanomachines turning the earth into a gob of goo because they get out of control.  The gray goo.  And I wrote about this in Forbes some years ago.  And I said, you know, worms have been trying to do this for eons and they've been unsuccessful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're not evolving as fast as nanotech will.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that people vastly.  Artificial, I've worked with a couple people who do a lot of artificial intelligence.  I think they vastly underestimate the human brain.  It strikes me that way.  When it's going to match.  I mean, maybe someday.  But I think this century I would be surprised.  I don't know.  Some of the people I've watched recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Science fiction.  I have no doubt that machines are going to keep catching up.  Yeah.  But I think they take out a good half of the population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, it's already had.  They already have taken out a good half.  But the half they've taken out are secretaries, people who did hand copy.  Gilgamesh.  Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For manufacturing, though, that robots were a must for that industry.  I used to work in manufacturing and it was 10 hours a day to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How smart can these machines be if they work so cheap?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, think about it.  One of the things he says to reassure you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and this actually made me laugh out loud while I'm reading the book.  Maybe that's why I'm reading it because it's humorous.  It says machines will revere us as their biological progenitors.  Or maybe a wheat.  We don't have to worry about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is Kurzweil's wishful thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He wants to be worshipped by someone.  He also talks about wetware integration in the book.  Right.  And that's key.  More and more hardware integration in human beings that will be chipped at some point.  Well, and this is where it's possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'd really like an address book and an image recognition that will tell me  who's name the person that's standing across from me.  All of that.  That would be really nice.  Well, I'd be able to add that in the research labs.  Why?  Because I'm always forgetting.  So what?  So just think it.  I prefer it.  His name is John C. DeVorex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He has three children.  His wife's name means his birthday.  It's been a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's the trick that I always use.  Read one of those.  Because I meet too many people so I can't remember half of them.  I hate to be giving this trick away on the air,  but just between us and it's only a podcast.  You go and you say, hey, how you doing?  I haven't seen you for a long time.  Hey, give me your new card before I forget to ask.  Because everyone always has a new card, right?  Nobody ever has their old card.  And they're all flattered that you asked.  Yeah, because I want to get the card right now.  So they give me the new card.  Good idea.  And I say, oh, that's so-and-so.  I'm using that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When I go with my fiance, the rule is mostly that I'm very good at introducing myself.  Honestly, I'm going to ruin this.  I'm doing the same thing.  I'm very good at introducing myself.  If I don't introduce you, I don't know their name.  And then so she knows to jump.  She just jumps out.  I go, oh, I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I've told my wife that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sometimes if you can slip in, hey, you guys should meet.  Why don't you introduce each other?  Obvious.  Is it?  You think so?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And what happens when the PR guy says, oh, I'm out of cards, John?  Then what do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's the PR guy never says that.  And in fact, I think it's illegal.  Anyway, the thing that's the real one that's a problem, and it happens to me  because I always wear phony badges that don't have my name on them just as a joke.  And people say, hey, how you doing?  The guy recognizes me and he looks down.  Hey, Sally.  And he says, hey, hey, hey, Alice, how you doing?  And he's thinking, I'm trying to get a clue.  Gotcha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gotcha.  You have no idea who I am.  So we'll talk some more about CES in a little bit because it does start this week.  And I don't know, maybe there is something to look forward to.  I'm sure Robert has some TV.  I'm excited.  HDTV stuff.  Have you been to CES before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Many times.  Oh, of course he has.  How can you be excited?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the question.  It's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a challenge.  It's like four days of just nonstop grinding.  And it's an opportunity for me just to meet and greet all the companies that I've  basically cramming about two, three months of meetings into four days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you always feel like crap, though, when you come afterwards?  No.  I just very, very sick every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As soon as I step on that plane to come back, though, I just feel bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just feel that bad that I should have been cleaning my office instead of going around  in Vegas.  Seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So are you going to clean your office this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep.  Yeah, absolutely.  It'll all be clean as a whistle by the end of the week.  I want to see pictures in the blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm just going to find a corner and take a picture.  Any TV developments you're expecting at CES as your rubber?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thin, flat, 1080p.  Those would be the three main things.  But is there any 1080p programming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it going to be 1920 1080p?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, that's what 1080p is.  Yeah, OK.  Well, 1920 by 1080 pixels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you could do it.  You could have a 1080.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could do a worse one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you could do a worse one as long as the 1080p is part of it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's the thing that sets it apart.  The resolution.  I'm talking about physical resolution, though.  It's 1920 by 1080.  That is the format that is 1080p.  Am I missing a joke?  It wouldn't be 16 by 9.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You could make it 1280 by 1080 screwy thing.  Or three.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sorry I brought it up.  Actually, some of the plasma companies are finally catching up with the LCD people in  terms of catching up to that 1080p resolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Most of the plasmas, the resolution is crummy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The 42-inch has been the biggest complaint of mine in the last year in that none of them  are true high-definition devices.  They're all 1024 by 768.  And they up-sample.  Right.  They're just cutting off resolution.  And you actually can see it and measure it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so when is the 1920 1080p plasma coming out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Panasonic announced two already in Japan, a 65-inch, 50-inch.  And they sell for what?  Supposedly that 1080p from Panasonic was coming to the US this year for $10,000.  It's always the number.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Any new TV that's big is always $10,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  At the same resolution is $20,000.  So you're talking if the plasma guys can get that display out.  You're going to buy one?  Half price.  I need any TV.  Why plasma?  Why plasma though?  And I'm single.  I have money.  Well here's the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why a plasma screen instead of a projector?  See I love front projectors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an absolute favorite of all.  I use a projector.  You can blow a thing at the 100-inch.  We're not talking rear projection.  We're talking the front projection.  Rear projection's going to die.  The US is a country not buying rear projection at this point just because we need the big TVs.  And it's the cheapest way to go when you want a huge screen.  But for me, more important than even resolution is the video processing on the back end that  will take your standard definition content.  You're still watching your DVDs, your regular NTSC television.  The Feruja chip or whatever it is.  Is Feruja still the best?  No.  There's a company called Teranex.  They make a processor called the HQV processor.  I hope I got that.  Either it's backwards.  Either the company's HQV, Hollywood quality video.  No, that sounds right.  They have an amazing video processor that's based off of some military signal processing  technology that's now.  But Feruja is bought out.  They don't.  Oh, were they?  They're not even.  They're owned by Tere.  There were so many mergers in that area recently.  But these guys are arguably one of the best chips out there right now.  But the cheapest devices are like $3,500 just for applause.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about just a little tripler or a line doubler that like the Samsung.  Samsung has a 720p DVD player.  It seems to do a really nice job.  Yeah, I use that one.  That's great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I run into more problems with those up converting players.  Either it breaks the 3-2 pull down for converting 24 frame material,  film based material into TV 30 frames per second.  I have a $1,500 Denon upscaling DVD player.  At 720p, it starts screwing up that cadence and causing all sorts of weird artifacts.  But if I move to the 1080i for some reason, most TVs look great.  And it somehow restores that proper 3-2 pull down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's not get too far into this HD discussion.  But what other?  The best.  Well, I know I asked him what was going to be cool at CES.  That's what he says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And we're all very enthusiastic listening to this stuff.  I'm excited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Better video processors, cheaper, flatter, bigger.  That's the big thing.  We're going to see some new players.  Are they going to announce the little?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Isn't there going to be an HD little pod player?  It's not really HD.  It's like 960 by 540.  The iRiver one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  iRiver's going to make an HD portable?  Is it iRiver?  I think iRiver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a company that's working on one that's supposed to be like 960.  It's got a 40 gig drive.  Who wants to watch something that small?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, iRiver already has that DVD resolution,  one that's got a seven inch screen on it with 100 gig hard drive inside for about 7, 800 bucks.  But wow, it looks expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I got like 1280 bytes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you got 720p.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Users have had high def for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the big story of the week, Intel is dropping the Intel inside.  They're changing the logo and the new tagline is,  leap ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leap ahead.  Yeah, you remember that, excuse me, the commercial in 1985 after the 1984.  Oh yeah.  The commercial where they leap the head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was it, off the cliff.  Yeah.  Like lemmings.  That's what Intel's doing.  And you said they're dropping the Pentium too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're going to drop the demonic.  The name.  Right, and then the first thing they're going to do is they're going to switch the Pentium  M name to the Core name.  The Core?  Like the Marine Core?  The C-O-R-E and it's going to be the Core Solo and Core Dual, so it's kind of a reverse of dual Core.  But my thinking is it still has to do with Apple so that Apple can use Apple Core.  Apple Core, yeah.  The Beatles is so-  No, but Apple Beals was C-O-R-P-S, this is C-O-R-E, which is what an Apple Core should be spelled like.  Should be.  So they're going to have that, so it's going to be Apple Core and this is going to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know you're joking, but in fact, I think the fact that Intel's doing this at CES the  week before Macworld is maybe an indicator that they want to do their rebranding now  before Apple comes out with very prominent.  Steve will come out next, Lipsmile.  Oh, and one more thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm really curious to see whether, I think a lot of people have been talking about  this online, but whether Apple's going to do anything that really puts a lot of Intel  branding on the machines.  I think the whole Intel inside thing was not going to happen.  But they might do leap ahead.  But leap ahead may-  They could do leap ahead.  You wonder whether that's somehow connected.  Think different, leap ahead?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Think ahead, leap different?  Apple Core.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The other thing is that Intel's, you know about the Vive?  Vive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, that's the media chipset that they actually are saying Apple will use.  Go on their website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They never mentioned Microsoft and the cool media center that they've got and the Xbox.  There's a feud going on.  And you know, by the way, I have this prediction that when Vive dies,  they're going to bring it back and call it Revive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, that's two.  I'm just marking them down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's actually been a huge bono contention between Intel and Microsoft for a long time,  is that Intel is constantly trying to put added benefits into their chipsets to  differentiate their hardware.  Microsoft wouldn't write to it.  They wouldn't take advantage of it.  It goes back to Andy Grove.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I remember we were setting up for an interview with Andy Grove on,  I don't even know if it was Tech TV.  It might have been the site.  And he went off before the cameras were on on Microsoft.  And they've always been, because they do 64 or 32-bit chips and Microsoft's still doing a 16-bit OS.  They do 64-bit chips.  Microsoft's still doing a 32-bit OS.  I mean, it's always been that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, there's another thing that's not well publicized, but for a long time,  Bill himself held huge shares of AMD.  Oh, interesting.  Yeah, it's a little known fact.  But do we have like a hedge fund, kind of the personal Bill Gates hedge fund?  Well, you know that when AMD had that one special windows only  chip or something, it was all part of that thing.  And I think he's always liked AMD's stuff.  Well, who wouldn't?  What's not to like?  Yeah, that's true.  But generally speaking, I don't think it pleased Intel by any means that he would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fastest desktop PC right now is AMD based.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But I have to say, I mean, from I'm excited about Yona.  I think the dual cores are looking pretty good.  I think that that's going to be most people believe that Intel is

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  two solid years behind AMD in dual core technology and well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but AMD is yet has got to show us if that's the case.  They haven't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Intel has their new Silicon Laser technology, which is what is going to allow them to do  smaller, basically chip sizes.  I mean, they can get down to the smaller nanometer size much quicker with the  Silicon Laser technology.  That gives you a bling processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The problem with that is that, yeah, that sounds good on paper.  But in fact, the entire chip semiconductor business is not one company with one little  technology, but it's the entire industry deciding that they're going to move to whatever, you know,  was why you say that?  Why can't Intel?  Because if you go and go into one of the one of the fabs and you'll see there's like 40  different companies.  Oh, Intel has their own fabs.  No, I'm talking about the fab that has a conveyor belt, the fab that has it to  chop the chip, the fab that burns the chip, the fab that washes it.  Doesn't Intel build its own?  No, no, most of this stuff is from, you know, applied, you know, what's applied materials  and all these about 10 major Japanese companies, Nikon, everybody.  I mean, it's basically all pieced together.  They have one or two proprietary elements on their line.  But for the most part, it's all CMOS stuff that's done by a huge industry of makers.  Intel doesn't build any of that gear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the companies is out of Montana, if I'm not mistaken.  It actually builds the processing lines and the system that actually is used by Intel  and some of the other companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've got one for Kenji Kato, who is working once again for the set.  What do you do for the Center for Homeland Defense?  I'm the Advanced Technology and Media Manager.  That's not that's not a Homeland Defense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, we are what we are is we're a group that actually does a training program basically  for state and local, for firefighters, for governors, for executives who are making  decisions about things from how do you deal with a natural disaster to how do you deal  with a terrorist event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You didn't make the one that Governor Blanco used in Louisiana.  No, no, no.  It's going to be OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, what's funny is that we actually look at like those kind of things in the center  and we have different professors at the Enable graduate schools where we're based.  And we they actually look at different things have gone on and actually try to put together  best policies and practices, which we then teach the students.  It's actually free for all of our students.  They get they can come into the program.  It's free.  They get a laptop, actually an iPod.  So we actually do like podcast.  We do all that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, at least one guy's getting money out of the.  iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting, though, is that these are working professionals.  They're only there for a week and then they go out and they're gone for 10 weeks  and they're back for another week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is the video training material on an iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, we actually do.  Really?  We do video now on iPod.  We do audio books.  We also do a flash based online learning that we've developed and all kinds of things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now we know the government will outsource things like that.  Didn't know this.  The White House had been outsourcing its Internet design, its web page design,  and apparently they're against federal policy because the Clinton administration,  seeing a threat here, made a federal policy that no government agency could use tracking cookies.  But the both White House dot gov and the NSA have been using tracking cookies, web bugs,  you know, those little invisible web and they're going back to web trends.  I guess it's so they can analyze traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and a lot of a lot of the reason that I spy our stuff and spy were products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, we know the government's spying on us now.  The problem is they can do it without a warrant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You really think a tracking cookie really means anything to anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't bother me.  I guess, though, when the NSA is doing it, it makes me a little nervous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I guess maybe I'm over paranoid.  But I think that this whole thing about the NSA, you know,  paying attention to us like it started.  They're acting like it started in 2001.  They've been doing it for the last 40 years.  It's illegal for them to monitor.  Whether it's illegal or not, it's just the assumption that it started in 2001,  I think, is very naive.  I mean, I'm not I'm not sold.  I mean, they've been spying on us for every.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think that it's I don't think it's I think it's the precedent that scares me.  I don't think it's the current.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Maybe for a fact that they decided to do this or it's just part of the software package  they bought that just happened to be built in.  I have like a stat counter program that runs on on my blog, the work dot org slash blog.  And and people somebody was complaining about the fact that my site  drops three cookies on on his because he was monitoring the cookie releases.  Because I have three statistical programs that run on the site.  Look, and I knew that, you know, yeah.  Yeah. So maybe just something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think it is.  In fact, Ari Schwartz, who's the one of the associate directors at the Center for Democracy  Technology, said considering the power to spy on us, the NSA has cookies are not a big deal.  But until Tuesday, the NSA website was creating cookie files on your computer  that didn't expire to 2035 that would allow them to track you around the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They were erasable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, you could erase them.  In fact, that's what happened.  I had to know they were there.  Somebody found them, I think, in a report.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You just erase all your miscellaneous useless cookies anyway.  You can all the spyware stuff.  Yeah, they all do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I do hate cleaning a browser out, though, completely, because if you use a system day  in and day out, it keeps all of your history.  You can go back, you forget an address or something or some site you surfed a week ago.  I hate having to just destroy all that history.  We have students who go through our program.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They like that because they're like, OK, you know, I have to come back online a week later  and I forgot my password.  So they want those sometimes.  And we're like, well, you really want that?  It's a security potential risk.  And they're like, no, we want that.  Makes it nice.  I'm with John on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm more about securing the physical device, like make sure the notebook's password or  the system I log into is password.  But otherwise, once I'm in, I'm not that annoyed about much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I pull a lot of stuff off.  Do you?  Yeah.  When you use this, I have a couple different anti-spyware programs.  One of them just says, a lot of this stuff is just tracking.  It's not like keeping your password and all some cool stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tools for website analysis, how people use it, are pretty amazing.  The stuff we use at work, actually, you can tell what people are clicking on at any given  moment in real time.  All that stuff's logged, though.  And whether they're clicking on the link in text or the picture above it or it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you seen Mint?  I really am liking Mint.  Have you looked at Mint?  No.  Mint?  Yeah, look at Mint.  M-I-N-T?  Yeah, it's a new-  .com?  I don't know what the URL is.  It's a new, relatively expensive statistics program.  It uses PHP and MySQL.  I think it's like 30 bucks.  It's not very expensive.  You should use, instead of these silly bugs that you're using, John, spend 30 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't use them.  I have stuff on the server, too.  Yeah, yeah.  But I like to compare because none of these things give you the same results.  Oh, look at Mint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to love this because what Mint does is it gives you all sorts of real-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A fresh look at your site, haveamint.com.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It smells minty fresh, doesn't it?  I'll check it out.  Yeah.  Big security vulnerability.  Actually, a number of big security vulnerabilities to talk about.  The first one came earlier about a week ago.  Symantec says it has a shared library which it uses on all of its products.  Oops, little bug in it.  So 63 different Symantec products, including all of the antivirus products,  all of the- I mean, just basically everything have this flaw in it.  You'll have to update your Symantec products to make sure.  What is the library it uses?  I think it was a zip library.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't see that story on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just thought I'd throw it in.  See if you can think on your feet.  All right, I'll give you another one.  That one's old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No Symantec software in my system.  Yeah, I don't have any Symantec software.  No antivirus software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But even if, for instance, let's say you uninstalled all that stuff,  you probably would still have live update on there, right?  Because that stays on.  Oh, yeah.  Explicitly.  Well, that also-  Oh, no, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I refuse to install anything from Symantec.  Why?  You can never get rid of it.  I don't like it.  It's not the best in class anymore.  What do you like?  I don't use anything.  I'll be honest with you.  You don't use anything?  No, no.  For antivirus.  I use like Spyware Blaster that basically blacklists a bunch of stuff ahead of time.  Text Internet Explorer.  It configures the browsers and keeps you safe that way.  Otherwise, I'm just pretty careful about what I do.  I use web-based email, so if there's a problem, it's on that end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is the dirty little secret, actually.  A lot of computer wizards and security people don't like to say this,  but they don't use antiviruses.  If you know what you're doing, you don't get a virus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I have a firewall on my router and the software firewall on my computer.  You know, the thing is that I agree with that basically,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  except the thing is that if you do something weird, or if you have kids,  or if you have a wife.  Shared systems.  But besides that, if you accidentally something happens, something weird happens,  and you get the virus and you don't have some antivirus, you got to dig around and maybe you can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's my new favorite, 932.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are there viruses out there that say, like, I'm looking to really buy a network-attached  storage device that I can just take some of the hard drives I have and just stuff them in there,  but are viruses out there that can jump from, say, a PC on that network to that network-attached  device and destroy information?  If there's not...  If it acts as a drive, yeah.  Yeah, it looks like there's another drive.  Yeah, if it's mapped, it doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A lot of viruses are network-aware now.  Just keep it back up, you won't have a problem.  Well, here's a new flaw in Windows.  This is a big zero-day exploit, too, that was discovered just a couple of days ago.  It's in the interpreter for Windows Metaphiles.  Why don't you explain what zero-day is to people out there?  Zero-day means that the exploits appeared pretty much at the same time as the  viruses or the hacks started almost immediately.  It's an instant turnaround.  And we're seeing a lot more of that.  Oftentimes, these exploits are discovered months and months before they go,  and they finally trickle out to the hacker community.  This one, already, there's over a thousand websites using this exploit.  And it affects all copies of Windows.  We talk about it a little bit in security now if you want more detail on it.  But Windows can display these graphics files.  You know, it has the thumbnail view.  It has what's called a Metafile interpreter.  All those thumbnails are metafiles.  A metafile can be put on a website or attached to an email.  It looks like a graphic file.  It looks like a data file.  And the flaw is that Windows says if the metafile is malformed,  then it can provide you with an alternative routine.  So a metafile is basically a vector graphic.  So it's a computer program as it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there are sites out there, literally over a thousand sites.  Panda says one of the most serious vulnerabilities recently detected.  It's all versions of Windows.  Now, the bad news is there's no patch.  The good news is it's a very easy thing to fix  because you just unregister the metafile DLL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you don't have to click on anything.  That's the drawback.  Exactly.  You just go to a page and that's it.  You get an email and it has it in it.  You just view the email.  That's all it takes.  Really?  Whether it's webmail or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a good one.  Hey, my outlook on my Gmail are both configured and not display imagery.  Yeah, that's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should turn off preview page in every email program because that's exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So what kind of exploits are we talking about here  that have been executed in the background?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Toolbar biz dot biz.  You want to try it?  Or a buy toolbar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is the end result to the user?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they install malicious code.  They install arbitrary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's being installed?  What do you mean by malicious code?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  And I think probably what it is is the same stuff that a virus is now installed,  which is spam forwarders.  Symantec has actually had people reporting bot network problems already.  The best thing you could do is put a bot network on there  because then basically you own that computer  and you can have it do anything you want.  So you can install any software.  DOS attacks to whatever.  But bot network, basically what it does is it puts a kind of an IRC server on your computer.  It logs on to an IRC client rather.  It logs on to the hackers IRC server and awaits commands.  Or they can update it remotely.  The machine becomes a stooge.  Interest in things.  That's right.  So this is a pretty big hole.  Microsoft hasn't really responded.  I'm sure they'll do a patch, but the question is, will they wait till patch Tuesday?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I have actually a question related.  Now, have you guys heard the rumors related to Apple being able to run Windows applications  in the new OS X?  Oh, is there a rumor circulating?  It's building.  It's kind of the wine type thing where there's a bunch of patents that came out last year.  Seamless is what I've been begging for.  Windows Seamless.  It's not running virtual PC or anything.  Not dual boot.  It's literally just opening the application in OS X as if it was an OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does that now with X Window.  They learned how to do that with X Windows very early on.  It's called Seamless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That assumes that they have the code that Microsoft uses to make these things work in  the first place.  It's got to be more to it than just talking to the x86 chip.  Well, then Microsoft is giving them a hand?  No.  Why would they?  That's never going to happen.  We might have to buy a copy of Windows still.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  You have to own Windows.  Or it still.  It might be.  Yeah.  You still have to.  You have to.  So here's the issue.  With Wine, do you have to?  Wine?  Yeah.  No, you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wine has an API.  Wine doesn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the problem with that.  So here's the deal.  Or kind of works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  On any new Mac, once they do an Intel chip, you'll be able to dual boot Windows.  I mean, everybody wants to do that.  It's kind of a pain.  Wouldn't it be nice if you're sitting there, you're running OS X, you double click a Windows  application and it opens.  There's a little window there.  They did it with OS 9.  They did it with X Window.  I don't see any reason why they couldn't do it with Microsoft Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, OS 9 runs actually in the background.  You have to, in a sense, boot OS 9 into OS X.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's going to be done that way.  So you'll have a blue box like you might have had a pink box or whatever.  What was the OS 9 box called?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, what was funny is I used to have a virtual PC and you crashed virtual PC and then you just  quit.  That was the nice thing about virtual PC.  You're like, oh, too bad.  But I think what you're asking is would there be that kind of vulnerability?  As these vulnerabilities start, well, they won't be vulnerable.  In the way that the Windows partition is vulnerable, the rest of the machine.  And then you get into this question about whether do you just surf and do all your email  on OS X and then do you use all the Windows applications you want in the Windows environment  and then you don't have to, then you just don't have to deal with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really think that as, and I know that OS X is safer because inherently it's designed  to be safer, but I think once Apple does an Intel, there will be exploits and there will  be people trying to take advantage of this.  And if they do do a seamless window, you'll see people writing all sorts of stuff that's  going to trick you into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, right now with virtual PC it does that.  If you go and you download like an EXE in the Mac OS and you have virtual PC there,  you double click it, it instantly runs virtual PC if you've got it set up that way.  So you have the same thing.  If it's more closely integrated with the OS now, you get that EXE there and it potentially  could take off and run in the background in the Windows partition potentially.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they get the overhead down though for that emulation, that would be nice, I think,  for game developers to be able to quickly port their titles over to the Mac platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, presumably there wouldn't be any porting involved at all.  Why would you want to port?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just run it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, here's the question.  It's good for Apple in some ways, but in some ways it's dangerous because for Apple,  because what a lot of people have been talking about is that it may have PC developers be  less likely to develop a native Mac version because they don't need to.  They just write a Windows version knowing it's going to run on the Mac.  And so then Mac users might get the short end of the stick on some of the stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm not in total agreement with that because people who write for the Mac typically don't  write for the...  It's a specialty.  As a specialist with the Mac environment, you're not going to say,  well, I think I'm going to start writing for Windows because it'd be easier to kill  two birds with one stone.  Most of the people I've seen, and I don't want to offend anybody,  that are Mac developers that started developing for the PC, this stuff sucks.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  From a Mac point of view, it's the vice versa.  The question is, there are some people who port their PC app to the Mac, but it's kind  of a half port.  It sucks.  Well, now they're not going to port is what you're saying.  Who cares?  Who cares?  Who differences are they?  As long as it runs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's plenty of good Mac software.  If it runs, yeah.  Yeah.  Oh, OK.  I just wondered.  I just asked.  I think there's actually some of the stuff on the Mac is better than...  I mean, on both platforms, there's stuff you wish you had on the other platform.  But I have to say, I'm more often looking at stuff that I'm using on the Mac and saying,  I wish it were on the PC, except for audio editing.  Apple has just really dropped the ball on this.  This Soundtrack Pro, just a...  I know you like it, Alex.  Awful program.  And Adobe Audition on Windows is just fantastic.  What's the difference?  Big difference.  One works better.  It doesn't crash, for one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Audition is a nice package.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Soundtrack Pro crashes at an hour and a half into an edit session.  I told you this.  It crashed.  And he's still mad about it.  He's still looking.  Well, it was only last week.  You could have saved.  You could have saved.  That's what Alex...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You can only blame the first five minutes on the computer.  That's what I said.  I don't want to...  I guess I'm spoiled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Doesn't it have all the save built in?  No.  I guess I'm spoiled.  No, it doesn't.  Well, it's crazy.  And the thing crashed silently and everything I had done was gone.  I have to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But Soundtrack Pro is more close to Audition now.  The old Soundtrack was not, but Soundtrack Pro was a lot better.  Your complaint is the stability.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Stability, but there's also some weird...  I guess it's mostly worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I will say that I have found that Soundtrack Pro...  The UI is pretty good.  Soundtrack Pro is less stable on a laptop than it is on the G5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You said that to me, so I tried it.  You crashed it immediately.  What?  No, the Mac doesn't crash.  The Mac doesn't crash.  Yeah, you're all one.  The software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google's Zeke Geist.  I like this.  Every year, Google does this.  What is a Zeke Geist?  What is a Zeke Geist?  What does it mean literally?  I'm only hearing that word for the second.  I don't think I've ever looked at it.  Sure, we can find it out.  That's how you would bring the dictionary.  Yeah, basically that's it, right?  But what's the literal translation?  That's what I'm trying to find out.  I'm going to do F20.  So they do this every year.  It's a lot of fun.  It's at google.com.  It's a press page.  But the top searches, for instance, the top search on...  This baffles me.  And Google News for 2005 was?  Any thoughts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, by the way, Zeke Geist, German term meaning spirit of the time.  Spirit of the time.  Oh, I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's better than worldview.  Yeah.  That would be Weltenschwang.  Ah, absolutely.  Absolutely.  Now, as you mentioned, I get back to my college days.  So the top search in Google News of 2005.  Would you think maybe Iraq or...  Or Brittany?  Or...  You see, you're close.  But it's worse than that.  Those guys are like Madonna.  Janet Jackson.  That's surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We forget that that happened at the beginning of last year.  No, it didn't.  Didn't it?  Yeah, it was last Super Bowl.  It was 2005?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't it the 2005?  No, it was 2004.  Sorry, guys.  It was 2005.  It was Paul McCartney was the last one.  Paul McCartney was 2005.  And it was the toned down one where even if he took his shirt off, nobody would be shocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No one would care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we're still searching for it a year.  Then Hurricane Katrina.  Then tsunami which happened December 26, 2004.  I mean, this is...  Then the Xbox 360.  That must be an up and comer, right?  Brad Pitt, number five on the list.  And the top gainers of 2005.  Now, this actually isn't too much of a surprise.  MySpace.  I find this hard to believe.  You think they're lying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Janet Jackson, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe this is left over from last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm telling you, this doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Number one, search on Frugal, their shopping site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, see, this is the...  No, come on.  This is...  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  MySpace.  Ares.  I don't know why Ares.  What?  A-R-E-S was the top gainer in 2005 for searches.  I must be...  It's something the kids are into.  I don't know.  I don't get it.  Let's see.  You want to look at Ares?  Have you ever looked at MySpace?  Probably.  Yeah.  We talked about that.  Remember?  You saw my page.  You saw my MySpace.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So anyway, I discovered a new one called Yelp.  What is Yelp?  It's at PCMag.com.  You can check it out this week's column.  Yelp is a very...  In fact, I was stunned by it.  It's Y-E-L-P.com for anybody out there.  It's great.  I mean, how did they get that?  I don't know.  They got lucky.  But anyway, what it is is...  Because over the years, I've had two major complaints  about two specific things.  One is public reviews of restaurants.  I think they stink because there's always a bunch of guys  who are shills or people who just hate the restaurant.  So even like the Zagat guy, you don't like the Zagat guy?  No, the Zagat guy's fair.  That's pretty good.  It's heavily edited, by the way, no matter what they tell you.  But I'm not talking about public reviews on the web.  Like opinions kind of stuff.  Yeah, you go in there and say,  this place is the worst restaurant I've ever been to.  It turns out to be the guy across the street  writing a review.  You don't know.  And the other thing that I dislike,  I never really thought much of these social networks.  What Yelp has done is put social networking  and reviewing together.  That's a good idea.  So you have a million reviewers out there,  but you can click on the person  and see what their taste is like based on their other reviews.  So it's almost like reverse engineering,  that computer idea that tells you,  if you like this book, you'll like that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  To me, the reviews on Amazon are absolutely  worth their weight in gold.  That's where, before I'll buy anything,  I won't read Consumer Reports.  I'll read Amazon.  I won't look at PC Magazine.  I'll read Amazon because those reviews  are people using the product,  and they're really right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  I've seen vested interests on Amazon.  Yeah, but you can tell right away.  But this is even better because we don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How do you avoid this?  How do we know this is invested interest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, because when you click on this person,  you can go and see everything they've reviewed,  who their friends are,  and you get a feeling for what this person's like.  You can pretty much reverse engineer this person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's find something we all know.  Maybe a San Francisco restaurant we can see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is mostly San Francisco, it seems to me.  Well, I wouldn't be surprised.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Evite has something like it also now.  You can say Evite Profiles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you don't get the depth.  We've got people on here that are 500 reviews deep.  Here's a review of the Golden Gate Bridge.  Actually, there's 21 reviews of the Golden Gate Bridge.  They review dry cleaners.  It gets five stars.  They review brands of beer.  It's a good bridge.  But they also review a lot of restaurants.  I love that bridge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gourmet G writes,  There is little I can add to the accolades  already bestowed upon it by fellow Yelpers,  though I scoff at those who criticize it  for attracting tourists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, some of the reviewers are a little corny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wait a minute, here's an ode to the bridge.  Hey, stud, how did you get to be so friggin' handsome?  You're not like other bridges with that crazy orange dye job  and your spectacular shoulders.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm telling you.  You know what?  It's entertaining to.  I'm telling you, Yelp is at least as entertaining  as Craigslist.  If you want to just waste time, go on Yelp and look stuff up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let me see some others.  And then after, okay, so I can see what else,  I mean, I like this Kevin S review,  so I can see what else Kevin S has reviewed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, he can read all this stuff.  And if he agrees with you and a lot of things,  you can say when he discovers a new restaurant or bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kevin's got good taste.  This is basically replacing friendship.  Exactly, yeah, no, because we do not want to,  you have to be with anyone.  Replacing friendship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's all, I wonder what is friendship?  Don't go there.  Who needs friendship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, nevermind.  Kevin S.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It used to be Zeitgeist.  Anyway, so you can waste a lot of time on this,  but it's quite fun.  So he's got reviews of Crate and Barrel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As long as he says Amici's pizza is the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He actually reviews.  Actually, there's a little, I ran into him,  he's going through a thing called Little Star pizza.  Have you checked this place?  It's supposed to be better than Zachary's.  Good.  I gotta say, it's all about North Beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The North Beach special.  North Beach is okay.  I think it's good if you're there.  Actually, I'm getting in the place.  Look it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's got a review of San Francisco International Airport.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did he give it one star?  Three.  International Wing Rocks.  That's the new section.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's really nice.  That's probably the best.  The Apple Store in San Francisco.  Ghetto and the rest of the airport.  Oh, no, I'm sorry, Burlingame, two stars.  He didn't like it?  Didn't like it.  Andronico's Market, two stars?  I don't know.  I like Kevin.  I stopped going when they stopped giving me three olives.  He does like the Geminid meteor shower though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think maybe you got the wrong guy here.  This guy's not gonna help you.  I think this is it.  So Yelp, huh?  All right.  Anyway, check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I think that's good.  I think there, you know, social bookmarking, social.  It's hard without Kevin here because he's kind of now one of the leaders of social news sites.  But I never really thought that much of it.  But I think that there's potential there.  I just, it doesn't seem like it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is the interesting combination that I thought was unique because they combined two ideas  that were both weak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Well, there's a Mac world.  I just saw something about like a social networking software that works on Wi-Fi.  So you can put down what you like and then other people on the show floor.  It will show you where they are.  Oh, I like that idea.  So you can go around and find like if you're looking for people or if you're looking for  people that have similar interests, you install the software and it uses the Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would subscribe to Dvorak's RSS feed on the CES show floor.  And then you could, I would see the feed of what, where John is now and you could rate it.  That's what I like.  People following me around in virtual world.  The cloud.  You have to keep on moving.  He's there.  He's there.  Go, go, go.  Somebody else friendship.com.  I know it's.  One of those.  It's just one of them.  I'll just sell them.  So Seagate bought Mac store.  Do we care?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Get rid of, well, not to get rid of Mac store, but Mac store was okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Their last standalone USB drives are quite gorgeous.  So one touch.  Do you like those one?  Well, I never didn't like them initially, but the last one they did just before they  got bought is really a hot looking box.  Thanks to my son walked off with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a Jambo networks.  That's what's a social networking tool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jambo.  I think that's a very interesting use of social network.  That's like real time.  So how's it going to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you have it on a phone or is it like the Japanese dating service or what's I mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It lets a wifi connected users discover each other in proximity.  It is based on a social networking tool.  Absolutely.  Help people find industry peers, customers, friends, enthusiasts with similar interests.  But that's what they do.  You're by Japan, right?  So it's Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I should turn it into some sort of a sex angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Talking to the company.  We have a clean badge on this podcast.  You notice that now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  I haven't gone any further than just use the word by the way.  We are clean.  That's the way to be by the way.  Well, I think, you know, all of a sudden this appeared as one of the tags that you can use.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Used to be explicit or nothing, right?  On the iTunes music store.  And all of a sudden this new tag clean appeared.  And then you want the next tag will be using square.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like it.  I think we should have other tags.  Square, clean, well groomed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Funky.  Funky, bad hat.  Round.  Thanks.  No, I think we could.  I think we could.  Did you notice that this year is going to be one second longer?  Yes.  Yeah.  I've been making lists.  I'm making lists of what I'm doing.  What to do.  That last second.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Steve Martin wrote a hysterical blog entry for Ariana Huffington's website in which he says,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's a conspiracy that the Republicans are all upset about the extra second because the  Democrats are going to use it to hate George Bush for one second more this year.  That would be a new record.  I'm not doing it justice.  I'm not doing it justice, but it's a very funny piece from Steve Martin.  His first is, as far as I know, his first blog.  I don't know if he's going to be a blogger or if that's just a one-off deal, but it's very funny.  Cinema tickets sales slide big time.  It's just a trend.  The third straight year in a row, well since 2002, that's the last year in which there was not a  decline, a total of 12.6% decline in ticket sales.  Well, and it's the lowest attendance since 97 of them.  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I bet you that doesn't apply to Los Angeles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, compared to the Bay Area, it's the lowest attendance since the first year.  I mean, compared to the Bay Area, the theaters in LA were so much better compared to it.  It's like garbage.  You mean the quality.  The quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really, in San Francisco, I mean, I know a lot of people aren't listening there, but San  Francisco, the Vanessa 1000, and the Metronome are pretty much the only places to watch a movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everything else is closed.  The MPAA says it's BitTorrent.  It's all about BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  These guys blame everyone but themselves.  The show for people out there who want to watch, who like to watch insider stuff, which is you  listen to this podcast, is Sunday Morning Shootout.  It's on AMC.  Oh, I like that.  And it has Peter Goober and Peter, the other Peter, who's probably getting mad at me now,  but he's the editor of Variety.  And they sit around, moaning and groaning about the movie industry.  But the thing that Goober keeps pointing out is that the theater experience is deteriorating.  Right.  Where you have to watch commercials before they show the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think, you know, I got to say, I think the commercials is the number one thing.  You just feel like it's 20 minutes.  Sometimes I get in there.  I can't even remember what movie I went and I'm waiting to watch.  It's like a surprise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  20 commercials.  It's unbelievable.  They have the gall to do that.  I think there was a King Kong a couple of days ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was like a five-hour.  They had a three-hour movie and two hours of commercials.  It's like your whole day is shot.  Oh, they had you trapped, though.  They got you.  The advertisers love that environment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know, but I think that's what's causing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I write down the names of the advertisers and then boycott them.  Do it.  That's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I do think, though, that I think that it's that type of thing.  The commercials are making a huge difference.  People think about it like, oh, I'm not going to go to the movie anymore.  I think there's an underlying discomfort that it creates going, oh, I've got to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there's other things.  There's demographics.  There's the aging population.  People are nesting to 911.  Nobody wants to go out anymore.  There's a lot of other things you can say.  When I was living in LA, we had some sweet, sweet theaters.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You could do everything from reserving a specific seat to having drinks served to you.  I'll see that later.  It was just the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  In London, the theater's a lot, yeah.  And some were really hardcore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's not the movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, DVD sales aren't down.  DVD rentals aren't down.  It's not the movies.  It's the experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think it's the experience.  I think it's also, I do think it's also the quality of what we can get at home now  between projectors and plasma screens and everything else.  I look at movies now and I go, I literally think about them.  Is it going to be a big experience?  Is it a King Kong or is it Narnia or is it Lord of the Rings or whatever?  I want to go see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As far as color and dynamic range go, you can do better in your home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  By the way, it's Peter Bart is the other Peter.  Thank you.  The, yeah, in fact, I only go see maybe personally two or three movies.  Well, movies that you know are going to be interesting on a big screen.  And it's too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's too expensive to go to every little movie when I can watch it on a 100 inch screen at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although you wish you could pause King Kong  because it's really two movies jammed together.  I don't know what Jackson didn't want to do another trilogy.  I don't know.  But as soon as they're going to New York, you want to pause.  There was so funny.  There's the island part.  There's the island part.  There's New York part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's two movies.  Right at that break in my theater, I kid you not, 15 people stood up.  Right when they were going back to New York, 15 people stood up, ran out, and then ran back down.  We'll be back tomorrow.  They just needed the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When they stopped the movie, do an intermission like they used to do with big, long movies.  They used to do that.  That's right.  Especially anything over three hours.  Let's all go to the lobby.  It probably go up your thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Let's all go to the lobby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Doesn't make sense to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The best special effects I thought in King Kong.  I mean, obviously, King Kong's amazing.  By the way, Andy Serkis again.  Andy Serkis again.  The guy who did Gollum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Did you hear about what he went through?  Was it a beep suit?  What was he?  He was in a motion capture.  But the interesting thing was, is he really wanted to go to Rwanda, because that's where all the gorillas are.  He wanted to see them.  Peter Jackson thought it was too dangerous to go to Rwanda, so he wouldn't allow him.  He said, we won't pay for it.  We won't send you.  He just used his own money and flew out on his own and went to Rwanda.  He called Jackson from there.  Yeah.  He told him, they went on a life-saving trip.  He went out there and spent a whole bunch of time looking at where, watching the gorillas,  so he could get it accurate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Unlike Gollum, who really is in the movie at human size, so he could actually act with the actors.  Obviously, he couldn't act with the actors when making King Kong, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So he had these big extensions coming off of his arms to replicate the forearms.  Oh, he did.  Yeah, he had extensions so that he'll move correctly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's all motion capture on a stage, and then they then put him in later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just like you, when you remember you used to do that character.  Yeah, Dev Null.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I was in the other room.  Soledad wouldn't let me go within 20 feet of her, so I had to go in the other room.  As good as those special effects are in the battle, of course, with the  Tyrannosaurus, that's pretty cool.  That looked cool.  That's pretty cool.  But I thought the special effect I liked was Times Square in the 30s, which was amazing.  You would like that, because I know you're a fan of old stuff.  It was like seeing what Times Square must have looked like in the 60s.  And there's snow.  30s.  30s, yeah.  Really great matte work.  It was beautifully done.  And that's a matte, right?  Because they had some live action.  It's a digital matte.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So there's probably very little live action stuff.  Maybe the bottoms of a lot of the buildings so they don't have to key everybody.  This will be a DVD.  But outside that, everything is all extended.  Stop frame it.  Well, just to see how they do it.  Generally, when you see those, what they do is they build the first floor,  first to maybe second floor max.  As sets.  As sets, so that you don't have to key everybody against the green.  And then they just extend everything up above it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they had ice and snow.  Now you said the ending.  Who hasn't seen it here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I haven't seen it, but I don't care.  And Robert hasn't seen it.  Surprise ending the monkey.  It turns out to be Bozo the Clown.  You know what's different from the original movie is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  this isn't a spoiler, but she really loves this guy.  I mean, like she like, not just like the ape is not like a puppy dog.  She like loves him in a man-woman fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you're thinking there's a bestiality angle.  It's a little creepy.  Really?  It's a little creepy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then.  That Peter Jackson's like a weird guy.  Well, and then there was the rumor floating around.  The rumors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's into hobbits, man.  The ending is so close to the original film that there was a rumor that he actually had  an alternate ending where she dies and the ape dies with the ape.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what you were looked, it looked like they were going up to that.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the tension, the way it was built, looked like she was going to die.  Oh, it was scary too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the other thing.  The special effects were well done.  The bugs and the heights were really terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to admit, it made me really uncomfortable when they were on top of the Empire straight  building.  It made me feel uncomfortable.  It was so big.  Did you like that vertigo?  Yeah.  It was really well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was very realistic.  So that's one where they should be making some good money on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're doing okay.  I think that thing cost, I saw the estimate on IMDB, it was $207 million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I thought it was closer to three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  With marketing maybe, but I think the $207 million was the production.  But they'll make that back.  They'll make it back.  Especially in DVD.  Here's the thing.  This is what Jackson understands really, really well, what Lucas understands really,  really well, is it is all about the features on the DVD to really turn that thing over.  All of the record setting DVDs are all ones that are feature laden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really?  Just about all of them.  Two disc DVD sets?  For me, it's just full bit rate for the whole movie.  That's what I hate.  It's like the big Lebowski when it was first released.  They put the pan scan and the widescreen format on one side.  Such a video nerd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Who knew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think they ended up buying the 20th or 10th anniversary edition or whatever just to get the full...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All you want is a two hour movie on four discs.  No, one disc, but the full...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think they really do the double disc thing anymore.  You'll love the HD.  You don't need to.  They've got dual layer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You'll love these HDs though.  They're coming.  They're coming in January, right?  Yes.  In fact, you'll see them at CES.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have I heard...  Blue Ray?  I know a couple of things that I will be seeing at CES that I can't really talk about.  What?  John's not going.  It's okay.  You can tell him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No way.  I mean seriously.  Yeah, there's no one listening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just give us a hint.  Nobody's listening.  Can we ask you questions?  Yeah.  20 questions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, basically the PC is going to get a lot closer to TV.  Well, and that's going to happen at CES and that's going to happen at Mac.  Do you think Apple will do a media center?  There's no doubt about it.  It's something good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It sounds like he's trying to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He knows too much.  He's sidetracking us here.  He's signed those NDAs.  We don't do NDAs.  What NDAs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're signing NDAs?  That's a catastrophe.  I put a little clause.  John taught me that right up front.  Never sign anything.  That's what you tell them.  You won't sign them.  They say, well, okay.  I'll tell you anyway.  They do it's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, if you insist.  So, I'll tell you who was making money this year.  It's the online retailers.  Huge jump for Christmas.  It doesn't make sense.  25% increase over 2004 according to a com score.  30% according to Nielsen net ratings because they include auction sites like eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It only takes about 10 minutes in downtown San Francisco to know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's also the selection.  These big stores, whether it's a Macy's or anybody else,  now they use centralized buyers.  There's nothing personalized about the store.  I was ranting about this in some column about how...  The only good thing about centralized buying,  because all these stores used to have their buyers and they'd be local.  They'd buy stuff for the locals and people would go in there and buy cool things.  Now it's all bought.  Everything's out of New York.  The only good news is that if you shop at these big chains in Florida,  you can buy these great expensive wool suits that are perpetually on clearance  because nobody buys...  This is too hot in Florida.  Nobody buys suits in Florida, but the centralized buyers put them in there anyway.  Interesting.  Yeah, I always buy a lot of clothes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is, I think, even maybe a more telling statistic.  Last year, 10% of American households shopped online.  This year, 33%.  I mean, that's a big...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Comfort factor too of using online.  You don't hear people saying, is it safe to shop online?  You don't hear that.  I remember the very first thing I bought.  It was a mouse pad just to see if it would work.  How long ago was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Gosh, I don't think I remember the first thing I bought online.  My first experience was Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just bought one for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Moving four times, I've seen it a couple of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The first...  It showed up from Amazon, I remember, in like 97 or 98 or whatever.  And then I bought like 100 in the next two months.  I think it was probably...  I was just like, oh my gosh, this is so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm actually writing back and forth to the actual person to own the store  because it was a pretty small mom and pop operation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Kenji, do you remember your first online purchase?  Software.  Software.  I was talking about software.  Yeah.  How about you, John?  You don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I buy like frames and...  You buy frames?  Yeah, frames buy...  Yeah, the prices are fantastic.  Glasses frames or picture frames?  No, no, they're picture frames.  Oh, be darned.  Where?  I got the name.  I did a lot of research to find this one frame shop,  but they have the best deals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you send them the stuff to get framed or you just get the frame?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get the pieces and they...  You do your own matting?  They tend to...  No, I have a local guy do matting.  I don't want to do any of that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Interesting.  I find that the only place that I actually go buy stuff is actually the...  Other than clothes, I don't...  I think they probably said that in the article.  That's not the thing that grows in somebody.  Clothes and shoes are not a great thing.  But outside of clothes, I think the only place that I go buy stuff  instead of going online is actually the Apple Store.  Because when I walk into the Apple Store,  the people actually know what they're talking about.  So if I don't know exactly what I want, I'll go in there.  But outside, I find that the Apple Store online is just a pain  because there's too many things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I buy shoes online, but I bought one pair and I sent it back to the fit  and now I know that fit.  And I get great shoes.  I get great shoes from LLB.  Not these.  I'm putting vans online.  30 bucks.  These are made by slaves in China, but they're cheap, but they're good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you know the dirty little secret that eventually is going to break it  loose for the online guys.  And it always cracks me up.  People originally, and they still are somewhat concerned about security.  Oh, I don't want to put my stuff online.  I'd rather call an 800 number.  But if anybody does any marketing, you'll know the first thing you do,  all the 800 number companies nowadays, you cannot even get an account with  one of them to do the work for you unless you have a website.  And when you call the 800 number, they bring up the same web page  that the person would have been doing.  And do it themselves.  And they type into the same exact page.  It goes right over the internet just like anybody else.  It's hilarious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Farmed out to incarcerated people.  And they will not do the idea.  But it's a prisoner doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What I never understand is I feel far more secure.  Well, then dealing with far more security.  Far more secure ordering off the web than giving my credit card to the waiter  at a restaurant.  Rocks off.  That's the thing is that it's way more secure.  I'm much less likely.  That's the thing.  It's just insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just curious if you guys could figure out the top, say, five retailers online this year.  Number one, Amazon.  Number two, don't look.  He's cheating.  eBay.  That makes sense.  Now, this is a surprise.  Brick and mortar Walmart, number three.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They also do a lot of affiliate stuff.  They're very aggressive.  They never want to do another Walmart again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Target.  Target.  That's surprising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, the one thing I love about Walmart.  Best Buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Best Buy.  Yeah, very good.  The Best Buy in Circuit City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thing I actually love, I finally had that experience where you could check out a Walmart  without actually talking to anyone.  It was awesome.  OK.  I was just like, I went into a Walmart.  I had my stuff.  And there's a-  What do you mean without talking to anyone?  There's no checkout person.  I love that.  I was like, I did it all.  I'm not, I just like to be on my own.  I want to do my thing.  I keep looking at that at the grocery store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  South, Georgia especially, but most of the southern states, they have most of the grocery  stores-  Yeah, Pickley Wigley.  Have a whole slew of these like, check yourself out.  I go through this thing and I'm like watching these old ladies.  I'm thinking, I don't know, why don't I just go to the checkout woman and let her do the work?  You know what those are needed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are the home improvement stores like Lowe's and-  They do a lot of that.  Anytime, you need to go in there for one item and it's a four hour experience because there's-  They have the checkout.  I've never seen a busier environment than this home improvement stores.  Those automated checkouts, those situations are just awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For the first time ever, Neiman Marcus and L.L. Bean sold more online than they did from their  catalogs or their phone.  I believe the L.L. Bean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm surprised by the Neiman Marcus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very interesting.  I think this is a big change.  Yeah, it's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, do they still send out the magazines and then people look at that and then go online?  L.L. Bean.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think a lot of people do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I get the catalog, I browse it, but I end up buying online.  It's not like looking at a page in the catalog and then going online.  I browse the catalog, but then I go online without the catalog.  I still end up- I buy a lot of stuff online now, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everything.  Me too, pretty much.  Clothing, a lot of clothing.  I'm this close to going with Safeway.com.  Books for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For my groceries.  My friends keep recommending it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's generally pretty good, but you got to buy at least $50 and a lot of times things will show  up and you'll just get a note that said, it wasn't available so we didn't pack it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, one of the things L.L. Bean did is they have free shipping online and that's one of  the reasons people started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You look like an L.L. Bean guy.  I am an L.L. Bean guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Amazon's done free shipping for a long time on most of their items.  I mean, it takes a while, but-  The old preppy and-  Yeah, they sent it by horseback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was going to say it's the slow stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just want to do a couple more real quick stories because I really do want to get your  predictions for 2006.  The CIO who was backing open documents in Massachusetts-  Post.  Quit.  Yeah.  He quit.  The investigation finally took him down and he said, you know,  which means probably Massachusetts will go back to Microsoft office just like any-  They all come back in the end, don't they?  Sony settled their rootkit class action lawsuit.  I mean, not a big settlement.  You know, you get-  All of them or one of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You can get like seven bucks and some change or you can get like three CD or three  downloadable music albums, something wacky that I'll never-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they claim again that they're recalling all the CDs with this rootkit on it.  They're still there.  Sony stores are still selling them.  So-  That's a collector's item.  Hang on to it.  There's a great, somebody's put it, I'll put a link on the show notes online,  a insert that was in his Coldplay CD of saying, you know, copy protected for your protection.  That was really, it was a plan.  Oh, I have to say, you'd be good for your blog.  I'll send it to you for your, to protect your experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold down that shift key when you're putting those discs in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So 2006 is here.  I know, you know, predictions make no sense, especially in technology.  Did you, do you used to do prediction columns?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I always ridiculed them when I did it myself.  And it's because I always believe that only person that's accurate with these predictions  is someone that has insider information and kind of saying, yeah, I guess what's going to happen  next year.  Everybody does.  I mean, there was no, I mean, the only, I mean, what, it's like, it's-  Better, faster, cheaper.  Yeah. And everything's a trend.  I mean, so, you know, we're going to see more blogs and we're going to see more podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And wasn't it Wired magazine that just quoted you for saying that, as John Dvorak said,  Apple would, was it 18 months and then Apple would switch over to Intel processors.  You predicted that?  Yeah.  And he was off that a couple of months and they were like,  that's one of the top rated predictions of 2005.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's pretty good, John.  How did you know that?  Did you have insider information?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was just logical.  Most predictions, if you do them like that, are logical.  What happened was Markov was telling me about how Steve Jobs kept meeting with the top Intel guys.  And they kept having these meetings and they were cozying up to each other a little too much.  And then Steve gave a speech and one of the Intel CEO or somebody was sitting in the front row.  And it just seemed a little suspicious to me.  And I also felt that it was a smart thing to do because they've been having battles with Motorola.  So I made this prediction, as it were.  And, you know, I was actually off a little bit and I had some concepts that didn't go the way  I was thinking, but, you know, basically they were going to switch.  He's too honest.  Most people would be going, yes, I predicted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's nothing to predict.  Yeah. Any thoughts about what might happen in the 2000s?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it's once again, a trend.  I think that we're going to see the, I think that the battle over online media distribution  will really hit heat by second half of this next year.  I think, you know, between Google, Yahoo, Apple, AOL and Microsoft.  I mean, those are the five big ones.  And I think that they're going to, they're all going to push hard.  I think that I think we're mostly people are going to start to be able to either through Google  or through Apple or Yahoo, especially be able to put their own content up there and charge for it.  And, you know, they'll make 10 bucks on it, you know, 15 bucks here and there.  But the point is, is I think that a lot of them know that that's the, that's the angle.  I think you're going to see this big separation where  as standard definition television is kind of in this evil middle.  Everyone's looking, I mean, when you talk to TV stations, everyone's talking about  everything's going HD and broadband.  So things that belong on broadband, I mean, things, you know, things like talk shows and  things like that stuff, they're looking at broadband.  Things like things that need to look big, they go to HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do have the capability with this new digital signal to do  four or five NTSC signals when they're not doing HD TV.  So that's what our local PBS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they have five sub channels or they have their HD channels on nine one and then nine,  two, three, five for all standard deaf.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And then when it's time for the big HD event, you'd go all, you can use up all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But a lot of them are, I think a lot of stations are looking at SD is kind of a thing of the past  for, for broad all HD.  You know, they're not to this year, but I mean, they're all moving away there.  When you look at their infrastructure, I mean, they're, they're, uh, that makes sense to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think once you start using HD, you don't want to watch SD signals, even on shows like this,  you kind of just get used to higher quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You convert those to a nice progressive format.  That'd be perfect for web distribution.  Then they're not as big or bit heavy.  So you can move those around pretty easily and, you know, what do you see for utilize  that content?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, one of the things I follow closely is IPTV and mainly because it's a worldwide  phenomenon that's not taking place here in this country at all.  In fact, I have this IPTV daily website.  It's interesting because it keeps, you know, real time tabs on who's watching it.  If I go to the site or on the site, you know, like so many people online, it's just like,  there's nothing during the day, but at night when the Europeans are on, man, boom,  the numbers just go skyrocketing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you're talking about, but it's almost like a standard TV model over IP, right?  I mean, that's essentially what it is, but it's like, so they don't have the infrastructure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They use IP.  Yeah, you use IP.  But that's not what we're talking about here.  I think we're talking about broadband, completely new form of distribution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When we talk about broadband, though, I mean, people don't want to, people are going to get  really tired of having to show up at some time to watch anything.  It's a TiVo.  Everything is going to be down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the way I saw it, I guess I've talked about this before.  I'm in Sweden and they're showing me IPTV casually since it's available there.  And they put me in front of a television set on, which is hooked to the internet  at a 30 megabits per second rate.  And they give me a gun and say, here, check it out.  And I'm flipping through it.  I thought I was on cable TV.  I thought I was on Comcast, but it was all HD.  And it was just clicking through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's not a revolution.  That's just a minor infrastructure change.  It's like said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Listen, I don't think the Comcast people would think it's still minor.  Well, they don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But it's like VoIP.  When you call Mexico, you use internet telephony.  Because they're packetizing it instead of a switched network.  But this is, I think, in the States, when we say IPTV, we mean a really much more  drastic change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the idea of being able to download stuff, watch it when we want to, how we want to,  whatever we want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's where IPTV is headed.  Yeah, I definitely agree.  It's what's happening right now with BitTorrent.  The cable guys have been talking about trying to go.  The problem is forward and backward time switching in real time on the cable.  Can't do it.  No, you can do it.  But it's like video on demand stuff, which a little bit chews up a lot of resources.  But the fact is, say you start the Letterman show, and you missed the first 10 minutes.  So you can go back.  You can go back on the cable in real time.  You can do that in Comcast VOD now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can go backwards in time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If the program is provided.  Yeah, I think you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe.  I don't think so.  First of all, you don't watch it on a schedule.  You start playing it.  But you can rewind.  On demand.  The on demand stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but I'm talking about TV, regular TV shows.  On schedule stuff.  Tevo style.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just think the whole concept of schedule is going to go away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we'll see this year somebody come up with a really nice software app that maybe  ties into a distributed database, just so to make it you can select the shows or content.  I should be able to watch last Tuesday's Letterman show on demand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like now.  You should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you can't.  I mean, you can watch the monologue part through iTunes right now.  You can go down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't want to do the iTunes.  I want to watch the whole show, and I want to watch it from last week.  Last Tuesday, I want to watch it now.  That's just it.  That's easy.  We're halfway there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have to admit, the one thing that-  I think we're halfway there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you've got to get CBS to go along with it.  That's the only issue, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, the thing that I have to admit that I've gotten kind of addicted to  buying shows on iTunes.  And the thing is, I got into Surface.  Surface is good.  I tried Surface once.  I tried it once.  First episode.  And I got two.  And then I just bought the rest.  I just went, wha!  I just bought them all.  And so I'm sitting there biking, watching them one after another.  You're riding your bicycle?  No, OK, yeah.  Everyone gets- I stationary bike about an hour and a half a day.  So I have to lose-  I have to lose 20 pounds.  And so I'm not going to work out.  So you have to lose 20 pounds?  I decided I want to.  I just wanted to have good pictures.  What a TV in front of the bicycle.  So anyway, well, here's the worst part.  Here's the thing.  You'll gain it right back.  There is a TV.  There is a TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He wants to fit his wedding gown.  Yeah, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There is a TV on my bike, but I don't want to watch cable.  I want to watch the stuff I want to watch.  And so what happens-  You watch a little screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't you set up some rig with it?  Because it's at the gym.  It's at the gym.  Oh, at the gym.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to kind of money that can have your own gym at home.  Anyway, so the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He doesn't even own a car.  Yeah, you got to get-  Yeah, so-  Chauffeur.  Yeah, exactly.  So I watch my little iPod, though.  And like last night, I started watching Surface, and I go boom, boom, boom, boom.  And suddenly I'm watching like two a day while I'm working out because I do about an hour and a half.  It's a pretty addictive show.  I get to the end, and I go, and then I have to slow back down to broadcast.  I have to wait now every week for the next one to come out.  And then Lost is even worse.  It's been like three or four weeks since they put out another Lost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that this is happening with the TV shows on DVD.  People are-  It's totally conditioning people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We just grabbed a whole series.  My son is a collector of like interesting sitcoms, especially ones that have been killed by Fox,  not to mention like the Serenity Show.  Fox kills all the best shows.  But the best one is Wonderfalls.  They only showed it for four weeks, and there's nine in the can.  There's like 13 or 14 episodes.  It is a terrific show.  See, I don't think people are going to watch network television much longer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're just going to watch the DVDs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We've already started with 24.  We've stopped watching it this year.  We literally watched 24 one-year-offs.  First of all, no one watches commercials.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Once you start watching shows without commercials, it's very hard to go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we still watch Alias in real time, but I put it on the TV device,  and then we plow through it, which has got to be driving these guys crazy.  Best news for podcast advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what I say.  Maybe.  We have a little poll on our site for our listeners to see.  I think that probably what we're going to move in that direction of adding some form of advertising.  Like an underwriting.  Underwriting.  Not- you'll never-  We're not going to be interrupting.  Go away.  We'll be right back after this word from our sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, the future of advertising may be a lot of product placement.  Well, they say it's a lot of-  So I think like if we're just-  Have another Coke, John.  I thought that was pretty tasty.  It was a lot better than Pepsi, Leo.  I don't like Pepsi.  I never liked that.  You know, I like Diet Coke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It just tastes good.  Zero calories.  Have you tried to Coke one yet?  Or zero?  I really like Vanilla Coke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And by the way, that's a much better ad than 20 Super Bowl ads because it makes you want to Coke.  It would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It requires some pretty good writing because I just-  No, not with us.  Well, not-  But broadcast television-  I'll give you an example.  What's watching an episode of Smallville-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll give you an example.  About three weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So Robert Heron's about to buy a TV set, right?  So what TV set are you going to buy?  Well, let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, the minute he names that TV set, that's the best ad ever.  Is it Money No Off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it's only good-  Hear the problem, though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you're going on and prattling on and on about television.  He's established his expertise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's only good for the first couple-  As long as people feel like it's really what he wants to get, it's fine.  I mean, that's the thing.  We're not going to do that anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't really afford, so I'm looking at good value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you can't afford it, maybe if Samson gave us a call and said,  hey, take a look at this.  No, well, maybe not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We'll give you guys 50 grand to run a center.  I mean, I'd really ideally like to have advertisers like Coke that don't conflict with what we talk  about, then there'd be no issue of editorial integrity.  I'm looking for Red Bull or Balls or somebody to come along and say,  and then we'll talk faster.  Yeah, energy drinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We'll talk faster.  You're getting more on your mind this show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, take the poll because we do want to hear your feedback on that.  And we haven't- First of all, somebody asked me, well, has this herald a change?  And it doesn't herald anything because we don't know if anybody's out there buying  advertising yet on podcasts.  I mean, it's just starting right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We know that NPR sold it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  For a lot of money.  Half a million dollars.  Yeah, that's what got Leo jacked up.  That's when I thought, NPR?  Wait a minute.  I don't know what the amount was.  Was it significant enough?  It was something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love listening to NPR.  Do you?  There's something very calming about it.  It's very calming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They do do classes.  And I was thinking of taking classes on how to talk like NPR.  Oh, it's easy.  We could do that.  Like the BBC without the accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Rule number one, don't talk over each other.  Yeah.  Be very thoughtful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it would sound dreadful.  Kind of wry.  I don't think this would be good.  We need life.  You have to list this in the Daniel Shore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like the Gilmore Gang.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, did you want to remind people about the Xeum?  We have a sign up ready to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's publicize the sign up.  Have you checked lately to see if anybody signed up yet?  I can.  Yeah, why don't you see how many spaces?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We haven't really talked about it very much.  So I think that it's been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I might have mentioned it somewhere on my radio shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh.  But what's the deal?  Well, people should go anyway.  Here's the deal.  If it's sold out, you can get on the wait list.  So if it's shorter.  And what we're going to do is we're going to open up the doors.  If you're not there by 630, we start at 7.  If you're not there by 630, then we're going to open the doors.  Will you charge into this?  Why don't we charge five bucks?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We should.  It's costing us money to actually pay for staff at the Xeum.  But we'll just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We'll have a donation box.  Yeah, there you go.  You know, here's the deal.  If you want to give us.  It's like church.  Come on.  Yeah, we'll pass the hat.  We'll pass the hat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why don't we have like a guy with a stick and a box on the end of it?  I love that.  You ever get one that jingles it in front of you?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We'll have one in Oregon and we'll interlude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But if you go to.  It's in the.  It's pixicore.com.  In the events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just go to pixicore.com and click the events on the left.  It's one of the events.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And we'll put you on a waiting list if it's.  So just sign up.  It fills up.  Just sign up and it will tell you that it's sold out if you get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Please don't sign up unless.  You're really coming.  You're really going to be at Mac World Expo January 10th.  That's Tuesday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tuesday.  You should have a formula for overage because there will be an X number.  We have a formula.  We have a formula.  They know how to do that kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  These guys have got it down.  And it's the day of Steve Jobs keynote.  So I presume we have much to talk about.  We're going to get some Apple experts to come by and some other interesting people.  I think I'm out that week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to go into Tahoe.  Oh yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know what we're going to do for CES coverage next week but I think we might do a Skype from CEA  because you're going to be the CES show floor.  Maybe John and I will be home and you and.  I'm going to be cleaning my office.  John will be cleaning his office and we'll get a progress report.  So we'll do that one by Skype and then we'll be live.  I'll be needy.  January 10th.  Have some tidbits.  From the museum.  I want to thank our friends at AOL radio.  This is the one commercial we do.  It's kind of like a commercial.  It's not really.  I'm going to get money for it.  Provide that bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a big thank you.  They rolled a Delta Airlines provided transportation.  It's like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Support for this podcast provided by AOL radio at AOLmusic.com.  I listen so should you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I keep one of their inspo sounds.  How much does that work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's probably worth more than the price of admission.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now they're very kindly provide us with a bandwidth.  Anything else that we need any business that we need to take care of?  I think that's it.  Kenji has been great having you.  Good luck with the Center for Homeland Defense and Security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of my many projects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What else you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I actually have my own company also.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay.  Edge Runner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We do technology consulting and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And of course Alex Lindsay with the Pixel Core.  Thank you for your help and thanks to the Pixel Core folks who provided the video.  How do you like the fact that there's nothing behind us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It compresses well.  Yeah, it really compresses well.  And I really want to thank the Golden Gate Studios.  Golden Gate Productions who provided us with this.  This is such an awesome stage.  Especially in the Bay Area thinking about this kind of work.  It's just such a fantastic.  This has always been a good place to do stuff.  It's a TV station so it's really like, you know, we really have, I mean,  it's not a TV station but we've got great lights and we've gotten great support  and we really appreciate the help that Golden Gate has brought.  Monkey Cam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you manage to get one of the video files down to like something like under 80 megs?  I heard people raving about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Almost the same size as the audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I sat down.  I thought I downloaded the wrong file.  So I sat down.  The black really makes a big difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we expect this one to be pretty small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, this one should be pretty small.  I, well, also I got really aggressive.  I'm going to probably do a tutorial.  Let's go home.  I'm going to start, we're going to start doing tutorials next year.  We're going to start doing tutorials next year that we're going to put up on,  related to Twitter as to like how we're doing different pieces.  But one of the things, so we got into,  I really got into compression.  So I spent a couple hours playing around with it.  What I do is I compress one minute and then multiply it by that.  So I know how big it's going to be and then I play with it and I decide how good it is.  And so I got it all the way down.  And the big thing was just increasing temporal compression.  So anyway, with the black, it works really well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're working for a megabyte a minute.  That's our goal.  That's when we know we've made it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's pretty darn good.  It's not going to happen.  I was going to say.  But even the thing, even the H264, even the big one, the 640 by 480 was,  was, we're not very far from mega minute for the, for the iPod version.  And the H264 was only like 150 megs.  So we've, that's the first one we did was 700.  That's close to mega minute.  It's good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's like the one horsepower per cube centimeter.  That's still looks pretty good.  There are a lot of people who would love to know how that's done.  So I'll put it up.  We're getting there and we will tell the world.  Thank you everybody for being here.  Stay out of the rain.  Happy New Year.  Another twit in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We never got to the predictions.  We tried.  Did you have some predictions?  I had one.  What's your prediction?  Wireless HD for, you know, being able to trend.  You think that will happen at CES?  I hope so.  They've been demonstrating a couple of different proprietary technologies,  but I think doing it over like a G network or super G network.  I think that'd be very cool.  But weren't they doing it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wasn't the bandwidth there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So did LG or somebody do that a couple of years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thing is if they do it digitally, you're going to run into all the VRM.  They'd be so scared of people just using that.  I got this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I say wireless iPod in January.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wireless iPod?  Wireless what?  Wireless to what?  Wi-Fi?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like I can walk into Starbucks and download movies onto my iPod.  I want an iPod A with an FM radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can do that on Audible with audio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just download before you go.  On the phone at home.  You can download.  Right.  Audible's doing that.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I should have paid attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what I'm going to do.  Too much work.  The problem is there's no limit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My server's completely collapsed.  So here's the deal.  I'm just trying to get the thing up, but I have a hell of a time.  What, what, what?  Blue screens.
