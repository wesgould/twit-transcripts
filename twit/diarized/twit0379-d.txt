Transcript:  This is this week in tech.  It is Sunday, November 11th, 2012.  Do not adjust your monitors.  Leo did not become young and  gorgeous. I am merely filling in  for him while he is cruising  around Australia for the next  couple of weeks and somehow Chad  Johnson said, Sarah, do you want  to host twit on one of the  Sundays? And I went, yeah, I  have nothing else to do.  So I thought, all right, well,  if I'm going to host twit, I  really need to have a cool crew  with me. It can't just be me and  you know, some yahoos I find off  the street that know a thing or  two about technology. So I  thought, who are my best buds in  the business? And I thought  immediately of Martin Sargent  and David Prager.

Transcript:  No, first of all, so I thought,  you know, we get a lot of people  who, well, there are a lot of  people who have no idea who any  of us are, but then we have a  lot of people who remember us  all from the screensavers days.  A lot of the twit audience is  the OG Tech TV, ZDTV audience,  and they want to see more of all  of us. And they like the idea of  our unions. I thought, let's try  to do that.  We actually were going to have  Kevin Rose on the show with us  today. And he unfortunately had  to bow out. He had some other  commitments at the last minute.  So lame.  We miss him.  It would have been fun, but  we'll do that another time.  I think the three of us can hold  down the fort.

So I think we should get, before  we get into some of the news,  get folks a little bit up to  speed on what both of you guys  are even doing these days.  Prager, you were on the show  back in July or something like  that. So I mean, coming up on  like six months ago.

Transcript:  Gosh, is it that long ago?  Well, getting there.  Since then, I've been stated  on board with Revision 3 only  as an advisor.  So I'm working on a show with  Glenn that's kind of a spin-off  of Dignation called Toasted  Donut. That's kind of just for  fun.  What's it about?  It's basically, it's about,  that's the thing, is the show  is pretty much anything that we  feel like talking about.  So it's kind of like a  discussion about nothing.  Exactly.  It's kind of like a Seinfeld-ish  thing except more based on  reality.  I love it.  Yeah.  And then I'm about to launch  another show.  It's called Distort, which I  don't think we've said the name  of, which is kind of a high  speed camera, super slow motion  based thing that I'm going to  put out on Revision 3.

Transcript:  So like I've got, you know,  over the course of the past,  you know, seven years working  at Revision 3 and covering not  only technology, but startups.  I kind of fell in love with  entrepreneurship and startups  and got to learn a few things  about it.  So I've had fun getting to know  more and more people that are  also in that community.  And so kind of helping people  where I can and the things that  I'm interested in and feeling  very privileged that some people  are interested in my help and  advice.  Yeah.  And then probably dabbling in a  little bit more video as I try  to work with some of the  startups and getting some of  their, I guess some of the  marketing in a way.  Sorry, for certain startups to  be able to communicate to their  potential users, consumers,  customers, users about what it  is that they do.  So I'm working on building some  relationships, some relationships  with some startup companies in  that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, it's been a while since  the two of us were actually  representing together at Twitter.  And your career has changed  somewhat.  People say, why hasn't Martin do  a lot of video stuff anymore?  What's the deal?  What are you doing?  Yeah.  What are you doing?

Start time: 417.80
End time: 445.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's, I actually have five  television projects in the works.  One on each of the major  networks.  They involve pythons, not  scorpions.  Okay.  No, I'm not doing any of those  things.  I'm actually making a lot of,  trying to make a little bit of  money.  I've been working in advertising.  I'm doing a lot of writings.  Basically, I do art in the  service of capitalism.  It's how I like to look at it.  So you're an ad man.  Otherwise, I'm a shill.  Yeah, I'm an ad man for,  I write stuff for major  corporations that try to make

Start time: 445.60
End time: 448.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 449.38
End time: 456.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems to be working out.  I, you know, I still get fired  a lot in this field, just like  I did in TV.

Start time: 456.24
End time: 458.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that, but everybody gets  fired in advertising, right?

Start time: 458.02
End time: 474.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a lot of turnover in  advertising.  There's a lot.  Most of that is my own fault.  But,  Well, at least you're taking  responsibility.  I'm taking all the responsibility.  I was just involved with a  startup.  I was the only writer.  Startup doesn't exist anymore.  Really?  As your example.  There you go.  Inferno, it was called  self-immolated.

Start time: 474.26
End time: 479.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

End time: 511.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm having an affair with  several women right now.  I'm drunk all day.  Basically, it's a lot like  television.  So,  I've got to get into advertising.  It's a,  yeah, it's basically,  yeah, it's a lot of slinging of  nonsense trying to,  trying to sell stuff.  It's a lot of fun too.  It's a lot of work.  I've never worked so hard as in  advertising.  You work on the weekends.  I work on the weekends.  I'm supposed to be working right  now.  I don't usually do that.  But I appreciate you taking time.  I want to get out of advertising  and I do intend to get right  back here on internet television  and I have some stuff in the works.  Well, you know,  hopefully that'll happen soon.

Start time: 511.14
End time: 524.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The two of us sometimes say,  why don't we do Twif anymore?  We could just do it on our own  and we don't have a very good  reason.  So,  you know,  I don't know if we want to  commit anything right here  and now,  but I don't see why it would be  anything less than fun.

Start time: 525.62

Start time: 529.10

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Should we try to do that?  Let's do that.  Alright, now we've made a commitment.

Start time: 531.94
End time: 606.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright, everybody heard it here.  Okay, so this show,  of course,  is about the week in tech  and what happened.  So last night,  I was sitting at dinner.  It was before dinner.  I was having a drink  and my date said,  well,  did you hear the news?  HTC and Apple have settled.  I was like,  alright,  let's figure it out,  you know,  so here we are on our phones,  reading about this stuff  because that's sort of thing that we do  on a Saturday night.  This is actually really,  it's kind of a big deal.  They have,  they have settled a patent dispute  that began back in 2010.  HTC's 1X EVO 4G LTE devices  had been delayed indefinitely  at US Customs  as a result of an ITC ban.  HTC created a workaround  on the infringing patents.  Then the customs ban was lifted,  but it was sort of a weird  workaround and it looked like  ITC might get involved again.  And as recently as August,  HTC chairwoman Cher Wang said  the company had no plans to settle  its ongoing litigation with Apple  and that was in the wake of Apple's  victory against Samsung,  at least in the US.  HTC said,  no, no,  we're not backing down.  This is,  this is,  we're going to fight this to the end.

Start time: 607.84
End time: 647.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're calling it,  at least in some places,  they're calling it a license agreement.  And so I think,  obviously,  in software patents,  there's kind of like building a war chest.  And I think a lot of people even like  in it to like nuclear warfare  in terms of like,  I've got this many bombs,  I've got this many bombs.  And it's Apple saying,  well, we have this many patents  and HTC saying we have this many patents,  except I believe,  I think that,  you know,  Apple has a few more  and they were able to come at them  with an agreement saying,  look,  we will follow some of these patents  against some of these other patents,  but you still owe us some money  for the licensing,  so that you can go ahead  and use some of the features  that say Samsung is still not allowed to  use at least as far as certain courts  in certain countries  have levied against Samsung  in favor of Apple.

Start time: 647.30
End time: 679.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, HTC a statement,  both companies released  sort of concise terse almost,  a statement saying,  yeah, it's a cross licensing agreement  and we're not going to talk about the details.  That's all confidential.  But HTC said,  the company will not have a material adverse  impact,  the decision anyway,  won't have a material adverse impact  on its financials.  Well, that means it's paying some money,  maybe not a ton,  but at least enough for the company to say,  you know,  we have to pay lawyers to drag this out,  however many more years.  Apple has more money than God,  or at least a lot more money than HTC.

Start time: 680.08
End time: 681.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Regardless of their stock price,  they have 131 billion in cash.

Start time: 682.92
End time: 705.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, exactly.  So Apple can do this forever.  And it doesn't really behoove  either company to keep this going.  I mean, nobody's enjoying this,  except of course lawyers racking up fees,  but it seems to me that  HTC,  it just makes so much more sense  for the company,  it keeps them on track.  I mean, they're trying to get some market  share back from Samsung,  and having a hard time at it.

Start time: 705.74
End time: 714.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The more these,  it feels to me like Apple is just trying to be a bully.  Do you guys agree with me?  Who do you think came out on top of this?  And do you think that they have the right to go after you?

Start time: 716.70
End time: 718.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I absolutely think that Apple is a bully company.

Start time: 718.20
End time: 730.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You think that they're a bully?  Do you think that they have the right to go after this?  Or is it like, you know,  trying to sue Carl Benz  because he invented the automobile  and you know, the Henry Ford started to do his?  You know, it's just like this is technology evolving.  If you start suing people like this.

Start time: 730.86
End time: 791.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I still think it boils down to the fundamental problem  of software patents.  People spend,  companies will spend money in not only securing them,  but purchasing them.  So once you spend money buying someone else's patents,  then you almost put more value,  like when is I going to protect this idea  so that I can chase after someone that's bullying someone  and it happens from,  you know, Apple to Microsoft to Google.  But then when you're,  when you invest money,  like say Google purchased all of these,  was it Motorola?  No.  Yeah.  They purchased,  Motorola Mobility.  They purchased over a billion dollars of the patents.  And so then that money has to have some value.  So they're going to use that not only to build up their defenses  against someone else's patents,  but also, you know,  try to use the laws that are in place to maybe execute  some sort of theoretical unfair advantage.  I only say unfair meaning like it's stifling other companies  from coming up with what I think are a lot of software patents  are obvious ideas.  Like, you know, the whole,  you know, one click purchase was the first one when I was,  you know, pretty young.  How do you patent one click purchase,  which Amazon did,  I think 15 years ago or something like that.  So, I mean,

Start time: 792.80
End time: 814.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's also exactly what Apple was going after HTC for.  It was the same kind of stuff that Apple is going after Samsung for,  but one would argue that some Samsung products really do look  exactly like iPads.  On HTC, not so much.  Apple may have not been as victorious had,  had the patent lawsuits carried out much longer.

Start time: 815.20
End time: 856.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't you,  don't you get kind of excited though?  Aren't you kind of happy when like what just happened over in the UK?  What just happened in the UK?  When the court said that,  sorry Apple,  you got to pay Samsung's legal bills.  This is nonsense.  This is false and misleading.  We're not going to let this stand.  You got to stop doing this.  You're going to have to pay for all that because that's what you have to do in Britain.  If you sue somebody and it doesn't work out,  you got to pay their legal bills.  And that makes you feel happy.  I don't know.  I'm tired of Apple just trying to throw their weight around like this.  I just feel like this is technology trying.  This is the way that things evolve.  All right, you build on things before.  I don't think it's patent infringement.

Start time: 856.92
End time: 865.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's yeah,  that's why a lot of people say that we need patent reform because  because you say this that makes sense,  but that's just not the way the law works right now.  I mean,

Start time: 866.62
End time: 908.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I might sound like a broken record because I think last time I was on Twitter,  we talked about patents,  but I mean,  I think the quickest way to start reforming the whole process is to not award stupid  software patents.  So you can meet like you have to you can maybe you need to honor patents that have been  awarded because of the efforts that went forth into it.  And maybe it's unfair to other companies that didn't spend that but like going forward  from tomorrow forward,  you can stop awarding pointless stupid software patents because they're still being  applied for and still being awarded as far as I know.  I know that there's some changes going on in the US Patent Office to maybe fix that  but it hasn't been thoroughly fixed.  And obviously if you stop awarding stupid software patents,  then you know by the time the old ones run out or they become yesterday's technology,  then you won't have quite the same amount of problem and people can hopefully focus  on innovating.

Start time: 908.14
End time: 913.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just a company out there that just patents things.  That's all I do is patent things and then then they sue people.

Start time: 913.93
End time: 918.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah,  patent trolls.  Is that this is a whole thing?  This is a business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean that just shows you.

Start time: 921.97
End time: 928.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's legal.  That's a thing,  you know,  it's that's why patent reform needs to happen.

Start time: 928.47

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  I think we're all on quorum then.  But I want to give a plug to the show.  So This American Life,  it's a radio show episode 441.  It's all about software patents.  I have of everything that I rant on about is because I listened to this episode and  learned about the problem with software patents.  It's an amazing,  it's an amazing listen.  It's like an hour just about software patents patent trolls and the problem with it.  Yeah,  This American Life 441.  441 is a great show.  I mean they educated me about that the same way as people learned about mortgage default swaps  and the whole problem with the mortgage problem two or three years ago,  which is barely getting ourselves out of that.

Start time: 972.50

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well,  that's you know,  you're picking at him.  No,  it's,  it's if it's a radio show,  I can see.  Our first story.  People tell me they don't like the cadence of my voice either.  Hey,  you mentioned Martin this this thing that happened in the UK.  We should probably explain to anybody who's like,  I don't really know what they're talking about.  No,  it's okay.  No,  it leads us right into this.  Court of Appeal of England and Wales has ordered Apple to pay the legal fees of Samsung on an indemnity  basis after Apple published a false and misleading notice after a patent lawsuit over the iPad.  You might recall that Apple was was was given a judgment to post in newspaper and on on their website.  Basically,  okay,  Samsung didn't infringe on on these patents of ours and Apple did do that.  They were ordered to publish a notice on the front page of the apple.co.uk website after they lost an appeal back in October.  But this so they did but they added some statements that according to the court confused people.  So even though Apple said yes,  these products by Samsung did not infringe on Apple products,  but we want a case like this back in the US and paraphrasing of course,  but it was basically Apple making it seem like they were in the least amount of wrong possible.  The court said it was calculated to produce huge confusion for users and under pressure Apple has now posted a second statement on its website  that says on 25th of October 2012 Apple incorporated published a statement on its UK website in relation to Samsung's Galaxy tablet computers.  That statement was inaccurate and did not comply with the order of the Court of Appeal of England and Wales.  The correct statement is this website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  but they had to apologize at a certain font point.  It was 14 point if I'm not mistaken.  It has to be above the fold.  Yeah, exactly.  Yeah, we were joking on TNT earlier this week.  It's like but they didn't say what color the font had to be.  They could have just written it in white font and then you wouldn't see it.

Transcript:  Well speaking of design though and Apple having to pay stuff another one of the stories that you had in the queue is Apple  basically taking the Swiss rails watch logo or the watch the way the watch looks and incorporating into iOS 6 and not asking  or saying anything about it and then they finally it looks like they agreed to to continue to use it and to pay.  I don't know they paid him 21 million.  Yeah, yeah, 21 million.

Transcript:  Yeah, it's so here.  Here's the story for anybody who hasn't been following this when I was six was unveiled.  We got a nice little clock app.  It's not anything that we had before.  In fact, let's see if I can just pull it up on my phone.  I think Chad pulled it up.  Chad.  Yeah, Chad had it up there.  Well, I guess it's on the iPad though, isn't it?  Yeah, it's on the iPad rather than the iPhone because the phone already had the clock app.  This was something that you never had an alarm or anything on your iPad before.  You've got this really nice beautiful Swiss looking simple clock icon, efficient, elegant, just like Apple.  But it turns out.  Yeah, it was something that Apple basically lifted from the the the Swiss National Rail Operator SBB.  I mean, it's it's it's basically the same thing.  I mean, you can't design you can't.

Transcript:  OK, so that's we talk about one more Apple story.  Of course. I was just on the list of Apple.  I thought it was interesting about it.  So and especially with regard to how much money they have,  the stories about the rumors of Apple slowly moving away from Intel processors.  Yeah, starting to use arm processors and Macs.

Start time: 1345.94
End time: 1351.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Obviously, they're already using them.  Yes, so they have their own for the most part, their own through some also some

Start time: 1351.54
End time: 1396.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  partnerships, but basically they put their own processors into the iPad  and the iPhone and they're thinking about possibly, you know, as the iOS  and the Mac OS start to merge a little bit more in the functionality,  that wouldn't it make a lot of sense to have the back end process  that's going on be seamless so that you can port those capabilities  and functionality across more and more devices, make it save more power  and make it more portable and still able to, you know, process the more intense  things which I think Apple's engineering team and especially with the R&D  and the money they have can kind of go at the capabilities  that Intel's processors provide and try to slowly make it  so that they can put their own processors into the next several generations of MacBook.

Start time: 1396.78
End time: 1408.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which obviously is what Apple would want to do.  The question is, can they? I mean, an arm processor in a new MacBook  is going to be more power efficient, but less powerful,  at least as the technology stands today.

Start time: 1409.70
End time: 1443.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But I think it's kind of obvious though, like if I was at Apple  and I knew that if I can control every element of my environment,  I'd want to do that one. Two, Intel is as far as I can tell,  and they're huge, but they've demonstrated that they're not able to innovate  as fast as everyone else is in the mobile environment.  So I'm sure that they're porting billions in R&D on it  and Apple can port billions into R&D on mobile processing, power consumption,  and the next generation of higher speed processor at lower energy consumption.

Start time: 1443.22
End time: 1445.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what you're saying is this is a good time to buy Intel stock.

Start time: 1447.40
End time: 1464.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, okay, so what does this mean for a company like Intel?  Let's say, you say it's a few years off and that might be true,  but this is a very key time for Intel to figure out how to get into the mobile space in a way  that the company is clearly working on it, but they're late to the game.

Start time: 1465.10

Transcript:  Yeah, you don't want to be Kodak here.

Start time: 1467.44
End time: 1521.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But also, Intel is, as far as I know, again, they're the number one processor manufacturer in the world.  They make the fastest processor, arguably. AMD is out there.  They're the only rival in terms of the absolute fastest, most badass,  aside from the few supercomputers, processor you can get.  And so in order to stay on top of their game,  they need to continue to refine the process of how they make these semiconductors function at the top.  And so I think for a company like Apple, they want, one, to control their environment,  but two, they want to make sure that they can provide the best possible experience for everyone.  And that's the reason they moved away from Motorola.  They said the processors we can get from Intel are faster and they're better.  We want to provide the best and the fastest for our consumers.  And I think as long as Apple maintains that they provide only the best,  then I think they'll continue to provide Intel.  And if they can make something that's better than what Intel does,  that's when they'll switch.  And the other reason for them to switch, of course, is from the business reasons of just controlling it all.

Start time: 1521.60
End time: 1570.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And having the power to do it.  And I know there are folks out there who say,  yeah, but Apple is not the majority of Intel's market.  It's just a tiny little sliver. But it is a tide turning, right?  If Apple can figure it out how to produce something that's better for the consumer internally,  they don't need Intel, well, it's going to make a lot less sense.  And Apple can be thought of as a trailblazer in this market in many ways.  That if Intel isn't needed from Apple, well, there's going to be other companies who are going to figure out,  well, that makes a lot of sense.  And let's figure out our own solutions as well.  Yeah, I like the I like to fantasize about what an actual OS 10 or Mac OS and iOS hybrid would actually be.  Well, I mean, there's so much engineering that I do.  Martin, you laugh, but these are the sorts of things that get me up at 530 a.m.  I like to fantasize fantasizing about a hybrid OS.

Transcript:  Well, imagine, you know, imagine, you know, there's going to be a there's going to be a MacBook Air at some point  where you'll be able to take this lid, flip it around, put it back down.  It's a touch screen that does and that functions and interacts with you the same way.  Oh, that's very Lenovo.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, the thing is, like you want to be able to do everything in your iOS environment the same way as you do in your Mac OS environment.  Because, you know, if I need to be able to do something and I have a device, I want to be able to do it the way I want.  And I think they want to be able to provide it for you to be able to do that way.  But then there's like there's so many things that, you know, about engineering and semiconductors, I don't know about.  But there's so many little nuances like on Mac OS, I can't use Siri because it's the way Siri has been designed doesn't function with the processor the right way.  Right. I don't understand why.  I mean, I have a processor that can do so many calculations per second.  That's as far as in depth as my as I know.  But obviously, there's a lot more about the underlying process and how it happens.  And that's why it's important to be able to get a processor that knows how to interpolate the data of all the programs you're doing, whether it's made for mobile device or not.

Transcript:  We interrupt this tweet for a message from Citrix and go to my PC.  Hello, everybody.  Leo Laporte here.  They asked me to come back from my trip to Australia just to tell you about my favorite remote access solution.  Go to my PC.  I actually started using go to my PC way back when during the screen savers.  We were using it.  We use it from time to time.  If there were if somebody called with a problem, we couldn't fix, you know, by talking them through it.  We'd actually fire up.  It was called expert city back in those days.  We fire it up and we fix it.  It was so cool.  And that's when I got to know the Citrix folks.  And ever since I've been big fans of their stuff, go to my PC gets better and better faster and faster is now Mac or PC.  You can access a Mac.  Well, so the idea is you put it most people would put it on their office computer so they can go home from work early.  They could take a day off.  They can travel.  They take vacation.  You better believe before I left for Australia, I had go to my actually already had it, but I had it on my Mac.  That means I can I can easily get to my Mac.  Now, it's not to fix stuff.  It's because there's stuff on my computer.  I need well, I can use my work email and it looks like it came right from work.  I can access any network resource.  I could send and receive email.  I can run any program.  It's just like I'm there.  And I got to tell you it's wild to run a computer Mac or PC from your iPhone.  Brian Brushwood showed me that's how he does flash and it's iPhone.  He'll use go to my fire.  I'm going to my PC go to his computer in Austin and go to the website there.  Actually, that's kind of a trivial use, but there is a serious purpose for that.  It gives you completely secure access.  So if I'm, you know, in Brisbane at a kind of some sort of shonky kind of coffee house,  I don't know, shady characters everywhere.  I could fire up my iPad or my iPhone or my Android tablet and bring the Nexus 7 or my laptop  and I can log into my office computer.  That's SSL all the way to here, completely secure and then surf out of here.  And I know it's safe here.  So that's a great way to do basically a VPN.  There's lots of ways to use go to my PC.  I'm sure you'll think of more if you try it for for free for the next month.  Visit go to my PC com click the try it free button.  See that big orange button right here and they're going to ask you for a promo code.  And all I ask is the type in the word twit T W I T.  That's not too much to ask.  They say it's optional.  It's not for me T W I T.  That way we get credit for it.  I think you're going to like go to my PC.  Really a great product.  We've used it for years and man, I don't know how I'd have lived without it.  To be honest with you, go to my PC com offer code twit speaking of which let's get back to the twits.

Transcript:  So you mentioned before we went to the break this crazy technology  and you said something about Microsoft and China and the idea is that you've got we've got technology now that was demonstrated actually.  And we even have a video that we can that we can show you in a sec, but I'll try to set it up.  This is a video of a speaker explaining how machines now can not only interpret English.  So if I am speaking into a phone, you can have the phone.  You know, translate typing exactly what I'm saying.  Thank you. Dictation.  That's the word I was looking for.  Dictating.  So that's actually a technology.  But then, okay, well, once that information is in there, then that English that has been dictated can be translated into let's say any other language.  But in this case, Mandarin Chinese, of course, extremely different language doesn't always doesn't always translate.  Yes, specifically that too.  Right. And characters rather than, you know, there's all sorts of differences between two.  At that point, that now can be converted into a voice because the information is there in Chinese.  And wouldn't it be nice if you were maybe speaking to a group of business people in another country?  You don't speak their language and they don't speak yours.  You talk freely and they're hearing without an actual human interpreter what you're saying in the correct language and the technology is actually there.  Chad, can we play a little bit of this video to give people an idea of what's what's happening?  The results are not perfect.

Start time: 2053.70
End time: 2071.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because it is pulling in the tones from the original voice and able to create a voice that is similar.  So if you were talking, for example, it's not going to translate into a voice that sounds like mine.  It sounds like yours.  That's pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Correct.  Well, you have problems with the it's the it's the cadence.  This is a technique called deep neural networks.  Two years ago, researchers at Microsoft Research and the University of Toronto had been working on this made a breakthrough.  It's patterned after human brain behavior and researchers are able to train a better speech recognizer than any anything that's come beforehand, which is obviously of the utmost importance, right?  It's like you can't use a translation tool that works most of the time.  And if you watch this is a 10 minute video, although it's very interesting and you should definitely go and watch it.  And and and they say, where, you know, get an error rate, maybe one in eight.  So that's still pretty high.

And there's that.  But I didn't actually have the opportunity to have a service, you know, relax on my couch and just see how the whole thing felt.  And boy, that software is laggy.  I mean, it is just unacceptably laggy.  I mean, even to the point if like you're looking at something in landscape, you go to portrait and it's like, you know, you can't that's not that just doesn't work for me.  I don't know.

One, I don't know enough about Android and I want to know more about Android because I think, you know,  Android is definitely a big force and I don't know a lot about it.  Two, I would have gotten the iPad Mini because I really do.  From what I've seen, I kind of believe that the seven inch tablet seems to be the way to go.  But I don't want the non-retina display iPad Mini.  If it was an iPad Mini with a retina display, I would have gotten it.  Yeah.  So I think I'm going to jump into Android with a Nexus 7.  And then.  People love their Nexus 7s.  And then, you know, between that and the time that the iPad Mini Retina comes out will be my deciding factor on  how much I want to stick with Android aside from educating myself more about it.

Transcript:  I know this has been talked to death, but do you think we're going to see an iPad Mini Retina in March  when we would normally see a new iPad?  I mean, we just got a new iPad 4th Gen.  What are they going to do in March?  Are we even going to have a March event?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would venture to think, and obviously this is coming from someone who doesn't own a tablet,  but I would venture to think that the iPad Mini might just kind of take over and be the iPad.  And maybe the iPad 4 is the last of the full size iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if I, if, if, yeah, it seems like I hear more and more from folks who have gotten Minis  that once they have that, they say, I want to pick up their full size iPad.  It's huge and clunky and the bezel is too big.  And I love the Mini.  I am with you about the Retina.  You also have a Retina MacBook Pro.  So, you know, it is sucky to go from that beautiful display and then look at anything.  That's a MacBook Pro?  It's a MacBook Pro, yeah.  That's not an Air?  No, no, it's just a beautiful thin MacBook Pro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would rather have the, I'd rather have the 13 inch MacBook Pro, but they didn't have it.  Right.  Yet.  I mean, that's what always happens with Apple and anyone else is you buy something and there's something better.

Transcript:  So that is, yeah, that's the cinema display, but you just want touch screen capability.  So then we get back into our Mac OS versus iOS and how they can fuse together.  See, you're starting to fantasize about it too.  Wow.  See what happened there.  Speaking of iOS and Microsoft, actually Microsoft Office for iPhone and the iPad and Android also has been revealed by the verge.  This is this is really technically still just a rumor, but the verge says, hey, we've got sources.  Our sources say from within Microsoft that an iOS version of Office mobile is coming to fruition as early as next February 2013.  Android, I think is expected a little bit later in May.  And we've talked about this a little bit on other shows this week, or I have anyway.  You guys haven't been here.  I'm excited about it.  Are you excited?  Okay, so let's talk about who is the target market for this.  Because you're interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I'm not very good at it.  I'm not an Excel Jedi at all.  But I will say that using numbers, which is the numbers for the iPhone, which is their version of a spreadsheet, Apple's version of a spreadsheet for mobile has made me a stronger spreadsheet user than any desktop app I've ever used.  Me being a dunce at spreadsheets.  But like using numbers on the iPhone is I think it costs six dollars, which is a lot for an app.  But like just the user interface, the way it allows you to just do everything with the touch of a finger versus thinking about keyboards and keyboard shortcuts and all that, the functionality that taught me how to create spreadsheets better on mobile than on Excel itself or than on the desktop version.  Of course, this coming from someone who's not good at it.  If I was doing spreadsheets all day long and working in an accounting firm, I would want to use the desktop version.  But like, it went to show me the power of how intuitive it can be using the inputs of the way a handheld device works to teach someone how to create formulas or just throw in graphs and charts.  And the fact that you could do all this on a mobile device that easily is pretty cool.  And so knowing that Microsoft, who is the one that pioneered office suites and office products, is getting in and creating their own version to help push everyone else to compete more, I think is exciting.  Because if they can make if they can make a better Excel than Apple can make numbers, then that makes it better for everyone.

Now let's get back to the idea that this is a great idea.  This is a great thing for Microsoft to get into the mobile market on obviously OSes aside its own, Android, iOS.  But what do you want to pay for this access?  What do you think is fair?

Start time: 2639.72
End time: 2694.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think there's a combination of you're paying for cloud storage because most of the files that you're opening in any office suite now are going to be stored on the cloud.  So whether it's SkyDrive or whatever is cloud.  So I think you'd be paying for a little bit of storage.  But to have a really rich capability, I think it's going to cost more than...  Gosh.  I think if you're really wanting to use productivity, not productivity, but just like office suite products, I think you depending on what your competition is doing and how it's supported, it's something that you have to pay for.  It has to be paid for and there's no other way around it.  So I guess it just depends on what's...  Google's offering it for free, but there's certain things that you're going to need to have capabilities of.  And then you're going to have your competition from Apple and numbers and pages.  Well, here's what we know.

Start time: 2696.63
End time: 2733.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And this is again rumors.  But what we know is that Microsoft has made it pretty clear that if you are accessing anything from the Microsoft office suite on, let's say your iPhone, for example.  By the way, a lot of stickers on my iPhone.  Got a little crazy over the weekend.  Cute.  Yeah.  Did you just come back from Japan?  Well, it was Japan Town, actually.  It wasn't actually Japan.  It was Japan Town.  Yeah, I just...  I know it's store.  We did that one night and we thought it was really funny.  And, you know, these stickers don't want to come off.  So I think they're here to stay.  Very nice, huh?  Just a little mistake I made a couple of days ago.

Start time: 2734.00
End time: 2737.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 2738.10
End time: 2778.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't steal them.  So the deal is you'd need a Microsoft account, obviously, to access any documents that you would be accessing on your phone.  Okay, so that's fine.  But then it would only be read privileges.  Okay, well, that's not helpful.  Okay, well, how do you get to a point where you can edit the documents?  Well, you need an Office 365 account.  Well, that's not free.  Okay, well, what are the different packages that I can get?  The lowest I think is $4 a month right now.  And they might change the pricing for Android and iOS folks.  But even if they do, it's not going to be free.  It's going to be a subscription model.  And do you really want a subscription model for something that's not going to be as good as the native version?

Start time: 2779.48
End time: 2828.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, as we get more and more devices, you want to be able to access whatever it is that you're working on.  And half of what you're working on for most people with normal jobs is using Office Suite products.  And so you want to be able to access it on your tablet, on your desktop, and on your very small handheld device.  And I think being able to provide the best possible experience for each of those form factors is going to be really important.  And so beyond that, I think that Microsoft Office for the iPad better be able to open everyone else's competing Word documents, spreadsheet documents.  You've got to be able to open all of it.  And each to compete in a Fortune 500 world, they need to be able to offer their own experience through and through and support everyone else's.

Yeah, we're going to get political because nobody...  We haven't had enough of that yet. No, but we're going to talk about kind of the fun stuff, the tech part of the election.

Transcript:  Excuse me one moment. May I interrupt? We'll get back to your tech news in just a moment before we do that, though.  I've got some news for anybody who mails a lot of stuff.  And I know that's a lot of you, whether you've got a business that sends out mailings or maybe you send packages.  Maybe you sell stuff on Amazon or eBay or PayPal or Etsy.  And you know, you're not. I hope. I hope you're not going to the post office and waiting in line and buying stamps.  Worse. Worse. I hope you're not leasing a postage meter and paying for like fancy ink that you don't really need.  I could save you up to 80 percent off the cost of a postage meter with stamps.com.  Stamps.com. You already have what you need. Stamps.com lets you print legal U.S. postage from your printer and your computer.  You don't need a postage meter. You don't need fancy ink. You don't need to wait in line at the post office.  You just need stamps.com. You sign up and bada boom. Now, I'm sorry if you're outside the U.S.  This is only for the United States. It is good, though, if you mail internationally from the U.S.  You know, I don't know if you know this, but if you ever mail internationally, you've got to go to the post office, get these forms, fill them all out, get international money.  It's very complicated. Stamps.com. They fill out the forms. The whole thing is easy. And then it all prints out.  They can print sticky stamps. You actually can buy like Avery label stamps. But that's not the best way to use stamps.com.  Should do what we do. Print it right onto the envelope with your logo. We got a little twit logo, return address.  Stamps.com will pull from your address book or Amazon, eBay, Etsy, PayPal, you know, all the sites.  Put the senders, the receivers, recipients address in there. Print it all out for you. The print great mailing labels.  They even do the kind of that thing where you know you're sending express mail and it clicks and you send an email to the recipient letting them know it's on its way, giving the tracking number and all that stuff.  And by the way, the post office loves stamps.com. They give them discounts you can't get at the post office.  Up to 21% on express mail, up to 15% on priority mail. I'm just a big fan.  And I think that I've been using it for almost 10 years and I think that you ought to try it if you aren't already doing it.  I know you will find it much easier than what you're doing now. So here's the deal. Go to stamps.com. You'll see there's an $80 trial offer.  But don't do that, please. Because that can get you better. Click the CC Heard About Us on a podcast. Click that up in the right hand corner.  Enter the word TWIT. And that $80 offer is now a $110 offer. It's magic. It's a little magic act there.  $55 in free postage, a free digital scale, $5 supply kit, four week trial. Cancel it anytime the scale's yours to keep.  But I don't think you're going to cancel because I think you're going to realize what a great deal stamps.com is.  Try it today. Stamps.com. Make sure you use the offer code TWIT.

In a way, Tom Merritt and me and Justin Robert Young were here. We were actually sitting over on the TNT news set.  We were trying to have kind of an election night hangout that was a little bit more about just making sense of all of it.  And it was really, really fun. But at that time, Justin says, you know, people in chat room are saying that Fox called the election in Ohio or called Ohio for Obama.  And we're like, no, no, no, that's it's way too early. And then all of a sudden we saw the tweets from Barack Obama's account.  The first tweet said something like, thank you. You know, I was able to do this because of you. And it's like, oh, OK, this is everything's happening now.  The second tweet said four more years and it was the picture of the two of them.

By the way, that same picture was posted to Facebook, Barack Obama's Facebook account.  It also broke records.  It's the most liked photo ever posted to Facebook.  And how many people liked it?  Four million, three hundred fifty thousand four hundred fifty five.  When I last checked, which was a couple of hours ago.  I wish they had a dislike button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I think general, though, I mean, it's just that more people are doing things online.  So when there is a global event or a national event, more people instead of just watching it on TV are now online in different ways.  So whatever the biggest social network is, they're going to be participating in that with.  Yeah, it's all about whether Obama wins or whether Romney wins.  If Romney had won and posted a picture, probably would have been the most retweeted picture.

And it's kind of fun to at least, you know, I was in a room with a bunch of friends watching everything go down and I was having an in-person experience with them.  But then at the same time, anyone who, you know, I'm following or is following me that there's other places, you know, they're I'm able to share in what they were doing and they're able to share what I'm doing a little bit.

Not sure about that.  But what Instagram is really interested in doing is figuring out, OK, we've got all the crazy amounts of data coming in.  Let's say the election, you know, the election goes to the incumbent president.  It's a big deal.  And people are just pouring in.  You can hashtag photos so you can you can give it a category that it will it'll be tagged in with other photos.  But that's about it.

So if you know where you got the map view of where you were, then you could say something like, OK, well, how many Instagram photos that are about this particular subject sent between nine and 10 p.m.  within a city?  Yeah, that's really cool.  Yeah, we're taking and I want to see them all.

Start time: 3502.04

But I mean, all the information is there for pretty much everyone.  I can turn off the geolocation if I want.  So if I you know, if I take, I don't know, photos somewhere, I don't know, there's all kinds of reasons not to share info.  But so, you know, you can be as private as you want.

So for a billion dollars, still a very small team works at Facebook and they got to figure out, OK, well, how can we continue to iterate on this on this really, really seemingly simple idea?  We just we have too many photos coming in.

Transcript:  Well, OK, so we talked about we were talking about big data here.  And it turns out this was sort of new to me, actually, that campaigns, they all have their own strategies for being able to make sense of who's voting and who still needs to vote in in a and making sense of exit polls and that they now have their own apps.  So for example, the Romney team, the campaign had an app called Orca that everyone sort of was like, oh, yeah, it's a big killer whale.  Got it. Got it.  It was a a web app that was supposed to search for and mark off voters as they left polling locations, then taking that data to use in projections or then check when supporters of Governor Romney might need a phone call.  Hey, are you still coming?  Yeah.  So this is obviously just a design to be as accurate as possible.  So Communications Director Gail Gole, Gitschow had told PBS, for example, when exit polls come out, we don't even need to pay attention to that because we have scientific information based on the political operation we have set up.  So this was Project Orca.  It was designed to replace kind of pen and paper, get out the vote efforts.  Right.  The problem is, is that by all accounts, it was a colossal failure.  There were log in information, a variety of logins.

Start time: 3755.10

Transcript:  Renegade Mike makes a good point, says Orca was never beta tested in the field.  That's right.  And that's what folks at the Romney campaign said is that it was just this is more just a story of it's not so much about the campaign.  It's just a story of it's not so much about politics is just you have organizations who say we've got this tool, we're going to build it.  It's going to help everybody.  And it's just a mess.

Transcript:  A Romney volunteer and someone who wrote sort of a what went wrong on Orca had said, I mean, training materials were vague and inaccurate.  Nightly information sessions weren't helpful.  Volunteers were told to look for a native mobile app, but it was web app.  The URL was for an HTTPS site, but the HTTP address didn't forward.  And if you started with the WWW, you just wouldn't find anything.  I mean, this is what we know enough about computers to know that if any of those things are wrong, you have a lot of people who are like, I don't know.  It's just broken.  I don't know.  It just doesn't work.  It just doesn't work.  So yikes.  This is not by the way.  Obama had his own campaign tool, Narwhal.  I don't know.  We haven't heard as much about that.

They stuffed it in the sheet that I was at, at least for my polling location, San Francisco.  I hung out at home, filled out the whole thing, looked up research online while I was doing it for some of the issues I want to know more about.  And then on Election Day, I didn't mail.  I just walked over and like, hey, can I stuff this in here?  And I want a sticker.  That's what I did.  I got my sticker.  But I think they should encourage more people to not even necessarily even have to mail it in.  But get the ballot in the mail and then hand the balloting because the lines are going to go down if it means you hand it over with your ID to a poll worker and you're done.  So, I mean, I don't know.

But just before we move on, I had read the same thing is like you can't just have somebody bring in your ballot because I did the same thing.  I I I filled out my my mail in ballot and then I walked it down to the precinct and I had my ID with me and you can't just be anybody.  And I walked up and she's like, oh, yeah, just put in there.  Yeah.  And kind of, you know, I said, do you need to know my name?  And she goes, no, no, it's fine.  And I sort of was like, well, where's my sticker?  And oh, oh, yeah.  OK, you have to go talk to that lady.  And then she gave me one.  She didn't really want to either.  I just voted.  I get a sticker.  But there was no security.

OK, should we talk about AT&T making it easier now for for anybody who's who's an AT&T user who isn't on an unlimited plan to now use FaceTime over cellular?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So here's the here's a little bit of a backstory on this for anybody who's like, what's going on here?  So initially, AT&T said, no, no, you can't get FaceTime over cellular unless you're part of a mobile share plan,  which happens to be a new exciting plan that is probably pricier than the plan you already have.  And people went, well, you suck.  OK, thanks for nothing, AT&T.  And meanwhile, there were a lot of organizations, public knowledge is one of them, free press is another said,  hold on a second, hold on a second.  There is no reason that AT&T should be limiting this.  AT&T has spectrum that it licenses as part of an agreement of licensing spectrum.  You pretty much agree to use the spectrum to its full capability for the benefit of the users, the community.  And AT&T just isn't giving us one of the options that we should have on our on our phone.  Right. So AT&T said, no, no, no, this is not because we're trying to screw anybody over.  It's because our engineers have no way to test our network beforehand.  So we just needed to make sure that the infrastructure was in place and we weren't going to affect everyone's all of the users by  bogging down the network, you know, with all the face timing that everybody's doing.  So we just had to make sure that everything was OK.  Now we've deemed it pretty much OK.  So anybody who's not on an unlimited plan gets to now use FaceTime over cellular, which just it's almost more insulting because AT&T is saying,  well, OK, we do have the capacity.  We always did have the capacity.  And now we're finally admitting it because we're under pressure from companies and possibly under FCC pressure.  Right. If we don't do something about this.  But it just it's spectrum that they have plenty of and they still won't let Prager or me use FaceTime over cellular.  Why? No reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not all about somebody in chat said, oh, only girls use FaceTime.  I never use FaceTime, actually.  And I think one of this really matters to me on an actual day to day level.  It just bothers me that AT&T is saying, oh, unlimited user that got in before we stopped letting people get unlimited accounts.  You can't have this feature because if you for some reason are a big FaceTime, then maybe you'll sign up for a different account  and we can get you off of that unlimited plan that we really don't want you to have.

Transcript:  I totally understand it, though. I do.  Yeah. Well, they're in the business of making money, right?  Well, I mean, they got in trouble.  There's another story we had here.  They have to pay overcharging dispute because there are people that were grandfathered in.  And then if they went and got a new phone through some warranty, they got automatically switched over to the non-grandfathered in one.  So they're getting overcharging users without telling them.  Yeah. Violating whatever contract that they had with the with the subscriber.  That probably has happened to me and I haven't even noticed.  What I don't understand about the stories, it says that AT&T is to pay the feds seven hundred thousand dollars to settle overcharging dispute.  It seems like they don't owe the feds. They owe the customer.  Maybe that's in the fine print somewhere, but I don't know.  Why the feds get all that money?

Julius Janikowski, FCC chairman, says today's action sends a clear signal that the wireless carriers can't wrongfully charge consumers.  These strong FCC accountability measures will ensure consumers are not overcharged.  I am pleased that AT&T is taking the appropriate steps to resolve this issue.  Well, they did it under duress. I don't think they did it just to be cool.  You know, they're collecting.

Now, you don't have to do that right away.  You could just say add it to the box and then keep doing it.  Find other gadgets, add them to the box.  Gazelle will pay shipping.  They actually send you a box with a shipping label and everything on it.  And they will pay the shipping on anything worth more than a buck.

Now, you can do it now and get 30 days guaranteed.  That way you can wait till your device comes and move the data over, then send it to Gazelle.  But do the quote now because I'll be honest with you.  These things aren't getting any more valuable.  I don't care what you think.  Here's a Blackberry torch.  You think that's worth more?

Transcript:  All right, Prager.  You said to me...  Back to you guys.  Oh, thank you, Leo.  You said to me, hey, are we going to talk about Smart Glass?  And I went, I guess.  Are you excited?  Xbox Smart Glass coming to iOS.

Start time: 4662.69
End time: 4729.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'll start by saying I'm not a huge gamer.  It's actually out already.  I just think it's kind of cool because it just allows a new dimension to a lot of what we do in our living rooms.  So, Smart Glass.  It's basically an app for iOS.  And you can also do...  I think I'm positive it's on Android as well.  But what it allows you to do is basically interface and input what you're doing through your Xbox.  But with your handheld.  Android app launch a couple weeks ago.  So instead of having to use a joystick and toggle through what your name is or just change all your settings,  it's a lot faster to change settings using the inputs of a touchscreen display than it is to use a joystick.  But beyond that, and even though it's not in the story,  I kind of find it interesting to be able to have an additional display for something like an Xbox 360  because the new Nintendo, the Nintendo Wii U, has a joystick that's also a display.  So say if you're playing a game like Madden and you want to scroll through all the plays,  I don't want you to be able to see the plays I'm looking at.  I can do that on the Wii U when it comes out.  And I think theoretically on the Xbox, because they have Smart Glass,  you'll be able to add additional ways of input for your game in addition to just going through your settings and changing your usernames.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And as a video game, it's an extra level of dimension that a video game author can choose whether or not they think it enhances the quality of the game.  And then they also have to consider like going back to the Wii U.  If you have a Wii U, it's given that 100 percent of the users will have the device.  And so it's easy for a video game maker to say, well, I'm going to make this added method of using the joystick in a build that into my game.  And they'll know everyone can use it for the Xbox 360.  You can't necessarily think forgiven that everyone has an Android phone or an iOS phone.  That said, they can decide whether or not enough people have it that they can add an element of diversity into the input control of the game that therefore allows that many more users to be interested in.  How much does this cost?  I have no idea. It's an app.  I bet you it would be free.  Let's look. Let's look.

Transcript:  Looking on your computer for an app that's going to be on the... Come on now.  You're blowing my mind.  Let's go the short route here.  Hey, so what do you guys think about Kim Dotcom and Mega Upload?  Because this story gets weirder and weirder.  Oh, so...  First of all, I don't have a huge issue with Kim Dotcom.  Why not?  I know that he's... Well, I guess as far as his persona goes, he really rubs people the wrong way.

Start time: 4882.00
End time: 4895.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sure everyone pretty much knows, but for the most part, he had Mega Upload, a place where you can pirate movies.  That's why it got shut down.  They said it's used for pirating movies, not for sharing massive amounts of legitimate data.

Start time: 4895.94
End time: 4897.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But there was legitimate data that was shared.

Start time: 4897.94
End time: 4935.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Of course there was. A ton of legitimate data, which pissed off a lot of people using it.  Sure.  But then the federal government, among other people, but for the most part, the federal government says,  guess what? You ain't doing this because you're violating federal law on sharing video material that's copywritten.  So they shut it down, try to issue an arrest warrant to have him extradited from New Zealand to the United States.  So that goes down. There's a huge, I don't know, rigamarole, for lack of a better word.  It's a rigamarole, all right.  So now Kim Dotcom says, well, I'm going to create a new service now that MegaUpload.com is down.  I'm going to go create it under, what was the new name?  Mega.  Mega. Dot-G-A. Gabon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So then the government over there is like, well, hold on, we don't want to be a tool for you to create a new site.  So then he's like, well, I'm making a new one.  It's going to be somewhere else.

Start time: 4949.31
End time: 4953.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  Well.  What else has Gabon got going on?

Start time: 4954.22
End time: 5030.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Balazs Luembe, which is Gabon's communications minister, pretty much said, no, we're not going to serve as a platform or screen for committing acts aimed at violating copyrights, nor to be used by unscrupulous people.  That was according to a New Zealand publication, Stuff.co.nz, which is funny because the lawyer for kind of like MegaUpload's worldwide defense, who is very busy these days, his name is Ira Rothken.  He's based in Silicon Valley, actually said in an interview with CNET.  Yeah, okay.  We're not going to actually go ahead and use the Gabon domain.  It's mega as in M-E-dot-G-A because that's the domain of the country said, well, okay, we'll just call it something else.  But it's funny because Kim Dotcom recently, I mean, it was in the last couple of weeks had made a big deal about how something is going to come back.  We're going to launch it in January.  We don't even have anything to show you, but it's going to be at the domain Mega, M-E-Ga, and it's going to be a big deal.  So everybody started talking about it.  Gabon says we want a part of this and they go, okay, well, our idea that it's really just an idea that no one's even seen yet will just be called something else entirely.  The thing is stupid.

Start time: 5031.48

Transcript:  I mean, it's this guy, Kim Dotcom, saying I'm going to be the champion of the ability to share information and media across as many people as possible, period.  And I'm the champion of this.  And it's the right thing to do because we want freedom for everyone.  That's nonsense.  The guy's a thief.  And he knows.  Of course.  And yes, there has to be a solution for some people to do stuff.  But I don't think this is the way to do it.  I'm all for circumventing means to get what you want legally.  But if you're using someone's service, clearly, I mean, it's pretty freaking obvious.  I hate to say it.  That the service was used in large part for piracy.

Start time: 5070.34
End time: 5112.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what can Mega upload do going forward?  They're going to figure out how to relaunch some sort of a service like this again.  In some form, we're going to see Mega upload come back from the ashes.  What do they do?  How do they make sure that I don't share infringing content rather than perfectly safe Linux distros the next time I use it?  What do they do?  I know that there is a whole there's the whole like winky wink thing like, yeah, sometimes there's legitimate stuff shared on Mega upload, but most of it isn't.  OK, everybody knows that.  But if you build infrastructure for people to share and you back away from it and say, well, it's not, you know, it's not my job to make sure that I'm policing what you're sharing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Some people are asking how does it how does it differ from the drop boxes in the in the doesn't really and the G drives, except for those are tied to specific user accounts.  And I also think at the end of the day, it's it's kind of like, you know, as it becomes more easy to traffic and high bandwidth and easier to have more storage on your devices.  I mean, the sharing of movies is not hard and it's not the problem is for stopping piracy.  I don't think that's the route necessarily to take.  You can't open it up.  So I'm kind of being a devil's advocate to myself.  But like, it's absolutely easy to share any data that you want.  And, you know, the encryption of, you know, copyright protection schemes using technology to do that.  All those are going to be cracked nonstop all the time.  Certainly.  So, you know, I think I think the movie industry hasn't happened yet.  It's going to it's going to come up against the same thing that's happened to the music industry.  And it's already happening.  It's going to start happening more.

He pleaded guilty to multiple felonies in exchange for a probation.  All the charges brought against him, which included charges based on credit card fraud, identity theft, bomb threats, online impersonation.  Just, you know, bad stuff.  Over the course of this last year, 2012, Cosmo belonging to a group called UG Nazi took part in some pretty high profile hacking events.  They started as a group that was opposing SOPA, as many folks were took down websites, took down NASDAQ, CIA, dot gov, USC, UFC, dot com, redirected 4chan's DNS to point to its own website.

That said, from some kid like him, who's livelihood and part of his in a way, his genius is being able to use the Internet.  Is it robbing him of his entire future by turning that off for that long?  Is this Mitnick-esque?  It's not his entire future.

He has to hand over all of his account logins and passwords.  He has to disclose in writing any devices that he has access to that have the capability to connect to any network.  He can't have any contact with the members or associates of UGNazi or anonymous.  I mean, that's a tough one.  So just anybody who might be associated with anonymous, we don't know who those people are.  Along with a list of other individuals, he had to forfeit all the computers and other items seized in the raid on his home.  And violating these terms will will result in a three year prison term.

You're talking about a really bright, gifted kid in terms of all things Internet.  At some point after getting on the right path, he could do some really good things.  I feel that monitored Internet access for six years is a bit on the hefty side.  It could sideline his whole life, his career path, his art, his skills.  At some level, it's like taking away Mozart's piano.  I'm sorry. I just don't.  I just don't.  See, I told you.  I don't.  I you do bad stuff.  You know you're doing it.

This is finally his sentencing.  So, yeah, there are there are folks out there who think it's a little a little a little steep, a little stiff.  I don't know if I agree.  I can't you can't just run rampant out there.  Take down government websites.  You can, but they'll find you.  They have it.  You like that?  Mind your P's and Q's.  Be careful.  On Internet.

Start time: 5736.14
End time: 5753.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I kind of do.  You know how anytime anybody has a reason to pimp their profile, you start getting all of these people on Twitter saying, oh, cool, I love the Instagram new web profiles.  Here's mine.  And so I saw a lot of that over over a few days.  But I can't look at my feed.  Well, yeah, it's not your feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the idea, it's almost like going to a Twitter profile, right?  If I'm like David Prager, I don't know, he seems like a cool guy.  What kind of stuff does he tweet about?  I go to Twitter dot com slash deal Prager.  If I if I want to go to see what you're taking pictures of, I go to Instagram dot com slash deal Prager.  Makes perfect sense.  I guess I'm just so used to accessing Instagram from a mobile device that I don't see much of a point of the of the web profiles.  Prager's over there clicking on stupid pictures that I've taken myself.  That's Instagram dot com slash Sarah Lane.  Right, right.  Oh, OK.

Start time: 5796.12

Start time: 5816.92
End time: 5845.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The only integration I've seen is that if I put an Instagram photo or a photo.  Yeah, if I post a picture on Instagram, it'll Instagram will tell me when certain people have liked it on Facebook.  If I tell it to go on Facebook, Instagram Apple tell me or was that always available through the API?  Gosh, I don't I've just noticed.  If if if you post a photo to Facebook from Instagram, if I use Instagram, take a photo and put it online and say also published to Facebook.  Yes, Instagram Apple tell me when Facebook people are liking it.

End time: 5867.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

It's actually sad from people who say my hard drive crashed and I had pictures of my wedding on there.  Is there any way I can get it back?  I got one guy called me up.  It actually was a happy ending.  He called me up.  He said, I was sailing from Los Angeles to Catalina Island on my boat and the lab got a little rough.  The laptop went overboard.  And he said, but there's a happy ending.  I was using carbon.  I didn't was fine.  I mean, you know, you had to buy a new laptop, but his data is safe.  And you know what?  Really?  The data is the stuff that's irreplaceable.  You can always get a new laptop.  But can you get, you know, new wedding pictures, baby pictures, financial records?  Just think what's on your hard drive right now.  You can't afford to lose that.  You need a backup solution that's automatic, that's continuous, that will be up in the clouds.  So, you know, it's not going to be lost whenever there's a really big disaster, a fire or a hurricane or something like that.  I love carbon.  I love carbon.  It's a really good backup plan.  Very affordable, by the way.  Fifty nine dollars a year for everything on your computer.  It's it's cloud access, too, because all those files are, you know, once they're on the carbonite servers, you can log in to your carbonite account on any device, any laptop, any desktop, even a smartphone or tablet.  And there's your stuff.  It's a great way to get to your files as well.  Best price.  Best part of all is the price.  Fifty nine dollars a year, less than five bucks a month.  I want you to try it free for the first two weeks.  That'll be enough probably to get your first backup done, depending on your upstream bandwidth.  And I do like you to try it because it uses your Internet connection.  Does not slow you down, does not slow your computer down.  But if you don't have enough bandwidth, you know, don't use it on a dial up.  So that's why I want you to try it free.  Carbonite dot com.  Click the try home free and use our offer code.

Start time: 6120.52
End time: 6136.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think it's that horrible.  And they're trying to, you know, obviously they're making some radical changes.  What they're trying to come out with now and they're testing it with some people.  I have not seen it.  They have not foisted it upon me.  Looks more like sort of a Windows 8.

Start time: 6137.55
End time: 6143.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it does.  Or some might say a Pinterest type of a thing.  It's all about tiles and visuals.

Start time: 6143.94
End time: 6162.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that is interesting that Pinterest, you know, they started and then you've even have I'm sure Windows 8 they're working on for a long, long time.  But then you've even got, you know, eBay's homepage redesign.  And so all the way it's like a new design movement in terms of like how people are displaying information that you can click on and you can, you know, kind of peg to things.

Start time: 6164.10
End time: 6212.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, Chad, if you if you pull up this all things D article and you scroll down a little bit, we can see a couple of examples of what the new Yahoo homepage will look like.  Just go down there a little bit.  So we're looking at something that looks like that.  You kind of go, OK, well, you've still got that familiar Yahoo logo.  It's a lot smaller up in the upper left.  You've got your categories.  You've got your big tiles.  I assume they'd be dynamic.  I don't know.  Maybe not.  Possibly changing, possibly not.  Of course, we're just looking at screenshots.  I think it looks great.  Yahoo is, you know, Martin, you say, I don't know.  I don't really have a problem with Yahoo.  I don't have a problem with Yahoo either.  It's familiar, but it's also it's, you know, it's it has that aged look.

Start time: 6212.92
End time: 6221.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It all really does.  I don't use it for much.  It's just functional.  I know where everything is.  That's not to say what they're doing now isn't bad.

Start time: 6221.90
End time: 6224.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's still why they have pretty good page views.  People still go to Yahoo.

Start time: 6225.90
End time: 6227.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has crazy good page views.

Start time: 6228.54
End time: 6246.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it doesn't really have the respect of, I don't know, a forward leaning community.  So design changes.  Obviously, that's just one piece of all of the stuff that Yahoo has to work on.  But I like it.  I think it looks nice.  It looks fine.  Do you know what?

Start time: 6247.22
End time: 6253.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I would get used to it if they did this.  It would take half a day.  You're like, oh, yeah, this is fine.

Start time: 6254.90
End time: 6304.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The only thing about this is that and no, I don't I don't know when they're rolling it out.  It looks like it's it's being tested and a limited group of users.  They've got, like I said, a simplified logo.  Still that crappy logo, though, but simplified smaller, more prominence for search,  infinite scrolling, things that people like.  And it looks like they're testing redesigns and figuring out what sticks with folks before they flip it on for everybody else.  Speaking of flipping, I mean, it looks like Flipboard.  It looks like Pinterest.  It looks like Windows 8, as you mentioned, Martin.  I just we're kind of getting to that point where everything looks the same because it's a nice design.  It's pleasing to the eye.  It works really well right now.  But I'm pretty sure in five years we're all going to go across.  Remember, we all did the tiles.  Everything was a square.

Start time: 6305.38
End time: 6308.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do we really need tiles?  Does everything have to be that easy?

Start time: 6309.06
End time: 6311.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I guess that's my question.  Isn't this a fad?

Start time: 6312.98
End time: 6326.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is is is Yahoo as it is, is it really is it too complex for you?  Is it giving you a headache?  Are you having trouble figuring it out?  No, it's it's simple.  It works tiles.  It's like this is like what a baby could use.  Why?

Start time: 6327.14
End time: 6341.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure, Yahoo is fine with that.  More page views, right?  Get the babies on the mobile.  No, no.  OK, you're I don't know.  I think I get more excited about design changes than everybody else.  You're you're at Yahoo right now.

Start time: 6342.36
End time: 6369.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I go to Yahoo specifically to do I go to like news.yahoo.com.  Sure.  I find it actually more fulfilling than news.google.com unless I'm searching for news.  Right.  I like they have editors and they have a lot of categories and they sort it fairly well.  Fairly well.  I'm guessing that they're not going to change the news site.  If they did, then it basically would be a bunch of massive photos with captions that if you hover over it, it'll tell you the caption.  I don't know if that's the way I want.  Yeah, I doubt that they're going to change it.

Start time: 6370.36
End time: 6374.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 6389.68
End time: 6397.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why do you use that over Google Maps or I mean, not to talk about Apple Maps, but why would you use it over the native apps in the smart and the phone devices?

Start time: 6398.14
End time: 6414.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a lot of people prefer Waze because they feel it has more updated information on like accidents that are coming up because folks have contributed to that data.  So it has a lot more of a real time indication of how point A to point B is going to go.

Start time: 6415.45
End time: 6437.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I always thought that Waze seemed like a cool idea.  And for some reason, I also always thought that that wouldn't succeed because there's too much competition from the likes of a Google.  And clearly, like they've been able to hold their own, amass their own data and be able to provide an experience that these big wigs like Google can't match.  Right. I mean, do you use it over Google because it's better?

Transcript:  Waze has also experienced an influx of new users because of the Apple Maps fiasco.  It's not the only company to enjoy a lot of users saying, yeah, I don't like Apple Maps.  What are my other alternatives at Apple?  Tim Cook himself had suggested some other map alternatives if you're not actually happy with Apple Maps.  She got a lot of Waze users in the company, has gone ahead and said, listen, it's time to monetize.  We got users and we are ready to figure out how to push ads towards them.

Transcript:  Exactly. Yeah. Or location.  We got a pop up going on right here at the Bates shop.  When I first heard about that, I was like, first of all, that'd be the most annoying thing in the world.  If, for example, you're listening to turn by turn and it's an audio ad.  I mean, that's like extremely distracting and just invasive and blah, blah, blah.  But I don't actually think that that's really the point of it.  It's more of a if you had liked Whole Foods on Facebook, say.  So we already know that you're like, that's a good brand.  Then we'll be able to say you're about to go buy a Whole Foods.  And I'd be like, cool, because they have this kind of juice.  I can't get anywhere else. And we'll just get right off the road.  And here we are.  The only thing is that you have to be looking at the map as you go along.  Right. So that gets a little complicated.  So if I'm in the middle of my journey, maybe I've already pulled over.  I look and I see my ways ad and I say, OK, cool, Whole Foods is pretty close.  But if I am not and I'm continuing to drive, then that would be extremely dangerous.  Yeah.

You drop it or something.  I don't. I'd like you to stop putting your fingerprints all over it.  That would be nice.  Gosh, you're terrible.  You know what? Fine.  Waze is monetizing.  It's a little disappointing to me, but hey, they deserve money.  They have a good product.  I guess I don't know.
