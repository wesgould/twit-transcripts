So be kind, be nice.  Wesley Faulkner is here. I met Wesley in Austin when we were down for South By.  And I was so impressed.  You know why I was impressed?  Because Stacey Higginbotham gave you the biggest hug and I thought, well, he must be one of the good guys.  Because Stacey's very finicky.  Yes.  It's nice to see you Wesley.  Well, that's what she wanted. Discerning.  She met you when you were at AMD doing IoT stuff there.

Transcript:  So jealous.  Absolutely.  Austin's a small town.  This is, I should tell everybody, I should warn everybody, this is April Fools.  You know though, it used to be you would walk onto the internet on April Fools Day with a flak jacket going like this, beware.  It seems to have calmed down a lot.  Because it's Easter.  Is that it? It's the first time since I was born.  That's right.  The first time in my lifetime that Easter and April Fools fall on the same day.

Transcript:  I also think a lot of the good jokes have been done.  I mean if you think back to when this kind of blew up, Gmail had its like Gmail paper.  They were going to print out all your emails to you and send them to you.  And everyone almost bought it for a second.  Back then it was a fresh kind of cool take on it.  And now it's kind of like, it's like South by Southwest, no offense to Austin.  But it's been so commercialized that life's been beaten out of it.  And now it's a mere husk of what it used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It feels like at one point Google was spending about half of its time preparing for April Fools Day.  Every division of Google had an April Fools page or joke.  It's calmed down a lot. Google Maps had a Where's Waldo.  If you go to your Maps app on your phone, a little Waldo appears out and there's a Where's Waldo game on it.  Which isn't really even.  You know the one that upset people the most I'm hearing?  Pokemon Go had 8-bit Pokemon.  I hear that wasn't popular though. People liked that.  I heard it was unpopular. People didn't like it.

Start time: 347.16
End time: 361.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well according to my Twitter timeline it was popular.  Well according to my Twitter timeline.  And we're off to the races. Welcome back to Twitter.  According to my Twitter timeline.  So here's an idea though. In that case, if it was popular among a certain subset, should they not build that out as an actual feature, as a toggle, an option?

Start time: 361.16
End time: 366.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's why the unpopular set wasn't liking it. They don't want to see it. I presume it'll go away tomorrow.

Start time: 366.18
End time: 378.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean these have to be one day phenomena.  But the worst element of this is now people are going early or late on their April Fools to make them a bit more compelling.  Like a March 30th or 31st April Fools joke. Not funny.  And I don't think we should be doing that in the news media.

Start time: 379.32

Transcript:  Actually, this is painful because if they brought back the sidekick I'd actually be happy.  You'd be stoked about that.  I want them to bring back the sidekick. If you have a banana phone you shouldn't have to.  I want a banana phone too. Did anybody order one? They announced it at Mobile World Congress.  This is the phone that Neo used to get out of the office.  I have one coming. Did you really?

Transcript:  Hello Andy. You've got five seconds to get out of there.  That is the DeLorean of phones.

Start time: 485.16
End time: 493.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the DeLorean of phones.  And I do not mean that as a positive analogy. I mean that in the rudest possible way.  It's not pretty. It's just nostalgia. It's not going to be useful.  And you can't tweet from it.

Start time: 494.24
End time: 537.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of nostalgia.  That's what makes it useful for a lot of people.  I love the idea of saying what if we were to make a $99 phone and making it run smartphone type apps was not the hugest priority.  What if it just has to run the basic social media apps that most people use and run them extremely, extremely well.  And if you can do that for a hundred bucks and it's also a hot spot and it's not just a flip phone.  It really is like a modern operating system with a really good GUI and a not crappy but not not crappy camera.  There are a lot of people for whom they just want a good phone that works for them.  And for 99 bucks you can give this to your kid. They can't get in too much trouble with it.  That's true.  If they drop it down a toilet or down a well. Well, it won't take long to most a few lawns and be able to afford another one.  It does have snake on it.

Start time: 539.32
End time: 542.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, I used to play snake on the old Nokia's. That's cool. The retro stuff.

Start time: 544.14
End time: 563.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right. So that's it on April Fool's. Right. We got the do we cover the waterfront.  I you know, I can't believe I used to really dread it because I would go look at the I do my beat check and there would I'd have to figure out what was real and what wasn't real.  And it was a and you're partly to blame for this Alex Wilhelm because I think you had some of those tech crunch articles.

Start time: 564.00
End time: 589.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, we did. But that's when I thought I was funny.  And then I realized that I wasn't so I gave it up because it requires a certain level of like you'd be confident in your sense of humor to make a joke like that on behalf of your team without telling them.  And then you didn't tell them. Oh, no. No, we would just write articles and ship them and then see what would happen.  See if anybody noticed. Yes. But I mean, it was fun. But I wouldn't go write the crunch coin article again. Right.

Start time: 590.24
End time: 617.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, if you think about anybody who would still think April Fool's jokes are funny, it would be Elon Musk.  Elon was found passed out against a Tesla Model 3 surrounded by Tesla keela bottles, the tracks of dried tears still visible on his cheeks.  This is not a forward looking statement because obviously what's the point?  He's got a cardboard Tesla box with the words bankwapped.

Start time: 617.44
End time: 620.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not funny. It's kind of sad.

Start time: 621.64
End time: 634.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's well, no, I'm sure he thinks it's funny because he thinks that there's no way that Tesla could possibly fail and that he couldn't be bankrupt.  The rest of us are like, oh, let's let's right click and save this for the for the thought.  The bone before that, it's a lot of Photoshop.

Start time: 637.80
End time: 647.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are many chapters of bankruptcy and his critics so rightly pointed out Tesla has them all, including Chapter 14 and a half.  The worst one. So am I missing something?

Start time: 647.50
End time: 669.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The joke here, if you don't get it, is that Tesla consumes tons of cash to operate and needs to borrow money constantly at a very high interest rate to fund its operations.  And we've recently seen the cost of its debt go up dramatically, implying a lack of investor faith that it's going to be able to pay its debts and also its share prices are down.  So he's making a joke about it, but it's not funny because it might happen.  It's too close to home to be whimsical. It's just kind of sad.

Start time: 670.00
End time: 674.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a whole go down. Don't you want to go down laughing?

Start time: 674.28
End time: 684.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, yeah, but in that picture, he just looks kind of sad and alone and that's true.  I'm going down on my terms.  I mean, he also owns SpaceX. I mean, I think Elon himself is doing fine.

Start time: 685.32
End time: 705.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. If I'm well, if he's going to be like bankrupt and homeless.  Okay, pretty slick to be sleeping in a Tesla three is her home.  But remember that he's got those he's got those crew modules at SpaceX that he could be sleeping in instead.  That's got to be better space.  You got to get you get to pick up your unemployment check in one of those astronaut suits that he's he was modeling about a year ago.

Start time: 705.38
End time: 707.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that's right. I forgot about that.

Start time: 707.44
End time: 713.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's probably kind of bummed that he sent his car into space. Now he might have been able to go at least like looking to change out of the ashtray first.

Start time: 715.40
End time: 718.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could use that. All right. Now we're falling for the whole thing.

Start time: 719.22
End time: 791.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now we're doing what they want. Yes. You know, there was an April Fool's.  I thought joke it was an April Fool's announcement.  I thought for sure was a joke from CloudFlare. So that wasn't a joke. It wasn't a joke.  Oh, I thought it was. So CloudFlare announced.  Yeah, I know. I thought it was to CloudFlare announced a new DNS service one dot one dot one dot one.  And the idea would be that you would replace your Internet service providers.  Let me go to the CloudFlare blog post instead of the.  So it's like open DNS then. Yes.  You would replace your DNS with this.  It's there's others. There's Quad nine.  This one's privacy focused.  And I think it's kind of interesting because certainly CloudFlare has the bandwidth to do this.  They do DDoS protection for people. They have a CDN.  They have probably more bandwidth than almost anybody.  One dot one dot one would continue to use an existing authoritative DNS service CloudFlare provides, but it'd be open to the public.  It's encrypted. It uses HTTPS, which not all DNS does.  And it keeps your ISP from seeing what you're doing.  So it protects your privacy.  Doesn't have any other features like Quad nine malware protection or anything like that.

Start time: 792.08
End time: 793.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  White list. Can you do that on that?

Start time: 794.34
End time: 798.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good question. I wasn't able to set it up because it's surprisingly very busy right now.

Start time: 800.42
End time: 841.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I set up in the afternoon and I was I had I think I had been using open DNS on this MacBook and I really did immediately see pages loading a lot faster.  That's good. Because they I think they say that when you see the numbers that they are giving for how much faster it is than competing services,  it doesn't look that much faster.  But then when you realize that when you go to when you go to like, you know, New York Times dot com, you're not just getting you're not just resolving New York Times dot com.  You're resolving like 30 different ad networks and 30 different tracker sort of URLs.  So, yeah, I noticed an immediate speed up.  So it's going to stay that way until inevitably I start researching the here's how the one point one point one point one six cam worked articles.

Start time: 842.58
End time: 866.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, performance is what CloudFlare is all about.  They are, by the way, we should mention a sponsor. We are big fans.  I've known their CTO, John Graham, coming for many years.  The blog post, which, yes, Matthew Prince, the CEO, wrote on April Fool's Day and admitted, I understand you're going to think this is phony.  But after all, when better to announce one dot one dot one dot one than for one.  There are four ones. Yeah.

Start time: 867.00
End time: 878.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I like the PR team gets a shout out in the next paragraph.  He's like my PR team can remind me that Gmail launched April 1st, but it wasn't Sunday and it wasn't Easter.  That's just go for it, man. Yeah. Do you do you.

Start time: 879.48
End time: 942.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I think this is I think this is going to be very interesting to watch.  Well, I'm sure Steve Gibson will cover it a little bit.  I've probably shift everything to one dot one.  I use open DNS like you, Andy.  But if it's faster, I think this is a kind of really cool.  Thank you, Cloudflare, for providing this.  They said they got the one dot from AP Nick, the Asia Pacific Nick.  And apparently they had it and AP.  Their research group had one dot one dot one dot one and one dot zero zero one.  But the addresses were valid.  But many people had entered them into various random systems.  They were continuously overwhelmed by a flood of garbage traffic.  It's just too easy to enter for ones. Right.  AP Nick wanted to know where it's coming from.  So they so the deal was Cloudflare said, let us do this.  AP Nick said, that's a great idea.  And we will give you information on the garbage traffic you're getting in exchange for being able to put the DNS resolver there.  So I have to say this is good.

Start time: 943.08
End time: 946.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does it have a lot of disclosure about what they're going to be doing with the data?

Start time: 947.30
End time: 948.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you not trust them? You're right.

Start time: 949.02
End time: 954.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a even if we did trust their what is their retention policy?  Are they going to be flushing it once a month, once a week?  Good question.

Start time: 955.50
End time: 967.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The page does notice that does know that they have an outside company that's going to be auditing their data to keep them on the up and up.  So if you don't trust open, if you don't trust them, you hopefully can start to trust the other companies.

Start time: 968.14
End time: 1010.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And after all, Cloudflare's business is not selling advertising, right?  It's not it's not spying on us.  So they're just I mean, their business model is not built around it.  And they've been known to be very good citizens, I think, on the Internet.  They really support people.  They got I remember they got a little bit of heat because Daily Stormer was just about to bring that up.  And at first, Matthew Prince said, I think in a quite principled way, look, we don't want to be responsible for editing the Internet.  And we offer this service to anybody.  And this is, you know, this.  But eventually, I think the pressure he decided, all right, we're going to make an exception.  This is one case where we are going to yank the Daily Stormer.  And he did. But I understand his reluctance because that's a slippery slope, isn't it?

Start time: 1010.28
End time: 1029.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he said we should not have this power.  But he said he did. He woke up angry and just wanted to get him off the Internet.  Yeah. And I can kind of grok both sides of it.  And he also has to run the business.  He's not responsible for the health and safety of the entire Internet and just take care of his company.  But, oh, geez, I'm glad I don't have that responsibility to have a day to day basis, because people come at you with all sorts of things.

Start time: 1029.54
End time: 1037.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and apparently it didn't open a can of worms, which I think would be a reasonable fear that yet.  Yet. Well, that was almost like a year ago.

Start time: 1037.30
End time: 1040.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Basically, that's the that's why we're going to keep going.  Otherwise, I just have to do four ads in a row.  That would be no jokes. That'd be terrible.  That'd be no fun.  Mr. Huggy in our chat room, always a reliable source, said I did a DNS benchmark on one dot and one zero  and Quad nine was faster. But remember, that's at your place.  So it's going to vary everybody.  Steve Gibson offers a benchmark for DNS for free on his website, GRC.com.  I think it'd probably sensible to try different different places and see what see what you get.  Quad nine does something different anyway than Quad one. Quad one already.  We're already got a nickname for Quad one.  Did anybody watch the Apple event on on Tuesday?  Did you? We couldn't watch it because it wasn't live.  Later. Andy was there.  You watched in person. You could watch it.  It was in Chicago. So here we are a few days later.  I have to say that the response has in general been fairly lukewarm.  There's some people excited that you can now use a Apple pencil on an iPad for three hundred twenty nine dollars  on the low end iPad. That's about it, though.  I don't hear people jumping up and down about the new software offerings.  I haven't talked to a lot of educators. Andy, have you heard from anybody about what the education folks are saying about Apple's announcements?

Transcript:  Well, there have always been really two groups of people inside education, the ones who really whatever curriculum they have  or whatever goals they have for the classroom and certainly whatever budget they have for the classroom  makes an iPad at least a possible sort of thing for the class to have and the ones for whom it's just not relevant.  It's and we're not talking about, oh, I favor this over the other.  It's I mean, an iPad is just not relevant.  And because they're dealing with core curriculums, they have they're dealing with requirements for purchasing that really say that if this device  does not have a built in keyboard, you can't buy them because our schools need devices with keyboards.  And to say nothing of how closed the system is for for Apple, how how smaller the marketplace of workers for I.T.  and for content developers are, you can get basically anybody who knows how to make content for a Web browser can develop for Chrome.  However, you need an iOS developer to give you customized content for for your for your iPad.  However, the ones that again, the ones that do have those resources are really, really pleased about it because Apple seems to Apple's goal  wasn't to try to fight back against Chromebook.  It was to make sure that if people are predisposed to getting iPads in their classrooms, they're going to remove the Apple wanted to try to remove as many of the  obstacles as they could possibly do.  And there were so many obstacles.

Start time: 1349.24
End time: 1377.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't think Apple makes any sense in education.  The Chromebook makes much more sense in education.  Not only is it cheaper, it's got a better IT management story to tell.  It's more robust.  It's got a keyboard.  And and more importantly to me, it's more open.  I think the problem, my biggest problem with iPad in classroom is iPad is a closed environment.  You're buying into an ecosystem and the only way it's going to work is if you're Apple everywhere.  Of course, that's good for Apple, but I don't think that's good for education.

Start time: 1378.42
End time: 1384.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The studies the studies I've seen haven't said that the school systems that were using education based on iPads were doing better than Chromebooks.  But there's so many variables associated with that.  It really depends on how how how really, really worked up was the school system was about having an iPad based curriculum.  Or they didn't do more focused things like what if we have Chromebooks for most of the school, but there is there are one or two tracks.  Like there's a there's a there's a learning lab.  There's a language lab or a science lab or physics lab that will have a cart of iPads inside the room.  So I think I think if you're looking to say nothing of the fact that when Apple did big deals with the state of Maine, when they big big deals with Los Angeles, it wound up being huge disasters.  And these were the every kid gets an iPad sort of solutions that I don't think the iPad is really well suited for.

Start time: 1434.02

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm trying to imagine what point in time in high school it would be better for me to have an iPad as opposed to a Chromebook or a kind of equivalent.  And I can't think of a single example.

Transcript:  I got some really interesting emails from people who said you're old.  I get that one every day.  But you're old and you think you still need a keyboard.  Kids today don't need keyboards.  I find that very hard to believe.  Do they not create anything?  You need to write if you're going to get a job even 10 years from now.  I can't imagine that you'll not be at some point keying writing reports and memos and things.  I can't imagine that.  Maybe I am.

Transcript:  If you if you want to if you want to write code using handwriting, go be my guest.  I don't think that's going to work in your class.  No, I mean, people again, it's there's a really good argument to be made that touchscreens are super relevant because the just like the first the first my first interaction with a computer.  Was touching a keyboard and then the generation after me.  The first interaction was by touching a mouse or trackpad.  And then the generations after that, their first interaction with a computer was touching a sheet of glass, touching a touch screen.  So it's not as though that's irrelevant.  But the thing is, nothing has ever really gotten rid of the the basic trinity of keyboard, mouse and screen for for the core computer experience.  So if you're going to have something that your entire curriculum is going to be based around, if you're going to be creating a plan by which each one of the two is going to be based on,  and by which each one of your students has access to a computer, it really has to be something along the lines of a laptop.  Ideally something that in the advertising in the advertising for it basically boasts of how many ounces of milk you can spill into the keyboard before it starts to have a problem.

Transcript:  I also got emails because I was talking about that.  And Apple does have Teacher Tuesday in the Apple stores.  But I think Apple needs to do more than that.  They had in 2014, a hundred million dollar fund to help schools and get equipment and teach teachers.  I think that's really important.  A hundred million doesn't seem like a lot.  I think they need to commit more.  And I don't see any I don't know if they've added to that fund since then.  The L.A. Unified School District wanted to buy a billion iPads, a billion dollars, a billion dollars worth of that.  That was an amazing verbal time.  There is a big difference.  But a billion is a big number either way you look at it.  And they end up suing both Apple and Pearson, the company that was supposed to make the curriculum and never did.  And they got a fairly hefty settlement, a several hundred million dollar settlement in all this.  This was a famous failure.

Start time: 1583.30

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But if the Chromebooks are going to take over more of the education market than the iPads will, which seems to be kind of our consensus here.  Are we seeing kind of a repeat of the old school Mac versus PC argument from the early 90s?  I feel like they're going to give away most of the market to the cheaper, less quality products and then take over kind of the niche smaller part of the markets more specialized.  iPads are great.

Start time: 1602.08
End time: 1684.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, I think what I think is that Apple is going by is reverting to the basic Apple playbook, which is to especially with the Mac.  They understand that there's no way that they're going to ever have more than 10 or 12 percent of the market.  And so their job is to sell Macs and MacBooks to the people that 12 percent of the people for whom Windows either doesn't work for them or they don't like them or they were never going to be.  They're not adaptable for Windows anyway.  And make sure that those people who buy those 12 percent of the people get the best experience that those 12 percent possibly can.  So I think that that's where they're going for for education now, where they know that they really can't compete with with Chromebooks.  But there is maybe going to be, I don't know, five percent, six percent, seven percent of schools that have a place for iPads in their curriculum.  And let's make sure that those five, six, seven percent will have the best experience possible.  They'll say that there's a reason why we went iPad and not Chromebook.  It's not because they're interchangeable.  It was because we have plans for using computer and education, at least for this track, for this class that really couldn't be met by a Chromebook.  So that's that's why when I saw the immediate response at all, this is this is not going to save Apple's experience and education.  It's not going to matter. I agree with both of those.  Yes, I don't I don't think that was right.  Remember that Apple Apple has the minority of phones out there.  They seem to be making a pretty good chunk of change off the iPhone anyway.  So it works for them. Yeah.

Start time: 1685.58
End time: 1692.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Number two is very profitable, but they did cut the price of the Apple pencil from ninety nine to eighty nine dollars for education.  Now that is a hefty discount.

Start time: 1693.18
End time: 1763.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, multiply that by five hundred and multiply it by a thousand and suddenly and then translate that into how many iPads you can now buy with the money you saved.  Really? In the people, there's that's why you also can't complain about the race to the bottom, so to speak, on Chromebooks.  That if you can save ten bucks on a Chromebook again, when you're buying five hundred, a thousand of these, that's that means that suddenly forty kids get Chromebooks that wouldn't have been able to get them before.  So, yeah, but it's the big the other big thing, though, is that I'm with the addition of Apple pencil to this three hundred and twenty nine dollar consumer, 32 gigabyte iPad with a modern CPU.  I finally feel as though Apple at least has a credible answer to the question.  Why doesn't Apple have any any computers for people who are in the budget range?  It's not it's not a replacement for a notebook, but at least you can say it's not nothing.  It's not a it's not a it's not a water soluble computer thrown together just to make a certain price point.  It's actually a really good computer that gives an experience that three hundred and four hundred dollar Windows machine or Chromebook can't deliver.  I would still love to see them make a MacBook that is affordable.  I don't think we're ever going to see that, but I'm glad to see that they're bringing good features to the bottom of the line iPad, at least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll take that argument. And I I didn't think of the small dollar differential over a multi unit kind of by being that important.  But you're right. So I was being a bit rude, but still a ten dollar discount.  They can do better than that. Why not cut it like 20 bucks?

Transcript:  Right. That's the same reason why you can't just add a Bluetooth keyboard to an iPad and meet the requirement that a computer in the school has to have a keyboard.  They really are concerned that if you have if you have Bluetooth active, then kids were using these during exams are going to use Bluetooth to swap answers, which would totally have happened when I was a kid.  We went to we went to the store and got bought those sharp.  I remember for one exam, we actually bought those sharp data bank watches that actually attached to a keyboard because the store had a 30 day return policy.  So we we cleaned out our we cleaned out our savings account, bought these watches and loaded up the watches with like all the dates and times of things.

And I'm sure a lot of kids would jump for joy that they were getting an iPad.  Although one of the problems the L.A. Unified School District had is the kids immediately hacked the iPads.  So now I'm sure Apple has a better system now.  But at the time in 2014, the the apples had a profile for the kid that would lock it down.

Tim and Don from ITProTV love these guys.  They came to me some years ago.  They were IT trainers and they had been at a panel I was on, an NAB, in which I'm kind of promoting the idea of Twitter and what we do.  And there should be lots of niche, you know, internet-based, basically TV stations.  And they came up and said, would you mind if we basically did what you do for IT training?  I said, mind?  I think that'd be awesome.  ITProTV was born and man, as an effective, now 90,000 members strong, not just individuals, a lot of teams as well.  I know the Harvard IT department signed up for ITProTV.  It's great if you're not yet in IT, but you want to take the tests, get the certs and get that first job in IT.  And that's kind of the initial idea of it.  But it also is a great way to keep your skills up to date, to add new skills, to get new certs.  And man, do they have a lot of content, 3,300 hours of on-demand content.  And they're always making more.  They have five studios now.  They're doing 125 new hours every single week.  They do much as, as you can see in the video, if you're watching it, much as we do, they have really cool-looking studios, great teachers and presenters,  and a chat room going at the same time so you can interact with the teachers as they're giving the courses.  There's Don.  And it's really a great training class from CompTIA to Cisco to AWS, even things like Kali Linux and Certified Ethical Hacker.  They have you covered.  This is a great field to get into.  If you're listening to the show, I know you're into tech.  If you're thinking about a career change, did you know there are one million open jobs in security, in IT security right now, right now, awaiting for somebody?  Get the certs, get the skills, get the job.  You can watch ITProTV on anything you've got.  They've got Roku, Apple TV, Fire TV apps.  They've got Android apps, iOS apps.  You can watch on a Chromecast.  You can even download courses for on-the-go learning.  This is not one of those boring voiceover slides snooze fest.  This is engaging, interactive IT training, your team, and you will actually enjoy watching.  And by the way, if you have a team, the team portal is great.  You get control over the schedule and you can track results.  You can see metrics like logins, viewing time, courses viewed, tracks completed.

A premium, just to give you a sense, a premium subscription and that's the top of the line.  That includes the Transcender practice exams.  That's worth, I think, 90 bucks by itself.  The virtual labs, which means you don't have to have say Windows Server 2019 is coming out, right?  You don't have to have it.  All you need is an HTML5 browser and you could set up the server, set up the clients.  I like that because when I screw things up and I always do, I just close the browser window and no one will know.  No harm, no foul.  Premium subscriptions include the virtual labs, the Transcender practice exams.  Normally that'd be $857 a year, which I still think is a great price.  But use the offer code TWIT30, $600 a year, $50 a month.  That's cheaper than buying the materials, let alone going to a technical school.  This is better.  Flexible training, binge-worthy content, ROI proven, ITPro.tv slash twit.  Use the offer code TWIT30 and join the 90,000 folks now learning to be IT professionals at ITPro.tv.  On we go with the show.  Let's see. We did April Fool's Day.  We did Apple's event.  I thought it was kind of interesting.  I don't know if I have this article.  I saw that the FBI, remember the San Bernardino shooter where the FBI went to Apple said unlock the phone.  It might have been an internicing battle going on because one division of the FBI said, oh, yeah, we could unlock it.  But they just never told the other division.  FBI sued Apple to unlock phone says tech crunch without considering all the options.  Apparently, it really was more about getting the word out and getting some heat on Apple than actually unlocking that phone.  We thought it was the case, right?

Transcript:  No, no, I was going to say they really want this precedent.  They really want this to be tried in court.  They really want a judge to say that the FBI has a right to, excuse me, that the makers of technology have an obligation to break through encryption.  At the same time this came out, the FBI was once again throwing their shorts on fire  about how important it is that this is a dark moment for law enforcement because Google and Facebook and Apple and they're all in cahoots with criminals and letting them to continue to do their jobs.  They're also citing things that turned out to be really just research from certain people who are saying that there is a way to do some sort of a backdoor that would be only a disaster, not a complete, utter, unmitigated disaster.  Or there's or other researchers that are saying there might be a way that you could put a backdoor encryption on live communications like live chat, texting, texting, video screen, screen, excuse me, video streaming.  But you could have a different sort of encryption on file encryption so that you could protect one but not the other.  But this that that once again really shows you they are going to keep at this and they're going to keep at this until they get a judge to say those magic words.  Apple, you are commanded by the federal judge, by this federal judge to help the FBI crack open this phone and then God help us all.

Transcript:  So there and we talked about this last week but not with you guys so I'll bring it up again.  There was a National Academy of Sciences panel.  Ray Ozzie was on it.  Former Chief Software Architect at Microsoft, Stefan Savage.  I'm going to call it that because that's a good name.  It could be Savage.  Stefan Savage, computer science professor at UC San Diego, Ernie Burkel, former CSO at Intel.  And they proposed that it might be what if, what if, here's a question for you guys.  What if there were a way to create a secure enclave on a phone that had a key that Apple, let's say, could unlock that would only unlock that phone?  So the law enforcement goes to Apple, says we want this phone unlocked.  It would not extend to Wesley's phone or your phone or anybody else's.  It would just to the bad guy's phone.  What if we could do that?  Wouldn't that be?  I'd still be against it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, OK, so yeah, presume they have access to the phone because you have to have access to get the enclave opened up.  So Apple.  So it's a double key.  Imagine a safe.  And there's a box, a strong box outside the safe that has a key in it.  Only Apple has the key to that key.  That key unlocks just that safe.  Apple, upon being provided with a proper appropriate process.  Now that may be an issue, too, after the cloud act.  But let's set that aside.  Apple, with being provided with appropriate warrant, says, OK, we're going to unlock that box here.  Law enforcement.  This is the key.  But it's not as we have been concerned about the key to all the phones, just the key to this phone.  But then China, Russia.

Start time: 2741.71
End time: 2843.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is bad.  And the bad people will still find a better, will basically use just illegal encryption to get their job done.  For me, though, it's a much bigger thing.  I think that this is a foundational principle that we've never in, at least in this country, in 200 and some odd years,  we have never had to answer this question before because it's never been possible to have a real secret from the government before that's been written down.  Do you have the right to have a secret from the government?  Yes.  The the the.  And so everything, all laws proceeding this are based on if you put it in a safe, then we can blow up the safe and get it.  So we're going to let you put in the safe or we're going to let you shred it because we can help.  We can put that back together again.  We will not stop you from trying to secure or destroy your data now.  But if if there is a way for me to encrypt my data such that law enforcement cannot get it for me when the FBI says that this should not be a lot be allowed to me.  And I'm not saying this in a in a in a in a stockpiling toilet paper and canned goods in a shack in the woods.  I feel I feel as though this is overreach from the government.  I feel as though I have the right to have a secret that the government cannot get if I choose to protect it in that fashion.  It doesn't matter what that secret is.  So that's why, in addition to all the far more simple reasons that, again, if someone if you have if you think that only the good guys are going to be able to get at this data, you're wrong.  It just will fail eventually.  I just think that it's a basic right that if I want to lock something up so that I can have a secret that the government cannot get, that's a basic right.  It's scary to me if the government say you're not allowed to write something down that we can't read.  That's bad.

Transcript:  And we have a right to privacy as interpreted by the Supreme Court.  It's a very important bit of our kind of court law.  And I think we should respect that.  Not in the Constitution, but it was read from the Constitution.  It's not an exact phrase.  But also if you read back to 1984, I know it's everyone's favorite example of this.  You cannot even in your apartment, Winston can actually get away from the screen that can see him.  And that's that constant feeling of being watched.  I think you're right.  If you don't have the ability to put something away yourself, nothing feels secure.  You'll definitely act differently.  It's poisonous.  It's anti-democratic.  It's bad.

Transcript:  It's also the panopticon.  Yeah.  And that's I mean, the panopticon was this 19th century conception that you could build a prison where prisoners wouldn't know whether they're being observed or not.  But they could assume that at some point they were being observed.  And so they acted as if they were always being observed.  And in the mind of the jailers, that meant that they would always behave.  But of course, as we know, that's not how it works out when it happens.

Start time: 2904.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  But I think a lot of us maybe watching right now are not as full of confidence in our government as we have been in recent half decades, say.

So it's not yet the rule of the land, but I think this is, I'm not a lawyer, I'm not sure what the rules are,  but I think this is the first step to making it a rule of the land.  Customs and Border Patrol is going to ask any, let me see if I can find the notice.  Visa applicants.  Any visa applicants.  This is even if a tourist visa.  This is not just to live here.

Whether the applicant's been deported or removed from any country,  whether specified family members have been involved in terrorist activities, all that I understand.  But really, they need the tweets.  They need all the tweets.  And that is going to be, you said you saw Crissade.  Yes.  Or you talked to him.  He's in Australia.  Former head of product at Uber.

It really is about these enforcement agencies are trying to convince themselves that they can predict invisible future terrorists based on who they've been colluding with and where they've been traveling in the past.  And so it really does, even though person X traveling to the country is absolutely no threat whatsoever, that could be the reason why five years later on, another innocent person Y gets detained and gets special searching.  And now they don't know why they're in this database that causes them to never be able to get back into the country again or to be held for three hours at a checkpoint.  Because some algorithm has said that you are in some sort of Venn diagram of people that has had enough incidental contact without maybe without even their knowledge with with people that we think are terrorists that we can't trust these people.  That's the never they'll never find out about it.  They'll never never be able to fix it and they'll never be able to escape it.  So that's why the stuff is can be really scary.

And back to Andy's comment, I just I don't want the government to really build this muscle.  This is not something I want them to get good at.  I mean, this is a relatively early look at what they could do with this down the road for all of us.  But it's naive or not.  But I just don't want them to get better at it.

So you're not on Facebook or you just, what did you do?  I'm deactivated on Facebook for the last couple of months and I haven't missed it a single time.  But I wasn't a big messenger user, so I've gotten kind of lucky about that.  Now, Leo is taking a picture of his face.  You can tell by the expression he's making.  He makes the duck face.  That's the duck.  Yeah, I know.  It's quite kissy, if I may.  So if you're not watching the video, you're missing out, but it is.  That is top notch.

I said, I know it's for communicating with my editors and doing research.  How much time can I spend before I go over?  Then they laughed.

That's why you recognize that.  See, that's what I grew up with.  You might have noticed I'm pouring myself a little glass of wine.  I see that.  The show is going downhill.  No, because my Wink came.  Wink is our sponsor for this portion of This Week in Tech, and it's the best way to discover  new wines you will love.  Wink is a winery, W-I-N-C. It's a winery.  What I love about it is it's great wine.  They make wine from all over the world, and it is a great way to get to know new wines,  to have wines for your...  There's four bottles a month subscription.  Of course, you can take a month off and that kind of thing, but that's just about right  for me.  We have a week for dinner on Fridays, right?  Then maybe one week we bring a nice bottle of wine.  This one's always popular with the weather heating up.  Here's a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc.  This is from our most recent shipment.  You might bring that to a party like for Easter.  We should bring this for the Easter dinner tonight.  Outer Sounds from Marlborough, New Zealand.  I love these Wink wines.  We went down and we met the winemaker.  This is an Albariño, which is a really nice varietal.  This one comes from California, but it's based on an Italian style white.  You can choose.  Here's what I want you to do.  If you go to T-R-Y-W-I-N-C.com, trywink.com slash twit, and you can go through the taste  test.  They'll ask you questions.  It's called a palate profile test.  They'll ask you questions like, do you like coffee or how do you like it?  How do you like your coffee, Wesley?  Do you drink it?  I don't drink coffee.  Do not drink it.  There you go.  There's that on there.  How do you like salt?  Do you use salt?  Of course you use salt.  Yes.  Do you like it on everything all the time?  No.  Citrus?  How do you feel?  Mushrooms?  Don't do shrooms.  Okay.  You don't like the earthy, but I bet you like the berries.  Do you like the berries?  Yes.  Blueberry?  I do.  And everything all the time?  Yep.  Peppers?  You're from Austin.  You better like the pepper.  There you go.  Sometimes they make recommendations.  There's a little slider there you can have, all red, all white or anything in between  so you get to choose what you like.  We've got a half and half here.  This is from, it's called Cape Root.  This is a South African wine from the Western Cape.  Oh man.  I just, so you're going to try wines you've never tried before.  This is a whole lot better than going to the grocery store or Trader Joe's or even a liquor  store and saying, ah, pick that one.  That's no way to choose a wine.  This is great.  Little French wine.  You got this one, didn't you Lisa?  She loves the French wines.  A Merlot Pie d'Or from Indication Géographique Protégée Produit de France.  I'm going to drink right now a little bit of this.  This is something we just had.  Look at the, I love the labels too.  They get local artists to do the labels.  They're beautiful.  Each month new delicious wines.  You're going to definitely want to get that summer water rose.  That is one of their most popular wines.  No membership fees.  You can skip any month.  You can cancel any time and shipping is covered.  And here's the best part.  I said, well, what if I don't like one of these?  They said, no problem.  I said, I don't want to ship it back.  They said, no, no, no, no, we're not going to make you ship it back.  We just send you another bottle.  No questions asked.  So you know, you're never stuck with something you don't like.  You'll get four bottles you love every single month.  Why settle for the same bottle of wine you always get?  Discover great wine today.  Try Wink.com slash twit.  Twenty dollars off your first shipment.  If you can buy individual bottles, if you really want to taste a great wine, Leo's pick  for the week.  Okay.  Is that okay if I do that?  Field theory.  You know how much we love it?  We're all out.  We are all out, right?  We tried to have some last night.  I said I could use a glass of that field.  It comes in this cute little bottle.  It's so it's kind of like this, but it's a red.  So good.  Oh, wait a minute.  This is field theory white.  They have a white.  This is the albino field theory.  Oh, so which one do we have?  Field theory red.  So I have to try the albino now.  Try Wink.  Here's to you.  Try Wink.com slash twit.  Twenty dollars off your first shipment.  T R Y W I N C dot com.  Try Wink.com slash twit.  Oh, that is so good.  You know what I realized and I think I really can credit Wink with this, that wine is actually  an ingredient in a meal.  That when you have wine that's properly matched to what you're eating, you take a bite of  the food and a sip of the wine and you guys don't understand this.  Oh, I do.  You understand it way too well.  And it's like an ingredient and it can actually make the flavor just go boom in your mouth.  That's probably not the best way to describe it, but that's how I'm going to do it.  Try Wink.com slash twit.  Andy, if you were here, I'd pour you a glass.  I know you would.  These are glasses that a fan brought us.  These are hand blown.  It's like Venetian glass.  Aren't they beautiful?  He brought us twenty of them or something.

It actually put me on a whiskey to begin with.  It was a gift when I gave a talk in Dublin, Ireland.  It used to be only produced in, it used to be you could only get it in Ireland and they  started exporting it, but you have to find a place that can get it for you.  And it was so good.  I sampled a glass there and it was so good I thought, okay, I'm going to pay the money  to check my carry on bag.  I'm going to wrap this in lots and lots of laundry.

It's going to air April 6th, but I guess some people from The Verge were there, Lauren Good,  writing about it.  And of course, Tim took this as an opportunity to talk about privacy.  This is really going to be increasingly Apple's selling point, right?  We don't have to care.  We sell hardware.  We don't have to follow you around.  We don't have to surveil you.  Cook...  Lauren says, MSNBC's Hayes and Swisher pressed Cook on the issue of privacy and regulation.  I don't know if when you throw somebody a softball, is that called pressing?  It's called helping, I think, actually.  Cook said, we've never believed that these detailed profiles of people that have incredibly  deep personal information that is patched together from several sources should exist.  He said they could be abused against their democracy.  It could be abused by advertisers as well.  See, I don't mind advertisers giving me ads for stuff I might be interested in.

He talks about those two big competitors.  He doesn't talk about what I feel is the larger threat from advertisers and from marketers,  from just being on the web that they're collecting all these kind of data from you.  I'm really very disappointed that he can be giving a talk at a tech conference in China  and talk about how privacy and fighting against Facebook is important.  But I have never seen him make a statement about here is the line with China and other  large governments that likes to use technology to control its people and make you disappear  ways sometimes.  I've not seen him make a statement about saying here is where the line is drawn.  Here is where we withdraw from the China market if they ask us to comply with a law that we  feel is going to subscript our iPhones into harming Chinese citizens.

I was outlining one of the problems.  But I mean, like that's the sort of moral decision you have to make.

Transcript:  If they're going to make that change, they may as well bring it stateside.  And because another organization they're cozying up to is, of course, the current presidential  administration, they might be able to get some good vibes from them.  I'm not suggesting this would be an easy thing for them to do.  I'm not suggesting that they need to pull out of China.  I'm just saying that I'm getting more and more impatient with Tim Cook's silence on,  But at what point does a government say,  we need the iPhone to be able to track our citizens this way,  or we need your iPhones to be able to control this,  or if we need to find somebody or if we need to find out what somebody has been up to,  we need your iPhones to be able to give us this data.  At what point do you say, no, you don't get that.  And if you kick us out of your country, we simply pull out of your country.  I just need some sort of statement that there is a line that Apple will not cross.  And I'm surprised that at this point, they haven't made it yet.

If you ask human rights leaders or human rights groups about what the responsibilities of companies like Facebook and Apple are,  they will actually say that they can do a lot of good for the people by being a presence,  by being at least a compromised form of a communication network that didn't exist before is better than having no ability to communicate with each other at all.

Transcript:  So I tried to explain this on Wednesday and made a hash of it.  Let me try again.  This goes back to Google's use of Java in Android.  Of course, they didn't use Java.  API.  They copied Java and they copied more particularly the Java API, because if you're going to be  a program and you think you're sitting on Java, not Google's version of Java, you need  to make Java calls.  So Google said, well, fine, you make a standard Java call will respond in a standard way,  but it'll be our code.  That doesn't require a license from Oracle.  Oracle begged to differ and took them to court eight years ago.

Start time: 5227.14
End time: 5227.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For $8.8 billion.

Start time: 5229.68
End time: 5327.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Eight years ago.  And then Oracle lost.  And then they did an interesting thing.  They decided to make the case not be about using Android, but really about using a copyrighted  API.  And this got very interesting, very fast.  They lost.  Google lost in that case, the court ruling.  I think this is for it's so hard to follow this four years ago.  I remember Judge Alsop, who learned Java so that he could write some Java code.  And then he ruled in favor of Google.  But then on appeal, the federal circuit, which is the Washington, D.C. federal appeals  court, which is often very much more in favor of IP holders.  They have a reputation of being very strongly in favor of copyright holders.  They ruled in favor of Oracle.  Google appealed to the Supreme Court, which declined to review, sending it back, but saying,  here's the issue.  Is it fair use?  So there's no question now the courts have held and the Supreme Court has refused to  review the notion you can copyright an API.  That's done.  The only defense Google had was, well, but OK, but it was fair use.  And now the appeals court again in D.C. has said, no, wasn't fair use.  You owe Oracle, Oracle, Oracle, Oracle, 8.8 billion dollars.

Start time: 5327.68
End time: 5332.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5332.88
End time: 5343.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that's done.  I think the Supreme Court is the one that sent it back to the district court saying  rule on the fair use thing.  I don't think there is.  I think that's done.  But maybe not.

Transcript:  I remember talking to Jonathan Schwartz.  He was the CEO of Sun and was at Sun when Sun was sold to Oracle.  And among the things that were transferred over was Java.  And he said, we have to pull this up, Karsten, from the triangulation interview because it  was very interesting.  He said, I remember these discussions when the Oracle folks came and sat down with Sun.  And I was really kind of surprised because they really didn't seem that interested in  Java.  What was really exciting to the lawyers, they were practically rubbing their hands in glee,  was the intellectual property rights.  Oh, we could sue that one.  We could go.  We could go.  And I think they really wanted to go after Google right there in that.  Just for the cash grab.  And that's what they saw as the value of Sun.  It wasn't Java.  It wasn't Solaris.  It wasn't.  We haven't heard in a while.  It was the property rights, the intellectual property rights.  That's really what was going on from day one.  So that's really what the point of this all was.  Now it's a shame because frankly, APIs need to be uncopyrightable.  That's to do their job.  You need, I think, Google is likely to, according to Bloomberg technology, ask that either the  three judge panel at the district court reconsider its decision.

Transcript:  Do over.  Or have the issue go before all the active judges?  I guess the issue was maybe all the judges weren't there.  The losing party could then ask the Supreme Court to take the case.  And that's what Google supporters are calling for.  So yes, your answer is it could go back to the Supreme Court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He gets all the good ones.  He's in, I guess, the Ninth Circuit.  He's in Silicon Valley location.  The fact that Android is free of charge does not make Google's use of the Java API packages  non-commercial.  That was Google's defense.  It's non-commercial.  We don't charge for Android.  The three-judge Federal Circuit panel noted that Android had generated more than $42 billion  in revenue.  You can't really, you know.  We don't charge anything for it.  It's free.  Yeah.  And Google didn't alter the copyrighted material in any way.  They just used it.  So actually Oracle's apparently going to ask for more than $8.8 billion.

I mean we have an API that we publish and allow people to use to their heart's content  for our backend.  So if people want to make a twit app, a podcast app, they can make API calls and populate  the information from our servers.  Now that's a normal use of an API.  If somebody said I'm going to duplicate the twit API and write my own backend, that's  nuts to say, oh you can't do that.  So you wouldn't care?  Well, I don't want to say that in case somebody does and we can sue them for $42 billion.  I don't think you would generate that much revenue though.

If you're buying a home and you're not writing a check for the total amount, which certainly  in this area you wouldn't be doing, I think in most areas, you might need a home loan  or maybe you've got a home loan and you want to lock in the low interest rate as interest  rates go up, now's the time to go to Quicken Loans, the number one lender in the country  and try out Rocket Mortgage, the modern 21st century way to get a home loan.

All right, we need a loan.  Okay, watch.  You go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit2 on your phone.  You could do this on your phone, any browser and you answer a few questions.  You don't even need to go to the attic.  You don't even know the brain attic because you know the answers, home address, birth  date, that kind of thing.  And then thanks to their relationships, Quicken Loans relationships with all the big financial  institutions, all you have to do is give them permission.  They'll get the information they need.  You don't have to go to the attic.  They'll do it for you.  Crunch the numbers and under 10 minutes, I mean, while you're at the open house, you  will be offered based on income, assets and credit, all the home loan options for which  you qualify.  You choose the rate, the term, the down payment.  They say approved.  You're done.  You can hold it up, show the realtor, hey, we're good for the loan amount.  We'd like to make an offer.  By the way, I have some experience in this.  That really puts you at the head of the line.  If you're coming there with a mortgage approval already, that's the way to make an offer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You too, Alex?  The whole book was a bunch of cliches strung together with odd cultural references.  But the reason why the book worked for me in the end was that it had a huge creative  vision and a lot of problems.  So if you were willing to look at the vision of what would life be like if we all lived  in a virtual world because the real world was bad, fun, if you got bogged down in the  70s or 80s references, whatever the heck that was going on the entire time, it was awful.

Anyway, I saw the movie last night, Steven Spielberg.  Now he's been getting mixed reviews in the New York Times.  What was it?  The quote in the New York Times is a hoot.  Something like, let me see if I can find it because it's about as they're throwing shade.  Keep going, Karsten.  It's the last line of, no, no.  No, I don't know.  This is web browsing by the Braille method.  I know.  I got to find it because it's the funniest line.  What's the gist of the...  That Steven Spielberg is simultaneously the best person and the worst person to make this  movie.  He's the best person because he is an 80s icon himself.  In fact, he can parody his own movies in there.  On the other hand, they feel like, I think they felt like he may be...  I don't know.  I'm not sure what they said.  It was...  Let's see if I can find this because it's...

Transcript:  Well, I saw it last night and I loved it.  I want to apologize because A, the movie was really good and the story and you're right.  I think Alex, maybe the thing I liked about it was the, it was an interesting idea, conception.  I'm going back and reading the novel and I apologize also to Ernest Cline who not only  wrote the novel but co-wrote the screenplay for us.  Oh, I didn't know that.  That's fascinating.  Yeah, and he was a producer.  So he had a lot of hand in this.  Spielberg was just right for it because it felt like an 80s Spielberg, feel-good ending  Spielberg movie.

Start time: 6267.94
End time: 6365.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is what's really throwing me off of it though.  I remember I've been going to the MIT Flea Market every month since like the 90s.  I've seen nostalgia affect markets and how sad it becomes when you realize that the reason  why, wow, the thing that keeps coming back to my mind is like vintage radios.  You go to MIT Flea Market and there'd be a dozen people with tables full of brilliant,  beautiful vintage radios you couldn't possibly afford because when I was a kid going to the  MIT Flea Market, the people who were like in their 40s and 50s and 60s who remember  radios in their parents' houses growing up wanted to buy and wanted to re-experience  what they had growing up.  And then like in the 2000s and 20 teens, suddenly these same radios that were going for like  hundreds of dollars were going for like $25, $10, $50 because all the people who were  nostalgic about that sort of stuff had died or gone into nursing homes.  And so I think what's bothering me about Ready Player One and to an extent like all the emulation  of old games and old systems is that now I'm in that 40s, 50s, 60s demographic.  And it's like, are these things popular?  Because again, we want to recapture all of our childhoods.  And then in 10 years time, nobody's going to care about it because we'll all be dead.  And so nostalgia is such a boring concept.  It's like, I'm hoping that if I went to see this movie, it won't be, hey, I recognize  that that car, hey, I recognize that guy.  I want it to be a really good story.

Start time: 6365.16
End time: 6477.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And nostalgia is completely peripheral to the story.  It doesn't. It's there without being in any way a critical part, except and I don't  want to give you any spoilers, so I won't say there is one exception.  It's actually the most important part of the movie does rely on something that brought  me back to my younger days.  I was actually much older than you at the time, Alex, but I don't know how I can describe  this. It involved playing a game on the Atari 2600 and appropriately enough for Easter  Sunday, the very first Easter egg ever.  Right. And yeah, you know it from the novel.  I think I know you're talking about.  Yeah. And to me, I remember vividly.  So there was a nostalgic moment for me playing this game, looking for this Easter egg very  much. This was this was a big deal.  So in that sense, there was some nostalgia, but it isn't it isn't a nostalgia fest.  And there's some really good performances.  Mark Rylance, who is one of my favorite actors and normally plays prestige roles, plays a  nerd. He plays a job.  You say how they well, he plays basically an on the  spectrum nerd. And it's it's really well done.  And it's quite funny. And at first I'm going, who the hell is that?  That's Mark Rylance. But he's really good.  He's really, really good at this. I agree.  The leads are kind of bland, but they're supposed to be.  It's a young adult kind of fiction kind of thing.  Well, here's the New York Times quote.  Steven Spielberg is the only person who could have made this movie and the last person who  should have been allowed near the material.  They also conclude and I think this probably the New York Times is strangely ambivalent  in all of this. I think they feel guilty because they wrote a follow up article that said  and it made a billion dollars.  It says Ready Player One is far from a masterpiece, but as the fanboys say, it's canon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It is a dodge. It is a little bit of a dodge.  The Times feels guilty because their headline today is Ready Player One overcomes challenges  to dominate box office.  And the first line is Steven Spielberg aced his test.  He's 71.  But I think he did a really good job with this movie.

End time: 6559.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK. So the nerd is the guy who made it.  Yeah.  And he is a central part of it.  But one of the things they say is that nearly everybody takes place in Columbus, Ohio,  which is unaccountably the fastest growing city in the world at this time.  That's what they say at the beginning of the movie, which is bizarre.  No, well, there's a reason.  I don't want to get into it.  There's a reason why it's the fastest growing.  But the people they say in it, everybody plays at least a little bit every day.  Yeah.  And what you see as you go down the streets is everybody's wearing their V.R.  5 shirts all the time.

Start time: 6560.52
End time: 6570.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But also inside the world, keeping this really generic, there are certain people who take  part in the V.R. world as a social event and some that search inside of it for a specific  set of things.  Right.  Right.  And that's that's big enough.

Start time: 6571.32
End time: 6621.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the nostalgia that comes to it, because well, I don't know how we can talk about this  without spoiling something.  The nostalgia is an artifact of what's going on.  It is not something that's normal in society.  In fact, it says very clearly in the first pages of the book, nobody knew or care about  the 80s until.  And I'll leave the until on set because I don't want to spoil it for you.  Yeah, that's a teaser.  It's a great movie.  Now I have to go watch it.  Yeah, you have to go see it.  I plan on watching it.  OK, here's some weird tidbits that I got from our home theater expert, Scott Wilkinson.  I thought, well, this must have been shot on digital, right?  Thirty five millimeter.  No way.  So Steven Spielberg.  And then I said, well, but at least the CGI, which is probably half the movie, that must  be UHD.  No, no CGI in any movie is more than 1080p.  It would be too costly and time consuming.

Transcript:  So this is a study from a reliable organization, the federal government, the US National Toxicology Program.  It was a study designed in 2009 that has concluded they exposed rats for two years to cell phone radiation.  What's weird about this is the results of the study as published said that there were equivocal.  To understand this, you need to understand how the US National Toxicology Program rates evidence.  There are four different levels.  There's no evidence, which is we can't draw any conclusion from the study.  Equivocal evidence, which means, well, it's hard to say some evidence and clear evidence.  The study itself said that there were equivocal evidence that the cell phones had caused tumors in the hearts of male rats and female rats.  Yeah.  Go ahead, Andy.

Start time: 6774.20
End time: 6891.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I read the study or at least the dumbed down version, but the official dumbed down version.  And so there's a lot of, there's a lot of reason not to be terribly worried.  It's a study that tells you that there should be more study.  They tested it on male rats, female rats, male mice and female mice.  They subjected us what they could only have done, which is essentially, it's like being immersed in a bath of the type of radio signals you would  experience that 2G and 3G phones, not 4G and LTE phones emit.  And so it's essentially like, imagine you're in a, you're in a, you're on a sunbed and the entire, instead of fluorescent tubes, it's like all one huge phone.  But they found, so they found tumors in the male rats, not significant tumors in the female rats or in the mice at all.  They also found, but they also found other effects that were affecting the male rats in other biological ways.  It wasn't so, and the dosage was at the maximum that is permittable.  So it's not as though they're doing 10 times, a hundred times, a thousand times the dosage, but the exposure was something like 10 minute intervals with an accumulation of like nine hours per day.  So we're talking about a test that is definitely applicable to male rats, not necessarily applicable to other rodents, but definitely says that the language as it is, is absolutely correct.  That if you're asking, did exposure to phone radiation create tumors in the test subject or did it not?  It did.  And should we say that it clearly created results?  Yes, it did.  As opposed to, it's in some, but not others.  No, definitely in this situation, they caused some biological badness to happen in male rats, but it wasn't enough to start people getting concerned about using their phones.

Transcript:  So here's the thing that is interesting and I think deserves more examination.  They're going to submit this, by the way, to the FDA.  The FDA will then decide what recommendations to make.  That hasn't happened yet.  The original paper, as submitted and published earlier this year, said the results were equivocal.  By the way, that matches pretty much every study ever done on this.  It's hard to say there's a connection.  It's equivocal means we're not sure.  We don't know.  In other words, it's non-conclusive.  And that's what every study has said so far.  And that's what this study said until last week.  Then the National Institutes of Health, which does a peer review session on this stuff, brought together brain and heart pathologists, toxicologists, biostatisticians, engineers, a panel of peer reviewers.  They did something unprecedented.  Traditionally, typically, when an NTP studies peer reviewed like this, the peer reviews just say, yeah, you're right.  At best, they might send it back and say there's some methodology issues, but they never upgrade.  In this case, they upgraded.  The peer review took equivocal and reevaluated the data, upgraded several of the conclusions to some evidence and, and this is the one that's concerning, clear evidence.  So the peer review said, you know, this, this is a good study.  It's accurate.  And we feel that it's significant enough that we're going to upgrade these findings.  I don't know what to say about this.  All I, all I can say is I feel like it's our responsibility to bring it up because we have said for years, even though people have said, well, there could be, I would be prudent.  I would be prudent, but we've said there's never been a study after study over decades now.  There's never been anything to say there's a link.  This is the first time and I think it's appropriate to say it.  We should mention it.

Transcript:  But when we got to the point where I can say, I got to the point where I said, OK, well, I can kind of see that is that large emitting electrical equipment can cause a current or electrical interference.  So I wonder, depending on the proximity of the waves to the equipment emitting the waves, the equipment itself could also be doing this to the rats and not just the waves.  Because if the equipment is pulling a current that changes, I mean, our bodies are full of electrical signals.  And if it's changing that and interacting with that through the magnetic waves or with a current, if you push enough current through it, that could be causing some of the problems if it's emitting like 2G signals and stuff like that.

Transcript:  I'm going to have to I have to defer to you have to defer to the peer review committee and presume that these people are experts.  And that's the kind of thing that they eliminated.  I don't see any political gain for them to recommend this.  In fact, I'm sure there's pressure to say otherwise.  Right. Huge.  Because there's a huge economic incentive to say cell phones are safe.  So, you know, I think that the other thing we know, and this is part of what you were talking about, Wesley, is that that it's the inverse square law that the farther away the radiation gets, the source gets it drops very rapidly by the inverse of the square.

Transcript:  But I remember climbing Sutro Tower, the big TV tower in San Francisco, an engineer took me up there and I came back down and I had white spots all over my hands.  And he said, oh, yeah, no big deal.  There's radiation burns from the tower.  And he said, we get those all the time.  And then but they changed the law like a month later to make you wear a metal mesh suit when you go up there from now on.  So, yes, proximity and the amount of power that's 100,000 and time of exposure, time of exposure, all of that's relevant.  What the FDA will recommend, I don't know.  But I think at this point, anybody who carries a cell phone might want to just shouldn't be sleeping on it.  A lot of people take it to bed with them.

But nonetheless, you're talking about so we're not really worried that much about people holding their phones against their heads because how often do you do that?  But if you're carrying your phone like in an inside jacket pocket, realize that it's the radios are working even when you're not having a phone call take place.  So it's possible that if you are carrying that there for 12 to 18 hours a day over time, this is this is why scientists look good.

Scientists have demonstrated you should be careful about your cell phone.  Like, well, no, they haven't.

I always like to end with happy news.  The FCC has approved SpaceX's plan to launch four thousand four hundred twenty five satellites for a broadband network that will blanket the earth in radiation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is why I don't want Elon Musk to end up in a cardboard box with a tear stained face saying bankwapped saying bankwapped because I want SpaceX to do this.  They'll have to start launching a lot of them if they're going to get four thousand four hundred twenty five up.  The the part of the agreement says that they will launch at least half of these satellites within six years.  So the FCC says, yeah, but you got to get two thousand two hundred of them up quick.  The Falcon launch, I didn't know this carried two SpaceX test satellites for global broadband.  This service is going to be called Starlink.  That's awesome. I love that.  Starlink and they will be fairly high altitude at one thousand one hundred fifty kilometers.  That's high. Right, John.  That's not a but you do that.  So you have a larger footprint.  It's not low Earth orbit.  No, it's kind of more of a standard orbit.  You also have to keep the satellite separated by one hundred twenty five kilometers of each other.  There are those, including people with satellites already up there, who are a little concerned about traffic, traffic jams in space.  You know.

Start time: 7388.46
End time: 7451.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More junk. But the whole point of this is to essentially make sure that there is no corner of the of the planet that can't directly get Internet.  It's different. It differs from standard communication satellites because these are communications.  These are communications.  The old way is you got communication satellites that will then downlink to a station that then turns it into some sort of useful broadband for where you are.  The idea is that your phone will just like your phone can communicate with GPS satellites directly will be able to communicate with this constellation directly, which if I see pie was is really really  is he's making lots of happy noises about this.  And when he makes happy noises, that could be good news.  That could be very bad news for consumers.  But if one of his if one of his mandates, one of his priorities really is making sure that the entire country, every community gets access to broadband.  This is one way to solve that without having to run cable and optical optical optical wire everywhere in every community where it doesn't make financial sense.  So I hope so.

Transcript:  So actually, this is low Earth orbit.  A geostationary orbit is typically twenty two thousand miles up.  So this is actually fairly low Earth orbit, eight hundred twenty three miles.  And then, by the way, this is only the beginning.  The total plan is for twelve thousand satellites, many of them at six hundred eighty four miles up.

Start time: 7473.28

Transcript:  With all the space junk.  But every time that he does a launch in order to do the telemetry, he has to rent it from NASA to be able to track his satellites.  And I'm guessing with this constellation that he'll be able to do that himself, especially with the accelerating of their launches.  And then if you're talking about possibly with the point to point Earth launching with Falcon Heavy, not Falcon Heavy, but the BFR, that they're going to need a continuous communication channel when they launch from point to point.  If that is indeed in their future.  So it's advantageous for them to be able to control all that.

They're huge.  They're huge end beans.  Scary.  Yeah.  I saw the Wizard of Oz.  Let's rind this up with a reference to our fabulous mattress.  You spend a third of your life, maybe more in my case, half my life on the mattress.  You want to have a good mattress.  And I got the best.  I got a Casper.  Let me tell you something.  Casper is an online...  You're going to say, no, no, Leo, a mattress this affordable cannot be this good.  And I'm going to say, I beg to differ.  Because Casper has done something really good.  They've eliminated the middleman.  That means all of that, you know, the middleman and it was funny.  The guys who came up with Casper, they're looking around, they're saying,  what is a business that where disintermediation could really help everybody?  Like, where is the most ridiculous markup happening?  And it is in the mattress store.  I mean, they are...  And the sales practice is worse than a used car salesman.  So you go in a mattress store.  I know we used to do this.  You go in, you lie in a mattress for five minutes.  So this sales lady looking at you like this.  And then you say, I'll take that one.  It's the wrong...  I guarantee you that's the wrong mattress for you.  What you need to do is get a mattress, eliminate the middleman.  So you're going to save a lot.  Get the mattress and sleep on it in...  What do they call that?  In vitro.  No, in vivo.  In vivo.  You got to sleep on it in vivo.  In your life and experience it with all the vicissitudes of fortune.  The ups, the downs, the ups and downs and downs and ups.  And all of the things that happen so that you know that this is the right mattress for you.  And you don't have to decide that in one day or two days or three days or a week or a month.  You have nine...  No, a hundred.  A hundred days, one in three months.  A hundred days of sleeping on this mattress to decide, is this the mattress for me?  And believe me, it is.  But if for any reason you don't like it...  I love Casper.  They come, they take it away, they give you back every penny.  It's as if it never happened.  But you're not going to want that because you're going to say, no, don't take my mattress.  You can't have my mattress.  The Casper mattress is obsessively engineered to combine multiple...  This is the original Casper.  The one we have combines multiple supportive memory phones for a sleep surface with just the right sink and just the right bounce.  Plus, its breathable design helps you sleep cool.  I like that.  I don't like sleeping hot.  It sleeps, breathes, your temperature is regulated through the night.  By the way, I've had mattresses where you have to open them up and let them lie there for a week to air out, not the Casper.  Boom.  It comes in a surprisingly compact box.  You open the box, the mattress is full size, smells great.  You can sleep on it right away.  And you're going to want to.  In fact, I took a nap the first day we got it right away.  I said, I got to sleep on this.

But we stayed at the hotel that's on the hairpin turn in Monaco and I walked along where they go under the tunnels.  It would be so cool to see that race there.  Anyway, the VSC, when it's active, the drivers have to slow down.  They can't pass.  They can't go below minimum times for each circuit sector.  Otherwise, they get penalties.  And this is all because they want to keep the race state the same.  Nobody passes.  So safety marshals have time.  Everything's a little slower, but nobody gets to advance.  During the VSC, the number two guy ducked into the pit lane, picked up fresh tires.  And because the speed rules don't apply in the pit lane, he passed Hamilton.  He got Hamilton said my software thought he would spend at least 15 seconds making the pit stop.  So we allowed him to have 15 seconds.  He got out in 11 seconds.

And the reason why I mean, look at just this picture,  you can see that the sponsors are Mercedes Benz and Ferrari.  That's their audience, right?  That's why it's expensive, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Speaking of party mode, here's the sad story.  Of course, the Apple engineer who is driving his Model X Tesla, same model as mine,  had the same problem I've had many times my Model X Tesla,  which is the autopilot tried to drive him into the side barrier,  the big cement barriers that they put up during construction.  And he complained to Tesla.  He brought his Tesla in.  I did the same thing because there's a curve in Marin.  Brought mine in.  He got the same response from Tesla.  Nothing wrong with it.  It's doing everything it's supposed to do.  His mistake was he left it on and and mustn't have been paying attention.  And unfortunately, it was a kind of a double whammy  because that barrier, which is supposed to be a crash absorption barrier,  had been crashed into earlier in the week and had not been replaced.  So it wasn't protecting him.  And it's actually the worst Tesla crash I've ever seen.  The car just. Yeah.  The whole front half is gone. Gone.  And he passed away, right?  He passed away.  Apple engineer, 38 years old, very sad.  And Tesla said, yes, the autopilot was on.  I think they kind of weaseled out a little bit, they said.  But it told him to put his hands on the wheels, which, of course, it tells you all the time.  I think the lesson, the PSA here is they call it autopilot.  It's not autopilot.  It's pilot assist. Exactly.

Start time: 8356.00
End time: 8401.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. It really people had the same.  It was it. This isn't just a just a funny story.  But cruise control first first appeared.  People thought that, oh, I can just put cruise control on.  And then does it go into the backseat and take a nap?  And no, it's all it's going to do is maintain a speed for you.  And that's it.  It's all this millions and millions of dollars going into autopilot technology.  And so much of that money should be going into explaining to the owner  what this software can and can't do.  It's it's dumb.  People are people are not dumb, but they have they're very predictable ways  in which you can get people to screw up.  And it's so easy, it seems, to get them to not screw up by simply calling it assist mode.  Yeah. And this is right after the Uber killing pedestrian.

Start time: 8417.76
End time: 8424.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think anyone else here has enough credentials to call that.  But I think it's right.  The answer is probably or possibly.

Start time: 8425.23
End time: 8546.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've I've you're absolutely right.  But I've spoken to engineers who are not  comfortable with certain platforms being allowed on public roads.  They're comfortable with them being allowed on in controlled environments,  like, again, the test test neighborhoods that they've bought and set up for this sort of thing.  They're comfortable with these modes being used in in on highways  where things are relatively predictable.  But in the major scrum of of public street,  where you can have places where people are would be idiots to try to cross on foot.  But they do cross on foot.  And we have people doing the most unpredictable and stupid things,  counting on a on a human driver behind them to do the right thing to preserve both their lives.  They just don't work very, very well.  And so it's this is the last five percent of this problem is going to take 10 years to solve.  And that's the that's the window in which a lot of people are going to die.  But the the the the last thing to say I want to say about this, though,  is that people are going to get killed with human drivers as well.  So a lot of this is, again, human interface trying to explain to people that, yes,  a human driver would not have caused this fatality.  But this car over the 10,000 miles that it drove autonomously or with an assist mode  saved probably eight lives or collectively.  This fleet of vehicles saved well over 100 more lives than they took  because, again, this is such a twitchy thing.  Driving a car, people get hurt, people get killed.  But it's you feel like it's completely unsuitable when it wasn't a person  you can blame for being distracted texting or or just not paying attention.  It's hard when you have this black box that you don't understand at all  is responsible for the taking of human life.  You just you just would mentally on some level,  you would much rather have 20 more people to die to the one person  that would be killed by the autonomous car than simply accept that a box  you don't understand took a human life.

Transcript:  He was complaining that he had veered into the barrier.  And I've had that happen with my Tesla.  But if I actually yesterday had it go over the dotted line,  which is not supposed to do in autopilot mode.  But you learn as a driver.  I hope you learn.  And I feel bad for the driver in this case not to trust the Tesla.  You keep your hand on the wheel.  And if it starts doing anything weird, especially since he complained  about it, doing it in the past, you keep an eye on it and maybe  don't use it in that stretch of the road.  Lisa won't use the autopilot at all anymore.

Start time: 8581.02
End time: 8651.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. But the truth is, it has software to follow the lanes.  It's far from perfect.  Yeah. Here's the article in Fast Company that I think is very interesting.  This is I want to give her credit.  This is by Ruth Reader.  And she raises the specter at the end of something she calls a flash  crash in the autonomy space.  And actually David Sosnow deserves credit for that, coining that.  In the case of high frequency training algorithms, remember the flash  crash in 2010 when the stock market bottomed out because all of the  software kind of interacted in a way that was disastrous.  If there's a flash crash in the autonomy space, says David Sosnow,  there's no reset button the following day.  A lot of people have died or been seriously injured.  Every this is the scary thing.  This is Zohar Fox, who is a co-founder of Aurora Labs.  Every thousand lines of code in a car contains an average of 50 errors.  Standard QA testing misses about 15 percent of those errors.  Well, that you could figure out what that leaves behind.  Those errors are an issue and can cause in a car a death.  So this is something we really software is not perfect.

Start time: 8652.02
End time: 8674.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Seven and a half errors per thousand lines of code sounds like a lot.  If it's going to involve making decisions on the fly for me about life and death.  Yeah, but I'm not.  Humans make far more.  Yeah, I'm about to say that.  Like, I'm not a very good driver because I'm very distracted.  Yeah.  And also I don't like driving that much.  I enjoy it like maybe on a road occasionally, but like, no, it's I'm not good.  I'm never going to be good.  And as soon as this can help me not drive, the world will be safer.

Transcript:  Well, a few weeks back, I'm sure you saw the Waymo 360 YouTube video.  Cool.  And it actually draws lines and says what it's thinking, what you're doing, which if  you said your car was veering, you could use this interface to help kind of debug  yourself, understand the patterns and be able to report that.  And that's what presumably collects all this information.  Yes, but they don't expose to you in real time.  Right.  And so maybe you would be more vigilant if you were doing being more active in the  process of autonomous driving, right?  Instead of being more relaxed, you can actually say, OK, I know I'm coming up on a  concrete barrier that has reflective tape on it.  And every time it seems to do this, then you can you can sess out these patterns on  your own, which they don't give you this access to do that, which is.

Start time: 8733.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That reminds me of an interview that I once read between a pilot who's talking about  all the technology, how glass cockpits have changed the nature of flying within a  certain generation of pilots.  And he said that we're asked historically when you think of what makes this person a  great pilot. Traditionally, this would be he's a good stick and rudder man.  Or she understands just by feeling the pedals, what the feeling the pedals, what's  happening with the plane just by sensing what's what's around him or her.  Here's what the plane is doing in this air.  And now a definition of what what makes this person a great pilot is this person is a  great manager of the cockpit systems.  So it's OK if their controls are not directly controlled to any connected anything.  They're just controlled to sensors that tell the computers where he wants or she  wants to go. This is a person that can keep an eye on these four screens, figure out  what it's telling them about the air around them, about the performance of the airplane  and use that to guide the computers to do their best work.  So maybe we're looking at that where it's a new form of driving, where it's not turn on  the autopilot, go into the backseat for a nap.  It really is. You're still driving.  You're still your brain is still active.  But rather than really actively keeping your car within the lane and keeping a space  between yourself and the car ahead of you, you're managing these systems that are  informing you of what's going on ahead and keeping you and all the other drivers safe.

Transcript:  Yeah. You look at how many miles each of these cars have driven.  Uber is essentially a 15 and a half year old with a learner's permit.  Whereas at this point, the amount of experience in terms of miles on the road, you're  talking about collectively about a 21, 22 year old still with a lot of people, a lot  of things to learn. But you really have to.  It's it's why machine learning.  People forget that the accident is on the word learning.  It has to learn. It has to have experiences.  And so that's why Uber.  I've been talking to more people than I used to since that Uber crash, that Uber is  not very well respected, not because they don't have good people working on them, but  because they don't have enough, nearly enough experience in these AIs to put it in a  live fire exercise and in a world with bicyclists in them.
