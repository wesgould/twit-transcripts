Start time: 271.23
End time: 284.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.  I was in the IETF.  It was happening in Prague.  The people who actually make the standards that drive the internet.  And I had a hanging around there with the people who, these are the nerdy nerds, if  you can imagine that.

Start time: 285.20
End time: 289.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 290.52
End time: 299.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, for normal people, they would walk in there and go like, there is no fashion  crime not being committed.  Let's just start with that.  Oh, yeah.

Start time: 299.54
End time: 302.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Sandals with socks.  That's nothing.  This goes way beyond that.

Start time: 302.58
End time: 327.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Oh, this goes way beyond that.  You know, like a 20-year-old suit coat with a 35-year-old t-shirt underneath that's just  got some arcane.  There was one guy who was wearing bright fluorescent orange trousers, big baggy ones, and a bright  yellow shirt.  Nice.  And he was generously proportioned in every way.  It was kind of like a flag walking past.

Start time: 327.34
End time: 331.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How do you get in this group?  I mean, who are these people?

Start time: 333.52
End time: 341.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Most of them started out, like the older people have been there sort of 30 or 40 years, building  the standards since the 1960s and 1970s.  Are they sisset men?

Start time: 341.66
End time: 343.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are they university types?

Start time: 345.02
End time: 377.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've all gone through various incarnations.  Anybody can participate.  The ITF is a volunteer effort.  So anybody who wants to can jump in and start participating in the standards process.  You join the mailing list.  You build up your karma points by contributing stuff to people and telling them about stuff.  And then as you build up more points, you can participate in more and more stuff.  So right now, a lot of the people who participate are employees of Huawei, Google, some of them  from Comcast and so forth.  Cisco has a number of people.

Start time: 377.54
End time: 379.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's depressing with these big companies, but that makes sense.

Start time: 380.08
End time: 453.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, these people are often very unaligned.  They may be working for the companies, but their best intentions are by and large in  the interests of the world, or the community as the whole.  And these people really work hard to do things like encryption in the internet.  We'll talk more about that later on.  But they're the people that are responsible for the new TLS 1.3 standard and trying to  prevent companies like Google from sniffing your traffic as it flies, as it's in motion.  And they're making standards to be able to improve data centers.  They're making standards to improve WAN connectivity or 5G or metropolitan mans.  And it's just so many different areas.  It's not just networking now.  They're also doing browsers and stuff like that.  So it's been a real effort to try and bring this around.  It's just fascinating to see it all because it's all volunteers getting in a room and  basically hashing out the things that they can't sort out on the mailing list.  So if you have something on a mailing list and you can't agree, then they'll take it  to the conference and then you hash it out in person.  So there's all these people just huddled around arguing over this arcane computer science.  And it's just the most fun thing to be around.  You can smell the nerd smoke coming off as you move around.

Start time: 453.84
End time: 460.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, and because you have a fairly deep understanding of this stuff, it's probably  meaningful to you. A lot of people would just be nonsense what they're saying.

Start time: 461.88
End time: 471.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I'm not I'm nowhere near as smart as any of them.  So please don't make that comparison.  But I'm smarter than me. So that puts me I'll be like a lizard there.

Start time: 471.54
End time: 495.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I feel like I wonder if these of course, there's no battles harder fought than battles over.  The less important something is, the worse the battle is.  How hard fought are these are these battles?  Are they are they vicious or do these guys and I presume it's mostly guys have a  sense of the importance of what they're doing and really how much this means to the world.  That may be a more important important meeting than the G20 summit.

Start time: 497.82
End time: 569.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's very collegiate.  So the first thing to do is it's very collegiate.  Yeah, yes, very community battles may be hard fought, but that's unusual.  And often battles aren't fought on company lines.  They're fought on technology lines like I believe my technology is the best way forward.  And people go around and try to convince other people that my vision of technology is the right way.  And the people who have been doing it for the longest, who have the most  karma will tend to be listened to more.  So as a rule, there's sort of a stabilisation between people just entering into the process  and those people who've been participating and contributing for 20, 30, 40 years.  I interviewed conducted a YouTube interview with Sue has Susan has.  She's the chair of the routing working group, which is the one that does all of the routing for the  Internet backbone, you know, the BGP and autonomous systems and that sort of stuff, among other things.  And she was telling me how back in the 1970s and 60s, how what it was like when we started doing  these technologies for the first time and telling stories about how we built these routers or why we  did this, because she was there writing that code.  Just fascinating to talk to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Are there are there how many how many women are there?

Start time: 574.79
End time: 626.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty well attended.  There might be five, maybe 10 percent.  Oh, that's good. I mean, it should be 50, obviously, but that's that's better than nothing.  It's very difficult to go to these conferences.  The ITF meets in person three times a year, usually meet somewhere in the Americas and then in Europe  and then in Asia somewhere.  Although they've stopped going to the US because of the isn't that changing.  Yeah, the visa policy meant that a lot of people couldn't attend these meetings, so they've shifted  all of the meetings from the US to Canada, which is disappointing.  I feel sorry for everybody in the US.  The idea behind the ITF is to make it as participatory as possible and as much as anybody  can get in and to sort of move it outside the US cuts you off from a market.  So and I know they were very sad about that, but, you know, it's not fair to people coming in from  Africa or the Middle East to not be able to attend.

Start time: 626.96
End time: 642.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  Well, we will get more about some of the goings on there, but I'm glad you're here, Greg.  And how about you at DEF CON?  Are you looking forward, Roberto, to anything particular?  I like DEF CON a lot.

Start time: 642.68
End time: 652.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like it's fun. It is.  It's really fun.  It sort of puts you, you know, it keeps you on your toes the entire time because you can't go in  with your sort of regular digital life.

Start time: 652.96
End time: 653.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.

Start time: 653.98
End time: 700.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What happens is you go in with regular digital life and then within 20 minutes you're on the wall of sheep.  Yeah, you're on the wall of sheep or just someone hacks you.  And it's a great way to sort of show you the potential of the future of like how much we have to take,  you know, protect our privacy, protect our security.  I mean, everything that's happening there, there's a potential for it to be what the real  world would be like if companies, if people don't get their, you know, get it together.  Right.  And so which they won't, which they won't.  We know what we want.  Well, individuals getting it together is that's you can only say, hey, use different passwords every time,  use two factor authentication every time.  And, you know, you can just keep telling people that doesn't mean they're going to do it.  Right.

Start time: 700.34
End time: 701.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't worry, the government will take care of our privacy.

Start time: 701.94
End time: 719.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And so and then that's the other thing.  So it kind of behooves the, you know, the companies that these researchers and hackers are talking about  and, you know, the systems that they're talking about and saying, hey, you know, we found this issue, fix it.  And that's that's really what Defcon is about.  We found something wrong, fix it.

Start time: 719.80
End time: 721.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  We're going to shame you into fixing it.

Start time: 721.46
End time: 726.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now, before Defcon is Black Hat and that was this weekend.  What is the difference between the two?

Start time: 727.08
End time: 762.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Black Hat is more of a sort of corporate event.  You have instead of getting individual talks, you get usually you usually end up getting talks from security  companies and they kind of talk about what their thing is, like networking, you know, everyone where everyone  dresses like this with a tie at Black Hat.  And then they go back to their room and they put their t-shirt on and they like let their, you know, they comb out  like the stuff in their hair that makes it one color.  They let themselves be themselves at Defcon.  Defcon is more people call it hacker, hacker summer camp.

Start time: 762.50
End time: 773.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Where will we learn more about exploits?  Do hackers bring their exploits to Defcon to talk about or do they do it more at Black Hat?  Because I know we always brace ourselves this time of year.

Start time: 773.76
End time: 801.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I think we're going to learn more from Defcon because the people who are presenting are presenting as  individuals. Right.  So there isn't the concern about, oh, well, the company behind me or this behind me or have to worry about, you  know, my boss things.  And so you have that.  I think that mentality actually breeds, you know, a better a better presentation.  Yeah. And it's a bit more fun, it's a bit more loose.

Start time: 802.96
End time: 820.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're also seeing a transition, Leo, where we used to only see security vulnerabilities announced at the  hacker conferences so that you could build up some, you know, hacker cred, you know, get some ego stroking going on.  But increasingly, we're seeing bug bounties being paid.

Start time: 820.18
End time: 823.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's so much money in this now.  You don't hold on to it.

Start time: 823.40
End time: 845.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, you want to. Yeah, you want to put that out.  And so a lot of some of the talks at Black Hat and at Defcon are about things that have been disclosed already.  Yeah. But they start to talk about the journey and they talk about how they found it out.  And I think the journey is really the the more interesting part.  Like, how did you find out about this?  How did you reverse engineer this malware?

Start time: 845.50
End time: 858.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How did you figure out that, you know, is Defcon going to suffer from the same kind of visa issues that the IETF  there's suffered from?  I mean, I would imagine there are a few hackers who say, I'm not coming to this.

Start time: 858.96
End time: 877.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I've I've talked I've asked them about that and they don't have any sort of official, but they have  there are people who have said on Twitter that we're not going to go to Defcon this year because we're concerned about  visas. We're concerned about the border patrol, like looking at our phones or concerned about, you know, there's a lot of things

Start time: 878.16
End time: 887.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  that suddenly. That seems to have been a little bit overblown.  I think we were very worried about that.  But Mike, you've traveled into and out of the country.  I have also in the last few months.  It was a snap for me.

Start time: 888.02
End time: 894.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. It's it's largely theoretical.  It's mostly targeted.  You could it could happen to you.  We know it's happened to people.

Start time: 894.18
End time: 910.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right. Yeah, it's happened to journalists.  It's probably worse if you're Muslim, you're a brown, you're somebody who doesn't look like you and me, Mike.  But it does.  And the border patrol says it's a very, very small percentage of people that we do this to.  So maybe it may be just the risk of that as opposed to the certainty.

Start time: 910.60
End time: 932.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's that's a calm and reasoned approach.  The other approach is to consider the fact that should there be a horrible incident of some kind, believe me, everything  is going to get locked in.  You wrote a good article on that.  We're one bomb away from from a full on laptop ban where the laptops will be banned from the cargo hold, not the and the cabin.  We're going right now in the opposite direction.

Start time: 932.82
End time: 970.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This week, the laptop ban was completely lifted.  The last few airlines that were still these are middle.  It was always weird to me that they were Middle Eastern airlines coming from the Middle East, not American owned airlines coming from the Middle East.  As if if you're a bad guy, why would you say, well, no, I got to fly on Emirates.  I can't fly. I can't fly United.  I only have seen the video for United.  I'm not flying. I don't want to drag people off the planes.  It's too dangerous. No, but seriously, a ban like that can only be effective if it's universal.  Otherwise, if you've got a laptop bomb, you just don't fly those five airlines.

Start time: 970.78
End time: 975.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You just drive or take a train or a boat to another country and get on a plane there.

Start time: 976.14
End time: 986.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's probably based on one of two things.  One of them is that they they handed Morocco or whatever a list of things that they want them to do at the airport.  And they're not doing it.  Not really. You say, well, we're going to make you do it.

Start time: 986.90
End time: 1002.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That I understand. The other one is it was a Mon, Jordan, Cairo, Istanbul, Jida and Riyadh in Saudi Arabia, Kuwait city, Casablanca, Morocco, Doha, Dubai and Abu Dhabi.  Those certain airports, those airports.  So it's presumed. Yeah, you can presume maybe there's security issues in those airports.

Start time: 1002.52
End time: 1020.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But the other thing is that it's very likely is that the leader in this space is Israel.  Israel has better intel. They have stronger secure airport security.  They've really excelled in this area and they're probably pushing the US to do certain things in the US going, OK, that makes a lot of sense.  We actually don't know what's happening behind the scenes.

Start time: 1020.06
End time: 1028.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think we think because of Trump's leaking to the Russians in the Oval Office that it was, in fact, Israeli intelligence that drove the laptop.

Start time: 1028.92
End time: 1052.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, and a huge amount of the airline based anti-terror sort of spy info comes from Israel because they they're all over that.  I mean, they do a great job. Right. Yeah.  You come in and out of my son traveled from Cairo to Tel Aviv.  That's got to be. Yeah.  And he was he was in an interrogation room for six hours. Really?  Yeah. No. What are you doing in Cairo?

Start time: 1052.64
End time: 1062.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's interesting, though, they rely, I'm told the Israeli security forces rely on that.  They rely on personal interviews more than anything else.  That's they feel like if they talk to you, they can they'll catch you.

Start time: 1062.48
End time: 1079.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. Right. And it's it's a very expensive manpower wise.  But yes, it is. Yes, it is. But they're apparently very good at it.  So, you know, and you know, you come into a major US airport, come into L.A.  acts or something like that, and it's just you're this cattle being herded through this mass process.

Start time: 1079.56
End time: 1095.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, Bruce Schneier has always said it's security theater, not not true security.  Yeah. And it's obvious because if, for instance, you're flying first class,  which, incidentally, the 9-11 terrorists flew first class, you are often as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're you're often exempted from those searches.  Every time I fly business or first, I get pre TSA pre.  And I don't even have to take my shoes off, let alone take my laptop out.  But that's so it's theater.  Yes. Yeah. And what they don't want to do is disadvantage wealthy.

Start time: 1114.26
End time: 1120.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  People are paying them the most.  They do not want them to stop flying.  But that's where the terrorists fly first class.

Start time: 1120.40
End time: 1123.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Because they're close to the front of the plane.  It was easier for them to hijack the plane.

Start time: 1123.74
End time: 1134.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It was a wonderful cartoon that I saw a couple of years ago where  airport security says, oh, this bottle of water may be a bomb.  I'm going to put it in this trash can with all these other potential.  Of the other bomb. Where all the people are.

Start time: 1134.66
End time: 1140.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Where all the people are.  Where the most, where the largest concentration of people are outside of a plane is at the TSA.

Start time: 1140.66
End time: 1152.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And I'm all for security. I want us to be safe.  I don't want anything bad to happen to anybody in flight.  Certainly not me or my family.  But I also don't think that  security theater is the right way to go.

Start time: 1152.86
End time: 1167.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And we've come a long, long way.  I mean, Leo, you and I are old enough to remember when you could just get on a plane.  Yeah. Pistol and go to Cuba. Right.  It happened all the time.

Transcript:  There's two things I think I could add to this.  One is when I first started traveling to Las Vegas four or five years ago,  there used to be I always been traveling Virgin Atlantic for quite some time.  There used to be three flights a day in and out of Vegas.  Most days of the week.  Now there's one plane a day and that plane is not full.  So the impact of the of the the visa changes and the increased border security,  from my point of view, has definitely had an impact.  I can only get one plane a day, but that plane is empty, which improves my life a little bit.  The second thing is, is that keep in mind that the computer systems  that customs are using that and they're all interlinked.  What they really do is a deep data search on you before you get on the plane  based on when you bought the ticket.  You know, how did you pay for it?  You know, what address did you put on that? Is it your home address?  Your passport, of course, is the the key of the data.  So don't underestimate the ability of the computers  that customs is using to identify potential people, because it's still certainly true  that when I go to board the plane, there are people being picked out of the queue  by name and then searched.  You know, it's so there's definitely a different approach.

And if they go after laptops and tablets and if you can't travel with those, that's going to just.  I mean, I can't even imagine if you know.

And one of it's got a screen on it and it looks like Bender.  And yeah, it's just amazing.  Like what and most of the badge is because of the design.  Like they can they can make it.

And she's just obsessed with reading and books.  And she's I want to show you my book collection.  She has this big book collection.  Where are you getting these books?

And I imagine the dash button, too, because if you have a washer dryer  and you don't and you don't run out of soap, you just push the button  and guess where that button doesn't go to Sears.  It's it is an amazing thing.  And, you know, it's hard.  I would imagine it's hard, first of all, in the current political climate.  I don't think there'll be much antitrust action anyway.  But they're busy.  They're busy. You know, all these Goldman Sachs guys.  The last thing they want to do is shut down companies.  But even so, it would be hard to prosecute Amazon because Amazon can rightly say,  well, we have competition in every single market.  There's a store on every corner.  How could you say we have a monopoly?  We people shop with us.  We have we dominate because we're better. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And most of our products are from other companies selling products.  They're smart that way. Right.  Because you're right, they're they're empowering Sears.  But if we can get back to this refrigerator thing, I think what they're  really gearing toward is the future of fridges where it's not just like barcodes  or whatever, where they'll have AI looking at what's in the fridge and determining  what you're low on, what you need more of.  And in fact, they're working on it in their secret.  Well, not secret. They're not so secret.  Their store in at their headquarters, a grocery store,  where you supposedly are supposed to take out products without paying.  And the way they do that is a combination of like you pick something up that  the shelf has a scale on it so it knows that, oh, it's this much lighter.  That's about the amount of a yogurt.  It looks at the person's history because using face recognition,  that person buys a lot of yogurt.  It looked like yogurt in the AI.  They just picked up yogurt.  Like so it's using all these different sensors and AI together  to figure out what food products are that people are removing.  That is going straight into refrigerators.  Are we.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everything that they it's all about the data.  And the second thing is that these companies are technology companies,  whereas Sears and Wal-Mart made the mistake of thinking that they were  management companies or retail companies.  What were they thinking?  Well, yeah. And they didn't sort of understand the trend that technology is really.  So the mistake I made about Amazon five, ten years ago when I was up on  I used to wander around Wall Street talking to investors and, you know,  discussing this point was I made the mistake of thinking that Amazon was  a retail company or whatever.  And it turns out that they're absolutely and utterly a technology company.  And they're building a technology platform that can do sell anything.  It is a fulfillment business.  For example, McDonald's Corporation, this is something I learned a while ago,  is actually not a fast food company.  It's a real estate trust.  And the secret to McDonald's success is that every time they open a store,  they open land.  Yeah. They open the land.  They own the land that the property is on.  And so McDonald's company, it's a real estate trust.  Right. And the fast food kind of justifies owning the portfolio  and generates enough money to fund the purchase of more and more land.

Here in Petaluma, because the movie theater, we had one movie theater  some years ago, and they were sitting on a lot of land, which they sold  for a shopping mall. And we're not in the movie business.  See, they didn't open another theater.  They just moved on.  So that's not unusual radio stations.  A lot of people think radio, terrestrial broadcast radio is really about real  estate, the land, the stations own in their towers as opposed  because they certainly aren't making any money, you know,  or not much money in broadcast.

And there's a consortium of rich people like Michael Dell and, you know,  the high big names who are buying radio stations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is. If you own that spectrum, you wouldn't even sell it.  You'd let you'd rent it. Right.  So you do like you do in London, where the land is owned on a 100 year lease.  And at the end of 100 years, the license comes back to you  and then you still own it.

And then I would write it and then I would go and I would sit with a lawyer.  And I would like everyone to tell me a or nay.  And then Harvey would come in and they'd have an argument over like one word.  He wanted to do it.  He would like, what about this?  We can't say this word about this word.

Transcript:  Well, apparently there are people in our audience who feel exactly the same way.  Do they have donuts in Germany?  They do. I just check  because I don't want to go there if they don't.  Our show today brought to you by Rocket Mortgage.  Quicken Loans, the best mortgage lender in the country.  Just a great company, very techno savvy.  And I can tell you, it sounds like hyperbole.  It sounds like I'm making something up when I say the best lender in the country.  But if you go to their website, you go to rocketmortgage.com  slash twit and the number two and scroll down a little bit,  you'll see all of those JD Power Customer Satisfaction Awards.  See, I'm not making it up.  Number one in customer satisfaction for primary mortgage origination  for the last seven years.  And I'm sure of 2017, they're going to add that little trophy there  and number one for mortgage servicing for the last three years.  So they really are the best lender in the country.  And because they're tech savvy, they decided that they could make  a better experience for us geeks.  The mortgage approval process is not.  It's practically a 19th century process.  You go to a bank, you bring a box of paperwork,  you'll maybe even fax stuff.  It's primitive and it takes a long time.  The last loan we got when we bought our house three years ago,  Lisa and I took, we just checked, it took three months, three months.  And we were still faxing stuff.  Like from they kept saying we want more.  Rocket mortgage wasn't around then.  From now on, goodbye paperwork.  Hello, rocket mortgage.  And it's transparent.  You get the confidence you need when you're buying a home or refinancing.  You can do that there.  You'll know the details.  You'll be confident you're getting the right mortgage for you.  You can provide all of the paperwork, everything online  with the touch of a button.  You can do it on your phone.  And because it's all computerized, they crunch those numbers fast.  They analyze all the options.  They're going to give you the best possible loan based on assets,  income, credit, just for you.  And they're going to do that not in months, not in weeks, not in days.  They're going to do that in minutes right there while you're there.  You could be at an open house applying for a loan.  Rocket mortgage by Quicken Loans.  Loans apply simply, understand fully, and then mortgage confidently.  To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com slash tweet and the number two  equal housing lender licensed in all 50 states and MLS consumer access dot org  number 3030 rocketmortgage.com slash tweet and the number two.  And we thank Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage so much for their support.  They've been with us more than a year now.  Great support of this week in tech and all of our shows.  I love this mic drop moment.  TechCrunch interviewed a guy named Rodney Brooks, founding director.  This guy's got cred.  Founding director of MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.  He was co-founder of iRobot, the Roomba company.  Rethink Robotics.  Connie Loizos of TechCrunch was interviewing him and asked him about Elon Musk.  Remember, Elon's been saying lately, we got to do something.  The AI is going to take over the world.  She said, Elon Musk, you're writing a book on AI, so I have to ask you, Rodney,  Elon Musk expressed this again this past weekend that AI is, in Elon's words,  an existential threat to humans.  Like the guy's seen all the Terminator movies, he knows.  Agree or disagree, Rodney Brooks says, there are quite a few people out there  who said that AI is an existential threat.  Stephen Hawking, astronomer Royal, Martin Rees, who's written a book about it.  They all share a common thread in that they don't work in AI.  Yeah, exactly.  For those who work in AI, we know how hard it is to actually get anything to work  through the product level.  And I think people who are on the ground with AI realize that it's primitive,  even things like Amazon's Echo or Siri.  He says the reason people, including Elon, make this mistake,  when you see somebody do something, like play chess or a GoMaster,  and we understand what's involved because we understand how humans think.  We understand the competence and the training and the brains that it takes.  But when you see, for instance, DeepMind's AlphaGo beat the Chinese Go champion,  you think, oh, this machine is so smart, it could do anything.  He said, but I was with DeepMind in London about three weeks ago,  and they admitted things could easily have gone very wrong.  It can't do anything.  It's really good at playing Go.  It can play Go. It's a machine.

Transcript:  If you've used any of the sort of bots, you remember messenger bots?  Yeah.  If you've used any of those, you know that AI is still sort of not so hot.  It's Eliza level, right?

Start time: 2712.04
End time: 2761.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's not sophisticated.  So and then she said, well, Elon's point is we need to regulate it before it gets smart.  Right. It's not smart.  Yes, I know it's not smart, but it's going to get smart.  We got to regulate it now.  Rodney Brooks says, so you're going to regulate now.  Well, and this is very I thought of you, Greg Farrow, when I read this logical refutation.  He says, first, if you're going to have a regulation now, either it applies to something  and changes something in the world that exists or it doesn't apply to anything.  If it doesn't apply to anything, what the hell is the regulation for?  Right. Right.  So tell me what behavior you want to change, Elon.  There's no you can't write a regulation today because you don't have an example  of what you want to prevent.  And then this is the mic drop moment.  By the way, Rodney Brooks goes on, let's talk about regulation on self-driving Teslas,  because that's an issue.

Start time: 2761.88
End time: 2769.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 2769.30
End time: 2778.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think what Brooks's point is you can't trust, you know, Tesla to drive yourself.  They maybe should be regulating that because that is something that is in the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  We've kind of talked about that.  I mean, when you say Amazon is going to eat the world, Sears is out of business.  That's a lot of jobs. That's a lot of people who aren't going to be working.

Start time: 2801.58
End time: 2848.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. So if you think if you think about artificial intelligence in let's let's try  and bring some practicality around this.  They're talking about truck drivers being removed from the roads within 30 years.  And I think it's something like 7 percent of jobs in the US are actually truck drives.  So you're going to have. So that's one. You're talking about manufacturing jobs.  There was an article a few weeks back about an entire iron manufacturing facility and it employs 10 people  because it's fully robot. It's fully automated using robots.  And artificial intelligence will continue to do that.  I think we're also seeing articles come out about artificial intelligence.  Your point about chat bots is well taken, but keep in mind that chat bots that actually involve real money.  So nobody's actually doing that.  That was investing in chat bots.

Start time: 2849.14
End time: 2851.34

Start time: 2852.02
End time: 2855.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have a look at the guy who did the website with the parking tickets and the speeding fines.  Yes, he's done very well.  He's using ML or AI like activities to basically put lawyers out of business.  So if it starts taking out the middle class, the professional middle class, as well as the working class,  you actually have something that is ripe for disruption in society because you're going to have  massive social disruption if artificial intelligence replaces those people.  And I think this is the point that Elon is trying to make.  It's not that some machine is going to take over the world, although that's certainly possible.  I mean, you look at what Petra did and not Petra, you know, the outbreak of the one cry.  Yes.  Those are I actually see those as like cyber warfare.  I think Russia was literally, you know, detonating a piece of cyber technology in Romania.  Sorry, in wherever it was, Ukraine, as bit like an atomic test back in the 1960s.  You know, you let off the atomic bomb to say, hey, I've got atomic bombs that tell you,  you know, blah, blah, blah.  I think artificial intelligence could be used in combination with cyber warfare to have an  enormous impact.  And that what he's trying to say to the lawmakers or to the government is you need to wake up to  this. There is massive social change coming driven by technology and probably simplifying  it to AI because your average senator is a bit of an idiot.  You know, the whole reason to try is pretty straightforward.  And that you need to be planning for these things.  You need to start legislating not to prevent AI, but to work out how you're going to run the  country in 20 years time when 50% of your population doesn't have to work for a living.

Transcript:  I have been using this one bot I have been using called Trim.  Have you ever heard of this?  This is a financial bot that you give you have to give it access to your finances, but then it  you can show this. I don't think there's anything in here about and then it will show you.  It will tell you about transactions, but it also shows you about recurring transactions and,  and gives you the chance to cancel the transactions.

Transcript:  The biggest, the funny thing to me about fear over AI is, is that it is potentially scary because of  the power it gives to people. I would trust the morality of a person or of AI more than the morality  of a person.  Well, at least it's predictable.  Right. So we always think we do this in biology too. There's a cloning and all that kind of stuff.  Oh, what, what should the U S do? What should the UK do? What should Germany do?  Which, what is North Korea going to do with AI? What is, you know what I mean? So I'm, I,  people scare me a lot more, you know,  You have to stay ahead. You have to stay ahead of them. I mean,

And they're like,  we have to do this because other nation states are going to do this. So we're having hackers  work on this now, but DARPA is working on basically AI hackers because if they don't,  you're going to fall behind and you're going to lose to Russia, to North Korea, to whoever,  to random, you know, usually it's the nation state. If you're talking about that much power,  but you have to, you know, you have to have somebody who is researching and working on this  because if you don't, someone else's.

Transcript:  Lisa and I have a game because we'll ask Siri stuff. It's just so bad.  It's yesterday. We were going to a concert in San Jose and I was looking for a place to eat.  So I said, as you're supposed to say, can I get restaurants near me?  You wonder, does anybody at Apple actually use this? So it says,  yes, here's the restaurants near me. It shows me a list, flashes it briefly,  and then starts one by one reading the names of the restaurant and saying,  would you like me to contact them? It hid the list and I know.  And then it goes to the next one. No.  It's like you can't see it. The information is there, but it hid it.  And now it's bothering me with this meaningless conversation.  I just want locations. I'm just looking for ratings.  You do it on Google with Google Assistant works exactly as expected.  You feel like nobody used this.

I personally think that the most elegant consumer electronics product that ever existed is AirPods.  I agree. I really like to take it out. It stops.  It knows if it's not perfect, but they're pretty cool.  So that's AI behind the scenes, knowing if it's in your ear or not, knowing if they're  and it's just that's what Apple's really good at.

My Kindle is a piece of junk.  I deeply regret buying that thing. What a waste of time that was.  So I tried using Siri and it doesn't work either. I've tried using it. I've got a bunch of Philip  Hugh lights and stuff, IOT and all that sort of stuff. And that is just like such an arcane  experience.

Eventually to build AI, you have to be able to build neural networks or networks that are  where the data associations can be made dynamically and quite fluidly.  And we're not there yet. There's no live applications around artificial intelligence.  Most of what we have today is ML. So just be patient. There's many years to go because  there's not enough AI mathematicians around to make those algorithms run yet. But most importantly,  is there's not enough data. So if you're a research scientist or if you're a post-grad or  a master student, you can have all the theory about artificial intelligence, but until you've  got a data center to train the AI on, you've got nothing. I guess you've got all the data.

Transcript:  But I think Greg's point is well taken, especially in this conversation about how smart is AI,  because machine learning isn't smart at all. It's just big data. And if you extract the  information, if you separate the two, then we really are in the early stages of AI. It really is  barely doing anything.

I thought we'd play it again here in just a second.  Ready Player One. Everybody loved the Ernest Cline novel.  Spielberg is making the movie. I want to take a look at the trailer  and that can launch a conversation about virtual reality.  What Apple is doing with augmented reality.  Scoble's really gone off the deep end this week.

It is, I can't express this more vividly. So it seems simple. It's the number one fresh  ingredient recipe delivery service in the country. So we get a box once a week.  We go online. We go to the menus. We choose the three meals we're going to get.  You can get it for a couple or for a family of four. And they have more kid-friendly ingredients.  But let's just look. So sweet and spicy beef. Sounds good. Crispy chicken tenders and hot  honey. Salmon and frika salad. I don't even know what frika is. So you pick the three.  You get the box. Everything's fresh. Everything's perfect. They have really figured out how to do  the delivery, the processing, because you never get like an old leaf or anything.

Start time: 3659.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  you feel like you're a chef. Exactly. So we always focus on the  mechanics of this. You get the box. You get exactly the right thing and blah, blah, blah.  But it's like you have a sous chef who's done all the prep work. You have exactly what you need.  And then you start cooking and you're going to be able to do this in half an hour, 40 minutes.  And you're the room starts to you feel like a chef. The room starts to fill with these amazing  aromas. You become extremely arrogant and you start yelling at people.  Get out of here. No soup for you, I say. No, it is really. And by the way, we've learned how to make  things that we make again and again. There's a salad now that we make again. Actually, it was  like when we came over to dinner the other that time and Amira was making a kale salad. It was so  good. And we've made that over and over again because we saw her make it. We learned and that  became a part of our repertoire. And that's what happens with Blue Apron. These things become a  part of your repertoire. They don't repeat. So you only repeat recipes at a minimum of once a year.  The ingredients are perfect. Every bit is good, if not better than you would get if you did the  shopping yourself. Actually, they do a better job of picking the produce and the meats and everything.  By the way, the meat is phenomenal cuts. Fresh delivery. It's in a refrigerated box.  On the menu, seared chicken and creamy pasta salad with summer squash and sweet peppers.  Creamy shrimp rolls with quick pickles and sweet potato wedges. We had this the other day,  chili butter steaks. It's chili butter. They have a chili pepper sauce. It's from Italy that you mix  in with the butter. With parmesan potatoes and spinach, it was a hit. A huge hit. I've wilted  more spinach with Blue Apron than I ever had before. I've become the fan of the wilted spinach.  They have partnerships with 150 local farms, fisheries and ranchers across the U.S.  so you're getting the best food. Their freshness guarantees promises everything arrives ready to  cook or they'll make it right. They've sent me emails. This is a company that does customer  service, right? They've sent me emails saying you're going to get yellow tomatoes instead of red  ones because the yellow were better. We just wanted to let you know. It's that kind of thing.  You've got to try this. For getting a family excited about cooking, for cooking for your  sweetheart, for date night, there's nothing better. Blue Apron. Check out this week's menu. By the way,  you're going to get three meals free with your first purchase and free shipping when you go to  blueapron.com slash twit. We actually cook two and give one to Lisa's parents, my in-laws.  It's more than they say it is. Oh yeah, easily. We feed a family of three with every meal.  But they love it. So we pick one that's going to be that they're going to love and it's all ready  to go and they just love it. It's a great gift. Blueapron.com slash twit or do it for yourself.  It's a gift for you. It's a better way to cook and I promise you. I think you know if you've  been listening, if you listen to our shows, I've been talking about cooking a lot more lately.  It's because of Blue Apron. Thank you, Blue Apron. We also been talking a lot about VR and AR.  That's because of Robert Scoble. Curse you, Robert Scoble. He is all about Apple going to be this  new iPhone.

Transcript:  So here is the trailer and I have to say, I'm pretty excited about this from Ready Player One  and watch, Mike pointed this out to me, watch the, how they, how Steven Spielberg dramatizes  the experience of VR because that's a hard thing to do. In our day, it was, they had to dramatize  smoking marijuana or the acid trip and they would make the camera go, I don't know, they did a pretty  good job on Lawn Mower Man. Actually, that was the VR movie of all time. That was the VR movie.  All right, well, compare this to Lawn Mower Man. Watch. I live here in Columbus, Ohio. No lawns in  the future though. Oh. In 2045, it's still ranked the fastest growing city on earth,  but it sure doesn't seem like Columbus, Ohio. They called our generation the missing millions.

So now he's in VR. People are flying around. That's actually from the book. Dancing is.  This is Spielberg's idea. So there are 80s things like that was Iron Giant. There are 80s  icons and references as there were in the book.  Of course. The best VR game though is coming up. They're gonna do this driving game where it shows  the guys walking into, you know, a kind of weird minimalist environment. It's an organized, very  organized team, video game playing in VR. And then it shows their VR experience of this, which  looks like, you know, Fast and Furious. And they're robots in VR. Yeah. And there's apparently there's

You have CGI, which is necessary based on the subject matter.  And it's just a fascinating story with lots of nostalgia. So the public generally can, you know,  the kids will love it and their parents will love it because of the nostalgia. It's just,  it's a perfect, even when I was reading it, I'm like, Oh, somebody's got to make this movie.

They'll digitize them and then say, thanks very  much. We'll send you the royalties. Yeah. But I mean, already they're doing things like,  I would imagine that almost all of that movie, if not all of it was done in front of a green  screen, everything else was CGI, which makes them incredibly cheap to make. Yes. Not only cheap to  make, but very accurate. You know exactly how much money you're going to spend to make a movie.  And this is a, one of the impacts of technology is that in movies, we never used to know how much  it would take. You know, you go out on site and what is it? There's a story in the matrix. They  could only get the studios to give them 20 million to make the whole of the matrix. Right.  So what they did was when spent 20 million making the first 15 minutes and then went back to the  studio and said, here's the first 15 minutes. We want the rest of the 200 million. That's a good  trick. And so I think we're seeing a transition here is if you can put, if you can turn video  production or movie production into a factory production line, you get control of your costs  and you know what things start to look at. And that's what we're seeing with Netflix and  Amazon video. There's a transition there where a lot of the CGI is, you know, definitely able  to be produced at a much lower cost than going out with a camera and taking shots of someone.

Transcript:  I wanted to show that trailer because that was the folly of the first, you know, the prequel,  the Star Wars prequels, like, well, we're just going to make everything CGI. Yeah.  And everything CGI is fine, but you have to have, you know, you need to have a good,  you have Steven Spielberg attached to this. You have good actors attached to it. Without that,  without a story, without a good director, without good actors, you're going to end up with the

Everybody's  very excited. Not exactly ready for everyone. Everybody's really excited. I mean, very cool.  I mean, how cool is that? Well, this is real, right? This is, you're actually going to be able  to do this presumably when the new iPhone comes out. What's one of the interesting things is she's  using an HTC Vive with AR kit. And in fact, it's, it's,

And these are  apps that we're going to be downloading, but Apple's app store didn't end all other app stores. It,  basically, you know, they, they helped create the market. And then the play store is even bigger  than the app store. And there's a thriving market on Android and even other platforms.  So his, his point is, it's going to kill everything else. That's VR. That is not going to happen.  They're going to, they're going to push augmented reality directly into the mainstream very rapidly,  which I think would be great for other companies doing AR. And I think that VR is going to be kind  of like a kind of a back burner thing. It's sort of like mobile games versus console games. Console  games are amazing, but a tiny minority of people actually play console games. VR is going to be

But, but all this work  that's being done in AR for looking through your phone and tablet will be applicable to the world  of glasses. This is the, to me, the most exciting thing that people under appreciate, which is that  all this development work, I mean, it's a lot of work to create these virtual experiences and so on.  All you need is glasses to project what's happening on the phone onto those glasses.  And you can take your pick. You can look at it on the phone, you can look at it in the glasses.

Again, I don't, I don't even want to  talk about virtual reality because that's like not, that's going to be nothing compared to  augmented reality. And there are going to be a million solutions for this already. There's a  $99 set of glasses that are ridiculous. You're not going to wear them in public and all that  kind of stuff. But what they do is they'd simply reflect virtual objects onto a curved piece of  plastic that is part of the goggles. What are those called? But it's $99 to have an augmented

That's a false narrative put out by the tech press, which felt  journalists don't make enough money to spend $1,500. They felt excluded through price. And so they

Start time: 4541.66

Google came out with an extraordinarily  innovative beta program. They said not only we want you to try the hardware, we also want  you to pay a fortune for it. And we want you to tell us how you're using us. We have no idea how  you're supposed to use this thing. They did it for a while. The one thing that that made the  narrative weird is that the very end they said, you know, OK, we're opening it up to the public.  The public said, I don't think so. And then we made it weird is when the initial initial video

Start time: 4596.84
End time: 4609.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Start time: 4611.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

For example, the the Magic Lens app,  which started out on the phone, which trans translates signs into a new language right before  your eyes using the same typeface. That was real augmented reality. But anyway, back to back to my

They still do. I  remember when I first experienced this, I was in Europe and saw people walking around looking at  phones that that is crazy. But now it's accepted. It's everywhere. It's universal. So much so that  you don't notice it. Well, what will we all get used to wearing some sort of augmented reality?

They almost promised they  underdelivered. What did they promise? They promised real augmented reality. They showed a  video and they're like, this is Google Glass. It's coming. They had a gussied up demo exactly

People wearing  them down the street could take a photo at a time when there was no Instagram, there was no  Snapchat. This is my point is... And then SnapGoggles came along and that was fine.

And the company who built it  actually builds the heads up displays for jets for people wearing those giant. So I'm like, okay,  okay, I can see how this is working. This is great. This makes sense.  I like the idea.  And the niche sort of market where it's like for manufacturing, for industrial uses, that's where  AR started and where it's going to be for a while. But now they're like, okay, well,  we're doing this for bicycles. And you can see, you know, there's sort of a little bit for  motorcycles and they're sort of a little bit for here and there. And I think augmented before AR,  before VR, VR, I don't even want to talk about VR, but AR is going to be huge. But you still have  to get over that initial, we have to make something that people want to wear. And that's when it comes

Transcript:  down. I've been predicting this for a while, but within like six or seven years, eight years,  when you go to get your glasses, they'll say, well, do you want the smart ones or the dumb ones?  You know, when you get pick your frames, you're like, well, okay, give me the smart ones. Okay,  so here's a series of options. Okay, I'll take those extra $200. And then you just, you'll get  little screens kind of like Google Glass, but there won't be the big boom that comes out in  front of your face. They'll be practically indistinguishable from ordinary glasses.  There's a company that a startup called where they call the view glasses, VUE glasses,  in San Francisco, they don't do screens, they don't have a camera, but it's little blinking  lights. And the most important part of all, which I think is really under represented is the audio  part of augmented reality. Bone conduction is the killer app for smart glasses, I think.  Because you want, you want to be talking to your virtual assistant all day.

So here's a problem  nobody worries about. We want to talk to our virtual assistant all day, our future selves,  five years from now. What technology gives us all day, battery life and all that kind of stuff,  AirPods last what two hours or something like that? Your phone does though.

And what about 5G? Would that make it possible?  No, no, no. You're talking like 5G is yes, in theory, the 5G will give you 10 gigabits per second,  but it's going to be shared with everybody. And if you want to be able to save battery life,  you have to shift a very low bandwidth connections. As soon as you're low bandwidth, no AR.

Transcript:  It's probably the case though. What was the, what was the increase in data use when the iPhone came  out? It was 10 or 20 fold. It's probably the case that before the iPhone came out,  AT&T's engineers said, well, there's no way we could, we could support that.  And they're sorry, but they did, they made a work of it, but it took years.

And even if it rolls out, it's not going to roll out everywhere in just a few years,  it's going to be a five to 20 year rollout. So now you'll be in the situation. It'll be back  like when the iPhones first came out and you could use your iPhone on edge everywhere in the country,  but 3G only in a couple of capital cities.

People, when Niantic's president, John Hanke took the stage, Hey, I like Pokemon Go.  Took the stage. He was greeted by an audience, a few thousand deep, many of them chanting, fix  your game. We can't play. Some more, Greg, this is from TechCrunch. Some more aggressive attendees  approached the stage to personally shout their discontent. And Niantic says, we're going to give  you refunds in the, in the form of a hundred dollars of Pokecoins. But there's a company that

And they just didn't do anything. Well, I thought I said at the time, they'll probably  have trucks coming out.

They spend  the entire year. So for six months at the conferences run, they use the tech and the next big  six months they spend rebuilding it and reworking the kit and the fiber optic cables and everything  so that they can actually run a data network at these events. It's a serious, it's just,  I've just got this vision of Niantic being like a bunch of kids going, it's all in the cloud. Don't  worry about it. We don't need to know anything about infrastructure.

Oh, Devo. That's a band I would go see  in need of a drummer, which is tough because. Yeah. Yeah. And then I have like, why is it  hard to get a drummer? Well, it's hard to find drummers who, okay, you have to have three things  A, they have to say they're a drummer B, they actually be able to keep time, which is very difficult.  A lot of people can like do, do, do, do, do, they can do that, but they can't keep time. I can do a  pair of diddle, but you got to go. And then own drums. Oh, so you have to have all three and all  of that. It's like the Holy Trinity. And the keeping time part is extremely crucial for a Devo band.  Yeah. Because it's very mechanical. It is very, yes. And the, you're dealing with like seven,  eight times and five, eight time and then three, four time all in the same song. So you have to be  able to have, I think you need a matchbox 20 tribute band. No, I don't think I do.  The general band, we just sort of cover everything.

Nice to have you.  Actually Cory Booker, the Senator from New Jersey has called for some government oversight on Amazon  and Google and tech giants. So there is some sentiment. I just saw this on Recode. They're  doing an episode with Cory. He says the consolidation that's happening all over this country is not a  positive trend. He said that the Republicans have been really slacking in terms of asserting  consumer protections. And he says that a number of key federal agency leaders who oversee issues of  like antitrust are dangerous. He really wants to kind of start paying attention to this.  I worry when I hear that. On the one hand, I kind of don't disagree that you got to keep an eye on  these guys. I worry at Congress's ability to regulate these guys. It's problematic because

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

It makes me throw up in my mouth a little bit to think about a government requiring  them to really reveal those. And it also makes me sick that they can get away with murder behind  the scenes with these algorithms. Facebook is another company that does this stuff. You don't  know what they're doing. Are they racially profiling? You'll never know.  All you know is that companies like Amazon and Google succeed wildly. In the case,  this is more of a European antitrust obsession. Google has competitors and those competitors  they both A, don't rank as well on Google searches as Google's stuff does and B, they're not as  successful. Are they not as successful because they don't rank? You don't know what's really  going on if they're really cheating or not. These algorithm-based companies change their algorithms  a thousand times a day. There's no tangible evidence that they're doing this because it's

End time: 6040.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's been automated book pricing for some time. But I think Ben Thompson over at Stratecari put  it together in that the American government is going to struggle to regulate Amazon because the  way that the government measures anti-competitive or monopolistic behavior is whether prices are  cheaper or not. The American system says if the price of the goods rise, then that's monopolistic  behavior and we will then leap in and regulate it immediately. If the price that the customer is  paying is less, then that's not monopolistic behavior. Now it doesn't matter if Amazon was  able to take over 100% of the market under the current legal framework as long as the price is,  you know, this is Google's advantage by the way because Google has a monopoly  but it's selling something for free. So therefore it can never be a monopoly unless something changes.

Transcript:  I think it was Jeff Jarvis who told me that the difference in the antitrust regulation is here,  they're designed to protect the consumer and in Europe they're designed to protect other companies,  to protect competition, which I think is a little more subtle and probably a better way of doing it  because price isn't the only way of measuring damage to consumers. The bizarre thing about that

Start time: 6072.92
End time: 6111.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  in Europe is that, especially as far as Google is concerned, is that Google is a monopoly in Europe  and it isn't elsewhere. European citizens voluntarily choose to use Google  and it's super easy to use something else like most other, you know, you go to Russia and it's  all Yandex, you go to the US, their market share, Google's market share is what, 70 something percent?  60 or something, yeah, it's much lower. Right, and so it's really a kind of bizarre thing,  you know, the citizens who the government in the EU is supposed to represent have chosen  to give Google monopoly power and so I just think it's a bizarre...

So you just came back Roberto, you just came back from  Barcelona and the Audi event there, in fact you've got a good article in Gadget here about  self-driving boredom. You were looking at Audi's autonomous efforts.  So they have a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  A monotonous effort.  Yeah, it's the 25th hour is what they're calling it, which is somebody in the marketing team thought,  hey, I got an idea, the 25th hour because they're giving, they're saying, you know...  We're going to get an extra hour of our day.  We're going to get an extra hour of our day. That's not how time works.  But you know, they're, but they have to, you know, companies like Audi, companies like BMW,  they're both working on it, but other companies need to figure out how are we going to sell  self-driving cars? Because if the car drives for you, then you're not worried about horsepower,  you're not worried about torque, you're not worried about steering. Now you're basically  selling a home entertainment system inside a car. How do you sell that now?

End time: 6238.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So any ads would be kind of annoying, but they're trying to figure out like that,  that secret sauce of giving you information. Like how much information do you want?  Because some people want an ad. Like I've, I've bought things from Instagram,  which seems ridiculous in my mind. I'm like ads are dumb, ads are stupid, ads pay my bills,  but they're horrible.

And then  after they bought one of these self-driving cars, they're going to get ads and they're trying to  figure out what, what kind of ads, how many they got it completely backwards. I think that we're  going to get to a point where rides are free and you pay for it by watching ads.  Oh, that's different.  It's going to be a great virtual reality platform.

That's what you want. You want what's on your phone there.  So we'll be doing Facebook.  And would you get ads? Maybe if you get ads, you'll probably get Facebook ads,  you'll probably get Instagram ads, you'll probably get which, what you are used to already.  And, you know, but Audi, you know, these companies need to do this research because they have to  figure out what people are going to want before they want, I'm afraid, you know, there was nothing  in there about them giving people ads.

End time: 6510.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's a massive gap opening up between who's going to manufacture electric cars,  who's going to manufacture self-driving cars. And if you have self-driving cars, are they all going  to be run by a ride sharing services like Uber and Lyft and so on and so forth? Yeah. What do you need

Start time: 6516.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I don't, I would welcome a ride sharing service that could just come and pick me up from  my door. So I don't have to call a taxi and wait for it to arrive or go and catch the bus. I think  that's a great thing. But if you're a car manufacturer and you're in a business where  you've making five to $10 billion a year shipping cars, you want to be able to have a spectrum of  choices. So you're, you have companies like Audi and Chrysler and Ford investing in ride hailing  services. And at the same time, they're putting out cars that consumers might want to buy directly.  So self-driving cars, but ones that can consumers might want to pay a premium for. And I think  they're going to try all the different possibilities in the market and we don't know  what the fine, it's a bit like Google glasses, right? Google glasses too comes out. Is it going  to be a success or a failure? We don't know. You know, I can point at things like the infrastructure  isn't there. You have to try it. You know, and they, so they do all of them. Big companies aren't  smart enough to do the one thing that's right. They do all the things and wait to see which one  of them, one of those little treasurer's little nuggets of happiness floats to the top and keeps

Isn't it?  You know, we drove into San Francisco, it was easier to park and just take Uber. The problem

Start time: 6600.10
End time: 6610.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Uber makes a lot of sense. The issue with self-driving car still is that it's not removing  that extra car on the road because people are still getting in one person and one car and they're

Start time: 6611.02
End time: 6621.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  going from point A to point B. More than 500 Ubers on the road in San Francisco. It hasn't reduced  congestion. It's increased congestion. Exactly. And so there's still, and so everyone's talking

Start time: 6621.62
End time: 6664.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  about self-driving cars. I'm like, well, we still have to look at the infrastructure of public  transportation, which is, you know what, you can get a lot of people on a bus and if the bus is  self-driving, that's great because the bus is, and this is what's going to, this is the first version  of autonomy is going to be vehicles along a very narrow route. They're on a route, they're like  slot cars basically. And they're on this route and it's going to be probably Ubers most likely  and probably public transportation. But the, but the like, oh, it's all just keep buying cars or  we're just going to have a lot of cars. If you, if you just replace the cars that people are driving  with cars that no one is driving, we're still going to have congestion. You know, algorithms are  great and we're going to be able to move a little bit quicker, but it still needs to be a figure out

Start time: 6664.08
End time: 6713.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  of reduction in vehicles on the road. So the way that's going to work is you're going to see in the  capital cities like London and New York with the congestion zones where, unless you're registered  or have a permit to drive in the center of those cities, the obvious thing that they're going to do  is to say only self-driving cars from ride hailing services inside of that congestion zone. And that'll  prove it out. And then you'll see, they're already talking here in London about turning parking  garages into charging stations for these self-driving vehicles. And they're still giving up all that,  real estate to vehicles. No, that shows that it's an eight to, no, you're wrong. There's an eight to  one compression ratio. Once you shift to self-driving ride hailing services for every,  eight cars on the road today will be replaced by one self-driving car. But you're talking about

They're working with an Austrian contract  manufacturer called Magne Steier. They've based their whole business off of Foxconn.  So I think Apple is making a big bet that- We won't make them.  We'll have somebody else make them. It won't matter who makes them. They'll be  designing California or whatever. Then some contract manufacturer will make them. They'll  be given the brand of whoever designed them. They'll churn them out like nothing. They'll  cost very little. They'll be mostly consumer electronics experiences.

Transcript:  I just agree with economics. Everything about the electric car industry is cliff,  is accelerated economics. It all runs off a cliff. I was talking to somebody in the  fuel in the petrol industry, petrol stations, and they are predicting that if just 30% of  sales of petrol sales shrink by 30%, the entire distribution market for fuel collapses  because it needs a certain density. It needs a certain number of fuel stations.  If 30% of the fuel stations go away because 30% less petrol is being sold,  that whole distribution chain just falls apart and that market goes into freefall.  At that point, it becomes more effective to have electric cars because fuel has to rise in price  just because of the cost of distribution. That's fuel in general, all kinds of fuels.

Transcript:  There's a whole bunch of things that has to happen, but if you look at what they do here in the UK,  they charge you road tax, which is to own a car, you have to have a tax to put it on the road,  as well as your insurance plus the government licensing fees plus so forth and so on. Most of  the government revenue though for running the roads comes in the form of fuel. So the taxes on  the fuel here, which is very high. That's the same here in the US actually.  So if you're not, you still need the roads and building out that infrastructure is not cheap. So  what do you do? Tax electricity? That'll be popular.

Transcript:  White and black hat hackers will descend on steamy hot Las Vegas this week for black hat.  The conference started in 1997, which means it turns 20 years old. And my advice for you is to  watch out for pineapples. And I'm not talking about their prickly skin. If constantly protecting  yourself from getting hacked isn't your jam. You might be more interested in the wearable  technologies conference, which will happen this week in San Francisco. And finally, Amazon,  Facebook, PayPal, and AMD will all release earnings this week. Alphabet will release their quarterly  earnings as well. And because of changes in regulation, we expect them to break out YouTube  earnings separately from Google search and advertising that happens for the first time.  And that could be interesting.

And I'm like, oh, this thing. Yeah.  Yeah, just I can never I tried to be excited about it was a category people were excited about. Oh,  yeah. Intel like put through some money at it. And by the way, they've just closed that division

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  down. It's like, again, that's everything. Intel technology really wasn't as good as anybody else  as they their mobile strategy hadn't supported the technology. So they didn't shut it down.  I don't I'm pretty sure that Intel like every other big company goes and sticks its finger  in someone else's pie. And if it doesn't work, it pulls its finger back out again.  And the mobile strategy hasn't been very good. It's low power stuff is still struggling.  Even their intelligence and image recognition chips are still not as good as somebody else's.  So it's hard to see how Intel comes back and participates in the mobile or the wearers market  offering silicon. And ultimately, it's businesses selling silicon, right? So that's what it does.

And actually, Microsoft's quarterly results  came out this weekend for the first time ever. They made more money on office subscriptions than  they did on selling office software outright. And that's a definitely a bellwether for the  future of software. In fact, can you who even remembers going to a software store and buying  a box of software and taking it home?

And now I do subscribe for eight  bucks a month to Office 365. And it's a better deal. I subscribed to Photoshop and Lightroom.  And it's just, it's a natural way to do it. Let's take a little break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  to throw this in there because I think it's such a cool thing. Before the show began, before we  began recording, we were talking about command lines and that sort of thing. And I mentioned  that my son uses a thing for the Mac OS that gives you super powerful thing. It's called Alfred.

What Alfred is kind of like  Launch Bar was the original one. And you can now do it with just built in Apple stuff,  Sherlock and so forth. But Alfred is really great if you use the command line because you can do  those command line chores from your command space, your hotkeys. No, I love Alfred. In fact,  I'm a Power Pack owner on Alfred. So yes, thank you for that. I had asked. I use Launch Bar.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  nice. You might be thinking of Quicksilver, Leo. I know about Quicksilver and I know that that went  away. But no, Launch Bar. I for some reason thought it had just been superseded by, you know,  objective development. Yeah, that's a good. No, I love Launch Bar. Another good choice. Very  similar to Alfred and Quicksilver. Yes, six of one, half a dozen of the other. Quicksilver  went open source and you could still use Quicksilver. I don't know the state of development.  I had problems with it. Did you? Yeah. I don't know how this turned into Mac Break Weekly,

Start time: 7715.66
End time: 7791.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  but it did somehow. Leo, I've got one thing I'd like to raise. When I was at the IETF last week,  there's a working group draft. This is part of the IETF is that they're responsible for the  encryption algorithms and the SSL. So they, you know, the little lock that appears in your  web browser and the encryption algorithms and the protocols that go with that. There's a new  draft coming out around TLS 1.3. Now, TLS 1.3 is about making sure that operators can't intercept  your traffic as it crosses their networks and then sell your data for money. And I dropped a note in  here. I found the link. This is from AdAge is the website back in 2015, talking about this being a  $24 billion market for selling your private data as it crosses the network backbones.  And so the IETF has been putting together a working group on increasing encryption on the  carriers and they wanted to get more people to jump in and join the conversation. Now, I'm not  so sure how many telco nerds or carrier nerds or crypto nerds are out there, but if you are,  it would be really great if you could go along and participate in the  draft that's happening around this, which is the effect of pervasive encryption on operators.

Transcript:  I'll drop it into the chat room. I once, we had Vince Serf on triangulation, one of the fathers  of the internet. I once asked him if you were going to do it all over again, designing TCPIP  the internet, what would you do differently? And he said pervasive encryption. They didn't,  they really didn't think that would be necessary. And now of course it's obvious that it would be.

Start time: 7813.20
End time: 7817.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's been some real argy bargy going on here. Apparently some of the big carriers, some of the-

Start time: 7818.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Oh, they don't want this at all, right?

Start time: 7820.82
End time: 7842.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, they really opposed it, very strongly opposed. And there's a lot of very unusual  stuff happening here where the carriers are putting pressure on the companies that employ  the people who are doing this draft in the ITF. And so this is big company on big company saying,  where your customer here, you really should get your person on the ITF to drop this because we  are opposed to it.

Start time: 7842.88

Transcript:  It's interesting because you would think Google would be opposed to it, but I think that they're  engineering a heritage.

Start time: 7848.66
End time: 7870.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google's very opposed. Google's not opposed because they capture it all in the browser.  They get it from Chrome directly.  Yeah, you've signed in, you know.  What we're trying to stop here is even when we use TLS 1.2, which is reasonably modern,  there's still a lot of data leakage in the header. Like a lot of the HTTP requests and the URL is not  hidden.

Start time: 7870.96
End time: 7890.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So that's interesting because I just assumed, well, of course in the United States, the law that  protected you from your internet service provider stooping on you was allowed to lapse. The regulation  was overturned at the FCC by the new administration. And I just assumed that, well,  the good news is my Google searches at least are not visible to my ISP, but that's not always true.

Start time: 7891.68
End time: 7896.14

Start time: 7900.66
End time: 7909.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a certain amount of the URL is still shown and the header is not fully encrypted. So  the next generation of TLS 1.3 will be a make pervasive encryption.

Start time: 7910.04
End time: 7918.82

Start time: 7951.72
End time: 7961.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  There's also a lot of companies who specialize in tapping this data and collecting it and analyzing  it. So Cambridge Analytics, for example, which recently was part of the Fiori in the government  and so forth. If we start taking away their data sources, they get a little bit poopy.  So these fights still go on.

They didn't think about encryption because they literally stumbled from problem to problem to  problem right through the boot cycle.

When Verizon bought AOL, there were a few sites that wrote,  how can we trust TechCrunch and Engadget, too?  When you write that sort of crap, you're not attacking a publication.  You're attacking individual reporters. You're saying that these reporters  don't have the journalistic integrity to see that Verizon is a crappy company.  And it is. I work for a horrible company.  They just got busted gating bandwidth to Netflix.  And so I talk crap about Verizon as much as I possibly can.  And if they fire me, I don't... Whatever.

We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.  That's 2200 UTC in the evening if you're in the UK.  That's why I thank Greg for staying up late.  But I hope you will join us.  If you join us live, don't forget to go to the chat room and pipe up in there at irc.twit.tv.  You can also join us live.  We have some great visitors from Oakland, from Germany, from London, England, and Columbus, Ohio.  Thank you for visiting from all over the world.  People come to see us.  All you have to do is email tickets at twit.tv.  We'll put out a chair for you.  Make sure you're comfortable.  Offer you snacks.  If you can't be here in person, if you can't be here during the live stream,  you can always download on-demand versions of all of our shows, audio and video.  The website is twit.tv.  For this show, I think it's twit.tv slash this week in tech, something like that.  It's a longer URL.  You'll find it.  Just go to the front page and click shows.  You can also, of course, subscribe.  However, whatever podcast program you use, just look for Twit and subscribe.  That way you'll get every episode every week.  You can start your week right with a little dose of tech talk.  Thanks for being here.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.  Bye-bye.
