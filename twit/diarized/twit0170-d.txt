Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  from Gadget. GDGT. You're one of them. I would attest to most of those things. Maybe not attractive.  Good looking fella. I'll go with intelligent. Intelligent, smart. GDGT.com. Ryan also does a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  podcast with Peter Rojas, his co-host and what do you call him? Co-owner? Co-founder? Co-founder,  co-owner, same thing. Of GDGT.com. Good to have you back, Ryan. Ryan Rock, I'm going to call you.  It's a wrestler name. Ryan Rock. Tom Merritt is also here from Buzz Out Loud and CNET and  CBS Interactive. Right, all of those things and more. And more. And the sword and the laser.  Swordandlaser.com. Good to have you back, Tom. I haven't missed you. Thanks, Lee. Yeah. Also here  in studio with us. Always glad to welcome Mr. Alex Lindsay from the Pixel Core. You'll be here  a lot more now that you live a block away. So, Ryan, you were on the Virgin, it was the Virgin

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  of America's first Wi-Fi flight. It's not the first Wi-Fi flight ever. The company who's providing  service is called Aircel and the service they're providing is called GoGo, just in case anyone's  curious as to what they should be looking out for. So this GoGo service has been active on a  couple of other airlines in very, very limited release. Delta, American, Air Canada. I think  they all have a plane or two that are being outfitted. But Virgin America is the first airline  that is rolling it out fleet-wide. So within the next couple of months, they're going to have every

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  single plane will have Wi-Fi. Oh, I love Virgin America, but I like them even more. Yeah, I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's as if you didn't already have reason enough to fly them. Now it's all on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Come for the disco balls, stay for the Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No Wi-Fi. I will definitely give you that. It is one of those moments where you can kind of  catch up on reading or an email or whatever. It's one of those chances to just completely  disconnect and not having that choice. Then again, you don't have to fly Virgin America.  And frankly, you don't have to turn on your Wi-Fi and pay for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a really good point. I was wondering, Ryan, did they explain how they get around the issue  of having Wi-Fi radios on? Because it's something if you're on a plane that doesn't have Wi-Fi,  they make you turn off the Wi-Fi radios on your laptop usually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, I didn't really ask them too much about that. I think it's kind of an open secret,  though, that they were lying all this time. FAA does that to be really, you know, they  try to restrict wireless signals to be as conservative as possible. And there's a lot  of spectrum that just doesn't go anywhere near the communications traffic from a plane.  So the actual signals they have going to the plane that are providing the data to the Wi-Fi,  to the cabin data is EVDO. I mean, it's their spectrum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's EVDO. That's how they're connecting to the ground station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. And so it's 3.6 megabits downstream and 1.8 megabits.  For the whole cabin.  For the whole cabin. And so I can talk a little bit about what that was like, you know,  being in that cabin and sharing it with everybody because it is a shared connection.  Was it a full flight?  It was a full flight. It was a press flight. So 100% saturation. Everybody on the plane  was using the Wi-Fi. So it was about as bad as you could possibly imagine.  And it was still great.  Really?  It was wonderful. I had no real complaints. I mean, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You said you were able to get on the pirate bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I didn't say what torrents I was downloading, but I did. I actually tested downloading a torrent  and it did work. Here's the thing though. They said that Aircel was providing the GoGo service,  said that they want to cut off chat. So VoIP, iChat, that kind of stuff.  No, IAM?  No, no, no. IAM is fine.  Just video chat.  They don't want to do audio or video streams, not even because the bandwidth couldn't handle it,  because I think that it can. I mean, it's not that I think it can. It can. I mean, I saw it.  I tested it. I was doing bit torrenting. I was sitting next to my pal, Brian Lamb, the editor of,  I'm sorry, the assistant editorial director over at Gawker and Gizmodo. And he was testing iChat  and it was working fine. So you can do it. And the latency is not that bad. I could be recording  twit from 35,000 feet if I wanted to. It's actually that they're doing it out of courtesy  and respect for the other passengers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nobody wants to hear somebody going, and then I said, and that's why I don't want cell phones on  flights. It's the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. And they were pretty upfront about that. They were like, look, we're choosing to block this  off because we don't want people just gabbing on phone or on chat or on...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they still have cell phones in there? Is that the other reason, right? Because they want to  charge you the eight bucks a minute for the cell phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, there's no, Virgin America doesn't have any.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, they don't have phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  As far as I know, all airlines have had those shut down and that spectrum has since been allocated  to data. So yeah, the whole intention here was to kind of take out all those in-flight cell phones.  All those licenses have been expired and that spectrum was auctioned off, I believe, last year.  So that's what this service...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I didn't know that. So you mean that phone in the back of the seat that hasn't worked for a year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, you don't fly Air Canada. They don't take nothing out. Now they  didn't have a hole in the seat. What are they going to do with it?  They still have ashtrays.  Yeah. Wow. I didn't realize that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. So it's been... It worked really well. It's $10 for flights under three hours and $13  for flights over three hours. In my opinion, totally worth it. Yeah. And again...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Worth it, but also a huge profit center for them. My God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're going to make so much money. So they're going to make so much money. It's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was on an SAS flight two or three years ago that had Wi-Fi Transatlantic, and I used it  off and on. But after a while, after the novelty wears off, you don't really want to be online all  the time, do you? I know you don't have this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a 10-hour flight or 11-hour flight on Tuesday.  You go to sleep.  No, no. I work the whole time. That's usually my... That's like the one isolated time that I have is  where nothing's bothering me. I actually probably get most of our planning and all of our text  written. Why did it take so long in the U.S.? Because Lufthansa's had this for

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  years. Yeah. Boeing has had a subcompany called Connection, and it's been rolled out in parts  of Europe and stuff like that. Here's the thing, though. There's a couple of bits.  First of all, since this is a U.S. service, and there isn't really any way except by satellite  to get internet access if you're, say, flying over the ocean, you can't expect this to work  if you're flying out of the country. Now, Virgin America doesn't have any international flights,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so it's not big deal. SAS worked across the Atlantic, so I guess they were using a different

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  technology. Right, so they might be able to... Most of them use satellites, yeah. Most of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  international flights. Here's the thing about that working condition and that disconnectivity,  so to speak, is here's what you got to do. It's not really anybody's business what airline you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  flying. You don't have to tell them you're on Virgin Atlantic with full Wi-Fi connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. You're on a 12-hour flight to be able to look, I'm taking a flight tomorrow. I'm  going to be offline. I do that. You can do all your web surfing. You can check your email and stuff  like that. Just don't respond to it. I used to do that. And just make sure Skype is turned off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's hard. I always forget and then suddenly I'm there. I'm there. Your presence is your choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can turn off AIM and still be browsing the web and checking your news feeds and stuff like  that because that's what I'd be doing. That's my biggest problem is I get off the plane. I have  like a thousand news articles unread. It's a big pain. When I would go to Canada, I would say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would actually put a responder on my mail. I'm going out of the country. I won't be  reachable. I'm going to the darkest continent. I'm going to be in Toronto. I don't know if they have  internet there. I would have a week that I'd have to answer email. I loved that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The big deal here is not that Virgin is the first to have Wi-Fi. Almost all the airlines  have at least announced experimentation with it. Some of them already have it. It's that they are  going to roll it out on all their planes by the middle of the next year. Is that their big hook

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that they're pushing? Yeah, pretty much. There's actually a couple of other little things that  aren't really being talked about. One is that they're not filtering traffic and they're the  only airline that's not filtering traffic. If you're on American and you go to a site that is  questionable and you never know what sites are considered questionable. Boing is by man's  standards considered a questionable site. You might not be able to access it. They filter that  traffic. They will actually be looking for questionable material. Virgin has said that  they're not going to do that at all. You could technically be browsing adult material. Not that  I would recommend doing so. It might be offensive to the people sitting next to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was one of the reasons the other airlines justified. They didn't want to have to have the  flight attendants responding to complaints from people, this person next to me surfing porn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sometimes I'll watch a movie with a nude scene and I'll go, whoa, and I'll cover it up. People  have laptops with them. They're going to have stuff on their laptops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly. It's not like that individual couldn't have already just loaded their laptop up with  questionable material and started watching and reviewing and browsing with it or whatever.  Even offline. If somebody wants to do that in a public place,  internet connectivity or no, they can do that. The whole I'm going to filter your traffic is  silly to me. It's just a pain. What kind of filter are they using?  I don't know exactly what the filtering solution that they're using or who is building their  white list. I also know that one of the things that they're doing is some traffic shaping.  Basically, if you're abusing the traffic in the system, they won't kick you off because  you did pay, but they'll scale you back. You mean America or Virgin?  I think this is pervasive across all of the GoGo installs on any airline.  If there are 10 people using the traffic, then everybody would get 360K if they were all using  all of their bandwidth at the same time. It would equal that out. One of the coolest things  that we're talking about is if you're on a red eye and everybody's asleep and you just happen  to be up at four in the morning and you're using the internet, you get as much bandwidth as there  is. It's proportionate to how many users are on the connection. Where can I get 3.6 megabit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  EVDO? I'd like to try that. What cell company offers that? Aircel. I thought EVDO was limited  to one and a half megabits, I guess. I'm getting faster than that. That's what they cap.  I'm getting 2.2, I think, at times. Speaking of 2.2, did you put the new iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did. How do you like the Street View? The Street View is the best implementation that I could  imagine. I expected it to be some kind of clunky. I couldn't find it when I first started because  I was trying to roll up the page. I was like, where's the Street View? Where's the Street View?  And I realized, oh, it's that little... Drop a pin, baby.  Well, you drop the pin and then there's this little button there and you just hit that little  button, the little person button or whatever. I love the way it flies into it. I was looking at

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a Petaluma right here, actually. I just say Google is owning the iPhone. I don't know what  the G1 is doing, but Google is on the... Between the voice search... Of course, you have actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a better Street View on the G1. Yeah, and you have the compass thing on the G1 where you can  actually turn it around. But my thing is, other than the G-Wiz factor, what is the big excitement

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  about having Street View on the phone? I do it a lot. I'll tell you what. I use Street View  for a lot, is verifying. Because, for instance, I want to go to a Starbucks or I want to go to  a pizza or whatever, and you'll see a whole bunch of them show up on a Google... You'll  search an address and you'll say, show me a coffee shop or whatever, and you'll see like six of them.  And there's really only three of them there. They've either moved or it's inaccurate or whatever.  And so I'll use the Street View a lot to make sure that there's a building, at least when that car

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  went by, that says Starbucks on it. You're the Ronald Reagan of fast food. Trust but verify.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's morning in America, so he needs his coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hallelujah. The other good thing I love, transit directions. I mean, if you... You must like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Transit directions are brilliant. They're so well-backed. I love that. It gives you the dollar  amount. It tells you what trains to take when those trains are arriving. I want to test it

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  when I'm in France. I presume it would work worldwide. I'd love to see it. I'm going to test

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it in Japan next week. See, if they... At pedestrian directions, it used to be you'd have to take  the stupid car directions and figure out, okay, what I really need to do is just go straight there.  I've been using that on the website for a long time and I really enjoy that. Yeah. I think a great

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  idea. Yeah. You know, I will say this. Having played with... I have a G1 and I have an iPhone 3G.  In fact, I'm playing with the implementation on the G1. The 3G implementation is better. It's nicer.  It works faster and I have to say it's smoother animation. You're saying that T-Mobile 3G is  better than AT&T's? No, no. I'm saying that the iPhone 3G implementation of Street View.  Their implementation of Street View is better than Google's own implementation of Street View  on their device. What's Google doing? Why... Well, it could be just a matter of teams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not like it's a central team. It's probably there's a team working on the iPhone app. There's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  a team working... Right. No. Well, Apple actually develops all their iPhone apps. So the Google Maps  app is not developed by Google. It's an Apple thing. Right. The Apple app. Same thing with...  The Google mobile app is not developed by Apple. It's developed by Google. Yeah. I talked to the  guy who... Yeah. The Google Maps and the YouTube app are both actually developed by Apple. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Al Korn worked on that. I think I like better about the 2.2 firmware is the direct downloads  of podcasts. The ability to get the new episode when you're like, oh, I forgot to sync. As podcasters,  we love that. Yeah. I don't think there's anything terribly revolutionary in 2.2. It's nice to have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think downloading podcasts from a podcaster point of view is revolutionary. It could open

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  things up very quickly because I know that it's something that I think about. I'll be somewhere  and I'll think, oh, I really want to listen to that. I'll have to go back to my computer and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll have to do this thing. I think you're limited to 10 megs if it's a 3G, right? Right. If you're  on Wi-Fi, there's no limit. Wi-Fi, you can do as much as you want. That's to keep people from

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  having 8,000. But the problem is that the subscriptions are impervasive. So what you're  subscribed to on your desktop is not carried over. So if you haven't gotten the latest episode,  the last time that you synced, your device does not know that. So you have to know to go check  there's an episode and then download it. But it's really not that hard. I did it this afternoon. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  was out with the dog and I was wanting to listen to Extra Life Radio and I didn't have the latest  episode. And I was like, oh crap, I forgot to sync. And then I remembered, oh, I can press this button  and while I was driving, it downloaded the episode. So I went out for the walk and we got to the park.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had it. I think that's pretty cool. It launches the iTunes store, right? Is that how it does it?  So you go to your podcasts, whatever you've got on here, GDGT or Sword and Laser Pointer,  and then you say, I'm sorry, I had to do that. And you say at the bottom, get more episodes,  you press get more episodes, then it launches the iTunes store. It shows you a list. So you're  saying because it shows you the list of, oh, it didn't work on that one. I don't know what

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  happened there. Here's the important thing I think though that we have to kind of put in perspective  with what Apple is doing. And that is that if you look at every single smartphone OS that has come  out in the last decade, Palm, Windows Mobile, or before it was called Windows Mobile, it was  Windows CE and Windows CE.net. You've got Android, you've got Symbian, you've got UIQ.  There's this plethora of smartphone platforms and they're all good in their own right and they all  have their advantages and disadvantages. But none have been as aggressive and as, you know,  so quick to add new features and expand on the functionality of the platform as Apple has with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the iPhone. Which is funny because we complain a lot about how they're not going fast enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they still don't have cut and paste and background processes and all these things,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but I agree, Ryan. Those are design decisions and I think that it's important to kind of, you know,  put those off in a different corner than they're choosing not to. I mean, yes, granted, it is a  choice not to do it, but those are choices. It's not like they haven't implemented copy and paste  because it just hasn't been on their radar. It's really, I think for them, it's been a design  decision. They haven't, you know, found an implementation that they think works elegantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Any implementation would work. T-Mobile Storm, nice implementation. You tap it, it does it. G1,  tap it. How do you like the Storm? The G1 implementation is not that good because it's  limited. It's not everywhere, so that's kind of a problem. How about the Storm? That's got

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  full cut and paste, right? It does have copy and paste, yeah. Copy and paste. It also has background

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  processes, which the iPhone actually has. I mean, if you're using the iPod, it's a background  process. It runs in the background while you're doing other stuff, so it's capable of doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just don't allow it. Only Apple. I think it could greatly affect battery power, you know,  if you start running those processes. Well, I have to say the G1's battery life is awful. I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's unusable. Yeah, it's something we're already seeing with the G1 because the G1, it comes,  you know, by default. It's looking on location. It's got apps in the background that are looking  for location. It's got push Gmail, you know, between the Wi-Fi, the cellular, all that stuff.  I mean, it's one of the most, you know, abysmal battery life experiences on any mobile device  out there right now. And it's the battery life that's actually the worst part of the G1. Everything  else that, you know, they got fairly well. But that battery life is just terrible. How about the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  storm? How's the battery life on the storm? Is that okay? You know, I haven't actually gotten to  play with the storm yet. What? So me neither. Yeah. Tom, you must have gotten a storm. You're with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CBS. Yeah, I haven't. I haven't got my hands on it myself. No, Verizon is not that it's for Sina.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to let you in on a little gadget industry secret. Verizon is not very pro press.  They don't really do a lot of outreach. It's quite usually they only do at the behest of the gadget  companies. And here's another little secret for you. RIM is also not pro press. They don't do a  lot of outreach. You know, it was actually I think somebody from a gadget was at a dinner with  Basili, co CEO of RIM. This is like last year. And talking about a gadget and he's like, what's a  gadget? Thanks for paying attention. That doesn't matter. You know, I guess maybe that sounds a  little silly coming from, you know, the former editor of a gadget. But you don't know what a  gadget is. That means that you basically been under a boulder for the last. No, no, if you're a cell

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  phone guy, you really ought to know who the players are. I kind of feel like the bold is a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  better choice in the storm anyway. I like the bold. I do like the bold. Really fond of the bold

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  so far. Yeah, I like it. It's a little bit kind of a brickish to me. It's a lot thicker than I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think it needed to be. Yeah, you know, it's in your hand. That guessing that slim, slim and  trim guessing. You know, it's interesting when we're talking about the differences between how  Apple, you know, implements things on the iPhone and what we've got going on with Blackberry.  It sort of fits into that old pattern that Umberto Eco identified between DOS and Mac,  DOS being the Protestants and Mac being the Catholics. Mac has always an Apple has always  granted you these is what this is what you do. You play by these rules. You will be happy. Just  trust us. You'll have good battery life. Don't complain. And DOS was always like, go anywhere,  do whatever you want. It's up to you. You know, your sins are on your own head. And that's  essentially in a little less extreme way, the difference between, you know, a Blackberry and a  Palm versus the iPhone. The iPhone says, no, you want good battery life. So we're going to let you  do these things. Blackberry is like, hey, it's up to you. Your battery runs out. You shouldn't use.  Well, you can change your battery. You can change it. Right. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You have the freedom to do that. There are very few Blackberry apps. I mean,  there are they're out there, but not too many people use them. And they're all pretty much  sandbox and they're more or less Java based. So you can't do a whole lot with them. It's not  the same nature of apps. I mean, Blackberry, I guess, is technically a smartphone, but it's not  that it's not a smartphone in the depth that you think of a Palm device or a Windows mobile device  or the G1. But with the Android, it's being a smartphone. I mean, those are on a whole other  level and you get really kind of low level access to some of that hardware. Not really the same on

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the Blackberry. How many apps do you guys download for the iPhone? For the iPhone? Eight pages. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it goes on and on. How often? How often do you have? Every day. I downloaded another one  yesterday. A few a week, maybe not every day. You're going to hate me because I'm going to show you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  desktop tower defense. No, I got it. You got it? After we talked about it on Mac, on Mac. Somebody  sent me an email. I got more than one. Field runners. Field runners is awesome. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, what's interesting though is that this is, I would estimate some of the best attach rate of  software to a mobile device we've ever seen. I agree. There are some really hardcore smartphone  users out there, but in terms of per capita, I think that there's more apps installed per device  on the iPhone platform. Well, so easy. Compared to experience. Exactly. Yeah. It's part of the  app store and that's why the other guys are doing that. Look at HandBango. I mean, buying it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's a painful experience to buy. And even, I have to say, even the G1 store is still nowhere near

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the elegance of the Apple store. I think that it's so far, it's so my, how much I'm paying and  everything else is so hidden behind things that I tend to. That's the other thing. I tend to just go,  yeah, I'll get that. I'll get that. It's free. Yeah, it's a beautiful cathedral,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wonderful ceremony in the Apple church. You're going to love it. You don't need all that freedom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just abuse it. Hey, talking about print, did you see this PC magazine? Of course you did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody saw it. No more print edition. Yes. I saw Jim Latterback the other day in a bar and

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we raised a glass. Yeah. I'll raise my coffee mug to raise a brain tonic. I think of an era.  This was the most powerful computer publication ever. When Spencer the Cat, well, that was  actually PC week, but it was Ziff Davis. When he threw a party at CES or Comdex, everybody  was there, including Bill Gates, PC magazines, Michael Miller, editor in chief, the most powerful  guy in the business. I think it went up to 1.2 or 1.3 million circ. This was dominant and now  they're giving up print. They're going to continue with the website. You got to remember, that was a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  different time though, Leo. It was four years ago. No, no, no, no, no. Yeah, it was a higher circ,  90s, early aughts. Again, this is before blogs really came onto the scene. There were not as many

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  technology. You're probably as much responsible for killing it as anybody, Ryan Block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It's all your fault. When it came out, I tweeted, then the news came out,  I tweeted that it bums me out. There's a couple bits of silver linings here. First,  they killed it before it killed itself, which is important. They could have just let the brand  drive itself into the ground, but they didn't. Secondly, and most importantly, they're not  shutting down operations. They're moving everything to the web, which is what they should be doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  anyway. Yeah, I think that's a really good point, Ryan. PCmag.com is still around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's not only around, but they actually do some really amazing content there. The people who I  know who work there are excellent. It's funny how it's a misnomer because it's PCmag.com. It's  clearly not a magazine anymore. The magazine brand doesn't really make a lot of sense.  Look, they do a good job. They've got a lot of great editors, a lot of great talent.  As far as publications go on the web, they're top notch. I'm glad that they're still around.  I'm glad they're putting 100% of their resources where it needs to be because, frankly, people who  are interested in technology are not buying paper magazines. They're absolutely...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think this was an issue when you looked at tech TV. You saw tech TV going on the cable,  and you were like where it really belonged was on the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  From day one, I said, why are we building a brick and mortar business? This is crazy. This is the  past. But Tom Merritt, is this the canary in the mine for other print magazines?  Yeah, the tech guys are the first to adopt this web, this thing called the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're some of the first magazines to go online. They were the tech magazines.  This is a big deal when you step back. It's like, look, a print entity decided that its business  can exist entirely online. It doesn't need a print adjutant, for lack of a better word. It  doesn't need a print edition of itself. Is that going to be true of the economist? Is that going  to be true of someday Vanity Fair? I think that there are a lot of publications

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that lend themselves to having print magazines. I don't think that this is a rule that is going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  sweep. Life magazine will never go out of business because it's all pictures. It's very, wait a minute.  I thought they were out of business. Oh, never mind.  What exactly, Ryan, I'll tell you, the only magazines that will be around in 10 years will  be the ones sold at the grocery checkout line. Star.  The Star. The Star, the Globe, Us Magazine, Entertainment Weekly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When you look at that tech section in your Barnes and Noble or Borders where they have the huge  magazine areas, I always look at those and I'm amazed. I'm like, really? There's this many  magazines still? It's the niche ones that people still buy for whatever. There's tons of windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those niche ones don't really matter because as blogs and publications start going to micro-niche,  you've got a photography magazine. Well, screw the photography magazine. I want a photography  magazine, a photography blog that's only about Canon lenses.  Yeah, I want the Canon lens magazine. I can't access that blog every single place I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I can't access that magazine. Well, that's the thing. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's why I think the grocery line is going to stick around. There'll be bathroom reading,  maybe not even airplane reading anymore after our first story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, for me, it's like, it's when we're taking off and landing,  you know, on an airplane, bathroom, and when my battery dies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can't have your Kindle on during takeoff and landing. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, somebody told me for the first time that he'd been, his Kindle was turned,  the stewardess said, turn off your Kindle, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because you know those are dangerous. You never know.  You know. Well, that Kindle could bring a plane down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I actually tell them that it's off and that because it's being, that it just looks like it's on.  And do they buy that? You have to live with yourself.  They usually leave you alone after that. Really?  Yeah, no, you can, well, you can pop out the battery. You can open up the back and take out  the battery and then the screen is still on. They're like, oh crap, maybe this guy's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He is Ryan Block, you know. Take that flight attendant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I like to be really passive aggressive with that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stick my. Well, I know that for me,  looking at these at magazines, if I could get stuff like The Economist and there's a handful  of other magazines that I read, I'd vastly prefer to have them, you know, on my iPhone, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It makes me mad that I can't get the New Yorker on the Kindle. I mean, that's just a natural place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Some things I don't want to read on an iPhone, that's a small screen.  Big enough e-paper like that one they show that's like, you know, eight and a half by 11,  eight size paper, something thin allows me to switch pages, you know, can update itself.  How long before that comes out? I mean, it's here. It's just a matter of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  the business plan. Now, technology is available. E Ink that is actually would be a mass market  substitute for paper is not here. I think we're really talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  people in our generation. I mean, you know, my kids aren't going to care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There is a display now that is, you know, updatable and high resolution that can do it.  It's too expensive and nobody wants to jump on that bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Is it needs to be color. It needs to be thin and it needs. I don't necessarily think that needs to  be flexible. I think people don't necessarily. I mean, flexible is great.  It needs to be unbreakable. No, isn't this really happening though?  It needs to be thin. It needs to be color and it needs to refresh faster than,  you know, a quarter of a second. The part that is hard. They can make them

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  color and they can make them thin, but the refresh rate is still pretty low.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Isn't this really happening though? Not because of consumer preference,  but because advertisers are abandoning print or is it or the magazines are too expensive.  The newsprint, the papers too expensive, the inks too expensive, the truck deliver it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Ink's expensive. Ink is like more expensive than gold.  Yeah. Especially if you use a Lexmark printer. And there's and there's it gets even more  expensive than a printer. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The economies of printing are it's all of those things.  Yeah. And the fact that- So it's not consumer preference we're talking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about here. It's economics we're talking about. I think it's both. Yeah, I don't think it's one  or the other. I mean, definitely consumer preference for wide ranging magazines like that  has gone down. There's no doubt about it. They're still out there for the more niche  magazines. At least that's the evidence that I see. But something like a PC mag that covers  so wide of an aspect, people are like, well, I get it other places, whether it's another magazine  or like Brian has pointed out, you can get a blog on any subject you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anything that's timely, anything that's a narrow catch you want on the web. I mean, even when PC  magazine went to twice a month, it still had, I think, an unusable lead time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I also think, I look at, I mean, I read the New York Times every morning on the way-  On your Kindle. On the bus,  but I don't pick up the paper. I mean, I see it, I see the paper at the coffee shop or whatever  in the morning. But the idea that I have to carry it around and open it up and everything else-  So you use your Kindle for that?  No, no, no. I use either my iPhone or I use my computer with EVDO on the bus or whatever.  But I'd much rather, I can very quickly get to all the things. I can get to maybe if I missed  yesterdays or whatever, I can find all the links. I don't want to deal with the paper anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not hard on your eyes to read a lot? Or is it just that the time is limited enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I mean, I read for an hour. I mean, I basically go through all of my RSS feeds on the bus in the  morning. It's about an hour. It doesn't really bother me at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think everybody should be listening to Audible.com because it's easy on your eyes. It's your ears that  you care about. It's listening. I'll tell you, I spent more time on the bus listening to Audible  books. I love that. And you just close your eyes and relax and enjoy.  When are you on the bus?  What?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You take the bus down to your office?  I take the bus to San Francisco.  Alex does because he's moved out here.  There's an express bus. So it picks up here and goes straight down.  It was a great bus.  It's awesome because it's direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a commercial now just to warn people who... Well, I segued into it so smoothly,  I might have fooled you. Audible.com slash twit2. That's a special URL for the Audible Platinum  plan. The Audible Platinum plan allows you to subscribe and get two books a month. And when  you do that, you're going to get two books right up front, absolutely free. Well, two credits.  Many great choices on there. When you do Sword and Laser, do you recommend also the audio versions

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of those sci-fi books? Actually, Audible was nice enough to throw some freebies  towards Sword and Laser listeners. They're not paying us, so we don't make a big deal out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One of the reasons is that Audible has actually built studios in their headquarters in New Jersey  and they are recording a lot of these sci-fi books that were never recorded because sci-fi  publishers aren't exactly... They don't record it. We're barely got paper to put this thing on. So  they have started this thing called Audible Frontiers where they're recording some of the  best classic science fiction, in many cases for the first time. When I first joined Audible in  2001, that's one thing I looked for is where's the sci-fi? And there wasn't a lot now. It's unlimited.  There's just a ton of great science fiction. What are you reading on Sword and Laser this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We are currently reading Memoirs Found in a Bathtub by Stanislav Lem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love Stanislav Lem. Yeah, I love him. I'm a big fan.  I think he's kind of underrated. Well, not underrated, but not so well known, is he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's not as well known. So it was... Veronica had a pick... Well, before Anathem,  Veronica had a pick, so this was my pick. And I tried to find something...  And did Anathem... Was that like a three-month long read?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Practically, yeah. Unfortunately, there's no Stanislav  Lem on Audible yet. I'm sure that's something that they're working to address. There's a sci-fi  radio series that he wrote. That's kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  By the way, Veronica wanted me to mention, for anyone interested in Veronica and maybe even  interested in speaking with her, she couldn't make it on the show today. She has a head cold.  Oh. But she's actually... She's auctioning a half an hour of her time off to do a video chat with  someone. She's doing Humanity, huh?  Exactly. H-U-M-A-N-E-T-Y.com. And that charity goes to Child's Play, which is an awesome charity for  sick children to get them video games. So you can hang out and talk with the co-hosts of Sword and  Laser, Core, Tekzilla. She does all those shows and more. And she's the current auction right now.  She is the current auction, yes. Gary Vaynerchuk is next. Felicia Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Scott Bourne's gonna do it. John C. Dvorak's gonna do it. Dick DiBartolo did it. It's a really neat

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  idea. I think this is a... Molly and I are gonna do it too. Are you? I think I'm on the list somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hugh... H-U-M-A-N-E-T-Y.com. This is like a turducken. We put a PSA in the middle of a commercial.  Now all we need is a commercial in the middle of the PSA in the middle of the commercial,  and it will be a turducken. Maybe I'll do a commercial for turducken in the middle of the PSA.  Boom! Audible.com slash twit2 for your platinum. Pick a book, two books if you want.  Anathem is a two... I think it's a true credit book. Boy, is that a good way to read Anathem,  just to listen to it. It's a... It's kind of partly dramatizes multiple voices.  Just fantastic. I've recommended it before. I loved... Did you like... What'd you think of it, Tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I loved it. I thought it was great. It took about 100 pages to really get cruising and then I was  sucked in and really enjoyed it. I know it's a lot for some people. Some people think it's a  little too pretentious and it is, but the world he created was just crazy. Took me 250 pages

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to really get into it. But boy, it's Neil Stevenson. When you read Neil Stevenson,  you say, I'm going to take some time here. I'm going to spend some time with this. He did a  masterful job. I'll make that our pick because that's a two credit pick. So if you go to  audible.com slash twit2, you can get two credits, make it this long book. And long is right. 32  hours and 30 minutes. That's faster than I read it. Yeah, it probably is. I loved that book.  And I've already read it in print, but I've downloaded the audible version to listen to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is my problem. I just don't... Now I see why I don't read a lot of fictional books. The idea  of taking 100 pages or 250 pages is just... I can listen through that. I could listen while in the  background, but I can't read that long. It takes the length of a book to get into it, but then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you'll love it. You'll love it at the end. You'll be sorry it ended. That's Tom Wolf. For me,  that's Tom Wolf. I'll get to the end. I go, boy, I hated that book, but I'm sorry it's over.  audible.com slash twit2 is the URL for it. We thank audible so much for their support.  I did see that online... This is weird. This is contrarian. Online advertising was up this quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's predictable. I saw that too. You thought that was predictable?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Before the bottom fell out, sure. Well, but that's this quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think that we're going to... I mean, I really... It's going to keep going up or is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's going to keep on going up. It can't go down. It's like the housing market and the dot

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  com was already so low. I see. Well, but I also think that I was talking to a marketing head of  marketing for a hotel chain and they were saying that they just keep on increasing their online  budget. And especially as things get harder, they're pushing more there because it's more focused.  From your mouth to God's ear, Alex Lindsay. No, but it's just... That's the thing that  people are focusing on because now part of it has to do also with the maturity of the online market  where you're getting a lot of data back about what people are doing. If you compare that to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  advertising on Seinfeld, you have no idea. You're just shooting into the dark.  You might have 18 million people, but you don't know how many of them are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I really don't know if it's 18 million. It's an extrapolated sample. That's another problem with

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  podcasts. You don't know. People listen to it. You know they downloaded it. You don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that's more certain than TV. I think a lot of advertisers use that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  newness to their advantage to get a better deal. They do. Not with us, though. We tell them,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  too bad. Sorry. There's a couple of other things too. As the market has gone the way that it has,  advertising online is more affordable. And then we're also seeing consolidated ad networks working  with larger sites that are giving greater discounts. What was a good deal before is  becoming an even better deal now in terms of on a CPM and cost per eyeball basis.  Online advertising is by far the best bang for your buck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another reason for PC Magazine to abandon print and go online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. But the trick is, is all of this advertising going to go to larger online media  companies or is there going to still be a larger boon for some of the smaller players in the space?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, I agree. The question is, what's happening is they've been shifting money into online  for a long time. That momentum has been building up for a while. It's no surprise, as Alex says,  that this has not changed. As the pot shrinks, they're still shifting money into online. If  it's a better deal, they're going to keep shifting more money to get a better deal.  That money so far hasn't been going all in one place, but it has, I think,  favored some of the more established places because the agencies are just comfortable with  dealing with them. At CNET, I don't work with the salespeople all that often, so I don't know  exactly what's going on. But I know that the clients we've been seeing, the similar clients  that we've had for a long time because they're comfortable with it, it's hard to get new clients.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that what you're likely to see, especially as online advertising grows in some ways,  I don't think it's going to grow in all ways. I don't think it's going to be an outward expansion  in all directions through this recession. But I think that what you will see is that big  advertisers will begin to consolidate and work with the larger, more reputable sites and networks.  I don't want to say the FMs and the publishers who are using FM, but I think the small  sites are going to feel the pinch harder because they're going to be viewed as a little bit riskier  and they're not going to have the economies of scale that CNET would with millions of pages a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  day. I've heard that said about blogging in general, which is that blogging was originally  this great flowering of individuals writing their thoughts online and finding an audience and a  voice. I've heard that said that the big ones, the end gadgets of the world are going to swallow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the reality of any big growth. It's what happens everywhere. We started doing railroads  120 years ago, 130 years ago, and it blew up and there were little railroads everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then eventually there were three. Actually, all three went out of business  after the Transcontinental Railroad. There was a big bust, very much like the dot com bust,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  and we started over. Television, another good example of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't speak specifically to how things have been within gadgets since I've left over the  last few months, but I do know that the margins on a lot of publishing houses are so high,  your Gawkers and your Weblogzinks and so on, that even as profits start to get churned through  the recession and it is a little bit harder to secure larger online advertising deals,  because the margins are so high, it's not as challenging for somebody like Engadget,  for a publication like Engadget, to stick this thing through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But aren't some of the publishers, didn't a bunch of people at Valleywag get laid off? Isn't Gawker

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  kind of struggling a little bit? Yeah, you want my personal opinion about that.  Valleywag has been struggling for a very long time. It was at the bottom or maybe second to the  bottom in Gawker's entire network, so it was a really easy opportunity for Nick Denton to blame  the economy on what was essentially a failed product. I think we're seeing a lot of that right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  now, which is people laying off people. I'm not going to put words in. I can say, for instance,  Jason and Mahalo or Revision 3, but I have to say this is a great opportunity if you wanted to lay  off people to do it and blame it on George Bush. The venture capitalists are telling their companies,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I read this in The Economist, they are saying, you need to cut your costs right now. They're

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  feeling the pressure from their backers. Yeah, all right, so blame it on the VCs then. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  even better. Yeah, why not? The Viet Cong. But that's typically the first round. The first  round is often, whether it's true or not, for a given company, whatever they're working on isn't  as successful as everything else, the next round is muscle. The next round of layoffs will be  muscle. It'll be stuff that is working. Oh, instead of fat, going down to the bone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was thinking Sopranos. I thought, I'm going to have to lay off Tito. I need my muscle, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Docker and Revision 3 can be laying off their bouncers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then anybody can be on a show. Anybody. Hey, how about the new Google? What do you think  about this idea that Google on Thursday started allowing people, and I noticed, by the way, for  instance, Mike Errington on TechCrunch said, whatever you do, turn it off. Don't use it.  It's terrible. It's a bad thing. And they allowed users to eliminate search results.  The kind of the wickification of Google, the changes won't affect anybody else, just you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, here's the thing, though, is that they're going to watch them.  This is an incredible amount of information being handed back to Google. It is crowd sourcing,  people picking through and deciding, oh, that's bad. This stuff isn't good. And maybe they're  not doing it with it now, but it's got to go back into the calculations over time.  I admit that, that they're paying attention to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you think about it, this is a logical extension of the way that Google as a search  engine works anyway. It's all about trying to learn what reputation means online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But do you want Google to be like Digg?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I said reputation. I didn't say voting or social book marketing or anything like that.  The way the page rank works is it looks for and it calculates reputation.  But this is more like voting.  Based on, yeah, well, I don't know if I'd say voting per se. And I don't even know if wiki is  the right word for it, because if you're the only person who sees it right now,  then that's not exactly a wiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think founded wiki is mad because they don't call Google sites a wiki,  but they call this a wiki. That's not even a wiki. But anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's how it works. If you're logged into Google, when you're doing a search,  you're going to see results. There'll be buttons below the links. You can up arrow it,  which moves the result higher on the page for you only. You can exit, which says,  I don't want to see this one anymore. It is very dig like, isn't it?  Yeah.  But that just affects your personal results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But Mike Harrington hated it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's going to be used as a contributing factor to people's ranks a year from now.  I think that's fine because I think it's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just one variable in the algorithm. It's not like dig where that is the algorithm.  Right.  I mean, there's a little more to it than that, but votes are all dominant. I don't think  that Google is going to go that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I agree.  It kind of went away though, didn't it? Is it still there? It's coming and going or something.  Cheers with Mike Harrington. Cheers were heard across the internet earlier today, November 22nd,  when Google's new search wiki search interface inexplicably vanished. Perhaps just maybe it was  gone for good or at least when it returned, it would have an opt out feature. Nope, neither it's  back. Now it's back.  What cheers?  I don't know. He's decided this is the bad thing. He says, whatever you do, don't use search wiki,  opt out. He says Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It doesn't matter. You don't want to use it, don't use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says Google, it wasn't broke to mess with the real Google searches, serious stuff. Why did they

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  do it? They mess with it all the time.  Often and it's out of the way. It's not something that's in any way obtrusive to what you're  already doing. It doesn't add clutter. It's actually really, I mean, they could have screwed  this implementation up and I'm not necessarily a huge fan of this service, but I mean, I don't  care what all the vitriol is about. I mean, it's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, here's one thing that Mike says, and I don't know if it's true, but he says you  can't, once you turn it on, you can't turn it off. Is that true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You can clear out the results. I don't know about turning it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I never turned it on. I haven't turned it on yet, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, clearing out the results is essentially the same as turning it off. I mean, if it's on  and you don't use it after that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Google killed Lively too. As long as we're talking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I was so sad to hear that.  It's stillborn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I forgot what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Lively, what was it? It's like their 3D world, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It was their second life.  And their take on second life is it was stillborn.  At best, it was stillborn. I mean, it was just not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way, it fell in our chat room says Google plus dig is giggle.  I like it.  You can start the giggle engine.  Let's see here.  Xbox 360. Love it or hate it?  Love it.  You love it?  The new.  You must be a wee. You're a wee guy.  Me?  You must be a wee guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I'm really not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I logged on. You know, I logged on to the Xbox 360.  Or you mean the Nintendo Wii.  Teeny weeny. No, because they've changed it now.  They got the Wii Vatars or whatever you call them.  The Wibbles. The Weebles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They're a little bit better. They're actually right in between what you get with the Miis on the Wii  and the Avatars on PlayStation Home, where it's enough customization that actually looks like you,  but it's not so much customization that it's kind of like uncanny valley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Really, do Xbox 360 gamers want to look like a weeble?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think that they do.  Look, that is not, I think, the crux of the new Xbox experience update that everybody got on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The first thing you see and the first thing you got to do is customize your weeble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but once you're done with that, it's pretty much out of the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I was done with that. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So you've got Netflix integration now, which is great.  That's very cool.  The new interface is really nice. It's a lot more streamlined.  Downloading things is a lot more streamlined as well. Everything seems a lot faster. You can  offload games to the hard drive, so they load quicker.  Oh, that's nice. That's really nice.  Running the game off of the disk anymore, which saves power. It's a lot quieter,  and like I said, it's faster. They have a new party system, so you can, this is something I've

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty funny. You can look at somebody's weeble and then say you want to party,  and to me, that seems like you're, I mean, I don't know.  What does the party, what does partying mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Basically, it means you can get a bunch of your friends and be playing a multiplayer game at the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  same time. It's like a World of Warcraft party.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, I get it. Yeah, kind of. I'm not a big well player,  but it's something that Xbox has always lacked because you can only do a one-to-one chat.  So say you're playing a 10-person multiplayer game, and it's just you and your friend,  and then you can't communicate with the other eight people because you're in private mode.  But say you want to have four or five people, and you want to play together,  but you don't really want to deal with any of the other people, which is frequent on Xbox  because there's a lot of douchebags. So the party system kind of resolves that where,  as it becomes supported in more games, you can jump from game to game with a persistent group  of people and kind of have that private chat with your friends and your friends only and not really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  have to deal with anybody else. Tom, have you watched the Netflix movies

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  on the Xbox 360? You know, I tried it out just to see what it's like.  I reactivated a trial subscription. I don't actually pay for Xbox Live Gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I realized I have to pay for gold. What is that? I'm already paying Xbox like $25 a month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a kind of a pain because if you want to use the Netflix, you have to be a Netflix subscriber

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with a plan and support. But I have the Roku player, and other than high-def, which is a big  difference, there really isn't that much of an advantage to using Xbox. But while the Roku  doesn't have high-def, I think the Xbox has a big advantage. Now the Roku player is going to be  getting high-def soon. As soon as Roku gets Hulu and possibly, I think they're talking about Amazon  and high-def, then that Roku player is a pretty nice item at $99. Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have the Roku player? No, they sent it to somebody who works for me and then wouldn't send  it to me. See, I said you already have one. I said, but I don't get it. I could buy one. Yeah, $99.  It's only $99. I think I could afford it. It's cheaper than Xbox Gold.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm just really wondering whether this is really going to be that. I mean, when you start seeing  between the Xbox through the Roku, through Apple iTunes, whether we're really going to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  buying Blu-rays. I brought in a show and tell item because I brought in the New York Times magazine,  which is the whole issue, how we watch stuff. It's all about screens, HDTVs, smartphones,  laptops, iMacs, computer monitors, Nanos, Kindles, bus shelters, airplane seat backs.  The whole issue is about the fact that all of this entertainment is being dispersed out to every  device. And of course, they have an interview with David Lynch, one of those little things,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and he hates the little screens. Oh, the little screens are horrible. Did you know that David?  Yeah, design a movie for a little screen. Ah, F and F and F and F and F.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But did you know that he does a daily weather report from his house on his blog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A little YouTube weather report. He just doesn't want people watching his films on an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. I don't want to watch this film. Have you seen Mulholland Drive? I don't want  to watch his films on anything. Piece of junk that was. God, I love blue velvet, but boy.  Heineken. Heineken, I bought one. I won't get to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So. Good one from blue velvet. Look at that.  Heineken. Perhaps blue ribbon.  Yeah, well, the screens everywhere is interesting. I mean, they're at the gas stations now, too,  with the live traffic reports. They're in your grocery cart.  Oh, yeah. They're in your grocery cart? I haven't seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one of the things they're putting. I don't know if it succeeded. Maybe it was one  of those things that came and went. It's like Peapod. But for a while, they were putting videos in the  grocery ads in your grocery cart. So here's the thing. I mean, President-elect Obama's putting his  address on YouTube. I mean, clearly, the world is changing in a very dramatic way. And the  fact that the New York Times spends a whole New York Times Sunday magazine on it tells you something.  Of course, maybe it's just so they could have all the DVD ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right. It was just a good moneymaker. Oh, it's a profit deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The other thing that you may not have seen is New York Times also this week launched a gadget block.  Did they? Really, really funny. I don't remember what  it's like. Gadget view, gadget scene, something like that.  GDGT.  I don't want to say it's not well written because it's New York Times. They do a pretty good job.  But the idea of anybody launching a gadget block in 2008 seems pretty hilarious to me

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because that land grab was over years ago. So you're saying GDGT is not a gadget block?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we've said that many times already. Peter and I are not launching another gadget block.  Peter did Gizmodo before Engadget and I did Engadget with Peter. So between the two of us,  we launched and cultivated the two most popular gadget and technology blogs on the internet.  Or at least at the top of that pile. And I don't have any real reason to want to do that again.  We want to try something new. I stand corrected. It's not a gadget  block. It's a consumer electronics site. Yeah, it's going to be a gadget and consumer  electronics site. But we're not focusing on blogging and news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Ah, okay. I get it. Well, the podcast is hugely successful. I mean, that's a hell of a start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it's no twit, but we do what we can. GDGT Weekly is at gdgt.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Boing Boing started a gadget blog too. Boing Boing started. They launched something else new  this week. Yeah, they did a video game blog too.  That's bizarre. That's another example of something. Why are you launching something now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's a little bit weird to see that at this point. Because again, it's not like that there's  any shortage of video game publications and sites out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, with Boing Boing, when they started the gadget thing, I took it as taking the gadget  posts that they already made because they did make them and sort of putting them together in  one place. I guess you could make the same argument with the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but they're doing more now. They hired a dedicated staff specifically for the gadget site.  They're trying to make Boing Boing gadgets its own publication. If your gadget posts are real

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  popular though, that's a good idea. Maybe they're responding to this whole thing  that we were just talking about, which is that the day of the individual blogger is over.  Let's face it, even though Boing Boing has five contributors or whatever,  it was the one thing. If you're going to continue in this world,  you have to be a network of blogs. Is that right? Can you succeed as Boing Boing?  I guess Boing Boing succeeds pretty well. I think it helps. First is finding a niche

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that works and that you can really cover the hell out of. If I was starting a blog now,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would be trying to find that niche. It wouldn't be gaming and it wouldn't be gadgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Those have been done. Frankly, they're not really niches anymore. In 2004 and in 2002,  respectively, when a gadget and Gizmodo were started, they were still niches. Gadgets  was a niche. People were still getting up to speed and owning a cell phone and a digital  camera wasn't as ubiquitous as it is now. The market has really changed since then.  The niche has gone from gadgets, which is what we think of now as being a very broad spectrum,  to something a lot more narrow. That's, I think, the first thing that you've got to do if you're  starting a publication today is pick something a little bit more. Find a new one and don't do a  tech news one table with your product. The best could possibly be a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you also have people who want to hear from the people who are posting there  or what their opinions are, but they want to hear it in a specific track.  We found with MacBreak, for instance, there were things we wanted to cover  like developer stuff or stuff for Final Cut Pro Studio. If we put that in the main feed,  people would go, where's the stuff about my iApps? We've been slowly cutting up  into wider gamuts within that one area, but that's just to satisfy as people have their own.  They can watch the feed that's specifically interesting to them, but it comes out as a

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  separate unit. The smart thing that you've seen over the past couple of years, especially with  regard to the gadget world, is it went from gadget blogs to specific gadget blogs. It went from  Gizmodo and in gadget, sites that covered gadgets with a capital G, to the Zoom blog and the iPhone  blog. Specific, super niche, where only covering one product or one line of products.  I think that's one way of doing it. To take this back, the New York Times doing a gadget blog at  this point seems really desperate, maybe. They're grasping for relevance and we know how poor they've  been doing financially over the past couple of months. I just don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or is it that that gadget, like you say, that gadget category is such a broad thing that it's  now up there with, you know, close to sports and real estate and cars. It's a section of the paper

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you got to have. But they already have bits, you know, the fact that they're doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And they've kind of killed circuits, which was their tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, circuits became bits. I mean, it's funny how they did that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was more granular. We had circuits, now we're just down to bits.  I'm surprised they didn't go from circuits to bytes and then to bits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're going to take a break, come back. We'll talk about, well, the New York Times has announced  it's OK for teenagers to socialize online. Turns out it's good for them. Thank goodness.  What Verizon did and did not do to President-elect Obama's cell phone account and the Pentagon  bans flash drives. But before we, well, it's about time. Before we do that, I want to mention our  good friends at GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting.com slash twit. GoToMeeting is something I've been using  for years. You know, I have to admit, I started using it because my good friend, Ed Iacobucci,  started the company Citrix, a great company. And I was a big fan of Ed. And Ed knew remote access  better than anybody. I mean, he really knew this stuff. Of course, GoToMyPC is one of their  products. I've been using that for years. GoToMeeting is for online meetings. So if you're  in the situation, and I think everybody is nowadays, where you want to eliminate  air travel for a meeting, you don't want to drive across town even for a 10 minute meeting,  you're doing more conference calls. But the problem with conference calls, problem I'm having right  now, I see Alex Lindsay start pulled out to field runners and he's going to play the game. And you  can't tell you're on the conference call. You know they're doing their email. They're chatting with  their girlfriends. They're not paying any attention. That's why GoToMeeting is so useful for an online  meeting. With GoToMeeting, you engage people. Here's how it works. Now you can do it ahead of  time. In fact, it works very nicely with Outlook. Works on the Mac and the PC, by the way. So you  just click a link and you send an email out saying we're going to have our conference calls at 2.30.  And here's the link to click when you get there. Or you can do it while you're on the phone. You  say, hey, look, just go to GoToMeeting.com and type in the meeting ID. They don't have to install  any software. It's very easy for them. All of a sudden, right there on their screen, they're  seeing your desktop. So they're seeing your PowerPoint. You show them the website, the  drawings, whatever it is you're working on. You could collaborate together. You could say, okay,  let's work on this paragraph. And they work together on it. I used it a couple of weeks  ago for a speech that I was giving. We actually rehearsed the speech over GoToMeeting. And the  PowerPoint slides in. It's all in real time. So you really can do that. It just takes two minutes  to set up. I want you to try it right now. Go to GoToMeeting.com. GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  And you could try it absolutely free for the next 30 days. A month of unlimited online meetings.  Mac and PCs, they now have VoIP built in, which is very cool. You don't have to use a  conference call service. It's all part of the price. One low flat monthly rate. As many meetings as  you want, as long as you want. GoToMeeting.com slash twit. We thank them so much for their  support of This Week in Tech. It's a great product. I've known these guys for years.  And I believe in what they do. And I think you will love it. GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  Moving along. The Pentagon bans flash drives. I don't know why were they letting them use flash  drives in the first place? I don't understand it. The use of external computer flash drives because  of a virus threat detected on Defense Department networks. Well, you got to think, guys, guys, pay  attention. Defense officials would not publicly confirm the ban. This is from the Associated Press.  Messages were sent to department employees informing them of the new restrictions. As part  of the ban, they collected any of the small flash drives that were in the building.  Were issued by the Defense Department. Yeah, we gave you these drives. We're taking them back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And we're not giving them back to you. These kinds of devices have been banned or blocked  throughout various levels of government. And in the corporate sector too, for years. It's not a  new thing. Camera phones are clearly one of those bits that have always been a point of contention.  Really, look, here's the bottom line. You can't expect to keep security by taking away flash drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's a good start. It's something you should be doing. These U3 drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really? What you've got to do is either just let everybody,  free for all, bring everything that they want to bring in. Or take everything away at the door  and completely remove all risk of any kind of device security issues whatsoever.  Yeah, take away the local drives too.  Pull that one device in and that device can do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What else do you do? I guess you could firewall. You could have the employee  network completely fire it off, firewalled off from your secure network. I'm sure they must do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They should probably teach the people what the problem is and why you shouldn't be putting  certain USB drives into the computers. Because the fact of the matter is, just banning the USB  drives is not going to solve the entire problem either if somebody goes and plugs one in anyway.  It takes multiple approaches. Education isn't going to solve it. A firewall isn't going to solve  it. Banning the USB drives. You've got to pull out all the stops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Also, thin clients. When I worked at Industrial Light and Magic, 90% of the company couldn't  share anything because everything was running through these Unix machines.  Everything was being shared out and you couldn't really plug anything in to pull anything off.  Of course, we were part of the one little group that just had Macs.  If there was a leak, we were always the first ones that got talked to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How did the virus get into the Pentagon? Actually, if you think about it, the Pentagon  is a big employer. There's a ton of people in there. It's not just any old...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it was detected, it doesn't sound like it got very far. It was like something got picked up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, was this on a secure network that has no internet access or is this on the wider Pentagon  system that's used by every level of clearance? It's hard to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Verizon staff might have cracked into President-elect Obama's cell phone account,  but they didn't listen to his voicemails. That's a good news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently, it didn't have any. In the story I read, it said, well, they didn't listen to  his voicemails. Then later in the article said, this phone didn't have any service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't use this phone for anything. It's not a blackberry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's been deactivated or not unused for a number of months, if not years. Probably not a huge deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  According to the New York Times, he changed cell phone numbers right at the beginning of  the campaign. His cell phone number was fairly widely known. Changed cell phone numbers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  for good reason, for security. This speaks to the other article  that came out about Obama, which is that he wants to be the first president to have a laptop and a  cell phone on his desk. At this point now, they take away all of your personal communications  and devices and equipment at the door. Presidents aren't allowed to communicate directly with the  outside world. It's like you're held hostage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kind of, right? That explains a lot about the last eight years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The concept, and I get it, is that he should have people who are taking care of those low-level  functions for him. Those are technically low-level functions. He doesn't carry a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  wallet or cash either, right? It's also the fact that, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the president, President Bush did this willingly. He said, I'm going to set aside my email address  because every email sent and received becomes part of the public record as a president. It  becomes part of the presidential record. He took his g94w at aol.com address and said,  shut down. He emailed everybody in his address book. Sorry, folks. I'm not going to be using  this for the next... I don't think it's widely known, but he did keep the Bushmeister at hotmail.com.  The decider at aol.com. It was interesting that his email address was given out by the New York

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Times. g94w at aol.com. It just cracks me up. I know.  But he got a bad rap, in fact, as a president who wasn't using email. I think early on,  a lot of us thought, oh, what a nitwit. He's not using email, but he, in fact, was using email. He  just gave it up. We talked about this a little bit last week, too. Obama giving up his Blackberry.  If you're putting some guy in charge of the free world, it seems like he should have access to a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  laptop computer. It seems like he should have. You think he might want to be able to see things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Again, the argument, not that I necessarily buy it, but it is an interesting argument.  And that is that most communications are low level, and that the people who you're dealing  with should be high enough level that they're worthy of your time as the commander-in-chief of  the free world and blah, blah, blah. But yeah, look, I don't really buy that. I think that  it's also important to have an unfiltered view of the world. And that doesn't mean what your  staff chooses to show you. That means checking the blogs or checking the media and the newspapers  and everything online and communicating with actual people and not just your yes-men that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're surrounding yourself with. It's a really interesting question.  Yeah, it's access to web and RSS feeds as much as just being able to send a text message or an email  to somebody. The president's a really busy person. They need to be able to communicate in multiple

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  ways. I don't think that Obama minds that all of those communications become public record. I don't  think that anybody's trying to change that policy. I think it's really just a matter of the policy  is he and should he be spending his time on these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And Al Gore actually set up a governmental email address when he started his campaign in  1999, I guess, for the 2000 campaign.  No, what it was.  He was able to set that up, but it was limited.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, no. It was different. He had his White House email address and he kept it and used it.  So it was like l.for at whitehouse.gov or whatever it was.  After he was out of office?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. He was still vice president while he was campaigning.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you're not supposed to use any. Well, you're certainly not supposed to, for instance,  make fundraising calls from the White House or from the vice president's office.  That's an interesting question. Are you allowed to use your governmental email address for campaigning?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think President Bush doesn't even have a governmental email address.  Right. Right.  I could be wrong about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's president at whitehouse.gov, but I'm sure he's not reading it.  Well, yeah. Okay. You're right.  I doubt he would. I wouldn't want him to. I wouldn't really want him to be reading it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's like feedback at US.gov.  Yeah, right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, man. This guy, you know, Larry Glass 99 doesn't like what I'm doing.  I'm going to have to change my ways.  You don't want him reading that. But does Vladimir Putin or whatever, who's the new guy?  Axel.  Men. Men.  Very good. Very good.  Were you practicing that time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, not really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does Ahmadinejad have a laptop on his laptop on his desk?  I mean, you know, yeah, you presume that the underlives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Both Max Catholic and Dost Protestant. What's his law?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know. Maybe BOS. I don't know. That's a good question.  That's Linux.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Linux?  Waged jihad against the oppressors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  According to the New York Times, actually according to a study,  living and learning with the new media. Teenagers socializing on the internet, not a bad thing.  Considering that everybody on this show and everybody listening to this show probably grew up  as a geek. I didn't have the internet when I was a kid. We had rocks. But basically,  I grew up as a geek. This isn't much of a surprise. A study describes new media usage  of teenagers. And of course, it's huge. It's through the roof.  It's a $50 million project on digital and media learning. 800 young people, they observed  their online usage for more than 5000 hours and determined that, you know, it's pretty good.  They're getting to know each other. They're socializing. They're learning social skills.  They're writing, which I think is fantastic. Even if it's, you know, AOL, ROFL, POS,  that kind of thing. Online socializing is ubiquitous. Many young people move on to  a period of tinkering and exploration like Kevin Mitnick as they learn to look for information  online, customize games or experiment with digital media productions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is not news. I guess it's confirmed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's news for, I guess, the straight world. What the study calls the straight world,  these straights, hey, get used to it. We're here. We're geeks. We're proud. What the study calls  geeking out is the most intense internet use in which young people delve deeply into a particular  area of interest, often through a connection to an online interest group. New media allows for a  degree of freedom and autonomy for youth that is less apparent in a classroom setting. Youth respect  one another's authority online and they're often more motivated to learn from peers than adults.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's all a good thing. They respect one another's authority online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The MacArthur Foundation got that one wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A trip through a local forum would seem to disprove that, but maybe that's all the 30 year olds  that are doing all the claiming and the young kids are actually tired of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're learning how to get along with others, how to manage a public identity and how to create  a homepage. Not in that order. They have geo cities, no less.  And they're also way more than any teenage group ever before.  We're going to wrap it up. Any of any else have any other stories before we table this endeavor?  It's silence. Everybody's in the mood to head out to the pub. Tom Merritt is heard every day.  You really, it's good of you to show up on the show, Tom, because you talk about tech news  like every other day. So I appreciate you're doing that here with us.  Yeah, no, I enjoy it. I enjoy talking about technology or wouldn't be doing Buzz out loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love getting the chance to talk about it with you and all the great folks you bring on like Ryan and Alex.  It's always fun. bol.cnet.com, a CBS joint. You can catch Tom there and he's on CNET TV all the time too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And really great. It's always good. Actually watch bol.com as the live place, right?  Yeah, that's when we record it. It's 1030 Pacific thereabouts. We stream it live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I make sure that I'm not on the air till you're done. I leave my mic on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I don't want to compete with you. Yeah, we don't want to compete with you either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We carefully schedule to avoid that. It's great to talk to you, Tom. Thanks for joining us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mr. Ryan Block, the man in charge over along with Peter Rojas of gdgt.com.  Listen to their great podcast. We look forward to seeing what the when you have a launch date at all.  I mean, it's the question of the day.  A launch date at all. I mean, it's the question of the hour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're sick of answering that one, I'm sure.  No, it's a fair question. We haven't announced the launch date. We're working our asses off behind.  Can I say that? Is that okay? Well, you did. Yeah. Well, you know, we're working as hard as we can to get the site out.  You know, it's we're not making any bones about the fact that it's pretty ambitious for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great. So are you going to have a staff or is it just going to be the two of you or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, you know, I mean, things are a little bit in flux right now. We're just trying to get the site done.  We'll see how it all kind of shakes out later. But like I said before, we're not looking to do news.  We're looking to kind of take on some larger problems in the gadget world online.  And I appreciate everybody's interest and I can't wait to show off the site.  But yeah, we're still in building mode right now.  I think it's a good time to start a new business, particularly of that kind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wouldn't I wouldn't start an auto business right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I left Engadget about two, three, well, I technically haven't really left Engadget.  I'm still the editor at large. I still advise on the site and talk to those guys daily.  But, you know, I left my role as editor of the site and AOL as my full time employer about two and a half,  maybe three weeks before September 15th when the bottom fell out in the stock market and banks collapsed.  And so I had a moment of severe self-reflection.  What have I done?  Yeah, no, but you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wasn't it the news of you reducing your role that caused the market to start going down in the first place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It could be.  You were the bellwether.  I sincerely doubt that. No, but yeah, I'm really excited about the site and I hope people will be too.  And, you know, we'll be showing it around as soon as we possibly can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm not. No pressure. No hurry.  We just look forward to seeing it. That's all. Everybody's very interested to see what you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Every time I come on the show, it's a huge spike.  Lots of people come check out our podcast.  So it's always really nice to kind of get that Leo Laporte bump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, frankly, that's what we do.  We try to shed our listeners off to other people's podcasts because it's just my goal in life to get out.  I've got too many here.  Put myself out of business, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't think anybody's coming to our show for me.  I mean, all we talk about is gadgets and nothing but gadgets.  And it's a really, really hardcore gadget conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. That's why I like it, actually.  Everybody I've talked to who has found the podcast loves it.  You're doing a great job with it. It's really, really good.  Thanks, I appreciate it.  And it's exactly what you were saying.  It's that find a niche and really super serve that niche.  And I think that's really the way to go.  And assume an intelligence on the part of your audience and an interest.  Instead of saying, you know, this is a gadget show for people who are kind of interested.  No, no, this is for people really interested.  That's the way to do it.  Mr. Alex Lindsay, the man in charge of the Pixelcore.  This is a good Alex.  I was talking to Alex the other day and he said, I designed the Pixelcore for this economy.  It's a good time to be a Pixelcorpian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's well, I mean, it was, you know, you don't need to kind of group together as much when things are going well.  But it makes a difference to have a group that you can work with in production and so on and so forth when things are getting a little sour.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A guild of multimedia artists.  And you'll find out more about that at Pixelcore.com.  And of course, the podcasts from Pixelcore, including this week in photo photography, which is great, took photo.com.  But also all the podcasts are on Pixelcore.TV.  Don't forget, you can find us, of course, on iTunes.  Dan keeps telling me, don't forget to mention people could download the show on iTunes.  OK, I thought most people knew that.  But just in case we've got over a dozen shows on iTunes or just go to iTunes, the iTunes store and search for Twit.  You'll find a bunch of stuff on there.  Some some wonderful shows, including this week in tech and the radio show and security now and Windows weekly.  There's a lot of good stuff if you like technology and we don't step on Ryan's toes.  Our gadget show is just silly.  It's the Daily Gizwiz with Dick DiBartolo.  We thank you all for being here.  We'll see you next week.
