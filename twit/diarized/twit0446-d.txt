Transcript:  I'm sorry, did I wake you?  No, you didn't mention noagendashow.com.  Noagendashow.com.  Twice a week.  Yeah.  Double the pleasure of the last.  Noagendashow.com.  That's the moneymaker.

Start time: 165.16

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And also with us, brand new, first time, right?  Yep.  Nathan Olivares Giles.  He is one of the newer guys at the Digits blog at the Wall Street Journal.  Welcome.  Where you were before that?

Start time: 175.28
End time: 179.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Before that, The Verge most recently and Wired, the LA Times.  We're so glad to have you.

Start time: 179.48
End time: 180.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thanks.

Start time: 180.70
End time: 182.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I work together at the LA Times.

Start time: 182.26
End time: 199.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There you go, Mark Millian, formerly LA Times.  He's now at Bloomberg Business Week.  It's great to have you, Mark.  Good to be here.  We have some really good people to talk about the very, very big story.  What's up?  So it's a really fascinating story from a lot of angles.  And of course, the big angle is $19 billion.

Start time: 202.21
End time: 205.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  $350 plus million per employee.  Yeah.  That works there.

Start time: 205.62
End time: 220.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the highest.  First of all, it's the largest acquisition of a VC-funded startup in history.  It's one of the largest acquisitions in history.  It actually dwarfs HP's acquisition of Ross Perot's EDS.  It's bigger than the Skype acquisition.

Start time: 220.38
End time: 225.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is the biggest internet deal since AOL Time Warner.  And look how well that worked out.

Start time: 227.00
End time: 240.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's actually close to what they paid $22 billion or something like that.  I can't remember.  But it's at $19 billion now.  So it's $12 million in Facebook stock.  It is $4 billion, which is 35% of Facebook's cash position.  $4 billion in cash.  And so that makes $16 billion.

Start time: 240.60
End time: 244.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Is this treasury stock that dilutes the value for everybody or not?

Start time: 244.62
End time: 251.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is, I think, a Class C.  But I don't know.  I'll have to look at that.  That's actually a very interesting question for the Bloomberg guy.

Start time: 252.32
End time: 254.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, he should know that right off the top of his head if he works for Bloomberg.

Start time: 254.16
End time: 291.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And then another $3 billion in potential stock grants over the next few years,  depending on performance.  So it could be somewhere between $16 and $19 billion.  You probably saw the Time magazine graph.  It's the biggest acquisition.  It's a whopping acquisition, a deal of historic proportions.  Terry McCracken put together a graph of other acquisitions.  Motorola was only $12 billion for Google.  And remember, gosh, it only seems like a few years ago that Facebook blew us all away  by paying a billion dollars for Instagram.  That's nothing.  That was jaw dropping at the time.

Start time: 291.64
End time: 298.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They should have held out.  They essentially paid one per customer.  They paid $100 a head.

Start time: 299.90
End time: 318.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, actually, that's what's interesting about this.  Facebook stock values it around $147 per user.  WhatsApp was only $42 per user.  I thought it was $100.  No, $42.  So they have 450 billion users.  Is that reasonable?  You always talk about that number, that that's often a number used for this kind of calculation.

Start time: 319.00
End time: 331.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, during the dot com era, we used to watch that number all the time.  How much a user is worth.  Yeah.  And it tended to be for a cable TV guy, it would approach $50 in some situations.  This isn't a weird number.  But generally it's 10.

Start time: 332.50
End time: 372.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, I remember that when Paul Allen bought Charter, he paid something like $50 a subscriber  and everybody bemoaned the inflationary.  It was outrageous.  Yeah.  Actually, it was more like 100, I think.  Outrageous inflationary amount.  All right.  Well, there's so many ways to slice this.  First of all, congratulations to Jan Kuhm and Brian Act and the founders.  They're buying.  One of the big winners, of course, is Sequoia Capital.  They're the only investors in this.  They had put in about $60 million into WhatsApp.  They're going to get a return of over $3 billion.  You got to feel pretty good about that right now.  That's a good day.

Start time: 372.96
End time: 392.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was a good bet.  And like you said, they were the only VC firm that got in.  It seemed like Jan wanted to avoid having a bunch of VCs in there with voting power  who were trying to tell them to put ads or whatever in there.  So I think he found a believer in Sequoia, and they kind of let him do his thing, and  it paid off for them.

Start time: 392.64
End time: 405.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  According to a fortune, Sequoia's stake in WhatsApp is less than 20% high teens, which  means that more than 80% stays with the founders and the employees.  That's a pretty big payday.

Start time: 405.60
End time: 408.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jan especially is a multi-billionaire many times over.

Start time: 408.82
End time: 413.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  45% of the company or somewhere around that, I think, is Jan's.  Yeah, that's a lot of them.

Start time: 413.60
End time: 485.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's $6-plus billion.  It's an interesting story.  When he was 16, he and his mom moved out of Kiev in the Ukraine, leaving his dad behind.  They were Jewish, and there was widespread anti-Semitism at the time.  They came to the United States.  According to a really good article written by Forbes where she did the research, his  mom brought a suitcase full of Soviet-era notebooks with her because she was afraid  they wouldn't have the money to buy notebooks for Jan's schooling.  He didn't like school very much, but was a computer whiz, studied networking, was able  to get a job, didn't go to college, was able to get a job out of high school, didn't go  to college right away, at Ernst & Young working as a technical auditor.  That's when he first met Brian Acton at Yahoo.  He sat across from him.  Acton, employee 44 at Yahoo.  He had some money.  He'd been investing in the tech bubble, but lost a lot of it in the tech crash.  Both he and Jan hit it off.  After Acton left, they both, actually Jan joined them at Yahoo.  They both left Yahoo.  And in 2000, around 2007 I think, they went for a year traveling around South America  playing Ultimate Frisbee and just hanging out.  Sounds like fun.

Start time: 488.32
End time: 490.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They can do that for the rest of their life now.

Start time: 490.72
End time: 495.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They can play a lot of Ultimate Frisbee for that amount of money.  Some very high quality Frisbee discs.

Start time: 496.90
End time: 499.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hand made.  Interesting post.

Start time: 499.70
End time: 558.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Reposted by a commercial Frisbee.  This is on Flyer Talk, which is a forum for frequent flyers.  May 9, 2009, JKB76.  I don't know if this is Brian or Jan, but he says,  Hi there, shameless self-promotion.  I couldn't resist posting here because I wrote this app with people like us in mind,  those who travel a lot.  Ever since I semi-retired a little over a year ago, must be Brian Acton.  I've been traveling a lot and hated it when people tried to reach me  when I'm on the plane or out of the country.  So I asked myself, wouldn't it be cool if I just set a status for my iPhone,  similar to how you could set a status on Yahoo Messenger or Skype?  Problem found, problem solved.  I spent a couple of months, developed a little tool called WhatsApp.  It can let you set a status like on the flight to Munich, send email instead of calling me.  I would like to hear your feedback and suggestions on the idea.  This thread is still alive.  And if you go to the last page, there's quite a few people saying,  Hey, I like that app. Nice job. You made some money, didn't you?  Pretty amazing story.

Start time: 560.08
End time: 564.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And a BlackBerry app is coming, he says in the announcement.  They did, in fact.

Start time: 564.74
End time: 568.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the real success stories of WhatsApp is it's totally cross-platform.

Start time: 569.88
End time: 571.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Except for iPad and desktop.

Start time: 572.21
End time: 573.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No desktop, which is weird, isn't it?

Start time: 573.78
End time: 588.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which is kind of annoying.  Hopefully Facebook will maybe help them out with that.  Did you use WhatsApp before this?  I had it. It's obviously not big in America.  So most of my friends here I wouldn't talk to.  But I spoke with some of my colleagues who are based overseas.

Start time: 588.22
End time: 617.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had one friend who did a lot of overseas traveling.  That's how I got to know WhatsApp.  Because she would use it all the time.  And it's the only reason I had it.  I had uninstalled it a long time ago because I didn't need to talk to her anymore.  But I reinstalled it.  You know, it's not changed much over the last few years.  It allows you to send text messages, video, audio, pictures.  You can do group or single contact messaging.  It takes the contacts from your contact book.  Because it uses your phone number as your contact name.

Start time: 620.20
End time: 651.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which, it's a number of apps.  Even Facebook Messenger does that now.  They let you use your phone number to find other friends to connect with.  But it's become huge.  It's become big in parts of Asia, but huge in Europe.  Because the European carriers tend to gouge customers and charge extra.  For SMS.  For someone who's in another country.  I mean, going to another country in Europe is like going to another state here.  You can road trip to another country.  So this has really taken off there as an alternative to having to pay per message through your carrier.

Start time: 652.70
End time: 672.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Another reason, my friend Alan Tepper, who's from Spain and speaks Castilian.  He'd want me to say that.  Castilian.  Says it takes diacritical remarks very well.  You know, accents and circumflexes, ideas.  And that's something a lot of text messaging apps don't do very well.  You know, Facebook acquired Beluga two years ago.  Did all the same things, right?  It's identical.

Start time: 672.20
End time: 678.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what they made Messenger.  Except it didn't have 450 million people using it.  That's the key, isn't it?

Start time: 678.55
End time: 680.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Have you used it, Nathan?  Did you use WhatsApp before this?

Start time: 680.42
End time: 720.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, actually earlier this week I wrote a story just kind of rounding up all of the different apps out there.  There's like KakaoTalk, there's Line.  Apps that are a lot more popular in Asia because they have stickers.  And you can share like animated little characters that are dancing around and stuff.  Those apps can do far more stuff.  And they're actually way more popular in Asia.  But like Mark said, in Europe WhatsApp is kind of where it's at.  Because there's just this big, big momentum.  Everyone's on it.  And really, I mean, when I look at WhatsApp, I don't really see too much that I want to do with it.  I don't use it very much, you know, because a lot of my friends are in the US.  But, you know, messaging service is only as good as the people who you're messaging with.  So if all your friends are on it, it kind of makes sense.  It's the network effect.

Start time: 720.70
End time: 749.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what made Facebook successful.  Exactly.  In fact, they say in Spain it's almost 100% penetration.  Nobody uses text messaging in Spain.  WhatsApp, there were 54 billion messages December 31st of this year for New Year's Eve.  54 billion.  450 million users.  It's currently more text messaging goes over WhatsApp than all of the SMS services worldwide.  It's not 54 billion users.  No.  It's 450 million users, but they send a lot of messages.  Well, you said 54.

Start time: 751.41
End time: 757.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  54 billion messages.  Yeah, I know.  Then you said, I'm sorry.  You can listen on the tape, ladies and gentlemen.  No, I said it right.

Start time: 758.01
End time: 761.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, you'll see.  It's a good thing you're here to keep them in line.  Thank God we're telling this.

Start time: 762.70
End time: 774.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In any event, it's clearly successful, but my question is what keeps it successful?  This is the problem with the network effect.  If somebody leaves as they did MySpace and uses something else.  Remember ICQ?  It was pretty popular in the day.

Start time: 775.25
End time: 780.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  AOL InstaMessenger was huge.  Somebody bought ICQ and screwed it up, though.  AOL.  Was it AOL?

Start time: 781.36
End time: 793.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At the time, somebody was tweeting a New York Times story that they covered at the time saying,  AOL's acquisition of ICQ gives them access to a new user base, a younger audience that may not like...  Same thing.  Same thing.

Start time: 793.26
End time: 825.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This is like the old...  It used to be predating all this to be one of the older farts here.  This used to be the reputation Xerox had.  Xerox used to buy a company and then the thing would just fold.  They bought Shugart drives.  Boom, no more disk drive companies there.  They had to go off and spin off another one.  It was one after the other.  There's a bunch of jingles companies.  I think AOL was one for a long time.  It hasn't happened yet with Facebook.  But Yahoo is the best example of this.  They buy a bunch of stuff and then they let it languish and it drops dead.  Flicker.

Start time: 825.88
End time: 827.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Yahoo tends to buy things that...

Start time: 827.74
End time: 831.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They go back to the ones like broadcast.com.  You know, where they threw $3 billion down the drain.

Start time: 831.84
End time: 841.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yahoo tends to buy things that don't fit into its mission, whatever that may be.  I mean, Delicious was an example of just buying...  Buying something because it's available.

Start time: 842.22
End time: 844.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was a product a lot of people liked.

Start time: 844.20
End time: 868.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  But it didn't fit...  Yahoo's core audience is mass consumption.  They're a portal and it's the homepage that my mom has on her computer.  And to go after this niche techie audience that Delicious was big in was just a weird pick for them.  But I think WhatsApp, their user base, pretty much fits into where Facebook wants to be.

Start time: 868.88
End time: 901.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That raises a couple of questions because they already had the technology.  Oh, yeah.  They didn't gain anything.  By the way, WhatsApp is written in Erlang.  Scales nicely, but I doubt it will integrate well into the PHP infrastructure over at Facebook.  In fact, they say they're not going to integrate it.  That it's going to be a standalone app.  That's actually wise. That's smart.  You'd lose...  Well, you've got to be careful because you don't want...  The real challenge here is you can't monetize it very well.  Because one of the things that is a big deal at WhatsApp is no ads.  They even say that when you first sign up.  Why we don't take ads.

Start time: 902.20
End time: 905.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they're saying they're going to keep it that way ad-free.  You have to because...

Start time: 906.24
End time: 912.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Alright, I'll go out on a limb.  This is a disaster.  It's the stupidest thing these guys could have possibly done.

Start time: 912.60
End time: 930.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree with you 100%.  You agree?  I think $19 billion right now seems like an insane amount of money.  And it could end up being a really stupid move.  But they need to get more and more users.  They need to grow.  And they just got 450 million people who aren't using their service.

Start time: 930.94
End time: 933.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Aren't all of those people also using Facebook already?

Start time: 934.28
End time: 953.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They might be using Facebook, but they're not using Facebook for messaging.  So maybe they're using Facebook to see their friends' baby pictures.  Or sharing a news story.  So maybe they're not sharing every day in the same way.  Here, this is a very sticky app.  I think something like 70% of the people who use WhatsApp use it every single day.  40 averages of 1,200 messages a month.

Start time: 954.22
End time: 962.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Over 2,000 received.  40 pictures a month.  The trouble is with these types of apps, the way that they're designed,

Start time: 962.20
End time: 973.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the way that they become so popular is that there is no lock-in into these apps.  Your contact list is what's on your phone.  It could evaporate into the horror of...  You can take it and go anywhere else you want.  So they didn't think it was a very good thing?

Start time: 974.72
End time: 975.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think there are two schools of thought.

Start time: 976.70
End time: 978.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like we talked about earlier, the price per user is not crazy

Start time: 979.80
End time: 989.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  when compared to Twitter or Facebook.  That's as valued by the stock market.  But before you go on with that argument,  the reason that price per user was extremely important as a metric

Start time: 990.74
End time: 1023.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  in the late 90s in particular,  is because those users translated to dollar revenue.  There's no revenue on that.  So if you have a guy and you're paying,  if you say you're paying 10 bucks a head,  that guy has to generate $10 in revenue at some point to get your money back.  If you're paying like 50, 60, 70, whatever these guys paid,  you say 60, 50.  I say 45.  45 is a lot.  Well, especially since it's a buck a year.  It takes 45 years to pay out.  That's the only revenue model they have right now.  It's still a relatively young app.

Start time: 1023.38
End time: 1027.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could introduce stickers, which is a lot of money.  They could introduce a bunch of stickers.

Start time: 1027.70
End time: 1040.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a small business, but for the Asian companies,  like Tencent and LINE.  It's Path's entire model.  So, yeah.  Messy websites.  There are other conceivable models like micropayments  that perhaps could be big,

Start time: 1041.70
End time: 1062.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  multi-billion dollar businesses  if you can integrate them into WhatsApp  and not just the ones that are in the market.  So, yeah.  So, yeah.  So, yeah.  So, yeah.  They could integrate them into WhatsApp  and not lose the user base.  I don't think they can add ads, but they could add functionality.

Start time: 1062.20
End time: 1078.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be cool.  You bring that up because a lot of the Asian messaging apps  like LINE and others are actually using  their messaging apps as kind of like a platform  to get payments, to get stickers,  but then also to serve up games,  to serve up e-books, all sorts of things on the top of it.  So, they're trying to kind of leverage that network that exists.

Start time: 1078.54
End time: 1094.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you can bet that Facebook  is aware of that and says,  this is what we're going to have to do with WhatsApp.  You're never going to get in China, because China is already occupied.  You're going to get the countries you've got.  I don't know if the growth...  They more than doubled this year.  But I don't know if that growth curve can continue.

Start time: 1094.70
End time: 1106.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One thing that was interesting, there's a story that  I think it was like the  China Daily Morning Post or something like that  that was in 2012 that said 45% of Hong Kong  was using WhatsApp.  So, it is popular in Mainland China.

Start time: 1107.95
End time: 1131.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was talking to one of my  colleagues in Taiwan  after the deal went down in Taipei  and he was telling me  we were talking about this sort of locking effect  and he was saying, him and all of his friends  in Taipei have WhatsApp  but they also have Line and WeChat.  They have them all.  And they send stickers online and then they'll  switch over to a new app to chat  and it just depends on who's on.

Start time: 1131.34
End time: 1138.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  These are... I mean, if you're in WhatsApp  you can only message WhatsApp users.  You can't go cross platform.  Now we need an intermediary product

Because already the acquisition has gone down  and you can see a lot of users online  who are scared that  Facebook is going to eat up all their  data and ship it over to the NSA.

End time: 1229.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which is the biggest social network in Russia.  His newest project is called  Telegram. It's  essentially a WhatsApp clone  for messaging.  And their usage has skyrocketed  since the deal because they play  up their encryption and  the security of the messages  that you send on their service, how it's unbreakable.  And so  they've already seen a lot of people  in Spain and the Netherlands and  Germany and some of these very privacy-  conscious markets jumping

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  from WhatsApp to Telegram. This should be a smart  thing to do with WhatsApp. Maybe Mark Zuckerberg  steps forward and says, I want to be the  Pavel Dorov of the United States.  No, actually, in seriousness,  steps forward and says, we're going to make this  like 3 mil. We're going to make this encrypted end to end.  We're going to make it secure. We know your privacy  counts. We are going to...  Nobody's going to believe it.  Nobody's going to believe it. He doesn't believe

I mean, this is a company that's growing at a  faster rate than Facebook.  They're a threat to Facebook. Instagram,  I think, was a paranoia play.

Apparently, according to the information,  Amir Afradi writing this... No.  WhatsApp turned them down.  I think that's a funny thing to say.  We don't want you, but please, if somebody else tries to buy you, let us know.  Especially Facebook.  Is it credible that Google could have offered them 10 billion?

Start time: 1324.70
End time: 1394.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fortune says they have two sources that say this,  but that Facebook  offered WhatsApp a seat  on the board and Google did not.  That doesn't surprise me because  Yonkoum and Brian Acton  clearly want to maintain control.  If they have a seat on the board, they have a shot  at derailing any effort to absorb the company and things like that.  So they want the power. They don't just want the money.  They want to protect their baby.  But I think Facebook did this because they were scared.  Of what?  Of some- But very rightly,  of getting MySpace'd.  That's their biggest problem right now.  Is that Facebook needs to-  I'm sure that they have a  metric in their mind. If we get to this certain point,  then we've got critical mass and we can't be MySpace'd.  We cannot be replaced by some other social network.  But we've got to get to that point.  And Mark is all in.  This is basically him pushing in every bit of his chips.  Ten percent of his cash position-  No, thirty percent of his cash position,  ten percent of his company's value.  I'm going to go all in because we just have to survive  several more years  and then no one can assail us.  That's laughable.  You think there's nowhere you can get to that you're safe?  Right.

As though somebody's chasing them, even though  I'm sure there's nothing  that's chasing them except what, the GIMP on Linux?  But they keep modifying  and they're moving your head  as if someone's chasing them.  And that's how you stay at the top.

Transcript:  You can look at Instagram as kind of a similar  defensive move. I mean, Facebook became  this place where everyone was sharing their photos  so much to the detriment of Flickr.  Now Instagram is becoming the one place  where everyone is sharing their photos, especially younger user base.  So what they do, they bought  Instagram and they left it alone.  They didn't absorb it in the company. They didn't potentially ruin it.  Now here you have another thing.  Instead of folks messaging on Facebook,  they're messaging on apps like WhatsApp.  So they're going to buy it.  Ideally, if they do what they say now, leave it alone.  So maybe there's other defensive  plays like this.

Transcript:  I put it aside specifically. So Pavel  I've been reading your articles and I think this is fascinating.  Because we don't know about him  because he's Russian.  But is he  really like the next Mark Zuckerberg?  Is he building an empire in Russia?

Start time: 1580.24
End time: 1653.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's  certainly already built an empire.  I talked to him just a couple days  ago after the WhatsApp deal.  And he's becoming less so now.  We did a feature  in Business Week a little while  ago about how he may have  been a Kremlin target in Russia.  Because he's sort of  a big  successful, self-made  entrepreneur in Russia who  is a contrarian, especially  politically. I talked to him a couple days  ago. We were talking about libertarianism.  He's a libertarian.  And he's very  against the grain in Russia. He's spending some time  in Berlin right now working on Telegram.  So he  was essentially telling me I have all  the money I could possibly ever need just  after VK. And  now all I want to do  is build products that the whole  world can use. And that's what he's doing with Telegram.  He's set up as a  non-profit entity, which is kind of interesting.  He has  absolutely no plans to sell.  His engineers are well  compensated. And he doesn't  need the money.  And the Russian internet  market is... Telegram is targeted  at the whole world. It's not very big in Russia right now.  Is it like Facebook

Start time: 1655.14
End time: 1658.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  basically?  It's a social network? It's more of a WhatsApp, right?

Start time: 1658.78
End time: 1705.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  VK is a social network, just like  Facebook. It looks very similar to Facebook.  His new app, Telegram, is  essentially a WhatsApp clone.  The Russian internet market  is interesting because  their language is so different from any other  language on Earth  pretty much. So  Facebook, Google, all of these  companies that have essentially taken over the world  except for China,  Russia has been the exception for all  of them as well. So VK  is much bigger than Facebook  in Russia. Yandex is the Google  of Russia. They have  vastly more market share than Google.  So Russia has been  an interesting market to watch  just because of it's almost like  a little melting pot  that's isolated from the rest  of the internet.

Transcript:  If you listen to Mark Zuckerberg's  conference call, he  had to take great pains to  express to shareholders why they should believe  in this acquisition. You may not have  heard of this. It's not big in America.  But if you look at Latin America,  if you look at India, if you look at Europe,  WhatsApp is massive.  The story  that I wrote after the WhatsApp deal  is that this is essentially buying  markets that Facebook for the most part  already has a hold in. They're essentially  buying more attention  from their users there.  But it's not going to make  much headway in Asia. WeChat  has China locked down. That's the  WhatsApp of China.  Like we were talking about earlier, Line is the  WhatsApp of Japan. Kakao is the WhatsApp  of South Korea.  In all of these big developed markets  where there are a lot of smartphones, WhatsApp is  not going to be making much of a dent there.  So Asia is still going to...  Facebook is still going to need to figure out  how to do something big  in Asia.

Start time: 1780.90
End time: 1798.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just have to feel like...  Zuckerberg must feel like he's  on a hamster wheel.  There's always going to be these  up and coming... And now, more than ever,  he's just raised the ante. Robert Reich,  the former Secretary of Labor, wrote an article saying  this is bad for America  because it doesn't create jobs. It's just

Start time: 1808.70

Speaking of miffed.  This is complicated.  So I understand this is complicated.  And I'm going to give you a little  backstory before we talk about this. But  essentially the story is that Netflix has  agreed to pay Comcast  for high speed streaming to Comcast  customers.  Now, here's why it's complicated. If Netflix  were just using the public internet,  they would, you know,  like anybody, like we do, they could  just go in on the network. But they  understand that 40%  of all prime time traffic in the US  is Netflix traffic. That they  use a lot of bandwidth. That if you can give  them two or three megabits per second  consistent, sustained, they could do  2K and now on something's  even 4K video. And they want that  bandwidth. So what they've been trying  to do is get a peering arrangement with  Comcast. That's where  basically it's a direct connect between  Comcast and Netflix.  In fact, they tried to  get Netflix servers  in Comcast  operations centers, inside the data centers.  Comcast hasn't agreed to that. But they  will connect to Netflix servers at data  centers operated by Cogent  and other companies that provide the  bandwidth for Netflix.  Comcast said,  if you want us to do that, you're going  to have to give us money. Netflix said no.  And according to  Reed Hastings, since  October, the  bandwidth for Comcast  subscribers, available to Comcast  subscribers, and Netflix plays close attention to this,  has dropped 27%.  And of course, my presumption  is that somebody at Comcast has got  a knob and they're turning that knob  down until they squeeze  them hard enough. And then  Netflix says, well, alright, fine.  Why  wouldn't you do that?  Well, if I were Netflix, I might do that.  It depends on whether they can afford it. I mean, one of the issues  that's come up is this could put them  out of business. It depends  on how much they're paying, but there's a point beyond which  they can't afford to pay for peering.

It is very  bad news for consumers. And here's my  point of view. It's basically setting up toll roads  on the internet. It's as if  UPS said to you, John C.  Dvorak,  you know, I'm Amazon.  I'm shipping to John C. Dvorak. I pay  UPS to ship the product out.  It's as if the driver pulled up to you and said,  hey John, you want this package? Give me a buck.  Otherwise I'm bringing it tomorrow.  It's just like that. It's double dipping.  We pay Comcast  for full and unfettered  access to the internet.  It's in Comcast's interest to  give Netflix a nice fat pipe because that  makes me a happy customer.  But you know why this doesn't work? Because Comcast  has a monopoly. There's nowhere

And Comcast is saying,  we'll do it. We'll give you better access to our customers, but  you've got to pay for that. From Netflix's point of  view, Comcast is basically  holding us up.  Put your own network up.  You can't.  That's not how it works.  It's called the internet, John.

Transcript:  I don't think Netflix has  Google money.  So who's at fault here?  The government.  Unfortunately, the chairman of the FCC  is a former cable company  lobbyist.  The FCC, by the way, I think this is related,  has decided, remember they lost  in court over the attempts to  enforce net neutrality regulations.  They could have appealed. They're not going  to. They could have declared  Internet service providers common  carriers. That would have given them  jurisdiction. They have decided not  to. They've basically folded.

And unless you declare it  as common carriers, then you have a mandate.  And they weren't willing to do that.  So I think Congress is going to have to step up  and say, but I don't think they're going to, because  do you know how many lobbyists  Comcast has in Washington, D.C.?

One of the  deals that they made on that was that  Comcast would not slow down internet  traffic for it.  It would preserve that neutrality.  And they blatantly just said, yeah,  we're going to screw with Skype.  The real problem is that Comcast is in the  streaming video business.  They have stream pics. They're doing the same thing  Netflix does. They're a competitor.

Transcript:  Eric Lipton wrote in  the New York Times this week on  Comcast's web of lobbying  and philanthropy.  We don't  know the number because it's, they have more  than a hundred registered lobbyists in DC  alone. Nice.  The team includes five  former members of Congress.  Also, Meredith  Atwell Baker, a former FCC commissioner.  The one, in fact,  who approved, voted to approve  the deal for Comcast and NBC  to unite.  If you've been watching House of Cards, this all sounds  extremely familiar. Yeah, the  storyline is the same thing.  Comcast has also  done an interesting thing. They have a nonprofit foundation.  They fund groups like the United States  Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, who,  interestingly enough, mere hours  after the Time Warner-Comcast  merger announcement, issued a  statement saying it was a win-win for America  business.

It's a, you know,  and that makes a lot of sense. One of the reasons, frankly,  we get sweetheart deals on bandwidth, because some of  our providers want to have a  back stream so that they, you know,  AOL for a long time carried our  content because they wanted to have peering relationships  with systems that were sending them

Start time: 2794.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, you know, I agree that  there are some not  unrealistic arguments for why  Cogent, among others, should  pay for access. That these  peering relationships aren't symmetric.  But on the other hand, I think Comcast,  it's in Comcast's commercial interest to provide  fast access to  YouTube, Netflix. By the way, there's some  I was told by another  networking fellow that Amazon is coming up against this.  Amazon Web Services,  another example of a company that's pumping  a lot of data, almost all  apps nowadays run on Amazon Web  Services. They're  to get a peering relationship with a company like  Comcast. Comcast wants money.  But don't we pay Comcast

He lives in an apartment.  But one of the reasons he does is he gets amazing internet  because, and this may be the...  Another way to do this is community internet.  A lot of folks have been advocating for this  for a while.  A town like Petaluma might buy wholesale bandwidths  that they wire then the people of the town with  bypassing all of this.

Transcript:  Mobile World Congress is in Barcelona.  Already some announcements. We will talk about it.  In fact, Samsung already pissing  Google off.  Didn't take long.  But first, a word from  Fresh Books. You know what pisses me off?  I used to, at the end of every month,  doing my invoices. If you're a freelancer,  this is the worst time of the month. You've got to get  all the bills,  and then if you forget to  get your invoice, then you don't get paid.  And if you put it off for too long,  I was very relieved in 2004.  That's how long I've been a Fresh Books customer  when Amber MacArthur told me about Fresh Books.  She said,  you don't have, you know, I was using  Microsoft Word and Excel  to keep track of receipts and expenses  and blah blah blah. It just saved me.  I love Fresh Books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, it's just the Gear 2.  I'm sorry. They dropped the Galaxy part.  They also dropped Android, which is  these are actually pretty significant  little moves for Samsung. This is Tizen.  It's now running their own operating system.  They made this all themselves.  No Google here.

Start time: 3540.84
End time: 3562.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It still does require an Android smartphone.  Probably a Galaxy Note 3, Galaxy S4,  or maybe the newer ones.  Yeah, it's going to work with all their Galaxy products.  But, and they will continue  to run Android, at least for now,  but the fact that they're dropping Android  from the Gear 2 is interesting.  The Gear 2  is a simpler device. It doesn't have the camera.  That was a weird thing, anyway.

Start time: 3562.72
End time: 3580.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, actually, they have two versions. They have one with the camera  and a lower priced one without a camera.  But, yeah, there's a lot of things that are interesting.  One thing to me that's  the most interesting is this comes out five months  after the original Galaxy Gear,  which was pretty much  universally thumbs down in the reviews.  I don't see anybody wearing a Gear anymore.

Huawei is now making a  and here's the thing, it's more of a fitness band  than a smart watch, but you know, they can still  all these things will tell you how many steps you took.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's unusual though, because usually when I have  check journalists on, they're all wearing  there you go. Is that the Fitbit Flex?  Watch out for rashes.  Watch out for rashes.  You're going to get electrocuted, take it off.  No, no, it has nickel in it.  Apparently it has nickel in it.  It's allergenic.  Once you get a nickel allergy,  your life is over.  You can never touch a nickel again.  Today's nickels, I don't believe  have any nickel in them.  Oh, that's right, they're now zinc.  Go ahead, touch a nickel.  But if you found an old, like a  buffalo head nickel, don't touch that.  Drop like a rock.  Apparently there's a nickel allergy.  And something like 12 or 14 percent  of all the people who were wearing it,  the force, were getting rashes.  It's curious, the number would be that high, so it means

Start time: 3734.80
End time: 3746.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  that people with some sort of nickel weirdness  are drawing to this device.  That they're going to make the next one out of peanuts.  And gluten, don't forget our gluten guy.

Start time: 3746.70
End time: 3758.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know what's weird is they've recalled them all, it's a voluntary recall,  so if you don't have a rash, I guess you can keep it,  but they've recalled them all and they will send you a check in about eight weeks.  For the value of the force.  They're not going to give you a new force.  I'm guessing that if you sent them a nasty note

Start time: 3758.70
End time: 3768.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  saying, I sent my thing in, where's my money?  And kept the watch, you would get a check.  Go ahead and try that.  I don't care, I'm not really interested.  This is a category that seems to have problems.

Transcript:  It's wishing it would be resuscitated.  I mean, I'm not sure if it's going to be resuscitated.  I think a lot of this is the market just saying,  quick, get to market before Apple does it.  I think this is the one product category  where Samsung is racing.

Start time: 3814.78
End time: 3825.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's why five months after they introduced the first one,  they introduced another one.  They need to make this work before Apple comes in  and acts like they invented the idea.  It could be a bluff.  Maybe Apple never does this.

Transcript:  They look around and say, this is crap.  You know, Ford pulled this stunt once.  You know, when they're making the bigger and bigger...  I remember the Model T.  I remember the Model T. That was a great car.  No, remember when they were making bigger and bigger?  The first they had the...  First it was the Explorer, then they made a bigger one.  The Excursion.  And then they showed on all...  You saw it on all of... a six-door.  This huge six-door Ford.  Just to screw with GM.  They did it just to...  Yeah. Yeah, they never released it.  It's just an artist's conception.  So I think this might be going on.  It's a great gag, by the way.  Is it Apple or is Apple screwing with them?

Start time: 3864.98

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think Apple's going to do it.  They've hired too many people.  And I think the perception of Apple being a failure  if they don't release it is a significant issue.  So they've got to release it.  And Tim Cook has said they will introduce

Transcript:  Just another Apple story real quick.  If you have iOS 7, you do want to patch it right now.  There is a 7.0.6 update that went out yesterday.  An emergency update because of a bug in SSL  making a man in the middle attack fairly easy.  That means that somebody could hijack  your SSL connection to a bank, to Amazon,  to a online retailer,  get your credit cards,  and then you can get your credit card back.  So I think that's a great idea.  Get your credit cards and other stuff.  It apparently is a flaw  both in iOS and in OS X.  Apple says we're going to release  an update for OS X as soon as we can,  but nothing at least as we go to press.  Do we go to press?  As we go to the internet?  The internet.  They said go to press?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's two American companies trying to merge.  There are two massive global companies that sell all over the world.  They have implications for those markets as well.  I think the regulatory approval is for that.  If you're going to do business here, you've got to meet our laws as well.  And China's a very important market for Nokia.  They're just pushing us around, telling us what to do.

Transcript:  One thing I'll be looking for tomorrow with interest is the crapware issue.  Because I really do feel like Samsung's gone too far.  It was pretty clear that Samsung wanted to distance itself from Google and Android.  But Tizen is one thing they're doing.  They had a developer conference last month.  I think they really want to get to the point where they don't have to say we're a Google phone.  They're already kind of at that point.  They're very close.  TouchWitch customizes it heavily.  They've got apps in most cases that replace the Google equivalents that are Samsung apps, not Google apps.  They don't have the Google services yet.  That's a big issue.  Things like location services, which you get from Google Search, which you get from Google.  But I really feel like Samsung has been moving away from Google.  I also feel like that's why Google got rid of Motorola.  Because they really use that as a lever, I think, with Samsung.  Remember, the South Korean government passed a law saying that crapware has to be uninstallable.  Samsung's made an agreement right at the same time as the Motorola Mobility Sale was announced to Lenovo.  Samsung announced, okay, we've made a deal with Google.  We're going to make a purer Google phone.  So I'm watching with interest to see this S5.  Is it a purer Google phone or is Samsung continuing to push away?  I think this Galaxy Gear story might be an indicator that they're going to continue to push away from Android.

Transcript:  Well, they've made it very clear that Tizen is where they see their software future.  They're not necessarily going away from Android, they say.  But they are trying to build up Tizen as a punch-for-punch counterpart, something that you can choose and will offer you the same experience.

Transcript:  Is that intended just for developing nations or do you think that that's...

Start time: 4395.08
End time: 4450.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's intended for everything.  I mean, Tizen's had a lot of setbacks.  We've actually been covering this a lot at the Wall Street Journal.  There are a lot of carriers that have kind of backed out of supporting Tizen phones so far.  Right now they are kind of on...  It's a Samsung product.  It is a fully Samsung product.  And it's interesting because really software has been kind of a weak point for Samsung.  I mean, yeah, there's touchwiz, but a lot of folks aren't using these alternative apps that Samsung's preloading.  They're horrible.  Like you said, this is one of the reasons why you're kind of neglecting those phones for...  I use them on Motorola because it's as close to a pure Google experience you can get.  Exactly. So, I mean, there's really kind of becoming a growing battle between Samsung.  They've leveraged Android to get a foothold in the market.  Now they're going to try and take that next step and say, okay, we're our own thing.  We have our own software.  We're still going to use Android here if people want that, give them the choice.  And that's the thing is Samsung can deliver a new phone, tablet, phablet, smartwatch, anything they want every six months.

Transcript:  But how long have they been saying that a Tizen phone is going to come out?  I mean, they've delayed this project.  I've heard they're having trouble with it.  They're having a ton of trouble with it.  I think one of the...

Start time: 4458.70
End time: 4473.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What kind of trouble?  Well, a lot of different carriers in...  Besides the carriers, is there technical issues with it?  There have been product delays.  There have been technical issues as well.  They've also had a hard time attracting third-party developers.  I think that's the big one.  You don't have an app store.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, that might be...  If Nokia, as the rumors say, if they're building an Android phone, why else would you do that if not because people want Android apps.  They want Android.  I mean, this is why Amazon's using Android on the Kindle.

Start time: 4494.76
End time: 4513.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why can't they make an Android compatible phone?  So in other words, you have the Tizen OS and it's compatible with Android apps and they're both problem solved.  And since it's supposed to be all open source and everything, and I'm sure the developers...  I'm a developer.  I don't care if it goes on the Tizen phone.  Why don't they go in that route?  Maybe...

Transcript:  Well, while Android is open source, there's very specific guidelines that Google sets for operators or for phone makers on how they can design the software.  So you can do whatever you want with Android as Amazon has shown and Xiaomi has shown.  But then you can't put the Google apps on it and you can't put Google's app store where all the apps are.  That's the big one.  According to AppBrain, there are 1,132,053 Android apps right now.

Start time: 4545.97
End time: 4586.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I should also point out that only 22% of them are any good.  I would say less than that.  Actually, they do a graph.  That's only about 22.  They do a graph where all apps, that's the red line, and you see it's jumped significantly in the last couple of months.  Regular apps, that's the blue line, low quality apps.  This is a green line.  I don't know what low quality apps are, but look at the number of new apps added.  Probably like the Flashlight would be calling that.  Stunning number.  The new, of decent quality apps, we're talking over 100,000 added in December in a month.  That's a lot.  If you're somebody looking for a phone, I think that's something you should consider.  It's one of the reasons why this phone is not up.

Transcript:  Well, there's that and there's also the issue of Android runs on so many different things.  There's so many different screen sizes and processors and options as to what the hardware can be.  You can't really have a consistent user experience when you have inconsistent hardware, which I mean, the gear has a two inch screen and one and a half inch screen, something like that.  Angry Birds impossible.  And then you have the note. How big is your note? 3 screen.  It's 5.7 I think.  So, you know, not to mention there's like a 12 inch Galaxy Note Tab Pro, extra 13 something super size. I mean, that's just the reality of the situation.  Bigger is better.

Well, yeah, maybe see pennies that could walk you through it.  Maybe you go to public space you've never been to before, but they already have an indoor map and they've actually been working really hard to get indoor mapping off the ground.  Photosphere is a part of getting the public to. So John was right.  In a way they do want to collect these. They want to map the entire world inside and out.

Start time: 5630.76
End time: 5672.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is.  I don't know if that's because it's part of Darwin, it's part of their open source, or for whatever reason, but they did publish the source code, which means, unfortunately, that somebody could come along like Adam Langley, who works at Google, and say,  you know, this if error statement, it goes, there's two go-to-fail lines in here.  So what happens is this is the kind of thing, if you were in the NSA, is exactly how you would modify this code.  Oh, yeah, it's easy.  So the reason is that it never gets to this third condition because it goes to fail each, you know, immediately.  So it's a typo or it's the kind of thing, if you really wanted to hack the code, you might just add it.

Start time: 5673.10

Transcript:  This is of Jacob Miller, who's a UX designer for Microsoft on a Reddit conversation.  He says Metro was created for casual users first and foremost.  Our hands were bound.  Why?  Well, maybe it's a sex thing.  And our users were in.  He compares Windows 8 to a rented tuxedo coat.  Designed.  OK.  Now bear with me here.  Designed to fit a variety of people, but not tailored to any one specific customer.  Ill fitting is the word.

Transcript:  Features added to Windows had to be simple enough for casual users.  Because that's what they're trying to do is attract casual.  I don't know why.  Why? There's none left.  Right.  But can't turn off power users.  As a result, many features were cut on the first go round.  And that, according to Miller, led to Windows 8 split personality.  Our hands were tied.  Our users were annoyed with their redded jackets.  So what did we do?  We separated the users into two groups.  Casual.  You could wear maybe like a turtleneck.  And power.

Transcript:  So we made two separate playgrounds.  Why did it boot to...

Start time: 5853.70
End time: 5881.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because casual users would have their own new and shiny place to look at pictures of cats.  Metro.  This is him.  The power users would then have free reign of their native domain, the desktop.  Why was Metro the default?  Because casual users are very inquisitive.  So if we didn't make it front and center, they'd never find it.  So we think...  You like classic shell so great, by the way.  By the way, this is why Windows 8 is so bad.  Now that the casual users are aware of their new pasture, says Miller, we could start tailoring.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, just look at the company.  Look at the way it's structured.  The whole One Microsoft movement that was started, well, really put in place by Steve Ballmer.  The whole entire push from Microsoft saying, Windows, one operating system on both your desktop, your laptop, and your mobile devices, your tablets.  I mean, the entire company bought into this.  Anyone who was involved with actually making decisions there, Ballmer all the way down,  these are the guys making that push.  And that's a really different kind of philosophical difference on how to view computing.  I mean, Apple says you have a desktop operating system, then you have a mobile one for your phone or tablet.  Windows is saying you have one operating system for your tablet and your one operating system for your desktop.  A single user experience is what they were working on.

Start time: 5928.86
End time: 5946.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's idiotic.  Do they think people are so stupid that they can't have a phone that acts a little differently than their desktop so everything has to look exactly the same?  Oh, look, my desktop is exactly like my phone.  That's great.  Yeah, but it's kind of confusing because it doesn't run the same software.

Start time: 5946.70

Transcript:  I mean, I don't know.  Anyway, our show today brought to you by Gazelle.  You got old gadgets.  Maybe you've got an old Windows phone you'd like to unload.  Gear 1.  Huh?  Gear 1?  You got a Galaxy Gear 1?  I don't know if they let me look because they should buy the Gear 1s.  That would be great.  I don't think they do.  They pretty much focus on phones, iPods, tablets.  They'll buy anything made by Apple because they've got a great resale value.  Even a Newton?  No, no, no.  No, no, no.  Anything recently.  Oh, OK.  They do buy BlackBerrys, HTCs, LG phones.  You can sell your Motorola, your Nokia.  Yes, you can sell your Samsung phone.  And they pay good money.  They even buy broken iPhones.  What's great about Gazelle is how easy they make it.  When you go to Gazelle, get a quote.  Give them all your stuff.  Find that gadget drawer that's filled with garbage.  Old gadgets you don't use anymore.  Get it all.  The quote's good for 30 days.  So if you, you know, this would be a good time right before Mobile World Congress.  To spend some time gazelling stuff.  Get those quotes.  You're locked in.  If you see something at Mobile World Congress, you know you're going to want to buy.  You could take advantage of it.  If not, no loss.  You didn't have to.  The 5C.  I hear Apple's discontinuing the color 5C.  Maybe I actually have, let's see, is 32, 200.  What?  That's a great deal.  Unlocked 255 bucks.  And they even give you instructions on how to unlock your iPhone 5C.  Now, once you get it all together, you pull the trigger.  If you decide this is it, they will send you a box, prepaid mailer.  So you don't ever pay for the shipping and anything worth anything more than a buck.  And then as soon as the gadget comes to their offices, they check it.  If you leave date on it, they will remove it.  They will upgrade your offer if it's in better condition than you said.  And then they'll send you a check.  Or if you're in a hurry, get a PayPal credit.  Or if you buy a lot of Amazon, my suggestion is get the Amazon gift card.  Because they bump that value up 5%.  So risk-free offer is good for 30 days.  It's trustworthy.  They've paid out now more than $100 million to over 700,000 customers.  And it's easy.  Free shipping, fast processing, great value for your used gadgets.  Gazelle.com.  Take advantage of it right now.  Gazelle.com.  Right before Mobile World Congress.  That's the time to get those quotes.  The new malware is called the moon.  This is a nasty bit of malware.  We talked about it on Security Now this week.  It would allow a hacker to gain control of your computer, your network remotely.  Linksys said all it only affects a few of our routers.  However, it turns out it affects pretty much every Linksys router.  Belkin now owns Linksys.  And they confirm the exploit.  You should turn off remote management access.  That is turned off by default.  You should always turn that off in every router unless you want to manage your router from the office or something.  I can't think of why you'd want that.  But this is a fairly serious defect.  Routers are full of bugs.  And because it's firmware, they're not patched very often.  You know, the untold story that was never really written up by anybody,

Start time: 6163.98
End time: 6192.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  because it happened with me and my sonic.net connection,  is the pace and it turns out that exploit that this French guy wrote about,  about DSL modems being hackable.  They were all hacked, almost all of them in the country.  And many of the DSL connections.  It didn't show up necessarily, so it was obvious.  But when we tried to use it for the podcast, we were just having all kinds of problems with...  Because your router had been hacked.  The routers have all been hacked, yeah, most of them.

Start time: 6192.92
End time: 6195.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And hacked to what end? Did it give them access to your network?

Start time: 6195.76
End time: 6222.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, actually they could access the network and spam without the computer through the router.  They were using the router to forward spam. Holy moly.  And so most of the DSL routers were compromised.  And as far as I could tell, it took them over a week to get the pace modems back online working right.  They gave me a special IP address so I could avoid the whole thing.  But these sorts of things are just going on constantly in these routers.  And I think routers are just carelessly...  They're poorly written.

Start time: 6222.78
End time: 6284.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think so, yeah.  And we've seen a lot of malware of late.  And one of the things that's happening is because Microsoft has done a pretty good job of patching windows,  it's no longer the automatic updates, it's no longer that people have gotten more aware,  no longer the vector it used to be.  So malware authors are looking at other avenues.  They're infecting third-party software like Flash and Java.  And they're looking at things like routers.  And you know, there's no software written.  It's not got some flaws in it, right?  A couple of go-to fails.  And it's just what happens.  If you're using a router, you should certainly update the firmware.  I would say if you're using a router, buy a router that is compatible with DDWRT and install it.  Because it's an open source firmware that has always been much more reliable, much better,  and it's not had the problems that the commercial router firmware has.

And then you have to go back  and find that it's all in your phone.  So they put your phone number in the clear  in the data of the WhatsApp application.
