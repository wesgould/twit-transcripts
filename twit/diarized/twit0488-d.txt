And creates a crazy crazy thing.  I'm going to jump ahead though because if we go all the way into the mountains.  We're going to see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh that's.  Hey I know. Wait a minute. I know that person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's iJustine in the mountains.  Blowing glitter dust.  This is actually an amazing video.  Justine is on the line with us. Justine is there.  Hi how you doing?  Hello how are you?  I just wanted to talk a little bit about this before we got into the news portion of the show.  I was so blown away by this.  Every year they do such a good job.

Start time: 211.60
End time: 220.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this year they actually have like I think 120 over 120 creators in this video.  They went all around the world to get creators.  Not only just from the US but they try to incorporate as many as they could.  And it's awesome.

Start time: 221.50
End time: 232.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And they use the YouTube spaces in New York.  LA London and Tokyo.  Yeah.  So there in fact I think there's eight locations on this five shooting days.  Did they ever tell you how much they spent on this?

Start time: 233.84
End time: 250.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They didn't but knowing how much production costs definitely was a pretty.  This is millions of dollars in this.  Yeah and the crazy thing is all of these YouTube people.  I mean a lot of them are my friends too and I know how busy they are.  So for them to be able to get all of these people in one video is amazing.  It's so impressive.

Start time: 251.10
End time: 264.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now this where you're blowing the dust the fairy dust looks like it's in the mountains.  In the Swiss Alps or something.  But I'm guessing they didn't fly all of you to the Swiss Alps to do this frozen thing.

Start time: 265.37
End time: 274.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nope.  We were in a parking lot downtown Los Angeles.  It was like 100 degrees.  Everybody is sweating.  No.  It was hot.  It was so hot.  Everyone was dying.

Start time: 275.04
End time: 280.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh my goodness.  So they made you wear a knit hat, a sweater, a scarf and it's 100 degrees out.

Start time: 281.62
End time: 295.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah but I mean it ended up turning out really awesome.  It's just crazy because like we spent almost half a day and I know even previously like  the people have spent like days on these and then you have like a two second cameo.  Yeah.  But that's I mean you guys know how production works.  Oh yeah.  It's a whole hurry up.

Start time: 296.00
End time: 302.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And everybody is it Conan O'Brien's in this, John Oliver's in this.  Yeah.  Why does YouTube do these rewinds?

Start time: 303.24
End time: 303.90
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's a good question.

Start time: 304.68
End time: 325.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean I think they really like to kind of show the community in YouTube and this is  such a good way to kind of pull all of the trends together from the past year and it's  just a really fun video.  So I think it really shows that they're willing to invest in creators and they're doing a  much better job of that in the past couple of years.  So it's great.  Although last year was my favorite because it was what does the Fox say.  Right.

Start time: 326.02
End time: 327.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So were you in that one too?  I was.

Start time: 328.06
End time: 334.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I forget what I was doing.  I think I was riding in a car with the guy who does the invisible drive through pranks.

Start time: 335.00
End time: 343.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Forty seven million views in the first week for this year's YouTube rewind.  So it's clearly something that people are interested in.

Start time: 344.08

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that ending part with the hamster was my favorite.

Start time: 347.22
End time: 348.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's eating a little YouTube chiclet.

Start time: 349.65
End time: 356.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So cute.  Have you seen those videos?  It's like this whole series where this hamster eats tiny little miniature food and it is  the cutest thing ever.

Start time: 357.62
End time: 371.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that's also part of the value of this and you see everybody's getting credit here.  Part of the value of this is introducing some of these YouTube stars to a larger audience.  I had to actually sit down with a 12 year old and to find out who all these people are.  And he knew at least half of them.

Start time: 372.92
End time: 388.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I only knew half of them, which is so crazy because this community is so massive  that even a lot of these YouTubers in other countries, I'm like, where did you come from?  You have millions of subscribers and I'm just now finding out about you.  So it is a really cool way to kind of get caught up on all the cool stuff that's happening  on YouTube.

Start time: 389.40
End time: 413.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It also, I think, establishes YouTube is more than just the viral video site or the crotch  shot video site.  These are all creators who are making content on a regular basis.  They have a style, they have a voice, they have a name and they're very successful as a result.  Although the normal person like John C. Dvorak, you'd look at this and you'd go, I don't know who these...  I love this guy.  I know all of them.

Start time: 414.00
End time: 415.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know that guy?  Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 416.22
End time: 417.00
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Really?

Start time: 417.00
End time: 424.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You look at him and you go, I know them.  Yeah, I've seen him before.  All right.  And I think what you're overlooking is these guys are making money.  Are they making money?

Start time: 426.33
End time: 432.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Justine, how lucrative is YouTube?  I mean, almost everybody, like Michelle Phan, has to sell cosmetic kits and stuff.  I mean, she makes her money in other ways.

Start time: 433.50
End time: 462.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it is hard because, I mean, in YouTube, they do have sort of the partner  program and, I mean, you'll get a percentage of your ad revenue, but sometimes ad revenue  isn't always the best.  So a lot of us do sponsored videos, we do other projects.  So it really is trying to find creative ways to have sort of that other revenue stream.  But it is so much fun and I love taking sponsored projects where it allows me to create bigger  and better projects that I normally wouldn't be able to do without the help of sponsors.  And I mean, you guys know this is what we do.  So it's great.

Start time: 462.34
End time: 473.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and I think also if you see YouTube as a launching point and not an end point,  but as part of a larger thing, then it makes more sense than if you're saying I'm trying  to make a living off of what I do on YouTube.

Start time: 474.00
End time: 476.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is, and it takes a lot of time.  I mean, I've been doing this forever.

Start time: 477.04
End time: 479.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  How many videos a day do you make?

Start time: 480.53
End time: 498.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I at least post one piece of content a day.  I used to, I've been posting like daily gaming videos and right now in December they do this  thing called Vlogmas, which you vlog every day until Christmas.  So you put out a video every day until then.  But it takes a lot of time, especially most of the YouTubers.  They still do shoot and edit all of their own stuff.  So it's very time consuming.

Start time: 499.74
End time: 515.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A lot of these are shot at YouTube spaces like the LA space where our former producer  Eileen is one of the producers there.  How important are the?  Yeah, we love Eileen.  How important?  How important Eileen Rivera?  How important are these YouTube spaces to creators?

Start time: 516.48
End time: 547.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's important because it does allow YouTube to be able to have a place where you  can do meetings, you can have events, you can do premieres, and it kind of more or less  validates it in the traditional space because most of the YouTubers, we shoot at home, we  shoot wherever.  So I wish they had this five or six years ago before I invested my entire life into  buying equipment and computers.  But it does definitely validate it where it's these places all around the world that you're  able to go.  So no matter what city I'm in, if there's a YouTube space, you could just come in and  shoot.

Start time: 548.22
End time: 552.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you get a sense of community and being part of a larger community when you go to  those YouTube spaces.  For sure.

Start time: 553.36
End time: 571.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think it's really important in LA too because to be able to rent out those studio  spaces, and they have full production suites and they have all kinds of stuff.  You do have to go through a training program before you're able to actually use it.  So there is that.  But it's just a great place that if YouTube wants to film something, I mean, they have  it all right there at their disposal.

Start time: 572.00
End time: 577.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll tell you, when you look at something like this, you realize what a phenomenon YouTube  has become.  It is.

Start time: 578.84
End time: 591.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the number one most viewed thing is gaming, which they kind of they did screw up because  they didn't put enough actual.  They missed out on Twitch.  Yeah.  But I mean, that's kind of a little competitor.  Now it is.  They could have bought it.

Start time: 592.00
End time: 592.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They could have.

Start time: 593.04
End time: 595.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They definitely could have.  They should have bought it.

Start time: 595.00
End time: 596.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not pointing fingers.

Start time: 596.00
End time: 597.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Justine, I'll let you go.  I thank you so much for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm talking about the YouTube community.  But she was at a WordCamp, a WordPress camp in Pittsburgh, and Alex Lindsay met her and said,  you're going to be a star. We had her on MacBreak all the time.  This is true.  And then she went on to bigger and better things.

Start time: 664.87
End time: 669.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I thought that she predated MacBreak.  You'd think that, wouldn't you?  I'm pretty sure of it.

Start time: 670.00
End time: 677.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I'm sure she was born before that.  That's John C. Dvorak, noagendashow.com, channeldvorak.org.  It's good to have you back. You didn't bring my camera back by any chance.

Start time: 678.62
End time: 685.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, I brought it back last time I was here and then I was going to bring it back and I left it at the house.  Yeah, yeah, I heard it all before. Also, Christina Warren is here.

End time: 707.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am because it's cold and my heat is not really working correctly.  I've got to get the landlord out.  So, yeah, this is one of those things where I'm in a sweater and a hat.  And if I had my what's about me, probably a scarf.  But it's OK.

Start time: 708.20

Transcript:  If you get chilly or your throat starts to get a little scratchy, please go get that scarf and then maybe a hot cup of tea.  I will. I will.  I don't want you to get sick on us.  Dwight Silverman is also here from his offices in Houston where it is a balmy, what, 80 degrees?

Start time: 737.16
End time: 747.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love I love Christina. I'm a big fan of hers.  I was particularly enamored of the piece she did about the Sony Pictures blowing the Steve Jobs film.  And I can't wait to hear her talk about it today.

Start time: 748.36
End time: 779.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let's talk about it right now because it is the story of the century.  Sony Pictures Entertainment hacked, of course.  No one knows who did it.  I, you know, even though apparently there was some Korean in the virus code,  the thought that North Korea did it as revenge for the interview movie seems to me on the face of it.  That's a stretch.  Not very credible, especially since these hashtag GOP people are some kind of independent.  So we'll put it that way on their on their own.

Start time: 780.04
End time: 790.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm wondering. I think it's interesting to try to figure out who did it.  But I know that they're I have a set out a Christmas delay.  They made an announcement saying they're going to have a Christmas gift for everyone.

Start time: 790.24
End time: 816.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, dear. Well, apparently they got into Sony so good that they got everything on every computer,  every server, all the content of the emails, the deals, the contracts, everything.  It's all been revealed, even movies on their server.  And Christine has been one of the people who has been watching this really closely.  In fact, going through some of these materials, looking for stuff.  How much stuff is there, Christina, so far?

Start time: 817.34
End time: 960.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so far, I guess about 250 gigabytes, I would say, has been released so far.  And you think there's more?  Yeah, there's definitely more.  I mean, and they're releasing it pretty indiscriminately.  They released some information today.  They said the Christmas gift for everyone.  I haven't had a chance to download that torrent yet and see what's in it.  But, you know, I mean, basically for the last two weeks, they've been releasing stuff about every day, every other day or so.  And it's been pretty indiscriminate.  You know, it started with some of the leaked films and that got a lot of attention.  Those were basically just screener copies, so they weren't even that great.  But but that got a lot of attention.  And then what we saw with the first dump of documents was, you know, oh, wow, this is actually some really serious internal stuff.  And then they've escalated going from, you know, documents to deals to inboxes.  And then the emails they've released so far have been, you know, the A.  Pascal, the co-chairman of Sony Pictures, as well as someone in one of the heads of legal counsel's inbox and, you know, just hundreds of gigs of documents being literally, you know, thousands upon thousands of documents, you know, mostly Excel files, document files, some PDFs.  And I mean, there's just so much it's hard to really wrap your mind around.  And then, I mean, what's bad is they got in so deeply.  I mean, they literally had lists of every single server, every single workstation, every single, you know, virtual machine, everything on the premises.  All of those devices, including their serial numbers, including their MAC addresses, you know, were all listed.  They had lists of every account that had pseudo access.  You know, I mean, they had password files galore.  I mean, they got they got in hard and, you know, try to sort through the material and figure out what's there has been a real challenge.  And so a lot of us in the in the media are kind of going through it.  And the emails have certainly had some of the most enlightening stuff, at least, you know, for the public there.  But there's all kinds of other stuff, too.  I mean, I've I've been talking to some former and current Sony employees.  There's a secret Facebook group of about thirty five hundred people right now who are all freaked out because their social security numbers have been part of this.  And you know, people are worried about having their identity stolen and and what recourse are they going to have in that end?  So, I mean, there's there's so much that it's it's kind of difficult to put into context because this is I mean, this is the worst corporate hack ever.  And I mean, it kind of it was kind of like, you know, the WikiLeaks kind of like the cable gate sort of thing.

Start time: 961.40
End time: 990.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But for a corporation, you know, I take a look at to see maybe the bad actor.  Look for all the companies that made proposals to Sony about improving their security.  That seems like the first and was ignored.  Yeah, it was ignored. And by the way, you know, David Boyce is out there.  You know, that famous guy was the attorney against Microsoft and all these other things.  He's the sony. He's took it, taken over the Sony Council.  Yeah. And he's threatening everybody saying this is stolen material.

Start time: 992.56
End time: 1018.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Didn't the FBI arrest one person for downloading some of this material?  Am I wrong? Yeah, no, I saw that.  I saw something with that. I mean, and Sony's been D Dossing the sites that host this material.  Let me explain how illegal. Yeah.  Well, but they're doing it out of a cert is in Asia. So it's OK. Yeah, sure.  How how are they distributing this data?  Is it a torrent link that they post to paste bin? Is that what they're doing?

Start time: 1019.46
End time: 1030.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, basically. And they're also, you know, they're using various file hosts and they're getting down.  They're getting taken down really quickly. You know, the paste bins are going down, you know, within, you know, hours, sometimes less than that.

Start time: 1031.10
End time: 1035.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So the press is jumping on these links the minute they're published, publicized and downloading as fast as they can.

Start time: 1036.10
End time: 1043.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, right. And then they're also emailing us. So the hackers are emailing you directly. Yes.

Start time: 1044.73
End time: 1045.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do they say in those emails?

Start time: 1046.38
End time: 1051.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It just has a link to the paste bin and some of their, you know, half English sort of stuff that.

Start time: 1051.00
End time: 1053.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So before they make it public, they send it to you so that you can get it.

Start time: 1054.12
End time: 1074.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no. They're actually they've been a little bit late, actually.  It's funny because I think I was one of the first people to get the emails and that was purely happenstance.  I happened it was on Monday. I just happened to go to paste bin and search and I found the emails.  They've been up for about 11 minutes and we didn't get any sort of link from them for another three or four hours.

Start time: 1074.68
End time: 1087.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What do you say to people who say it is as bad to look at this material as it is to look at the naked pictures of Jennifer Lawrence?  It's as unethical to do that. You're really by looking at this material.

Start time: 1088.82
End time: 1112.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, I mean, I mean, it's not even remotely the same thing.  I mean, I understand why people have that.  I understand why people can draw that conclusion. But first of all, I think it's a false equivalency to to equate public or not public,  but corporate documents for public companies from private communications that are that are taking place on stolen material.  Of course it is. But so are the Pentagon Papers. So is the NSA leaks.

Start time: 1112.32
End time: 1117.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So are most. Wait a minute. You can't say that what this has anywhere near the end of the Pentagon.

Start time: 1118.08
End time: 1128.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not. I'm not. I'm not. No, I'm not in any way at all.  I'm in no way trying to equate the two. Let me be very clear. There's no equation whatsoever.  What is the public need to know this stuff from Sony?

Start time: 1128.48
End time: 1133.68

Transcript:  That's gossip. Well, I mean, I mean, it is gossip, but it's also I mean, but it's the sort of information that if we were being completely honest,  if someone were to email us the budget from that film and it were to come into my inbox and it weren't to be part of this thing,  it would be stolen and it would still be news. No, it's still be something that the trade publications would publish.  And most of the time, I mean, this is kind of the uncomfortable part about journalism.  Andrew Wallenstein at Variety wrote a really good op-ed that I largely agree with that kind of says, you know, we get stolen material all the time.  That's kind of part of our job. People leak things to us usually for their purposes, usually with their own agendas.  And we have to go through and decide what's worthy and what's not.  And in a case like this, you know, there are FOIA requests.  And obviously this is stolen. But a lot of times there are FOIA requests for information that was obtained illegally that people go through  and search for the most salacious or the most interesting tidbits.  Now, you know, you can make the argument that something like, you know, the inside story of the Steve Jobs movie is it might not be news.  I would disagree. I think that it is news. I think it's interesting.  I think that seeing the inner workings of how a major studio bungles, a high profile project is news, whether it's the most newsworthy thing out there.  Of course not. But it is news. I also think that things such as salaries, things such as, you know, internal memos and finding out, you know,  information about things that might be going against what's being said publicly are interesting.  And then, you know, you also have to kind of look through and figure out are there things that are happening that might be bad.  You know, some people have been looking into the potential pay gap within Sony for, you know, across gender lines.  I haven't actually seen any proof that that exists in a conventional sense.  But I mean, you know, these are the things that are worth kind of looking into to find out.  I mean, I've been getting from some sources that there was a little of the layoffs that Sony made might have actually been tied to what employees were costing them the most in terms of their health insurance and in their health insurance program.  That's something that we're looking into and trying to verify.  These are real stories. And when you get this data, you know, you go through it.  Our job as journalists is to be responsible to the truth first and foremost, not the individuals at Sony.  And then the second responsibility, I mean, you know, and I put, you know, when I wrote my story, you know, it's six thousand words.  I reached out to every person that was in it in advance. It's not as if they didn't get a heads up and they didn't know that it was coming.  Second of all, you know, there are things that you omit because when you're going through this stuff, I had certain lines where I said, you know, if this is going to be communications between someone and their husband or wife and it's going to be clearly personal in nature, it's not necessary to be part of this narrative.  It's not necessary to be part of this story. So I understand the criticism.  Even Andrew Wallenstein, I'm not saying that it doesn't feel gross.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, even Andrew Wallenstein, who is the co-editor and chief of Variety, says at the end of his op-ed piece,  Every reporter is fantasized about stumbling upon a treasure trove of secret documents when a story such as Sony is spread in front of us all in its unprecedented scope.  It's instinctive for us to pounce. But this time around, acting on that reflex just doesn't feel right, even though it isn't wrong.  He's conflicted.

End time: 1346.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Exactly. Well, no, and I am too. It's not an easy thing to do.  You know what I found interesting about your article?  And there are things that you feel uncomfortable about, but that's kind of one of the depths of journalism.

Start time: 1347.34
End time: 1360.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One of the things I found interesting about your article is how much of what you report from the inside sources was already leaked by sites like Deadline.  Exactly.  It seems like Hollywood is a pretty leaky civ anyway.

Start time: 1361.79
End time: 1461.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they nailed it, by the way. In every case, Deadline and these other gossip columns got it exactly right.  Well, and it was funny. My story was so long as it was, I wasn't able to make it into its own kind of narrative.  But one of the things that I wanted to kind of even say was that it was funny. You could look at the date that emails were happening.  You could look at the timestamp. And literally within hours, the story, sometimes within 45 minutes, there would be a story on Deadline or The Hollywood Reporter.  There was clearly leaks happening from within the inside. And this happens all the time.  So this is another reason why I'm saying in this case, I would never equate it to looking at nude photos of celebrities,  because a lot of this information is being leaked willingly by the party anyway for their own benefit, for trying to influence things one way or another.  I'm not saying that it can't be painful and that it can't be embarrassing and that this isn't devastating for the people who are involved.  But this is also kind of part of the game with Hollywood where things are leaked.  And that's kind of the case with business journalism, too, where we leak things. That's kind of what we do.  That's kind of part of our role in the press is we get information, we vet it, and we publish it.  And the fact that this information was obtained illegally, while awful that this illegal act happened,  does not mean that it's unethical according to any journalistic guidelines or anything else for us to go through them.  In fact, on the contrary, the amount of legal precedent involved in saying that publishing stuff from stolen documents is absolutely legal and absolutely ethical  according to almost every single journalistic guideline out there.  Really?  That doesn't mean people can't be grossed out about it. That doesn't mean that reporters can't feel conflicted.

Transcript:  Well, any gossip stuff will be that way, but still it's banal.  I mean, it's like a traffic wreck. Let's stop and check it out.  I don't know. This whole thing seems to be...  What I think people should be more focused on is the outrageous amount of stuff that is on their servers that shouldn't be on their servers.  Unprotected.  It's ridiculous how cavalier these guys were. That, to me, is the issue.  Not that somebody's gotten... was a sexual harasser at some place in Hollywood. That never happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We talked a little bit on security now about this.  And one thing, I think even Steve Gibson, who is a security guru and kind of lives by the notion that it's possible to secure stuff, otherwise why be a security expert?  Even he said there's very few companies that wouldn't be vulnerable to this kind of attack, that wouldn't have this kind of stuff unencrypted on their servers.  This is probably... and certainly no motion picture company.  The problem is that in order to get business done, you have to kind of... to be fully secure, you need to silo stuff and encrypt stuff and limit access to stuff.  But to get business done, you need to kind of almost do the opposite. People need to be able to freely speak in emails.  They need to be able to see stuff. Spreadsheets need to be shared.  And so there is this kind of mismatch between the needs of high-end security.

Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because apparently one of the responses to this is no more emails, nothing in writing.  They're doing everything by phone calls going forward.  The olden days.  And imagine if you were a producer, a director, an actor who was considering a contract with Sony. Wouldn't you think twice now about that?  It depends on how much money was involved.  I might not want to trust that with my information, Dwight.

Transcript:  Mashable has just published, nine minutes ago, a piece in which Sony Pictures has sent a letter to several media outlets demanding that they delete troves of emails delivered by hackers.  I presume Christina has gotten some of those.  And that they are essentially sounds like they're threatening you.  I'm curious, Christina, have you mentioned that you're getting emails from the hackers?  Have you by any chance heard from law enforcement about we'd like to talk to you, young lady?

Start time: 1658.68
End time: 1774.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, we lost Christina at a very pivotal moment right there.  We're going to get her back.  There's a whole lot to this story that I think is of newsworthiness.  For instance, Sony and the Motion Picture Association of America created something, and we learned this from these documents, called Project Goliath in which they were going after, Goliath is Google in this case, the code name for Google.  They talk about the problems created by Goliath and worry, what would Goliath do if we went on attack?  One of the things the Motion Picture Association of America and the studios continually believe is that Google's search enables piracy.  They would love to get Google to stop linking to BitTorrent sites and things like that.  This is search is search.  And they even talked about, well, I agree with you, they even talked about ways to actually block sites from reaching ISPs to in effect DDoS or block these sites.  This is just censorship.  Different guides.  So I think I think there is there is some of that is more than just gossip in here.  But I think I don't we don't want to repeat the gossip.  We're not going to repeat the gossip here.  I think that's the story for us anyway.  Yeah, I think the story for us is, first of all, that Sony kind of ignored security entirely.  Apparently, according to Elizabeth Barber writing in Time magazine, they had been hacked in February of this year.  They knew its servers were vulnerable, according to Gawker, for at least a year before the hacking incident.  In fact, Gawker quotes an email in February 12th of this year from Sony's vice president of legal compliance, Courtney Sheberg, telling her colleagues a Sony server may have been hacked, but she would quote recommend against providing any notification to individuals that they in fact wanted to bury these hacks.  And that's pretty you know.

End time: 1803.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, so yeah, my question was before the FBI cut you off, Christina, was have you heard from law enforcement about this where they want to talk to you?  I mean, if you're getting emails from the hackers, and obviously they're going to they're going to cover their tracks.  If you're getting emails from the hackers, are you have you been contacted by law enforcement?

Start time: 1804.31
End time: 1896.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have not.  I have not. And if I was, I'd be happy to turn over any of the emails from the hackers, which are coming from hushmail addresses and other things that they wanted to have those that would be more than happy to turn that over.  When it comes to David Boyes and has he said anything to my knowledge, he hasn't said anything to Mashable yet.  I haven't received any communications.  I'm not sure if he's sent out a press thing or not.  You know, that would be our legal counsel would have to take that over.  That's not my pay grade.  That's someone above me.  But as far as you know, we know, I mean, we're we're standing by our reporting and we're far from the only organization that's that's done this.  I think that, you know, trying to intimidate people to not publish stuff, especially when there is proof, as you were just mentioning, you know, Gawker fighting out that there's, you know, that there was potentially they were aware of someone being in the systems and they're not wanting to let people know that sort of negligence, especially in when it comes to the inevitable class action lawsuits.  The individual rank and file employees are going to be.  I mean, I think that that's that becomes really valid and really interesting.  And I think the fact that they've had such despicable internal information security at Sony is something that I mean, most my early reporting was not before the emails.  They had didn't have anything to do with with any of the salacious stuff.  It was all about the fact that this is, you know, how terrible the how terrible this was and how Sony's own internal policies made this so much worse.  And I think that's worth harping on and worth investigating, especially as we try to figure out, you know, who's behind us and what's what their motive is, which, you know, it seems to be financial.  But I don't think so.

Start time: 1897.02
End time: 1924.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a theory.  And I understand the financial because they said they're blackmailing Sony, except there was that was not right.  There has to be some that wasn't what was going on.  Well, they they claim if you don't give us some money, but I don't think that there was really a strong attempt to get money out of Sony.  I think this goes back to 2005 when Sony, Sony Music, you may remember this distributed music CDs with root kits on them.

Start time: 1925.65
End time: 1926.52

Remember that this was incredibly infuriating to people, particularly, I think, a certain class of people who then have continually taken it out on Sony ever since.  I think the Sony PlayStation Network hack was as a result of the bad publicity Sony got for this rootkit and then other bad things that they did.  They didn't do it.  It wasn't a malicious rootkit.

Start time: 1963.42
End time: 1970.00

End time: 1991.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think that but I don't think it's a stretch at all.  I think Sony got on somebody's bad side and they've been on their bad side ever since that the same people or at least descendants of the same people.  The descendants of the same people who perpetrated the Sony PlayStation Network hack are people who are involved in this.  This is a revenge.  This is somebody who's out to get Sony has been out to get Sony for a long time.  That's what I think.

Transcript:  Maybe that's the guy.  I was going to say that you're operating at a severe disadvantage.  Sony 77 million PlayStation Network customers and 25 million Sony Online Entertainment customers were hacked.  In effect, their information was revealed in this PlayStation hack.  You may remember that the PlayStation Network was shut down for several weeks because of this.  According to Reuters, this goes back to 2011, Sony's higher detectives from Guidance Software, Protivity and Data Forte to find these hackers.  They think it came from a Malaysia-based server.  By the way, this is as credible as the fact that this came from North Korea.  It's almost impossible if the hackers are doing their job right to track these people and know where they came from.  Probably the Ukraine, if any place.  It's clear that Sony doesn't care so much about security, even though they have every reason to care.  They continually get hacked.  I think we don't know how continually.  I think there's been an ongoing campaign against Sony since 2005.

A lot of these things where you talk about the state doing it is oftentimes I'm not necessarily sure  like there's a general somewhere saying, you know, go hack.  I think what's happening is you have people who are aware of this, who are sympathetic,  who have the skills to do it, and they just do it, and they may be located in Iran,  but they may not necessarily be, you know, necessarily employees of the government.

Transcript:  Yeah, the first thing you'd attack would be the power plants, right?  Right.  We in Israel hacked the Iranian centrifuges with Stuxnet to slow down their nuclear enrichment program.  So, yeah, I guess they don't know exactly who hacked the Sands.  The investigators who have been investigating this, working for the Sands, this attack, by the way, occurred in February.  We're just now learning about it.  It was likely the work of hacktivists based in Iran, but they couldn't determine if the Iranian government played a role.  But, says Dell SecureWorks, it's unlikely that any hackers inside the country could pull off an attack of that scope without government knowledge,  given the close scrutiny of Internet use within its borders.  James Lewis, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington, D.C., said,  This isn't the kind of business you can get into in Iran without the government knowing.  I think that's fairly safe to say.  So, cost Shelley 40 mil. Shelley can afford it.  We know Shelley because Danadans Adelson started Comdex.  Yes.

Transcript:  The Sands in the days after the attack in February told the press only that its websites had been vandalized  and some office productivity systems, including email, weren't working.  So, the hackers got mad and they posted a video, an 11-minute video on YouTube set to Carl Orff, oh, Fortuna.  You know, that's the one they use in all the horror movies.  Damien.  Yeah.  Yes.  It began by scrolling through a news article that highlighted Adelson's comments about nuking Iran,  then showed a computer screen packed with thousands of files and photos with names like IT passwords and casino credit,  which had been stolen from the Sands.  In the video, an unseen hacker, by the way, it's gone, the law enforcement took it down.  An unseen hacker clicks into a disk drive titled, damn A, and enters a folder containing a terabyte of data.  The text box appears, do you really think only your email server has been taken down?  Like hell it has.  I think this sounds a lot like the GOP hack.

Transcript:  Well, what was actually interesting about a lot of the emails is that there were certain conversations that they very clearly knew not to have over email.  And they said, OK, I'll call you. I can't talk about this over email.  And there were certain exchanges that got between Amy Pascal and Scott Rudin that got forwarded to Michael Linton, the CEO.  And he actually said, I can't believe the two of you would say this over email.  So it's one of those funny things.  Or even what we were able to get is obviously only parts of the story.  They were aware that there are certain things and certain conversations they shouldn't have over email just for standard practices and the fact that people can forward things and stuff can leak.  So, yeah, I mean, I think that it probably isn't a bad idea for if there's something truly sensitive or truly important that you don't want a paper trail for, then don't leave a paper trail.

I want to see if there's any nude pictures on there.  The search must be limited to the suspected crime.  This is the most important.  Police have to keep detailed records of the search.  While initially it looks as if Canada is going the wrong direction on this.  In fact, this is an improvement over the preliminary.  The previous law of officers in Canada had unfettered virtually unfettered right to search a cell phone during an arrest.

They said, well, we're going to charge Google for putting snippets from the stories.  They said, that's our content.  You can't do that.  You have to pay us.  So Google just turned it off and they lost so much traffic.  They said, never mind.  Please publish snippets.  So in Spain, a really extremely aggressive law that would have compelled Google to pay licensing revenues to Spanish publishers if even a headline appeared in Google.  Yeah.

Less than one.  Whoa.  300 out of 54,000.  That's a scam.  One of the things they found,  maybe in fact I even saw this,  I think it was Best Buy was offering a,  was it a Samsung UHD Ultra HD TV?  Let me see if I can find the story here.  Yeah.  55 inch ultra high definition Samsung TV, 899 on Black Friday.  Discounted $500.  Best Buy in fact has raised the price back up to 1299,  but the Wirecutter looked at the model.  They found it had one of the worst cases  of motion blur they've ever seen in an LCD.  The 4K resolution only holds true  if there is no motion on the screen at all.  If it's a static picture.  Oh my God.  They said on a moving image,  you'd be lucky to get 1K.  What brand is this?

He said, otherwise you'll get lost in a sea  of apparent discounts that are most likely  not good things and not good prices.  They're not good things and they're not good prices.

And was it, it might have been Owen.  I can't remember who it was, but somebody said,  look, you're not poor.  You don't understand that if you don't have a lot of money  and you need to get gifts,  you're gonna get in line on these door busters  because you're gonna be able to get more for your money.  And I think a lot of people do believe  they're getting a better deal.  It is not a good deal.  And you are not often saving money.  For instance, this smart toaster,  Macy's was offering for a limited time sale price.  You just saw that the highest price on Amazon was 250.  Macy's was offering for $280.  Oh no.  Which Macy's says is a discount  off the item's regular price of $417  except according to camel, camel, camel,  no one's ever charged that.  So Farhad asked a spokeswoman for Macy's,  where did that $417 price come from?  Macy's says those quote, regular prices  are based on many different factors,  including the cost.  Oh, I love it, I love it.  Including the cost of the item, overhead,  benefits we offer, as well as our ability to offer the item  at a lower price during sales events.  Gambling?

Transcript:  When, and I mean, granted, this was more than a decade ago,  but when I worked at Best Buy  when I was in high school and college for Black Friday.  Were you on the Geek Squad?  I quit when it became Geek Squad  because they wanted me to wear polyester pants  and shirt combo that was attached together  with a clip-on tie.  And at that point I was like, no, I'm done.  I'm not doing this.  I like the clip-on tie.  I'm not gonna wear a clip-on tie and polyester pants.  Christina Warren, I like your high standards.

Transcript:  That basically was it.  But what was funny was that for Black Friday  and for other things, we would actually get,  remember e-machines?  Remember those? Yeah.  Of the really terrible computers?  Well, we would get special e-machines  and that we would only sell on Black Friday.  We would get these packages that were similarly specced,  but not quite as good as the regular,  kind of low cost machines.  We would get, and we would get things from HP as well.  We'd get computers.  We would only sell at Black Friday  that we would have for these really low prices.  They would have these kind of cut down configurations  and they would look really similar in model number  to the existing stuff we sold,  but they weren't exactly the same.  And they were, it'd be $100 less or whatever.  We'd sell out of all of those  and then we'd have to try to upsell people to the real ones  that were sort of similar to what was in the ad.  But the fact of the matter is,  that just proves that this thing was,  that this report is totally right,  is that a lot of these things are not deals  and the good stuff doesn't go on sale.  And in fact, they get models of products  in just to sell cheaper.

Because he felt like, you know,  when you see these reviews,  what you really want to know is,  in this category, what's the one product?  What's the best product?  So Wirecutter was just like, don't worry about it.  This is the best one.  This is the best toaster oven.  This is the best electric room.  This is the best computer.  That's the one.  And I almost always agreed with their conclusions.  And obviously, it was a great idea  because they're clearly growing  and good on him.  I think that's great.

So I'm watching with great interest,  a couple of Supreme Court cases.  One that I'm really interested in is about free speech.  Let me see if I can find this story,  because I don't think it's in our rundown.  The First Amendment.  And the question is, believe it or not,  if the First Amendment protects hate speech online.  Let me see if I can find this story.  It comes from a guy who was harassing  his ex-wife on Facebook.  And I mean-  Oh, this is a crazy guy.  Right.  He's in jail right now.

Start time: 4841.76

Start time: 4847.51
End time: 4890.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  So they actually heard arguments December 1st.  A Pennsylvania resident, Anthony Alanis,  was sentenced to four years in prison  for posting explicit rap lyrics  in which he threatened to murder his estranged wife,  shoot up elementary schools,  and cut the throat of an FBI agent  investigating the case.  He went to jail for that,  because it's a federal offense to transmit threats  over the internet,  interstate threats to injure the person of another.  One of the things he wrote,  "'I'm not gonna rest until your body is a mess,  soaked in blood and dying from all the little cuts.  Hurry up and die.'"

Start time: 4891.74
End time: 4894.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Seems like that's not protected by free speech, right?

Start time: 4895.99
End time: 4935.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And?  In the past, it's always been held that if-  This is really not hate speech, though.  If you're, well, but free speech is not protected  if it's a threat against somebody, right?  There's a threat speech.  The ACLU is defending this guy.  Bless their hearts.  Saying,  "'A statute that proscribes speech  with that regard to the speaker's intended meaning  runs the risk of punishing  protected First Amendment expression  simply because it is crudely or zealously expressed.'"  Supreme Court has all along said that  if it's a true threat,  it's not protected under the First Amendment.

Start time: 4936.68
End time: 4936.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.

Start time: 4938.06
End time: 4941.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But they are agreeing to hear this case.  This was a true threat.

Start time: 4942.02
End time: 4945.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Sounds like a threat.  Sounds like a threat.  It's a threat.

Start time: 4945.70
End time: 4985.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She, his ex, filed a restraining order.  She feared for her life.  The appeals court said,  "'No, no, you're right.'  They sent him to jail saying,  "'A federal statute only requires a reasonable person  would feel legitimately threatened.'"  But now the Supreme Court is going to address this  and answer the question whether her perception  that her husband intended harm is enough to warrant a crime  or do you need to, in prosecution,  demonstrate that the husband himself  was in a threatening state of mind.  This is stuff that's hard to prove.  Intent is very hard to prove.  And because-

Start time: 4985.38
End time: 4989.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But she had a restraining order.  Yes.  I think that's a good sign right there.  That proves something was up.

Start time: 4989.78
End time: 5003.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was going to say,  I mean, the fact that she had the restraining order  means that already,  I mean, I would think, I'm not a lawyer, obviously,  but I would think that that means that the judge,  someone has shown that there's clearly a cause for concern  and that's why he has the restraining order  issued against him.

Start time: 5003.76
End time: 5060.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But here's the thing, it's on Facebook.  And here's a legal scholar,  Garrett Epps, writing at the Atlantic, said,  if Alanis had sent the threats by mail,  there would be little doubt of his intent.  If he had written them in a diary  that was discovered by accident, they'd be protected.  Okay.  Where do Facebook postings fall?  I think that's public.  Wait, why is the diary-  They're totally public.  Apparently they're- Why is the diary-  Because the threats were not communicated  and so they are not actually threats.  So the real, and this is why I bring this up,  otherwise this would be just a free speech issue.  But somehow, because of the context, this threatening,  if it's on Facebook, is it really a threat?  And what worries me is if the Supreme Court decides,  oh no, that's protected speech,  that is First Amendment-  They're not gonna do that.  Then hateful stuff on Facebook and Twitter  is gonna have a free rein.  It's not gonna happen.

Start time: 5061.46
End time: 5068.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, that wouldn't prevent Facebook and Twitter  from still banning that sort of-  No.  No, in fact, we should be very clear about this.

Start time: 5068.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 5090.76
End time: 5126.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, I guess what would that mean then  to say that they were to rule in favor of this guy  and say that it was protected?  What would that mean then for people  who admit to crimes on Facebook?  Because law enforcement uses a lot of Facebook postings now  for those sorts of purposes.  So if they're to say that this has been private  communications because it's on Facebook,  then wouldn't someone's whereabouts,  any information that they're delving for that  be the same as getting in a diary?  And if they didn't have a warrant or other things,  or if they admitted to a crime,  would the argument be, well, that was just,  you know, my musings, that wasn't actually anything else?

Start time: 5126.20
End time: 5146.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing that's interesting about that,  he didn't post this on her wall.  He posted it on his wall.  That's why it's more, they consider this.  I don't think so, but they consider this  maybe more like a diary.  But of course, because it's on his wall,  it will show up on her wall,  or other people who are following her,  maybe depending on how he said this, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they accepted the case,  and that's the question is, why did they accept the case?  They must've thought there was something worth talking about.  What's the other one?  Internet shopping.  So Colorado decided that they could collect taxes,  sales taxes on out-of-state purchases.

Start time: 5182.96
End time: 5183.78
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  This is what they said.

Start time: 5184.91
End time: 5217.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Colorado in 2010 enacted a law  that required out-of-state merchants  to report transactions to their customers  and to state tax authorities.  So right now, the way it works,  if a company doesn't do business in that state,  they don't have some physical presence,  then they don't have to collect taxes.  You still owe taxes.  In fact, here in the state of California,  they ask you on your state form.  I pay them.  Yeah.  They say, did you buy anything online  and not pay sales taxes, if so?  When I'm on Amazon buying stuff,  it usually shows up right there as I pay sales taxes.  Well, Amazon does collect it now.

Start time: 5217.00
End time: 5220.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Remember what happened was Amazon said,  we're not gonna collect.

Start time: 5220.64
End time: 5274.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then the state turned around and said,  well, you do business in California  because you have associates, Amazon associates.  So Amazon cut off the associates,  putting a lot of, taking the money out of their pockets,  and then they're like, well,  putting a lot of, taking the money out  of a lot of people's pockets.  That put pressure on the state to back down.  They went back and forth,  and finally there was a negotiated agreement  which Amazon said, all right,  we'll start collecting sales taxes.  I think it's next year.  So I'm wondering.  By the way, that's good for Amazon  because now they're building  a fulfillment center in California.  I'll tell you what's gonna be in Nevada.  They have one in Nevada right now,  and that's why they had it in Nevada,  to service California,  but now they can put service centers all over California  because they are finally collecting sales tax.  Colorado didn't say we're gonna collect the tax,  but we are gonna require  that these out of state merchants report to us  so that we can go back.  Apparently it's the only state that does that.

Start time: 5274.96
End time: 5297.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I'm doing business in Washington state.  I'm paying my taxes.  I'm doing all these things.  And Colorado is going to tax me,  even though I get no services from Colorado whatsoever,  but they're gonna tax me.  This is taxation without representation.  It's a founding problem with the entire system.  We do not, I've got no representation in Colorado,  yet I'm being taxed by these guys.

Start time: 5298.70
End time: 5310.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think it's the other way around.  I think it's if you live in Colorado  and you buy something online  from a merchant that doesn't do business in Colorado,  the merchant will be required to tell Colorado  so that they can send you a bill.

Start time: 5311.80
End time: 5313.64

Start time: 5333.64

Well I don't want to, but I'm just saying-  But I don't have a presence,  and I have no presence.  I'm not getting any of the benefits of the tax.  Taxes are to benefit from tax.  I run a company in Petaluma,  and I have to tax everybody,  because Petaluma's got goods and services,  and sewers, and it gives me all these benefits  of paying the taxes.

You have a lot of,  because right now it's set up so,  income tax takes people from,  it makes them so they can't accumulate wealth.  So you tax them for income.  Most of the people at the high end,  they're always complaining about this.  So raise capital gains in property taxes?  No, create a wealth tax mechanism like in Switzerland,  an extremely wealthy country where everybody benefits  and just charge people a certain percentage of their wealth.  It's a small number.  So the more time you spend in second life.  And by the way, guys like Buffett and Gates,  oh, I wanna be taxed more.  This would tax them more.  This is perfect.  All right.

I'm gonna use an online broker  and I'm gonna do my own investment.  But then you forget, you don't rebalance,  you don't pay attention to it.

Start time: 5899.60
End time: 5902.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is a story you had in Houston.

Start time: 5903.22
End time: 5928.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, initially it was from a site called Courthouse News  and I think that's out of San Francisco.  And, you know, a while back Comcast turned on  public Wi-Fi hotspots in its customers' routers  and the routers that they rent to them.  Oh yeah, this story.  And it creates an Xfinity Wi-Fi hotspot  that any other Comcast customer can connect to  or you can buy a day pass.

Start time: 5928.42
End time: 5936.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In fact, as I wander around, I'm an Xfinity,  I have a Comcast at home, as I wander around,  I can see open Wi-Fi access spots all everywhere.

Start time: 5936.88
End time: 5975.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right, and they're from residential routers.  Comcast says that it's a separate network.  It may come through your router,  but it has its own channels, bonded channels,  and a different Wi-Fi signal.  And so it's, in theory, it is secure.  But this lawsuit basically said  because Comcast didn't get permission to do this first,  you have to, it's opt out.  I mean, it's opt, yeah, it's opt out.  You're automatically opted in  that it's essentially a violation of the contract  between Comcast and its customers.  And so they have filed this lawsuit against them.  How does it work?

Start time: 5975.30
End time: 6026.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, when you get, it only works  if you're using a Comcast Wi-Fi router.  Right, right. Okay.  And when you install,  if you use your own Wi-Fi router, nothing.  But if you install the Comcast Wi-Fi router,  and most people do because it comes with a service.  Yeah, but you have to pay a monthly fee to have that.  It's dumb. Paying a monthly fee for it.  But it comes, the modem and the router  are built into one device.  I don't use it, I use an airport router.  I don't have this problem.  But if you do, by default,  unless you go to the Comcast site and turn it off,  it opens up two networks, yours and a public network.  And anybody who is a Comcast customer,  there's actually an app you can put on your phone  that'll say, oh, there's one nearby.  Once you log into one, by the way,  they're all available to you.  They're all open to you and you can use them.  And it really kind of makes this great mesh of Wi-Fi.  If you go to San Francisco,  where the plaintiffs are in this case,  you can pretty much go anywhere in the city and be online.

Start time: 6027.66
End time: 6084.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The idea behind this was for they ultimately,  Comcast wants to build a telephone network,  Wi-Fi telephony network that where you could essentially  roam and be able to connect and this way,  they could compete with somebody like AT&T.  And that's also another issue in the lawsuit saying  that essentially they're profiting off of the ability  of the customers to have these in their homes.  What's interesting is that in Houston,  when they turned this on,  it was about 150,000 customers had it here.  They said that there would be that many hotspots.  I mean, it has continued to be of high interest here  and nationally, the blog posts that I wrote on it,  including one that tells you how to turn it off  and how to set up your own router,  are the easily on any given day,  the most viewed thing on my blog.  They get about 2000 page views every day each.  And it's been a while since they were up.  So there's still a lot of interest in this.  A lot of people are still pretty upset about it.

Transcript:  The plaintiffs in this case say that it's a power wasting.  That's a good point.  We have to pay for the power.  I mean, it's probably a few cents,  but we're paying for that.  Oh my God.  Internet clogging and Comcast disputes that saying,  well, it's not using your bandwidth.  It's privacy threatening.  That's an interesting point.  Network of public Wi-Fi hotspots.  The plaintiffs say Comcast is exploiting them for profit.  And I have to agree with that.  Have you looked at their bills?  I know I'm paying them and then they're using me.  Well, no, I'm talking about the regular bills.

These guys are so horrible.  You know, I pay-  AT&T is worse.  I pay for Showtime and HBO.  I wanna watch it on demand.  I can do that on my TiVo with my cable card.  But the fancy Dan X1 Comcast box says,  you're not subscribing to HBO or Showtime,  so you can't watch this.  So I called them up and said this,  and here's the error code.  The error code, by the way, clearly,  it's a 901F error code.  If you look on Comcast site, they said,  oh yes, that's a billing error.  Nevertheless, the rep insisted  it was because my connection was weak.  She had me running all over the house,  turning on all the TVs.

Which means, of course,  subscribe you to 14 other Comcast services you don't want.  But first, let's help you with this.  An hour and a half later.  Nothing.  She says, well, I think a technician  has to come out to your house now.  They don't do anything.  And I told her, no, it's 901F, it's a billing error.  Would you please look at the billing?

But then, when I got the billing department,  they fixed it.  Reset the modem.  Oh, I reset the modem.  Reset the modem.  Well, you have to go through this notebook  that this nitwit has,  but I thought maybe at the end,  if I sit here for an hour and a half  and go through all of this,  laughs on you.  She'll finally check the billing code  and fix it, and no, she won't.  We have to send a technician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In 1971, he was working for a company called  Sanders Associates in Nashville, New Hampshire,  filed the first video game patent.  He actually was an engineer who figured out  how to put little dots on a standard  analog television screen.  He got the patent in April 1973,  licensed it to Magnavox, which began selling it  as the Odyssey.  The Odyssey, I don't know if you remember the Odyssey.  That was the one that had colored overlays.  It was a game that you could actually put on the screen  to give the game color.  Yeah.  Because it couldn't support color.  You'd also get a deck of playing cards,  poker chips, and a pair of dice.  So it was a good deal.  40 transistors, 40 diodes.  Now, I have to say, and I don't know Ralph,  and I didn't really, there it is,  I didn't know the history of this,  but I do know that he spent a lot of his later years  suing the hell out of people.  Atari came out with Pong shortly after Odyssey sued.  Atari settled for $700,000, becoming their second licensee.  Over the next 20 years, Magnavox sued dozens more companies,  winning more than $100 million,  and of course, Behr often testified.  But there you go, wow.  92 years old.

Transcript:  And HBO is gonna go ahead, we've heard rumors,  but they're gonna go ahead with streaming content  on the internet.  However, a little bit of a slap in the face  for their former CTO, who had created  a streaming video office in Seattle.  They hired 55 people, many of them his ex-colleagues  from Microsoft.  HBO was rumored to have spent as much as $100 million  a year on this auto, Burkese the CTO quit  when he learned that HBO was going to go  to Major League Baseball for the streaming technology  for their new website.  Isn't that Silverlight?  Oh, I hope not.

Start time: 6750.78
End time: 6797.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, Silverlight is just the front end.  I mean, at this point, even Netflix is now HTML5.  Silverlight's being deprecated anyway.  But yeah, no, I mean, MLB works really well.  And I guess, from what I understand,  the CTO, he was building out his own technology,  and they've done pretty well.  I mean, HBO's had some bandwidth problems  after some Game of Thrones episodes,  but they've done fairly well with keeping up the demand.  But I think, I guess, internally, they looked at it  and said, if we have this pure online-only play  with live stuff, we're not convinced  that we'll be able to support the number of concurrent users.  And MLB has proven that they can do it really well  on lots of other devices in lots of different markets.  So I mean, it probably does make more sense for them  to just use proven technology,  but it was an affront to the CTO, so he's gone now.

Start time: 6803.08
End time: 6812.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  HBO Go uses the old technology, not MLB.  I think what they're saying basically is,  we're gonna stop using this HBO Go stuff.

Start time: 6812.46
End time: 6829.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they'll probably shift over.  I mean, yeah, it's not clear yet  if it's going to basically be,  if this streaming thing is going to basically be  HBO Go plus live stuff,  or if it's going to be just a standalone property,  if it's gonna have, you know,  what the price point is going to be.  I still say, I'm predicting $20 a month  is what they're gonna charge, and I stand by that.

Start time: 6830.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It won't.

Start time: 6836.70
End time: 6879.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, well, and that's the whole reason  that I think they're gonna charge $20,  is because at this point, they get so much money  from the cable companies who are offering it  as part of tie-in deals, and they get so much,  you know, free promotion with that,  that they will probably offer you a standalone,  saying, hey, you don't have to have a cable subscription,  you can just subscribe to HBO,  but they're gonna charge $20 a month  as a way to probably, A, appease the cable companies,  and B, you know, frankly make, you know,  a similar amount of profit that they're getting  from the cable subs, if they do it at $10 a month,  it'd be cheaper for me to subscribe to HBO  without having to detach from my cable  than it would be to pay the 15 or whatever it is  that I pay as part of my cable plan.  So I can't see them going below what it costs me  as part of my cable package.

Transcript:  Apparently, the technology, which was codenamed MAUI,  will continue to be, well,  they're canceling the MAUI project,  but it sounds like they're gonna continue to use it  with HBO GO.

Transcript:  So many people are sharing HBO GO passwords.  In fact, I think there's probably just,  there's just one HBO GO password, and everybody uses it.  But it'll be, you know, they'll obviously shut that down,  but the question becomes,  what happens to cable subscribers  who are legitimately using HBO GO  to watch, you know, when they're away from home?  Will, you know, will they have to use this new platform  as well, or will they be able to continue to use  the simple app, you know, that HBO GO has?

Start time: 6933.58
End time: 6953.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, the other thing is, with HBO,  is a lot of people subscribe for specific shows  that last only a certain amount of time.  So like I like, you know, the newsroom,  which is going away, or I'm not a big Game of Thrones fan,  but if so, I'd watch it for,  I'd pay that $20 a month for, you know,  three or four months, and then stop  when there's nothing on that I wanna see.  And then come back later.

Start time: 6954.82
End time: 7015.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and that's always been the case.  And I mean, actually, that was one of the main reasons  they rolled out HBO GO to begin with,  was that basically, because it has all the past content  available too, and so, you know, you have The Supremes,  you have Sex and City, you have, you know,  these classic shows, you have documentaries,  you have a huge array of content.  And when I interviewed HBO at the time,  I guess 2011 when it rolled out,  you know, they were very clear.  They said, you know, we are willing to give up  our home video business in exchange for hoping  that we can keep people subscribed longer,  because exactly like you said, Dwight,  most people do go in spurts and drops, you know,  where they are not consistently subscribed,  you know, month over month.  And Netflix sees this too, where they see fluctuations  in people subscribing.  And I think that the goal with HBO GO,  and whatever this new thing is,  is that by providing not just live access to the content,  but also the entire back catalog,  they can entice people to continue to be part of it,  you know, because they feel like, hey,  I never know when I might wanna watch, you know,  old episodes of something,  or I wanna catch up on some other content.
