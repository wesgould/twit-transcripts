Transcript:  Since the mid nineties, when you first started appearing on Devorak on computers, our  radio show back in the early nineties.  So nice to see you, Ed.  I think you can guess why Ed might be here today.  Along with Daniel Rubino.  It's good to see you executive editor at Windows Central.  We've got the...  Pleasure.  Thank you for having me.  It's great to have you.  We have the Windows team in town because Microsoft announced Windows 11.  It will not be the only subject of the day, but we certainly have to talk about it.  It's really interesting.  There are, Microsoft with its announcement raised far more questions than it  answered.  It really has become a like, well, but what about, but what about, but what about,  but what about, and in fact, even in the post announcement  communications, Microsoft has been confused itself, apparently.  So let's just start talking about Windows 11.  Microsoft announced it on a Wednesday, on a Thursday.  We covered the announcement.  We have a stream of that on our Twitter news feed and then did a special edition  of Windows weekly to talk about it.  Uh, it is, it, the first thing I guess we should say preemptively is Microsoft  never said that Windows 10 is the last version of Windows.  It was widely reported, but it turns out it was just some guy.  Jerry Nixon has said it, a developer advocate once and Microsoft never denied  it clearly.  Windows 10 is not the last version of Windows.  Uh, is Daniel is Windows 11 on, on schedule?  It's the, it's right about five years, right?

Start time: 249.42
End time: 298.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a, yeah.  The original announcement of Windows 10.  Well, obviously what they were hyping more is more about Windows as a service.  This concept that they'll just be constantly updated forever and there'll be new  versions of refreshes to it.  They never said it, as you pointed out though, about the name and Windows 11,  you know, it's had a, we haven't written this story yet about how Windows 11 came  to be, because obviously Windows 10 X was somewhere in between there and Windows 11  borrows a lot from that operating system.  So it's really interesting to see, but yeah, it's on schedule to release in  October.  And so they're going to start shipping the insider build this week and then,  uh, four months to go.  And so they have a lot of time to clarify and adjust things, which I think they  definitely need to do, but it's going to be, it's going to be coming out this  year.

Start time: 298.76
End time: 321.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think the picture was also a little muddied by the leaked released of  Windows 11 that came out last week that was unfinished.  And I think people made decisions about what Windows 11 was going to be based on  what was clearly an early beta release.  Do we know where that version came from?  There was speculation Microsoft released it on purpose to lower expectations.  That can't, that's not right.

Start time: 321.74
End time: 396.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I, I that, that, uh, a they're, they're not that good.  And, and B, uh, you know, there, there's just the, the, the, the result wasn't  what you would expect if someone had leaked that on purpose.  No, I think there's, there's a, you can try all you want to prevent leaks from  happening, but you have to share code with partners, um, along the way.  And there's always, you know, if you share it with a hundred partners, all you  need to do is have one who, uh, you know, lets it out and, uh, and then the games,  you know, and then the game's over there.  Um, it did spoil a lot of the thunder.  Um, and the real problem is that it caused people to focus on the user  experience, the surface elements stuff, instead of focusing on the totality  of the picture where, you know, the user experience is a big deal of it.  But the stuff like, you know, being able to run Android apps in a Windows  subsystem for Android is something that nobody noticed in the leaked build  as far as I know.

Start time: 396.75
End time: 423.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And in fact, that was the kind of the one more thing of Panos Panay's, uh, discussion.  He even, he kind of glossed over it, but I boy, it sure caught my attention  when they talked about the new app store.  The new app store wasn't in this leaked build.  Uh, he mentioned that it will include not only Win32 apps and PWA apps.  I'm sorry.  UWP apps.  I get the acronyms confused, but also, and PWA.  And PWA.  And PWA.  Yeah.

Start time: 424.13
End time: 427.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So everything's in there now.  Uh, uh, yeah.  Even other stores.

Start time: 427.52
End time: 440.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yes.  Oh, and that was another thing you can, and this was very much a shot  across the bow of Apple.  You can also, uh, use your own e-commerce platform and we won't take a penny.  Microsoft said.

Start time: 441.96
End time: 472.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you're going to see a lot of sub stores join.  They want steam in there.  You know, we know Amazon is obviously on board for Android.  That doesn't, though, per se, you know, it's a, it's a, it's a  prevent Samsung from joining as well.  I'd be shocked if Samsung doesn't bring its own store, its own galaxy store to  its own laptops to run its own Android apps on, on there.  That seems that's totally open.  I mean, Google technically could join as well.  Yeah.

Start time: 472.32
End time: 475.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why not the Google play store?  Why choose the Amazon store?

Start time: 476.90
End time: 512.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think Google won't.  That's why.  So I think Amazon was just, they had relationships there already.  Amazon store is not known to be amazing, but it's, you know, it's workable and it's  a start, so get an Amazon, I believe Samsung will probably join too.  Maybe Google will come down the line.  If all this proves popular, which to be honest, there are questions about the  valuableness of running Android apps and windows.  We don't know if it's actually going to be a good experience or useful, but I  think there's a lot of opportunity here.  And, um, yeah, I don't know.  We'll have to wait and see what happens with that.

Start time: 513.02
End time: 532.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, people who are following closely might remember that Microsoft had  its own Android bridge, which they killed.  Uh, so they're using Intel, something no one ever heard of, which is Intel's  Android bridge.  Uh, did you guys know about Intel's Android bridge before?  We don't know much about that.  Had you heard, had you heard of it?

Start time: 535.62
End time: 539.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, no, we heard about that on the day.

Start time: 539.52
End time: 566.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I, you know, I went and looked, uh, and Intel released, uh, Intel put out a press  release, uh, sounds like they had just heard about it as well.  Yeah.  Right.  And they, and they then refused to answer any more questions about it.  So basically what it is is a, you know, it's a runtime compiler that, uh, turns.  Android turns arm instructions into X86 instructions.  Oh, how interesting.  Executed.

Start time: 567.13
End time: 579.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does.  So that's.  So runtime means it's done by the operating system, not by the developer.  The developer doesn't have to modify their app or in Silicon.  Uh, it's not the, not the operation, but by the, uh, by the processor.

Start time: 580.43
End time: 678.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  So, yeah, so, so when the program runs, uh, the, the, you know, the program, the,  the, the program is written for Android for an arm architecture and, and then  those instructions get, get recompiled in at runtime and, uh, and then get  executed by the X86 processor.  Uh, and, and we'll see, you know, Intel doesn't have a great track record at  doing stuff like this, so I'm going to be curious to see how well it works.  And by the way, one thing to add to what Daniel said, the, um, the Amazon  app store is, you know, it's whole, it's per its purpose in life is to deliver  apps for, you know, Kindle fire tablets generally, you know, that's, that's what  it does, the, the only app I, you know, I looked at it and I thought, what's,  what app would I want to run on a windows PC that could come from the Amazon app  store and the, the one that just leaped out at me is I've got a surface tablet.  Uh, and I would love to be able to read Kindle books on it.  And so having the Kindle app that's written by Amazon, that's in a, you know,  that's in an APK, uh, being able to just run that on my surface would suddenly  make my surface useful in places where right now I have to put it away and take  out either an iPad or a, or a Kindle device.  So that's the one thing where I could see some immediate value, but I  can't see much beyond that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Uh, Microsoft showed TikTok.

Start time: 686.26
End time: 716.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think some of the arguments I've heard for this is, uh, IOT apps and smart home  apps and heck, even my Tesla, right.  That the Tesla app, I could run right on my computer.  I can turn the heat on or warm it up or do whatever.  So I think it's going to be a lot of small little, little things.  And to be honest, maybe that's all it needs to do, right?  It's just that one app that someone really wants that they can now run.  And the performance should be good, right?  This isn't BlueStacks.  This is going to be, you know, you know, as Ed explained, this runs,  I think a little bit better.

Start time: 716.68
End time: 720.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, BlueStacks was an emulator that really didn't do a great job.

Start time: 720.80
End time: 741.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  I use a lot of processor requirements on that, but this also will work on AMD  and of course, Qualcomm's ARM chips.  So I'm not really sure the Intel Bridge, I think is for Intel chips, but it doesn't  preclude this from running on AMD and Qualcomm.  So, but we got it.  There's a lot we need to find out about how this all works.

Start time: 741.82
End time: 776.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and in fact, Intel did say that they are working with AMD to run it on Ryzen chips.  So it will run.  Yeah, it will run on Ryzen and it won't actually be necessary on.  I mean, I guess it would have to be necessary to run on ARM chips, but if you have  something like a Surface Pro X or the Lenovo Yoga C630 like I have here, which have an  ARM processor inside already, I'm really curious to see how that story plays out.

Start time: 777.71
End time: 783.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What does it mean?  Well, knowing Microsoft, it'll, I was going to say, knowing Microsoft, it's going to  translate from ARM to x86 back to ARM.

Start time: 788.06
End time: 841.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What does it mean strategically for Microsoft?  Does it mean, I think, you know, at the end, I thought Sachin Adela's comments at the end  were really great.  I thought very interesting and clearly also aimed at Apple.  He was really saying, he said, Windows has always stood for sovereignty for creators  and agency for consumers.  And he's also been the guy who has consistently said since he became CEO at Microsoft that  we want to be everywhere our customers are, which is kind of a big change from Microsoft's  original mission statement, which is to get everybody in the world to run Windows.  It now really looks like Microsoft wants to be because of Azure and the cloud and so forth,  wants to be everywhere, including part of Android, part of Mac.  Is that what this says?  Is it's the universal platform?

Start time: 843.01
End time: 862.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, the original mission statement for Microsoft was a PC on every desktop running  Microsoft software.  Right.  And so what you have now is you basically turn that in reverse.  Microsoft software running on every desktop on a PC or anything else.

Start time: 862.80
End time: 898.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or anywhere you are wherever you want to be.  That also raises the issue of Windows as a service, which Microsoft seemed to back down.  They said we're only going to update this once a year.  Isn't Microsoft this year going to announce a virtual Windows desktop as well?  PC.  Cloud PC.  So it's really it's a it's a interesting change for Microsoft.  It sounds like from such as words that really they want to be a platform for everybody  everywhere.  Something like that.

Start time: 900.05
End time: 917.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not a bad.  It's so wildly different from the 90s.  Right.  I mean, I don't know that whole sovereignty for consumers thing flashed me right back to  not being able to download Mosaic and Windows 95.  It is.  They're a long way from that, I guess.

Start time: 918.02
End time: 944.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and there are a lot of consumers who are saying sovereignty.  What are you talking about?  I can't run this on my late model PC.  Let's let's talk about compatibility.  No go away.  Really, that was.  Oh, before we do that, before we leave, I just I want to mention, Daniel, you wrote  about this in Windows Center, some other people did.  It won't just be the Amazon App Store.  You will be also able to sideload Android apps onto Windows.  Yeah, which is nice.

Start time: 944.44
End time: 954.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think for developers, that's super important.  But yeah, it literally means you can somehow get a hold of an APK.  You can just sideload it into Windows and run it that way.

Start time: 954.30
End time: 970.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, as a lot of Android users know, there's APK libraries all over the place.  Mirrors all over. APK mirror is the biggest one.  So you'll be able to get apps.  So that's very interesting.  And do we think all apps will run or is it even on the Chrome OS?  You can't run all Android apps.

Start time: 971.50
End time: 978.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the question. And how do they run?  Can you like, you know, Ed brought up the Kindle app, which is really neat.  But will that run full screen?

Start time: 978.92
End time: 983.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And then it looked like it was a phone app on top of Windows.

Start time: 983.52
End time: 1025.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. Yes, I think there'll be limits.  But that may be sort of the goal here, too, because maybe Android  developers will start modifying their apps to run on larger screens.  You know, there's like a lot of play here in terms of what this means,  you know, for apps.  But right now, Microsoft's taking a very neutral position on apps in the store.  Basically, any store can join the Microsoft store.  You can keep all the money and will run any app.  Win32, PWA, UWP.  It doesn't matter whatever developers feel more comfortable using.  They can use that. It's definitely, you know, it's a nice point.  That's a very different approach.  But we've been seeing this trajectory ever since around 2015.  Microsoft opening everything.  And this is just further evidence of that.

Start time: 1025.96
End time: 1029.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is such an Adela strategy.

Start time: 1029.92
End time: 1099.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And let me just add one one more thing to what Daniel said in there.  The store, when it, you know, it started in Windows 8,  came to Windows 10 and its sort of mission statement  was to be the place where you bought stuff that was guaranteed to be safe.  It was running in a sandbox and and you know, and couldn't break out of that  sandbox and therefore couldn't have malware in it and couldn't be a trojan  of any kind. What this week's announcement said was the new store,  which is also coming to Windows 10, is going to be able to deliver  conventional Win32 apps and not just the kind that are repackaged  using MSIX, but that are, you know, just full trust.  Win32 apps, you go to somebody's website and you click on their link  and the store pops up in a little tiny window and downloads the thing  and installs it with whatever switches that you have for it.

Start time: 1099.40
End time: 1103.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's an installer as well as a store, really.

Start time: 1103.40
End time: 1165.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an installer as well as a store.  Now, what they're doing to provide the security there  is you're saying it has to be admitted into the store.  And once it's, you know, and just like with any store,  Microsoft's or Apple's or Google's, it has to be inspected.  It has to pass inspection and be vetted and be, you know, we are safe.  And then there's a hash that's assigned to that app.  And you can't change that.  You can host the app on your own server if you want it.  You don't have to upload it to Microsoft servers.  It doesn't have to be downloaded from there.  But the hash has to match.  If you make even, you know, you change even one byte in that,  it will no longer download.  It will no longer install from the store using your location.  So that's their that's their way of maintaining the promise of security  for a conventional Win32 app that's downloaded from the store.

Start time: 1166.04
End time: 1227.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So there does seem to be a little bit of a mismatch  between the promise of security and the demand for a TPM module  on to install Windows 11 and then  opening up in so many new ways and different ways.  And even Android apps, you got to wonder, I mean,  what is the security model going to look like with Android apps running on this?  Let's talk about compatibility, because this was the the biggest upset for people.  I think, you know, a lot of I thought the biggest upset would be  they put the start menu in the middle.  I thought that was going to be I'm going to hear about that all day.  Apparently, nobody cared about that.  I actually aesthetically, I think Windows 11 looks very nice.  But there was a lot of upset about I think a lot of people wanted to run it  and were upset they won't be able to even on some late model PCs.  And what is the first of all, this is a moving target.  Microsoft has changed the requirements a couple of times since this event.  What is the current status?  You need a TPM 2.0 chip to run Windows 11.

Start time: 1231.50
End time: 1252.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's not a TPM 2.0 chip.  That's you can have it in software too.  Right. There's a lot of confusion about it.  Well, pretty much every Intel CPU that's been released since 2015  has TPM functionality, trusted platform module functionality.  You didn't need a separate chip for this.

Start time: 1252.94
End time: 1255.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It could be part of the CPU.  You don't need it.

Start time: 1256.16
End time: 1297.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Previously, you needed to have a separate chip on the motherboard.  Right. And it's you know, it's analogous to the Mac secure enclave kind of,  you know, kind of thing.  But it's basically it's a place where cryptographic keys can be stored  and they can't be tampered with.  And you can use that to do integrity checks,  you know, some very serious integrity checks,  especially at crucial times like startup  to ensure that something isn't injected into the operating system there.  But so the TPM requirement, though, isn't the big deal  because most even six year old hardware has a TPM.

Start time: 1298.20
End time: 1313.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, you say that and I've said that.  But I hear from people who say I have an AMD chip, a self-built computer.  It doesn't, you know, and there is a compatibility checker,  which Microsoft offers, which has told a lot of people to run.

Start time: 1313.66
End time: 1474.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's two things going on there.  One is that until 2018,  there was no requirement that the TPM had to be enabled.  So a lot of vendors shipped PCs without the TPM being enabled.  But you could turn it on.  But you could. But you could turn it on.  But in the device manager. Yeah.  In the BIOS, the BIOS is where you turn it on.  You have to go into the firm, into the UEFI firmware.  It has to be a UEFI.  So if you if you have an old fashioned BIOS, forget it.  It's not going to run Windows 11.  You need a UEFI system.  It has to have secure boot and it has to have TPM 2.0 functionality in it.  Now, for a lot of home built PCs and a lot of gamer PCs,  those might have had the TPM functionality built into the CPU.  But the companies that released those motherboards  never bothered to put the TPM switch into the firmware.  And so those are the people who they technically,  if their motherboard manufacturer released a new firmware update  that allowed them to turn on the TPM functionality, they'd be golden.  But what's the odds that, you know, a motherboard from,  you know, 2017 or 2018 is suddenly going to get a firmware update  after going four years since the last one it had. Right. Right.  So that's it. So that's problem number one.  But it's a TPM.  But the much, much, much bigger problem is that Microsoft put a hard floor  on CPU compatibility and basically anything.  It's it's eighth generation Intel CPUs  and their equivalent on AMD and and arm manufactured.  Most ARM chips are going to that that you're going to see in a PC  will qualify because that's that's a relatively new thing.  But and even some eighth generation Intel chips won't qualify  because it's Kaby Lake. Right.  Is an eight generation. But there's some Kaby Lake chips.  It's only Kaby Lake revision are and later  that are going to be supported on Windows 11.  So the the official word from Microsoft, this is in the documentation,  is that most PCs that were designed and built  in the last 18 to 24 months will qualify for Windows 11.  Before that, maybe, maybe not.

Start time: 1474.84
End time: 1486.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For those people, they can continue to run Windows 10  and it will get updated through 2025. That's its end of life.  At least through 2025.  So they at least means what Microsoft might extend that.

Start time: 1487.04
End time: 1532.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I am I would bet I would say that it's at least a 50 50 bet  that Microsoft will extend Windows 10 support  for at least a year or two past October 2025.  There's no reason not to. Right.  Because there's there's going to be in fact, if you if you go back  to the eighth generation CPU, eight generation Intel CPUs,  those came out in PCs in 2018.  The Microsoft's general promise is a 10 year life cycle for an operating system.  So it would make sense for them to try and extend it to, you know, 2027, 2028.  So mostly people are just saying, oh, this is funny.

Transcript:  I'm going to a new conspiracy theory.  Microsoft did this because they wanted people to say,  I really want Windows 11 and I can't get it like they like that.  That is a good drumbeat because otherwise  it would have been people saying, I don't want Windows 11.  That's disgusting. I'm staying with Windows 10,  which is what most people usually say when there's a new version of Windows.

Transcript:  This is a mystery here is that the processors, you know,  is that pointed out with the Kibble Lake?  Why wouldn't they allow those? Yeah.  Yeah, we don't know yet the reasoning.  Like, I think we're all open to OK, Microsoft, give us the argument.  Why technical argument? Yeah. Right.  And so far, they haven't presented it.  There's been like one of some from Microsoft said it's not security related.  You know, there is this concern maybe it has to do with, you know,  down or some of the hardware flaws. Yeah.  Or it's not just security related.

Transcript:  They said performance, which was because because an i7 7700 is pretty fast  and it's still faster than some of the cells in an atom or a cellar on. Yeah. Right.  So there's no rhyme or reason here in terms of the performance.  And the question I have is, you know, with the leaked build,  you can throw it on a USB disc and use a Microsoft creation tool.  You can install it on anything that runs Windows.  You put on a Surface Go, Surface Studio 2.  So these are all the PCs that technically do not qualify for Windows 11.  It runs perfectly fine on there. No issues whatsoever.  So it's not like it can't physically run it.  It can. They're just arbitrarily saying, we don't want it on these chips.  And we're all waiting for another shoe to fall.  I don't think they're going to stick to this.  At least, you know, the TPM stuff, I'm totally on board with.  I think that's you got to have some argument here for security.  And I think that's they need to have sort of a break.  But the processor stuff, they're going to have to do a little bit better of a job.  I could see blocking lower end chips, maybe.  If you have if you have a core i7 7th Gen, I mean, come on.  It is getting a little weird. That's pretty recent.

Transcript:  This kind of lends some credence to the argument.  You know, Paul and Mary Jo, last week before Windows 11 was announced, said,  I said, why are they doing a Windows 11?  And they said to juke the PC market because it had an incredible year last year  because of covid.  But of course, it's probably going to have a terrible year as a result this year.  And they wanted to sell PCs.  And so this really is for OEMs because historically people buy  new PCs to get the new version of Windows.  This would that that would be a good reason.  But I don't think Microsoft would ever admit to that.  You think that's the reason?

Start time: 1704.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because I could see how they bought it to run Zoom because the kids have to go to class.  And, you know, I'm working at home and I needed a new PC last year.  But that would sound like that.  They don't have a reason this year. Why?

Transcript:  I think it's the permanent change that the pandemic has caused in the workplace.  These are the residual effects of it.  So while some people are definitely going back to the office, you know,  Microsoft and Nadella has talked about this.  This digital transformation has been he says accelerated by five years  just because of the pandemic.  So we were already going down this route, but it happened so quickly.  So basically they're betting on and the market seems to say that the laptop  or the PC is still going to be the hub of all computing going forward.  And the thing about Windows 11, it is true to, you know,  to the market and, you know, to drive some more sales.  But it will also open up some new hardware opportunities.  You know, this idea of two in ones with dual screens.  You know, we already saw they have a new pen that supports haptic feedback.  The current pen doesn't support it.  You know, we know there's wake on touch where you touch the display and it wakes up.  So they're going to be doing a lot more with the hardware, which Windows 11 is,  you know, and then there's a smaller stuff that no one talks about.  Windows 11, the updates are 40 percent smaller and it reboots much quicker.  And it's going to be able to refer from our sourcing that it'll be able  to give you an estimate about how long the update is going to actually take.  And it does it all in the background, much more like how a smartphone works.  You know, so there's a lot more of these under the hood changes that are coming  that this is going to allow to go forward.  But there is still a lot here. We don't know.  And I can tell you, there's still features that haven't been announced  that will be coming out with this operating system.

Transcript:  Although sounds a lot like how Chrome updates to.  Yeah. And Leo, Leo bringing up schools makes me think about,  you know, what Microsoft strategy is there because  Google and Chrome have that market pretty much locked up. Absolutely.

Start time: 1821.64
End time: 1882.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely. So 10x was their answer to that.  And then they canceled 10x, which left us all wondering, like,  that was your plan for Chromebooks.  And now it seems like it took a lot of what was in 10x  and merged it into Windows 11.  Now, 10x was going to be a complete break.  They were going to continue with Windows 10,  but it was only sold on new devices.  Windows 11 is really a hybrid strategy here.  You're still going to need sometimes new hardware to run it, not all the time,  but as we just discussed some of the time.  And they are, you know, making somewhat of a hard break.  But it also brings over a lot of stuff from 10x and 10 into one.  I don't know the story behind that.  I would love to know and I'm sure we'll find out.  Sure, I will do some reporting on this about what the transition,  what was that discussion by that happened.  But, you know, the school, you know, Denise, right.  I mean, Chromebooks dominate in the U.S. for schools.  You know, we'll have to wait and see how Windows 11 plays into that.  But it is a lighter operating system, technically.  But I'm not sure it competes completely with Chrome OS yet.

Transcript:  I'm kind of surprised to hear PC sales are going to be up this year.  I'm going to have to retract my longstanding statement that the desktop is dead  because it sounds like the desktop is not only not dead, it's quite alive and well,  which surprises me a little bit.  We are seeing both Apple and Microsoft make their desktop operating systems  more like mobile operating systems in a Microsoft case.  Even actually, in both cases, install  phone apps on your desktop.  But the desktop seems like it's alive and well.  Is that a surprise?  Doesn't surprise me.  It surprises me. I thought this was this nobody.  So here's the thing.

Transcript:  So, you know, the phrase they kept using at the launch event this week was hybrid work.  And and so a lot of people who were forced home for the pandemic,  you know, just just dragged out.  I heard from a lot of people who just dragged out whatever old PC  that PC they had. Right.  And they made do with it.  And because they thought it was temporary,  because they thought it was temporary.  And now they see, ah, OK, I'm going to be spending a lot more time.  At home and in the office and in other places and such.  And so I need to replace this this piece of crap that I thought I was just  going to need for a little while with something with with something more useful.  And, you know, and that explains, I think that explains the success of the M1 Macs,  you know, which have tremendous battery life and they're, you know, they're lightweight  and and impressively fast.  And if people who had like a seven year old Mac are feeling like,  oh, OK, this is a worthy upgrade and I'll do this.  People who are in the Windows world, I think are in a very similar situation.  If they've got a six or seven year old PC, the compatibility  compatibility questions here  sort of accelerate the upgrade decision for some of them.

Transcript:  The other thing I'm curious what our Windows experts think about is  is office and its role sort of going forward and harkening back to the fact  that if kids are growing up on Chrome and used to using every  all of Google's products in the cloud, you know, maybe office becomes less  and less relevant.  And this is a hedge against that.

Start time: 2111.08
End time: 2161.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's a really good point.  I mean, I hear this all the time that, you know, with schools  relying on Google, that you have a generation growing up  basically using Google products.  There is a tension because when you go into the workforce,  that doesn't seem to be the case.  You still have a lot of enterprise and Fortune 500 companies  all using office, which means where does that tension go?  Right. Do the students have to convert or is it going to be the companies that convert?  It's not like office has turned into a bad product or it has any negatives to it.  In fact, office is still doing extremely well.  Subscriptions are always up every year.  But I don't know how that tension gets resolved because it's true.  And I think that's one reason why Microsoft definitely wants to,  you know, have a more aggressive approach in the schools  and they're trying to find an answer.  How Windows 11 plays into that, I think remains to be seen.  Microsoft hasn't sold us that story yet.

Transcript:  One fascinating thing about Office 365 today  is that you can use it without ever installing the desktop apps.  You can treat it and it is the experience is like a,  you know, through the looking glass, bizarro world version of Google Docs.  Instead of G Drive, you've got OneDrive.  Instead of instead of Google Docs, you've got Word online and you've got Excel online.  And even PowerPoint online and Outlook instead of Gmail.  And you can do the entire thing in a browser  without ever touching a desktop app, without ever having to manage a file  in File Explorer or in Finder, you know, whichever you can just.  And I mean, that to me is seems like it's ultimately the answer  to the question that you posed, Leo or Denise,  is how do the folks, the kids who are growing up with  living in the cloud and working on school assignments in the cloud,  how do they transition into the workforce?  Well, if the workforce allows them to continue working in the cloud  and the menus look pretty much the same  and the editing surface looks pretty much the same  and all you have to do is learn a few slight differences, but everything.  I just open a browser and I click on my saved shortcut and boom, there I am  editing a document and working on a spreadsheet and such.  Then there shouldn't be a transition, really.

This is a small little thing that's so good.  They released an extension for Edge that connects to your Outlook.  So you don't need to leave the tab here and you just click the tab  and it drops down a little mobile view of your inbox.  You can read your email.  And so they're doing a lot of this.  But yeah, that's right.  I mean, PWA Microsoft's all on board with it.  And this idea of like web versions of Office is it's already here.  You can do this all right now.  And it is pretty good, although there's no dark mode yet.  So I'm waiting until they get dark mode.  But I'm sure it's just an added tag.

Start time: 2324.78
End time: 2383.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll explain for those who are saying, what are they talking about?  Progressive web apps or PWA apps are websites  that can become static  with the help of service workers in your browser and live on your desktop,  operate offline, connect when necessary, but don't have to connect to run.  It's kind of a hybrid app model.  And it's something Google invented.  Microsoft and Google have been very  promoting it.  Apple has been somewhat suspect about it.  Right.  And it's kind of a kind of abandoned.  And that's what's really surprising.  Firefox abandoned all support for PWAs.  But people have been using, you know, web apps ever since Gmail.  So I think they're very comfortable with the idea of opening up a browser.  And that that is the interface to all of their apps.  I think they're very comfortable with that, as long as it works  and it can work offline.  Why not?  There's still a lock in component.

Start time: 2389.96
End time: 2426.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we're clearly moving towards that data in the cloud model.  Right. Both Apple and Microsoft default to their own clouds for storage  on both Windows and Mac OS.  Many of your folders don't live on your desktop.  They seem to be on your desktop, but they're really on the cloud.  One driver, I drive.  That's a little weird to me.  I don't like it, but I'm like, I'm an old timer.  That's why I thought the desktop was dying because it was just old fashioned.  But I guess a whole new generation has discovered the desktop.  But as we can see, it isn't the desktop.  I know it's a hybrid thing.

Start time: 2427.14
End time: 2437.40

Start time: 2456.12
End time: 2463.38

End time: 2549.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. It will.  But here's the but here's here's why that's relevant to this discussion is Teams.  Especially in education, it wants to be the hub for all of those.  It's becoming a platform more and more.  It's become it's becoming a platform.  And guess what? If you go to Teams, you get to again, to address Denise's point here.  If you go to Teams, you can add of course, OneDrive is already there,  but you can add Google Drive to it.  You can add Dropbox and you can add Box.  And any other cloud provider can if they all they have to do is use the APIs.  They can add their cloud storage into into Teams  and thus into Office 365 as well.  And you can integrate into the ribbons and such so that  you can share files and co edit files,  even if you're not in OneDrive,  even if you're in Dropbox or Box.  That's something that I don't think Google has done and I don't think Google would do.  And it's sort of you know, it's it's in Microsoft's DNA to do that.  And it'll be interesting to see whether that becomes a competitive strength.

Start time: 2551.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's when I look at Teams integrated into Windows 11,  it really looks like a phone app.  And I think that this is in response to the fact that people do a lot of their communication now  in the messaging apps on their phone.  That's what this looks like.  And so this is to me part of the phonification of the desktop  or the mobile integrating into the desktop.  We thought at first that this would be like the whole thing would be Teams centric.  Teams is turning into an operating system of its own.  But I guess it's just Teams integrated into Windows 11.  October, free upgrade for Windows 10 users, as long as your computer is compatible.

It's called it's open source and it's a much more detailed app  that you could run that will delineate the reasons why your PC doesn't qualify.  So it's not just the CPU goes into the architecture, the cores, the generation,  the TPM, it does all that.  It has 11 categories and it'll check each one of them.

Transcript:  It didn't even create a log file.  Yeah, for heaven's sakes, which is, I mean, and that's that's something that every.  As part of the check, it's doing all that stuff.  All it has to do is dump the output into a log file and put it in a well-known place.  And then and then you can open a text file at the end.  And they didn't even do that.  It's just there's something about this whole week.  It strikes me as just strange because they, you know, they didn't have their  compatibility story ready to go.  There should have been a white paper that explained in, you know, Microsoft BS terms,  you know, why they're doing these things, you know, you have all of their fluffy language on it.  But they should at least have had a white paper ready to go that says, here's why we're  insisting on a minimum, you know, CPU generation, because it will do this, that and the  other thing. And you're going to have the greatest experience and the most compatible and  reliable. But they didn't they didn't even have that ready.  And now they're scrambling to get this thing ready and publish it next week.

Yeah, it's interesting at the end of his talk, by the way, I liked it that they started with  Panos Panay, who seemed a little down, but I think he was just trying to be sincere.  Nadella came on it afterwards instead of kicking things off, which I thought worked very  well to kind of put a button on it and really talk about a strategy.  And I think also to kind of rub Mike Apple's nose in the fact that Windows is open  and supports agency and is not going to not going to close down.  He also quoted Schopenhauer, which is a little weird at the end.  He didn't mention him by name, but he said, I am reminded of analogy from a 19th century  philosopher who compared creators to objects in our solar system.  He wrote about meteors that flash but fade away, planets that burned longer, but whose  energy is confined to their own orbit and compared them to the stars that are constant  and light the path of their own.  He says, we want Windows to be a star, a permanent, constant light on the path.  That's interesting. And I don't know if that's something new from Nadella, but it is  much more Windows centric than his previous statements.  So it was a time where people were.

And we're all, you know, and we're all very excited about seeing what he's done with  Windows. And this is his first year.  I mean, this is what he's done in the first year of him taking over Windows.  It's pretty impressive.  So they're back, I would say, with all this stuff.

Transcript:  It's really interesting.  And it's kind of counter what I thought Microsoft was going to do is move Windows to  the cloud, solve the security issues by, you know, basically managed Windows.  And I guess I was wrong on that.  I really thought that was the future for Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that's it. You know, that's what's also interesting.  You can now play Xbox games on your PC.  They've thanks to X cloud.  You can play Xbox games anywhere, really.  So you would think they'd be promoting the console.  And I guess they are. But because it's hard to get the console, they're also saying,  look, you know, you could still play it in other on other places.

Transcript:  They're even. And there are people who prefer to play on PCs.  Oh, there was one new feature.  I'm not a gamer, so I didn't pay as much attention as I should have to that to that  part of it. But I recall there's one new feature that's going to allow you to  run objects directly from NVMe of.

Start time: 3068.76
End time: 3078.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. That's that's that direct media access is something that's in the Xbox.  What is it called? Direct memory, direct storage, direct storage, direct storage.

Start time: 3079.34
End time: 3130.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the one. And that will require a new PC.  And that should be a huge performance bump for exactly the kind of  scenarios that gamers love.  And and there's no reason that that technology wouldn't translate to things like  graphics workstations and, you know, CAD.  Drafting apps and stuff like that.  So, you know, it's a consumer release this October.  And so obviously, gaming is the place to to focus that there.  But that's an that was an interesting architectural change that, you know, you  definitely will need new hardware for and some, you know,  definitely new, definitely new hardware.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Daniel, what's the technical explanation for direct storage?  It requires a fast SSD  like an NVMe drive.  But what is it doing? Is it is it just loading things faster?  What is it doing?

Start time: 3144.74
End time: 3199.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe it's bypassing parts of the CPU and going direct to the memory.  And it's allowed to hold it persistent.  So you see this on the new Xbox Series X and Series S, I believe,  where you can basically put a game into the background, go do something else,  come back to the game and it doesn't need to reload the game.  It just it pops back in and you're right where you left off.  So it's just a sort of persistent behavior, almost like what we saw  with tomb stoning and smartphones.  You can think of it that way, but it's on a much bigger scale for GPU intensive  apps. And so, you know, Ed's right.  I mean, this is in terms of gaming.  You can just minimize your game out of the way, go back to Word, continue.  And then when you launch it again, it's just you don't need to reload the game.  You won't see the menu pop up.  It'll just be right there with the game again.  So this does have ramifications for, yeah, heavy lifting apps like CAD.  And, you know, for workstations where all this is going to be playing a major role.

Start time: 3199.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sam Meshkovich writing in Ars Technica also says it'll change the way  games are developed, because right now, when you're writing a game,  you have to allow for slow load times in between big loads.  And so you have kind of elements of the game where nothing much is happening  as you're moving from one world to the other.  Those can open up suddenly.  And that's going to change how game developers write their games.  So that's that's interesting as well.  Yeah, I feel like Microsoft is firing on all cylinders at this point,  that this was despite the miscommunications.  Yeah, despite the miscommunications, they really have the technology anyway.  Seems to be well on track and right on for what people are looking for.  Is that right? Would you say?  And the philosophy to Daniel? Yeah.

Start time: 3249.14
End time: 3276.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You agree, Ed? Absolutely.  I do think they they really need to get their  communication strategy figured out, though, because even because a lot of the  the the good stuff that they're doing is is just completely getting lost  because they're having they're going to have to be spending all their time  explaining what they meant.  And any time you're explaining, you're losing. Yeah.

Transcript:  Well, and there's a lot of backpedaling  and re-explaining and no, let's get this right.  But that's historically going back to the announcement  that you couldn't use Xbox in a submarine.  That's historically been a problem for Microsoft or Jerry Nixon saying  this is the last version of Windows.  They've I don't know what the problem is.  Maybe bring back.  Who was it? Burstyn Marsteller, who was the no, no.  I want to say Warby Parker.  No, no, it was who is there?  Who is their PR famous PR company for many, many years?  Come on, Ed. You spent a lot of Wagner.

Transcript:  Just to close out, I would say the other half of this is going to be coming in October.  Obviously, Windows 11 is going to be starting to come out then.  But I fully expect a big surface events in October  where they're going to fill in the other half here with the new hardware.  So I really expect a new surface pro a like a real new surface pro.  Thinner vessels pen in the keyboard,  but also reflecting some of the newer technologies that are becoming with Windows  11 Surface Studio 3, possibly surface to a version two, definitely.  So this is going to be, I think, the other part to watch.  And of course, their partners, HP, Dell, Lenovo, especially,  will have all new hardware to sort of, you know, match what's coming with Windows 11.  I think that's going to be the other exciting part to watch later this year.

And I guess I guess it I guess it is.  I'm looking forward to trying Windows 11.  I turned on my insider.

So he could have that social experience and then covid.  And at least he got to walk.  He got to walk with a mask on, but he got to walk.  And that was that was a good thing.  Yeah. And I presume college  will have in-person classes.  I hope so. They're debating that still, believe it or not.  Our show today brought to you by brand new sponsor.  Want to welcome Endava Endava.  E N D A V A.  They've got a great podcast.  In fact, season two is just launched of Tech Reimagined.  It brings together some of the biggest, most interesting people in tech  with industry experts like Guy Kawasaki,  Mary Williams, Alex Hunter, Brian McBride, Tom Gruber, Dave Copeland,  Inma Martinez, Viola Llewellyn.  It's it's the big questions around technology and its industry's guests  and hosts will be talking about how these trends impact our everyday lives  and our relationship with technology is constantly reimagined.  Hence the name Tech Reimagined.  The first episodes, insurance reimagined parts one and two,  included Anne Norclit and Kevin Crawford discussing the role  I.T. plays in the insurance industry.  A.I. reimagined these two episodes, the role of A.I. reimagined,  featured Boris Sergal and Radu Orgedon  talking about the regulations, accountability and expectations  that arise when using A.I. to solve complex problems  and discussed what the future holds for this technology.  And for those of us who use it on a daily basis,  if you're interested in shopping, I love this.  This show has everything.  Parts one and two of our shopping experience reimagined.  The guests, Thomas Beechin and Jeremy Mays,  dive into some of the most significant shifts they've seen in consumer behavior  over the last 12 months, including the increasing popularity of direct  to consumer and buy online pickup in store and how the shift to digital  is pushing people and companies to reimagine the way we shop and Dava.  That's really their business, too.  They've been reimagining the relationship between technology and people  with a look at the most recent experiences with technology and its experts.  Learn more about how tech is becoming so much more in this world.  It is constantly growing and changing.  It's a podcast you don't want to miss.  And Dava podcast.  You can subscribe and listen to Tech Reimagined, the podcast from Dava,  of course, wherever you get your podcasts.  And thank you, Dava, for your support for our show for this week.  In tech reminder, we do have not only the IRC, we've always had that at IRC.  That TV, some great comments during this conversation in the IRC.  We also now have a discord for members of Club Twit Club.  Twit is how you can support our show yourself with a seven dollar a month  subscription. We figured we had to give you something for that seven bucks.  So we have ad free versions of all of our shows,  which is really nice audio and video bonus content on a twit plus feed,  including a lot of the things that happen before and after shows  that never make it into the podcast.  And then that members only discord, which is a really fun place to hang out.  Each show has its own channel.  But there's also conversations about books, travel,  coding, comics, Linux.

I don't know if there's anybody out there still using the Western Digital My Book Live.  Western Digital stopped making it in 2015.  I know a lot of people, I think I had one back then,  stopped updating it around that time.  In 2018, a serious exploit was discovered that allowed arbitrary code to be run on the My Book Live.  Western Digital didn't put out a patch, they didn't fix it.  And now three years later, it's being exploited, apparently.  A malefactor, a bad actor, a hacker is using that exploit to wipe people's  Western Digital My Book Live.  If you noticed a factory reset performed in your vice,  you may also notice that all of your data is gone.  And as far as anybody can tell, there's no way to get it back.  Western Digital says we're investigating, perhaps they'll issue a patch.  But their advice to anybody who owns a Western Digital My Book Live right now is,  you might want to disconnect it from the internet.  It's a good idea to disconnect your My Book Live to prevent further attacks while we investigate.

Start time: 3849.82
End time: 3900.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yes. These are people probably who said, oh, I don't trust the cloud.  I'm going to have my own cloud here in my house.  What it really goes to, if you've got an IoT device, which is basically any hardware  that goes on the internet in your house, you really want to make sure it's being supported  and updated and that you're getting regular over the air updates.  Ideally, you shouldn't buy anything these days that doesn't get regular over the air  updates automatically because you don't want to just go around and have to update everything.  I feel bad. I've been saying this on the radio show for a long time, but I feel bad because  most people who own this thought of it as their backup drive, right?  The problem is, if it's the only place something exists, it ain't a backup. I don't care what you  call it. It's the original. It's the only copy. I certainly hope people have backups of their

Start time: 3901.10

Start time: 3913.34
End time: 3918.62

Start time: 3919.38
End time: 3926.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  I don't know. I think about things like the Samsung refrigerators that have their own  operating system that gets updated about once every couple of years. I guess you're not storing a

Start time: 3936.22
End time: 3954.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  whole lot of data on your refrigerator. But if you bought a refrigerator that has a big screen  and a browser, and by the way, this has happened to people who bought this refrigerator, the browser  is no longer updated, it is unusable. So what's that big screen for? You've got a big

Start time: 3954.88
End time: 3993.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  nothing on your refrigerator. It's also a potential point of access to the rest of your network.  Good point. It's a jumping off point. And that's where the really good hackers, the ones who  want to get deep into networks, they love stuff like this because it gives you a toehold,  and a toehold in a place that's not maintained. Well, who can forget the Vegas casino that was

Start time: 3994.80
End time: 4038.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  hacked via a fish tank thermometer? You remember this? Exactly. A fish tank thermometer that was  apparently online. This happened back in 2018. The attackers used the thermometer to get a  foothold in the network. They then found the high roller database, pulled that back across the  network out the thermostat and up into the cloud. It probably took a while to get it through the  thermostat, but they are very patient. And nobody seemed to notice. Apparently, this thermostat was  connected to the internet so you could see what temperature your tank was at, I guess. Crazy.

Start time: 4039.10
End time: 4057.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, and control it because that's the whole point. Turn it up and down.  You don't want to have to send an employee in to do that all the time. You can just keep an eye on  it, monitor it. It's a perfectly good idea, but security is a process.

Transcript:  You would think a casino would have. Actually, somebody asked me this on the radio show today.  I didn't really have a great answer, which is now that we know ransomware is a massive threat,  why is it people are still getting bit by it? Why did Colonial Pipeline pay several million dollars  in ransomware? Didn't they have backups? Weren't they prepared for this?  It's not a simple list.

Start time: 4084.16
End time: 4086.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not the backups that are getting affected. Yeah.

Start time: 4087.26
End time: 4089.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the backups themselves are being affected.

Start time: 4089.32
End time: 4124.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. In the case of Colonial Pipeline, clearly IT wasn't up to the task or wasn't getting funded  properly because I think we found out later that the way the bad guys got in was through a VPN  account from a long employee who had left long ago, but the account was never discontinued. The  employee hadn't used two factor and in fact reused the password and the password was leaked  in a breach. The hackers tried it on the VPN. It worked. We're in the famous movie hacker phrase,

Start time: 4125.02
End time: 4138.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm in and the rest is history. I think it was even worse than that. It was a VPN product  and this happens a lot. It was a VPN product that was installed and then they stopped using it,

Start time: 4138.44
End time: 4144.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but they never cleaned up after. They weren't even using the product anymore,  but the server was still running? Yeah.

Start time: 4147.16
End time: 4197.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's very, very, very common. And basically these days, especially in critical infrastructure,  you basically need to assume you're already hacked and your job is not to keep them out.  Your job is to find them and your job is to find all the places they could come in as. But IT  and security are seen as cost centers and when something is a cost center and profit,  capitalism, etc., then the cost center, no, we're not going to give you another $100,000  or another half a million dollars to hire two white hats. We're not going to fund your red team.

Start time: 4206.74
End time: 4218.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They did say, as they have said year after year, the most secure version of Windows ever.  You'd think they'd be smart enough not to say that phrase, but people want it to be secure.

Start time: 4220.14
End time: 4290.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the problem across industry, right? So we're just talking about TPM 2.0. That plays a  role in this, this idea of security. But it's a very unsexy argument if you're a consumer and you  just want Windows 11. I've literally had people say, I don't care about that. And it's true. You  don't care about any of this until it happens. And that's the problem with all these companies  who have IT departments. Maybe the IT department does care, but as Ed pointed out, financially,  the company doesn't. And so they're like, no, you don't get the money for it. And you see this in  medicine too, right? We know preventative medicine is much more effective than treating someone.  Yet in the United States, we don't put a lot of money towards preventative medicine.  And so I don't know how you solve this outside of that companies. There needs to be regulation.  Talk about the IoT thing before. We're in a period where people just threw Wi-Fi and everything.  There was no security. There's no standards. And now you're starting to reap those security flaws.  And so it's going to change. There will be standards coming along, but that's the problem  here. We need to have some regulation and some security. And even that won't prevent everything,  but we'll at least set the ground floor for it. And of course, the tech industry doesn't want

Start time: 4290.86

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  regulation. Microsoft's in an unusual position because they were the first to get investigated  back in 1998 by the Department of Justice. They have been kind of left out of this current round  of big tech investigations, Facebook, Google, Apple, taking the brunt and Amazon, the brunt of  the hits. There have been, and we talked about this last week, six bills in Congress with  bipartisan support to break up, to regulate, to change the way we monitor big tech. And this was  the week that big tech came to Washington lobbying like crazy. Tim Cook wrote a letter,  actually it was a phone call to Nancy Pelosi, warning her that the bills were rushed.  He told Pelosi, the CEO of Apple, that they would, the CEO of Apple told Nancy Pelosi,  the Speaker of the House, they would, let me get the titles all right, Tim Apple, you know him,  that they would crimp, these bills would crimp innovation. They would hurt consumers by  disrupting the services that power Apple's iPhone. And according to people with knowledge of the  conversation, it's part of a forceful and wide ranging pushback, the New York Times says, by the  tech industry since the proposals were announced. Denise, have you looked at those bills?

Start time: 4374.20
End time: 4451.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Denise McLaughlin I haven't read all six of them. No, I haven't read all six of the bills. I've  read coverage about the bills. And I guess I have two minds on this. I mean, when we remember back  to 1998, Microsoft wasn't broken up and lots of people thought it should have been. And I  kind of feel like putting this kind of legislation out there lets lawmakers go to their constituents  and say, see, we're taking action against these huge companies that you all have told us you're  concerned about. And then perhaps it goes the way of what happened when the DOJ came after  Microsoft. I mean, there were some changes and requirements, but there were no breakups.  So there's that. And then I guess the flip side of that is really maybe nothing happens at all.  Maybe this is all political. Maybe this is, you know, there are so many people so upset,  and it's something that the lawmakers can actually come together on and say, you know,  we're divided on lots of things, but we're unified on this. We're going to look out for your interests  vis-a-vis big tech, and they can look like they're doing just that. And then again, maybe not much

Start time: 4452.08
End time: 4484.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  comes of it. You might think that could happen. But this week, the GOP, the Republican Party,  tweeted at the Democratic representative who introduced at least one of those bills  that they said they accused him of taking money from Microsoft and allowing Microsoft to write  that bill. Oh, great. So no, I don't think there's going to be a bipartisan.

Start time: 4485.22
End time: 4521.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's a relief. Actually, last week, we had the host of the big technology podcast,  the big technology newsletter, Alex Cantor, what's on. And he said, at first, when I saw these,  I thought there's no way that, you know, there'll be bipartisan support. There's no way they'll agree  on this. But he started, he was said, I'm starting to get a little nervous. Of course,  the Republicans have different reasons for wanting to censure big tech than the Democrats. But if  even if the reasons are different, if they can get together to at least pass those bills,  he thought that that actually might happen. I'm wondering, though, I think-

Transcript:  And so is the White House. You know, Lena Kahn is the new chair of the FTC. She's very much  pro breaking up. She wrote a paper in law school about breaking up Facebook, I think. She's very  much, you know, considered an enemy of big tech. And that's coming from the left. It's going to be  interesting. But as I said, big tech is not taking it lying down. They have lots of money to spend.  And I think honestly, money is probably the only language both Republicans and Democrats can agree

Transcript:  this one of the bills says you can't acquire competition anymore. You know, that was the  startups. Yeah, no startup. That was, of course, what Facebook uses used to kill the competition  from Instagram and WhatsApp. They wanted to buy Snapchat. Snapchat wouldn't sell to them. They  saw Snapchat as an existential threat. Instead, they just kind of copied them.

Transcript:  And that seemed to do some of the work. Yeah, I mean, we were kind of talking about this before  how all the cloud apps start to kind of look the same after a while and you can move from one to  another and not really matter. Even the desktop operating systems. I mean, Mac and Windows are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  looking more and more alike these days. The new Windows taskbar is the dock. Yeah,  essentially. Yeah, it's the you know, it's the mac. The center dock. That's right. The center dock  and you know, it has a different twist on it in that it, you know, it still has a start menu.

Start time: 4635.64

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple never had a start menu and never and still doesn't. One button. Linux fans would say this is  more Linux stealing than Apple. It looks a little like a gnome. It looks like gnome. Yeah, it does  look like gnome. Although gnome looks like the way it looks because of the Apple. So

Transcript:  The classic interface. Yeah, they did that with XP too. I remember. Yeah. Prime Day,  Monday and Tuesday, of course broke sales records. It does every year.  In fact, it was big for third party sales as well. Amazon said it was the biggest two day sales  period for third party sellers in the company's history. And then in fact, in Amazon, of course,  you know, anxious to say this third party sales outpaced its own Prime Day sales, 250 million items  sold robotic vacuums, coffee makers and crest white strips. Some of the top selling products  see if I have a number $11 billion. That's a 6% increase over Prime Day back in October,  according to Adobe analytics. And it wasn't just Amazon, by the way, Walmart, Target, Costco,  Best Buy and Macy's all had on the same days, their own deal days or what have you.

Transcript:  really are a platform. Do you I mean, the case was made, you may have even made this headbutt  on previous shows that even if Microsoft didn't get broken up, they really learned to be a little  more judicious after the DOJ lawsuit. Do you think that the big tech companies, Facebook, Amazon,  Google, Apple are being more cautious now due to this scrutiny? Oh, absolutely. They, you know,

Start time: 4801.88
End time: 4833.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  especially to Denise's point, especially because of Europe, I think if it weren't for the EU  enforcement, Facebook in particular, but Amazon also would be much more aggressive than they're  being than they're being right now. That that threat of antitrust action causes a lot of  of hesitation in doing things that they might have just jumped right into five years ago. And

Start time: 4833.84
End time: 4846.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's especially an issue with Google. Yeah. And Apple too, Apple knows that their app store is  a sore spot. And so they're trying to make somewhat, I would say somewhat cosmetic changes,

Start time: 4846.70
End time: 4886.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but they're trying to make some. But they've at least pushed back on that with the big white  paper. Yeah. Customer centric argument saying our primary goal on this is the security of our  customers. And if you take away our control of the app store and the commerce, then you open the  floodgates to bad things happening to our customers. And we we're going to go to the mat on that one.  So they're at least trying to make the argument in a way that is, you know, that isn't just,  you know, this is legal to do this. They're saying it's moral and right for us to be doing this.

Start time: 4886.08
End time: 4936.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think they're going to the court of public opinion on this? They're trying to get the public  to say, Hey, stop messing with Apple. Tim Cook has said allowing side loading would severely  harm the security of our app store. Here's the white paper they put out this week, building a  trusted ecosystem for millions of apps, featuring a father and young child smiling as they look at  their iPad, the important role of app store protections. This is, you know, quoting Steve  Jobs back in 2007. This is a timeline of the app store that Apple put out. We're trying to do two  diametrically opposed things at once, provide an advanced and open platform to developers,  while at the same time, protect iPhone users from viruses, malware, private privacy attacks, etc.  This is no easy task that kind of sets the stage for the whole thing.

Start time: 4938.60
End time: 4973.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, and Facebook has done the same thing, trying to rally public opinion, right? Saying that  these actions that are trying are going to, you know, cripple Facebook, as you know, they're  going to make it impossible for it to be free for advertising supported content. If you take that  away, then you'll lose all the things you love about Facebook. You know, Facebook is not nearly  as good at making those arguments. No, Apple is really good. Look at this.

At the park,  the copycat filter app John had side loaded threads to all of his photos, unless he pays  up. There's that Fox again, in the trees this time. Let's see. Here you are. That's not a cup.  That's not a copycat. Oh, it's a maybe it's a cat. No, that look at the pointy snout.  Fox is everywhere offended by this. And that's terrible.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in fact, those parental controls came because Apple got sued by a family whose son  spent tens of thousands of dollars on Redfish and Bluefish in some game. Yeah. Yeah. Well,  you're the one who got hit, Denise, because my kids were too old before that was a problem.  They weren't young with the iPhone. But your son, I think, was right that age.

Michael, a senior in high school,  is no longer doing this, but his mom is. So I see a lot of purchases on the various games that Lisa's  playing, which is fine. I get the email, but I'll make sure to charge her for it. Ages and stages,  Leah. Yeah, it does. Oh, I can't complain. I'm the guy who bought a $7,000 gaming machine just to be  a Viking in a game that is still occupying far more hours than I'd like to admit. Meanwhile,  moving on, Wall Street Journal, by the way, I think it was in the Wall Street Journal that I  saw a Facebook full page ad saying, we need more regulation. What is that strategy? What are they  up to? Is that preemptive? Like, regulate this. Don't pass these bills. But tech industry does

Start time: 5177.20
End time: 5199.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  need some regulation. Or is it just- Yeah, I think Facebook's point is that a lot of the laws  that regulate the internet go back to the mid-90s. That's what they're saying. They're old laws. Yeah.  Yeah. And they should, well, and one of those laws is section 230, which-  That's the one. ... which desperately needs-

Start time: 5200.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  partner rather than adversary. Yeah, exactly. And let's not forget that  Facebook has done quite well, as have Google, Apple, and Amazon, and very likely would love to  see laws that prevent competition from creeping up behind them. So let's just make first-party data  be the only kind of data there is. No third-party cookies. Google, by the way, has backed off.  This is a story from this week on their plan to block third-party cookies. Let me pull this up,  John, for you. On Chrome, they had planned to do it next year. Now they say,  uh, maybe it's going to be a couple of years. They pushed out the date by nearly two years,  saying, it takes time to fix privacy problems without hurting ad-dependent websites.  And of course, our revenue, because all of those ads come through Google.

Transcript:  Um, so if you have that other article in the rundown about, about insiders at Google saying,  yeah, it's not the same company. It's not as nimble. It's not as fast. It's much more risk averse.

Start time: 5284.82
End time: 5320.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not sure about this article. We talked about this on Twig. It's a strange article. This  is from the New York Times. Google executives see cracks in their company's success. And the blame  is Sundar Pichai, according to this article, because he's too thoughtful and deliberative  and he's not acting fast enough. Um, I, you know, this is Daisuke Wakabayashi writing in the New  York Times. I'm not, I don't know what to think about this. Um, I've been saying-

Start time: 5320.82
End time: 5337.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't mind thoughtful and deliberative on big important issues like privacy, but  at the same time, you know, I don't know, Apple sure is, is trying to paint themselves as,  themselves as the privacy friendly, where we got your back company.

Start time: 5338.18
End time: 5416.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The chief complaint in this Times article is that, uh, Google executives wanted to buy Shopify.  Um, Mr. Pichai rejected the idea because he thought Shopify was too expensive.  Um, and you know, and he kind of waffled over a period of time to kind of delay it. Uh,  they feel like he's too risk adverse. Actually, I don't know if that's the problem with Google.  There's definitely a problem with Google and it may be Sundar Pichai, but I don't think thoughtful  and deliberative is the problem. Uh, I think Google kills too many projects, uh, which is  shaken confidence in its users. Uh, they have a huge problem with the firing of Timnit Jebru, the,  the, uh, uh, AI ethics researcher who was critical of Google and immediately got fired,  even though they'd hired her to do exactly that. Um, I think they've got problems with employees.  Uh, they've, I, I, I'm not sure that Google is in great shape and, and I guess you have to  point to the CEO. How important is a CEO at a company that we were talking about this on  this week in Google on Wednesday. And I use such an Adela as the counter example. Um, he is a,  I would say a great CEO. You agree, Daniel? He's done a great job for Microsoft in his six years.

Start time: 5417.94
End time: 5460.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, a lot of people didn't think he was going to be good or he was going to be too,  he comes from a cloud background and that's where he, now I mentioned earlier,  kill Xbox kill surface and there were investors calling for that. And so, and he did give things  a chance. Windows phone. He gave them a chance. It's like, you guys get a couple of years to  fix this. Otherwise I'm going to cut it and they didn't fix it. So it got cut. But yeah, he,  I think you do need a good leader in that position and it's a hard job, right? I think the,  the best description of a CEO is not necessarily the decisions they make. It's the people they  put into the other positions to make those decisions. That's what you said. He's done a

Start time: 5460.14
End time: 5466.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  great job putting in great people in Xbox and in, in windows and so forth. Yeah. Well, and that

Start time: 5466.90
End time: 5502.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is, that is the definition of what a good CEO does. Sets the strategy so that it's clear and  everybody knows what direction the ship is moving in. Cause these companies are big. You can't,  you can't turn easily. So you get a set, set the strategy, hire the right people. And then,  and then let them, let them do their jobs. And, and, and then finally, keep from becoming,  you know, a headline from the EU antitrust enforcement agencies, which he's done.

Start time: 5503.76
End time: 5537.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, he's decisive to the very first thing he did as CEO was kill. What was the, the,  it was a windows RT and they had a surface mini or something that they were going to ship  surface mini. Yeah. And there were thousands in the warehouse. And he said, Nope, we're not  going to ship that product. That was one of the very first things he did. So you can't accuse him  of being too deliberative. He never liked the Nokia acquisition, wrote that off as quickly as he  could, wrote off overture, the ad business acquisition at the same time. Yeah. I think he's

Start time: 5537.92
End time: 5613.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right about that stuff. You know, he made the right moves. Yeah. I mean, everybody brings up  windows phone about how mad they are about that, but it was the right decision. He gave them,  it's not like he, he didn't come in in 2015 and go windows phones gone. No, he gave them, he's like,  you have a runway, you have a couple of years, let's figure this out. They didn't figure it out.  Yeah. And then he killed it, but he makes the right decisions. And he did kill off a lot of  stuff that came from Balmer who listened, Balmer had a very different approach. He wanted to be  the consumer company. He had a vision there. And Nadella was like, nope, we're going back  to our roots. And they've been dragging the company in another direction. And it's been  the right direction. They're making money and they're being successful. So, you know,  I can't speak to Google too much, but you're right. You know, the, they having a lot of  turnover with employees, apparently there's discontent. It's never a good thing when your  VPs are talking behind your back in New York times about faith in you as a leader. So there's  definitely even just the perception of this is really bad. But I can't speak internally to what  they do to fix it. They've always been, you know, fundamentally Google, we know they have the pixel,  Google search, Gmail, but fundamentally they're an ad company. And that's always been hard to  square with this perception of that they're a consumer company or are they an ad company?

Start time: 5613.90
End time: 5646.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so there's always that tension. It's also a unique challenge for them because they're so  successful as an ad company and make so much money. Historically, really, they haven't made  much money on anything else. Even the success of YouTube is based on its advertising that they  don't have to succeed in anything else. And as a result, they really haven't. A lot of the other  bets that Google has been putting money into have gone away or been canceled because they just,  they just not taken off. And yet they're very successful. To your point about CEOs,

Start time: 5646.60
End time: 5702.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think we could all sit here and look at companies like Amazon or Facebook or  sorry, Microsoft, Apple. And we could pull out some strategies that we would associate  with those CEOs. And I think that's harder to do with Google right now. Like what is its strategy?  What is its CEO charting for it in the future? You know, and if you looked at it years ago,  you know, as it's starting out and it's scrappy and it wants to offer people the best darn search  results and it wants to have people focus on their 20% time and come up with great creative things  that they didn't even know would be, you know, important until they were developed. I don't know  that Google has that at this moment and maybe it needs to regain it. They never came up with a

And it's like, all right, early missteps, pull it back. What's  happened with that story though? Apple, you know, big rumors that they're going to be entering this  field pretty soon. Microsoft's are already making billions apparently in this field.

Start time: 5756.88
End time: 5877.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Right. Speaking of dystopia, I thought this was fascinating. I'm a fan of spy novels,  spy movies. The Wall Street Journal talks about an app called Premise, which is being used by the  US military and intelligence agencies to spy in effect abroad. The idea of Premise is they  primarily pays users in the developing world to complete basic tasks for small payments.  Typical assignments include snapping photos, filling out surveys, doing other basic data  collection or observational reporting like counting ATMs or reporting on the price of  consumer goods like food. About half the company's clients are private businesses looking for  commercial information. We want to open a bank in Santiago. How many ATMs are there? Where should  we put our ATM? But apparently a lot of the work being done, about half these days, is for the US  and other governments. They're marketing the capability of its flexible global gig-based  workforce to do basic reconnaissance and gauge public opinion. The company says 90% of its work  is gauging public sentiment and understanding human geography by paying users to fill out surveys.  Small number of projects involve asking users to go out into the world and take pictures or  walk a predetermined route. Sometimes these tasks involve collecting data on nearby  wireless signals or other cell phones. Data, this is from Premise CEO, Maury Blackman,  data gained from our contributors helped inform government policy makers on how to best deal  with vaccine hesitancy, susceptibility to foreign interference and misinformation in elections,  as well as the location and nature of gang activity in Honduras, which is oddly specific.

Transcript:  In a nutshell. This is CAPTCHA as a service.  Yeah, I really resent these Google captures because I know I'm teaching their self-driving  cars how to find crosswalks and buses. It pisses the hell out of me every time I have to do it.  But yeah, this is, I mean, it makes sense. You've got a workforce that's willing for,  you know, a nickel or a dime or a buck to do some basic reconnaissance. They're carrying around the  ultimate reconnaissance tool. These smartphones are, you know, always connected. They've got GPS,

Start time: 5916.82
End time: 5952.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  they've got cameras and microphones. It's perfect. There was one fascinating thing I found in that  article, which is that they said in some cases, the tasks that they were assigning to people were  the task itself was irrelevant. They mainly wanted them to move around and map the existence of  the strength of cell tower signals, for example, or Wi-Fi or something like that. So just go and  find bodegas. And they would just-

In fact,  Premis apparently submitted a pitch to the British government last summer saying,  we can capture more than a hundred types of metadata from our contributors' phones  and provide them to paying customers, including location, type, battery level, and installed apps.

Transcript:  So, I mean, I brought up AI earlier and obviously these clients are not  nominally AI, but they're clearly using machine learning to crunch all this data.  And it makes me think about, you know, there are a lot of people wondering what happens when all of  our jobs have become irrelevant because AI can do it better and creates more free time for all of us  in the process. Well, this will be something that AI always needs is data, sending people out into the world.

Transcript:  So, Byron Tau at the Wall Street Journal. Kudos for that great story.  Instagram is changing how it works. Actually, let me take a break and then we'll talk about  that and a lot more. Live audio rooms, aka Clubhouse, and Facebook.  Facebook's introducing Clubhouse just as Clubhouse is going downhill, right?  And did John McAfee really commit suicide? The conspiracy theories have begun.  But first, a word from our sponsor. Was that a good tease? Does that make you want to say?  Yeah, I think so. Our show today brought to you by Podium. It was great. We had a contractor come out  trying to remember what they were working on. And then after they left, we got a text message from  them saying, how was our work? Raid us on Google. And of course I did. Yeah, that was cool. Because  the text message, I open all the text messages. That's what they were using Podium.  One of the good things that has come from this past year has been many of the on-demand options.  You know, Blockbuster movie releases at home, curbside pickup from your favorite restaurant,  visiting your doctor remotely. Your customers, if you're a small business, have grown to expect  a simpler way of doing business no matter what your product is. That's why more than 90,000 local  businesses of all sizes, including my dentist, some of our contractors have turned to Podium.  Whether you have one location or 1,000, Podium can help you stay ahead. See, it turns out  we like to text. People read their text messages. And frankly, I just ask you, if you had a choice  between interacting with somebody via phone or text, wouldn't you prefer text? Well, your  customers would too. Podium makes doing business as easy as sending a text. Because when texts  get opened, business gets done. And it's great. Your employees will love it because they can text  from a single inbox, offering a great experience, a much smoother experience for your customers,  and a lot easier, more responsive way for your employees to stay in touch. If you're answering  questions, you send a text. If you're collecting reviews, you send a text. Schedule an appointment  or delivery, send a text. Payment collection too, yes, they do payments, just send a text.  Car dealerships use Podium to sell more cars by offering text messaging. We know of one dealer  who sold a $50,000 truck by sending four different text messages. That's it. Dealerships are running  profitable service centers with easier appointment scheduling. Reminders, I just did that to a  scheduled appointment on my Ford. It was awesome. Home service providers are responding faster and  winning more jobs than their competition. When a homeowner wants to get in touch, they're not going  to leave a voicemail. Text is easier for them and it lets you get back in touch faster. And by the  way, if a homeowner texts five different businesses, if you're the first to reply, you are way more  likely to get the job. Retailers are increasing revenue by allowing customers to shop via text  message. Even with stores open, we've gotten used to this whole idea of shopping from home.  A jeweler just sold a $5,000 ring and even coordinated curbside pickup with Podium.  Local service professionals keep clients longer and collect payments faster. It's great that they  take payments. There's a dentist in New York City, had a million dollars in overdue collections.  He just sent everyone a text payment request, collected 70%, $700,000 in just two weeks.  Because it's easier. People like using text. Today's customers expect on demand everything,  even from local businesses. This is the time. Stay ahead of the competition with Podium.

Transcript:  John McAfee, it was breaking news. I think on Wednesday, he was held since October in a  jail in Barcelona held for extradition to the United States where he's being charged with tax evasion.  Word came down from a Spanish court that he would be extradited several hours later.  He was dead, found dead in his cell in a prison near Barcelona, 75 years old. He actually was on  the arrested in Barcelona in October as he was on the run from Belizean authorities who wanted to  question him about the murder of his neighbor. Well, his, his, his wife, Janice McAfee, just held  a press conference. She said, John was not suicidal. She somehow blamed United States  authorities for this tragedy. I'm not sure exactly how you may remember when he was arrested in  October, he tweeted, Hey, this is a great jail. I like the people. The food is good. If I ever  commit suicide, no, it's more of an Epstein thing. It wasn't me. That's also led to,

I'm sorry, 19, when was it? 1998, when he  discovered the brain virus and wrote the first antivirus. McAfee became a very dominant  antivirus force was sold to Intel, I think in 2010. He had other businesses that he followed,  including some oddball drug use and cryptocurrency businesses. That's what he's in trouble for is  apparently crypto currency scams and not declaring income for two years.  But he, he also ran for president in the, for the Libertarian Party in 2016 and 2020.

Transcript:  dominant force in your life. He was, you know, when you go through the Wikipedia article about his  various businesses, he was incredibly energetic and creative. He started one of the first instant  messaging platforms PowWow with a company Tribal Voice. He invested in and joined the board of  Zone Labs, makers of Zone Alarm back in the day, prior to its acquisition. At one point in the  2000s, he was investing in and advertising ultralight flights. He called it Aero Trekking.  He started a company called Quorum X, headquartered in Belize in 2010,  aimed to produce herbal antibiotics. He uploaded a parody video called How to uninstall McAfee  antivirus on his YouTube in 2013. In it, he critiques the antivirus software while snorting  white powder and being stripped by scantily clad women. It got 10 million views. In 2013, he  founded Future Tense Central, which aimed to produce a secure computer network device  called the Decentral. He announced a company in 2014 called Cognizant, which in a way,  I think it was ahead of its time. And it was an application for smartphones, which displays  information about the permissions of other installed applications. Did eventually release  an Android version of that. In 2014, he warned people at DEFCON not to use smartphones,  saying apps are used to spy on clueless consumers who don't read privacy agreements.  Yeah, I think that's that wasn't wrong. Anyway, it goes on and on and on.  He clearly had a lot of energy. He was doing cryptocurrencies towards the end and he's being  accused of fleecing investors with his crypto security companies. It's a sad story, I guess.  His fortune was estimated at one point to be worth 100 million.  Towards the end, much, much smaller, as little as 4 million.  So John McAfee dead at 75.

If you are thinking about suicide or you're  worried about a friend or a loved one, there is help out there. People really care. We really  want you around. If you want some emotional support, if you want somebody to talk to,  the Lifeline Network is available 24 7 everywhere in the US. SuicidePreventionLifeline.org or call  800-273-8255. And I'm sure every country where we have listeners offer something similar.  Please take care of yourself. We don't want anything to happen to you.  Frank McCourt, real estate mogul, billionaire. He apparently is going to save the internet.  He's former owner of the Los Angeles Dodgers. He says, I'm going to spend $100 million to rebuild  social media. The effort he's called Project Liberty centers on the construction of a publicly  accessible database of people's social connections, allowing users to move records of their  relationships between social media services. I don't know what the technical underpinnings are,  but $100 million is enough money probably to get some people working on this. It would use the  blockchain to construct a new internet. This is from Bloomberg, a new internet infrastructure  called the Decentralized Social Networking Protocol, DSNP. The guy he's hired to build it,  I don't know, his name is Braxton Woodham, co-founder of the meal delivery service,  Sun Basket, former CTO at Fandango. Apparently Woodham had been thinking about something like  this. This sounds like a TV show. Maybe Netflix is going to give him a billion dollars for the  $100 million he's going to spend. Doesn't it? Sounds like startup.

Transcript:  The only thing I like about this idea is they're going to have a public version of this,  like a demonstration app or something, but they're not really trying to be like,  we're going to create another Facebook differently. They're creating the underpinnings  for their newer social networks to build off of. That might actually stand a chance because this  was just a, all we've seen so far, it's like, oh, Twitter stinks, let's do Parler. Everybody's  trying to create just an alternate version of something that already exists and those almost  never work. But this is a little bit different. I kind of do like the, let's go under the,  create the underpinnings for a new system of social apps. I think if we could reset the  internet right now, we would all do it way differently. We'd start charging people for  information. So I've just given away for all for free for once. Right. So this may be a way to do  that. I still think it's a massive uphill to climb, but I like it is different. At least

Transcript:  the idea is use blockchain for two reasons. One to make your social graph portable so you can move  it around. But he also says blockchain would discourage bad behavior because people would  be tied to their posts forever. I don't know if that's a good idea. That's the way it should be,  but maybe it is. Maybe if you knew that what you wrote on Twitter was going to live

I know like some countries do control this and there's always been this attempt of like,  when it's tied, not always, but when it's tied to your public real name, right. And a history  that does result in accountability. There's this whole thing, right. That the way people behave on  the internet is very differently than how people would behave in person. Not always the case,  especially in the United States. If people do still bad behavior on Facebook, but there's at least  beastly, you know, just having a random name or something like that and no accountability.

Start time: 7343.74
End time: 7369.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is the government. The public schools are. Historically, it's always, and I come from an  era where the schools would tell you how long your hemline could be, what t-shirts you could wear,  you should cut your hair, and it's always bugged the hell out of me. But still, that's attending  school. This wasn't even during school hours on school property. Correct. So the school was  reaching out to say to this teenager, we control every aspect of your personal life.

Start time: 7370.56
End time: 7464.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. And I know you have school-age kids, Leo. I don't know about Dan and Ed and lots of folks  listening, but I've been noticing more and more that schools attempt to get parents and kids,  even that don't get me started, they try and get kids to sign documents, which I always think is  hilarious because, of course, anything a child under the age of 18 signs is not legally valid  as a contract or anything else. But be that as it may, they think it sends a message if you have  a child sign off on something that they've read and acknowledged it. But they have parents, which  is more critical, also agree that these are the policies that will govern their children. And those  off-campus policies are starting to get a little concerning where the school will let you know,  hey, we reserve the right if your kid is misbehaving in a way that we find troublesome,  that we can discipline that child even when they're not on campus. So this case was sort of a test  of that and how much authority they actually have. And it's not that they have no authority. If the  court was clear that there could be situations where there's a substantial interest in regulating  the conduct, for example, severe bullying, threats aimed at teachers or students,  participation in online school activities, or hacking into school computers.

Transcript:  I just want to say my only concern with this decision was it was kind of an easy decision.  Like when we look at what she said, being the context out of school, to me, it was like cut  and dry. This wasn't an issue. The question is, and you know, Denise, you were just talking about  this idea of like kind of regulating behavior. What if it was racist behavior?  I feel like people on the left then would have come from the other angle because what happens  if the school want to do some kind of punitive action against the student for maybe saying,  going on a racial tirade on one of these social networks, what would that be like?  This case is really easy to decide. But yeah, go ahead.

Start time: 7552.68
End time: 7579.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think in the wake of this decision, there's at least guidance on that. I think that what you  would see is courts deciding, well, it's unpopular speech, but if it's not directly threatening or  there might be some protection there. But it would depend on the exact statement and whether  it could be construed as bullying or a threat or some sort of thing.

Several cheerleaders and other  students approached the cheerleading coaches, visibly upset about her post. It's really  interesting. You raised an interesting question, Daniel.

When I was in junior high school, I was suspended for publishing an underground newspaper.  Really? And it was the ACLU that took my case to the school board. It didn't have to go to court.  They took it to the school board and the school board reinstated me. And they said he could  hand out his newspapers in the lunchroom. He just can't go into classrooms and do it.

And it kicked off a whole dress code fight in our school.  And the ACLU came in and we were going to sue them, but they backed down. So yeah,  they're a good organization. And you learn a lot in high school about them.

A bad week for Bitcoin. China is now shutting down over 90% of its Bitcoin mining  capacity, which has led to a drop in the speed with which Bitcoin hashes are calculated,  slowing down the transaction rate. Bitcoin maybe coincidentally also went down in value.  And then there was the South African Bitcoin... Oh, the brothers?  Brothers, yeah, who disappeared with a significant amount of Bitcoin, probably the biggest since  Mount Gox disappearance of Bitcoin. They were creating a Bitcoin investment fund and claimed  they had been hacked for $3.6 billion, then disappeared. Probably was hacked. They were  probably hacked. Yeah. I do not understand.

I know I saw that Andresen Horowitz  now they're on their third cryptocurrency fund. Huge fund. They're up to billions of dollars that  they're investing in cryptocurrency infrastructure and brokers and traders and stuff. This just seems  to me like beanie babies where you don't even get a beanie baby. You don't even get a beanie baby.

I think something's happening,  but I don't understand how it's... Even major government banks, including the Federal Reserve,  some sort of stable coin might well be in the future for governments. There's a lot to be...  Really, these days, your dollar bill is as digital as anything. I don't have cash for anything I own.  It's all bits being in ledgers. Decentralized ledgers is the only way.

Transcript:  The problem with crypto is it's very complicated. Most of us are involved in tech, and it's like,  as soon as you start going into crypto, it becomes very, very complicated, not just economics,  but in terms of how it works, how to back it up, the ledgers and the keys.  Then that's just dealing with, say, Bitcoin. We all understand and go, okay, there's this thing,  Bitcoin. But then when you learn there's 150 other cryptocurrencies out there, even more,  you can just create them yourself. It becomes very weird. What is that?  It's one thing to say, here's the US dollar. Here's an alternative to the US dollar.  What does it mean when there's 200 other alternatives all of a sudden? Which one  means anything? I think that basically puts us another way. I don't think Apple would ever  invent this. It's too opaque for the masses to really get involved with.

Transcript:  It's also risky. Look at these guys who just made off with 69,000 Bitcoin or Mount Gox,  where people lost a lot of money. Now the UK financial watchdog has banned Binance,  saying they're violating some sort of UK finance rules. That's one of the big Bitcoin exchanges.  Binance Markets Limited is not permitted to undertake any regulated activity in the UK  as of yesterday. That's probably the biggest problem.

Transcript:  I read that article and it was unclear on whether that meant they couldn't continue to let people  buy and sell or whether it was more of a securities-oriented...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know either. I do know that the SEC, to the extent they've weighted in in the United States,  has looked at ICOs and things like that and treated them as securities falling within  securities laws and wanting to curtail fraud and things around that. But that's different than

Start time: 8122.94

Transcript:  saying you can't buy and sell. And to be clear, it was Binance Markets  Limited and that's not the same as Binance.com. In fact, Binance says,  BML is a separate legal entity. It does not offer any products or services via the Binance.com website.  So Binance.com continues. And still, it's got to make you a little nervous if you're using Binance

I don't know about you guys, but I've found it even more difficult to get out of the house and  sort of put yourself together in a way that bears public scrutiny after the pandemic. Some of us have  lost those skills entirely. So to assist you with that and also to assist the planet, I started a  little business called Fits with Fits, which is using sustainable pre-loved clothing that is  pre-styled for you. So you can turn yourself out. Hopefully Leo and others have told me over the  years they like the way I put things together. So I'm putting things together for you. So if you go  to fitswithfits.com, you can possibly pick up something for yourself or a gift for someone  else. I've tried very hard to make things pretty size neutral so that you can buy one of these sets.

But they're all doing well. Actually Dell, Lenovo also make incredible  machines, and now Razer is involved with non-computer. So it's a great place to get  non-gaming laptops.

They would load more crap on their computers than  anybody. But I think when they spun off HP, HPE, whatever they call it,  suddenly they got more focused on the PC side, and it's really good.

Next Sunday is the  4th of July. I hear that in the United States, that's a big holiday. We don't want our people  to work on the 4th of July. So we're going to do Twitter on Saturday instead on July 3rd.  So if you like to watch live little programming notes same time, which is 2130 UTC. That's 230  PM Pacific, 530 Eastern. So next time it'll be Saturday from then on Sunday at that time.  You can watch us live at twit.tv slash live. There's live audio and video feeds. If you're  doing that chat at irc.twit.tv. Those are all the people watching live or if you're a member  of Club Twit in our Club Twit Discord. After the fact on demand versions of this show and every show  we do available in a variety of places. Of course, every show has a YouTube channel.  But on the website, twit.tv, you'll find a link to that YouTube channel.  You'll also find the links you can use to subscribe in a podcast player, including just  the plain old RSS feed. That's probably the best way to get it. That way you get it automatically.  And if your podcast player offers a review section, please leave us a five star review.  Spread the word. Let others know about this week in tech. We've been around a long time,  but believe it or not, there's still some people have never heard of Twit. Don't forget,  we are going on an Alaska cruise in 2022. If you'd like to join us in July, a Twit cruise  is going to be a lot of fun. Some great people are coming along. Find out more at  cruise.twit.tv. We figured July 2022 things should have settled down a little bit.  Got to go up and see the salmon and the grizzly bears and have a great time. The glaciers.  Cruise.twit.tv. I look forward to it. Lisa and I will be on that cruise. I think we're getting  close to the number of signups. I think it's close to 60, which means we can add another host.  We're going to see which we can. Steve Gibson, he says, Laurie won't let me go on cruises,  but maybe we can talk him into it. Anyway, we'll let you know when we invite additional hosts.  That's about it for the show. Thank you everybody for being here. We'll see you next week. Remember,  Saturday, July 3rd for the live show. Another Twit is in the can.
