Transcript:  for the first time in months. Yeah, yeah, definitely. Is it quiet? It is very quiet.  We've been away since March. Been working at home since then. It is really, I like working at home  normally. I don't like working at home under these conditions. But it's really good to be back. And  it's pretty empty here because everybody is working from home. We've been our copy editors

Start time: 220.20
End time: 247.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and folks who lay out the print edition. What we do as bloggers and as podcasters can be done  at home, but I always think of a newspaper as a big room with people yelling and running around  and banging on typewriters. And then of course, in fact, Jeff Jarvis tells a story of he was there  to computerize. I think it was the Examiner because they had still had typewriters and they brought  in whatever the first computer system was. But even then you couldn't go home and do it. You had

Start time: 261.34
End time: 285.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, we have our we use a content management system called CCI. It's based out of Europe for  print. And then we have our own proprietary software for doing web stuff. And so everything  is just done kind of in this one thing. You can do it from anywhere. It helps to be able to  collaborate. But even like I said, even the people who do page layout are able to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's one of the things that's really changed. And this quarantine would be a very different  experience. But so many businesses that traditionally have to be performed on site

End time: 308.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like a newspaper, not anymore. Right. And one of the things about the Houston Chronicle is we have  been through enough hurricanes that we know how to kind of do this. And so it's just like

Start time: 309.20
End time: 324.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a permanent ongoing hurricane. Yeah, we were a little better prepared because of the fires  in Sonoma County last couple of years. Right. Right. Right. Mike Elgin is also here. He's grounded  for the time being our gastronomad stuck at home. At least you kept the chef with you.

Start time: 325.60
End time: 337.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely. And yeah, my wife has been cooking up a storm and and it's been actually great.  So we've been in order to keep keep myself from gaining weight. We've been doing massive hiking.

Start time: 338.62
End time: 345.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So lots of eating and lots of hiking. So you had gastronomad experiences planned at gastronomad.net.

Start time: 346.54
End time: 368.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. Are they just all called off or? We postponed two or three of them. So Provence has now been  booted to next year. The one that was already scheduled for next year is still on. So we're  going to do two Provence experiences next year. We're still shooting for a couple of European  experiences this year, later in the year. And, you know, they're opening Italy on June 1st.

Start time: 369.30
End time: 378.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so that doesn't sound like a great idea, to be honest with you. But OK,  I'm not sure. Well, I'd rush en masse to Italy right now.

Start time: 379.50
End time: 416.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the place where we do the experience is actually a farmhouse on a mountain. The  nearest neighbor is about a half a mile away. And the second nearest neighbor is like three  miles away. And then we go to people's homes. So we go to instead of going to a winery in a  tasting room, we'll go to the winemakers house and do tasting at her house and that sort of thing.  So we are it's a most of our some of our experiences, especially the European ones,  Provence and Italy, they're already kind of socially distancing oriented already. So I  think we can I think we can do it. Plus, people are dying to travel. So I think I think it'll

Transcript:  happen. You know, I know you won't do it if it's not safe, but it sounds like this possibly.  I do fantasize about like moving my quarantine, just picking it up and putting it somewhere.  So maybe that's that's the that's what you offer an alternative space to quarantine.  Exactly. Exactly. Also joining us Brianna.  So now we're gonna have to change your lower third. Yeah, I guess we are. I got a depressing  email from you last week. You've decided to call off your campaign. I did. You know, I'm

End time: 508.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  running against an incumbent and it's just not possible to beat someone that's been there for as  long as Stephen Lynch has been there. If you can't if you can't knock on doors, if you can't hold  events, if you can't give speeches. One of the things with digital is you're essentially talking  to people that already support you if you're holding digital events. So I just didn't feel good  about, you know, using my, you know, my supporters money to support something that I didn't feel I  had a mathematical chance of winning. So it was the hardest thing I've ever done. It's hard throwing  away three years of work because we had all the other pieces of the campaign in place. We had a  killer field team. But, you know, it's just this this coronavirus, I could not ethically put my  team in a position where they were risking their lives. Yeah, rightly so. I understand. It's, you

Transcript:  know, we got a challenge in general, because we've got a big election coming up in November, and it's  going to be Yeah, what happened to the primaries? Are they all just canceled? Or? Pretty much? Yeah.  We were like in the middle of this gung ho primary season. They just flatlined. Just over pause.

Start time: 529.04
End time: 532.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's kind of a relief, isn't it? I mean, how many more debates can we I know,

Start time: 533.30
End time: 571.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know, I'm all debated out. Yeah. Could it could actually stopped about five debates earlier?  Maybe. Okay. The tech industry does not slow down. I thought when we you know, we started sheltering  in place two months ago. Oh, boy, you know, I don't know what it's gonna look like in two months,  there'll be no stories. But you know what the tech industry seems to be going gung ho. For instance,  this week, Facebook announced it's buying. Is it Giphy? Giphy? I still don't know for Giphy. Giphy.  It's Giphy. I'm calling it Giphy. Do you mind if I call it Giphy? Giphy. Giphy. Giphy. Giphy.

Start time: 572.32
End time: 593.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds like we're all having seizures. I think Giphy would call it Giphy. Because because Giphy  actually ran a series of I don't know, promotions or something a while ago, where they basically  said it's the it's the gift that keeps on giving. They were doing puns like that, which indicated  that they use a hard G. But that's just one day at a point. I don't think this will ever be resolved.

Start time: 594.10
End time: 600.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In the meantime, if you're going to spell your company name G I P H Y, you're asking to be called

Start time: 601.10
End time: 607.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Giphy. Yes. Yes. Wouldn't you wouldn't you spell it J I F F Y? No, because that's no, no, it's a pun.

Start time: 608.00
End time: 658.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a play on a GIF. But it's a GIF. Oh, I don't know. Anyway, so you think the company calls it  Giphy? I do. That's such a terrible name. I'm glad I'm glad they got sold. Now, now they call it  Facebook. Yeah, so it's interesting because does Giphy have any way of monetizing? I mean,  they're everywhere. They're on Twitter. They're on Slack. They're of course on Facebook, about half  the traffic, according to Axios, for Giphy comes from people using Facebook, searching for animated  gifts, and then using Giphy to put them into their messages. That's the primary use for it.  I suppose they might make a little money selling special gifts when the next Star Wars comes out,  something like that. But it really is there's no ads in Giphy. Is there? I think there are.

Start time: 659.60
End time: 662.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you go to the site, I think there are on the site. But no,

Start time: 662.50
End time: 666.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  oh, yeah, on the site when you create it creates the content. I mean,

Start time: 666.78
End time: 699.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's 90% of I guess 99% of the users are just doing in the keyboard. Yeah. And you know,  even Apple's messages, you type, you know, you search for GIFs and that's gifts.  That's what you're going to get. So that's where you're going to jet. So but that but and by the  way, very popular. They said that they have 300 million daily active users. So it's a it's a lot  of people use it, they must have huge expenses. Why then is it worth get ready $400 million

Start time: 701.96
End time: 743.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to Facebook? Well, here's one. Here's one thing to consider when you are sharing GIFs and or GIFs  on Twitter on Tumblr on anywhere, you will now be sharing a little bit of a little piece of Facebook,  a little bit of you going, yeah, going everywhere. It's kind of like it's kind of like Facebook  getting their claws into all the other social networks. Because if you know, most most of the  GIFs shared these days are shared on messaging platform, they're shared on Facebook or its  competitors. Right? Yeah. So it's kind of a it's kind of a I don't know what exactly how they're  going to monetize it from a dollar and cents point of view, but it is a power play. It basically point

Start time: 744.08
End time: 773.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  makes Facebook really ubiquitous. I think it also tells you how valuable data is.  That really is you don't need to monetize because what you're getting is now you know what Twitter  users are doing what Apple messages users are doing what slack users are doing. You have all  sorts of additional information. I don't know how much the GIFy keyboard gives Facebook when you use  it, but I'm going to guess it gives you them more than just what GIF you searched for.

Start time: 775.18
End time: 786.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And also, you know, they were they actually came in under their about their latest valuation. They  just did a rap funding round that valued them at 600 million. Wow. So Facebook actually got a bargain.

Start time: 787.26
End time: 793.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A bargain. Half a billion dollars bargain. It also comes I mean, but look at it this way. It's it's

Start time: 793.58
End time: 809.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I definitely agree privacy and data has got to be part of it. But it's also it's just a feature. I  mean, whenever I'm forced to use Facebook, you know, this is a method of communication that it's  it's a great way to leave a fun comment or sarcastic. Oh, I love it. And I think everybody

Start time: 809.50
End time: 825.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  loves it. In fact, it's the it's the bane of slack. I actually had to yell at my team and say,  stop putting animated GIFs in the freaking general channel. I can't keep track of what's going on.  We have a channel just for it. You have to have a channel just for the humorous fun.

Start time: 826.18
End time: 849.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely. No, but I mean, this way they can, you know, they can go through they can  put their moderation policies in place, make sure there's not stuff coming up that's  inappropriate for different channels. So I think in addition to the data, it's just,  it's a it's a feature. It's like when Apple tried to buy Dropbox, it's just  something as part of it. Facebook can certainly drop this money. It's a no brainer really.

Start time: 850.10
End time: 901.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I don't know, I'm just trying to make it be scary and spooky. That's going to be  part of it's going to be part of Instagram. And it's a quarter of all traffic to GIF he goes  through Instagram. So it's very popular. But it's not a unique feature. And I don't I doubt that  here's how you'll know. If if Facebook says, Oh, no, it's unique, we only we own it. You can  only use it on Facebook and Instagram and WhatsApp. Then you're right, Brianna, it's a feature that's  so valuable, they're willing to spend $400 million because people love it. And they're taking it away  from Twitter and Slack and Apple and everybody else. But my guess is they won't my guess is  they'll make it even more available to more people that cost them money. That's a lot of data. That's  a lot of servers. But it's it's also inbound data. And I wonder, it's kind of hard to figure out. But  how much what do they get location information? Do they get what do they get if you're well,

Start time: 902.14
End time: 930.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  here's one thing they get. So one thing to consider is the fact that one quarter of GIF he's traffic.  You can't say it without being self conscious. I know I hate this. I hate it. rename it. One  quarter. One quarter of the usage of their service is actually on Instagram. So in by buying it,  Facebook is making sure nobody else buys it. So Instagram is currently heavily reliant on on this  service. And so they figure, well, let's just own it so that we don't have problems. I bet it's used

Start time: 930.98
End time: 945.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  on snap, which is, you know, Facebook and Instagram are there arch rival. There are other there's  another service. But I mean, GIF is the main service that does this, right? Yeah, yeah.

Start time: 946.08
End time: 983.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mike, that's such a good point, too. Because the thing is, I would I'm not a fair use lawyer. But  imagine if someone else bought this and cut off Facebook and Instagram's access to it.  They couldn't really go through and pull up all those movies and stuff as a giant company to  recreate this data set very easily, because it's it's user generated content. So I would imagine,  I mean, it's not like Apple Maps, where, you know, they can go create their own thing. I think it's  uniquely valuable in that way. According to the media post from the GIFI company, their API will

Start time: 983.90
End time: 1146.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  not go away. GIFs, GIF stickers, emojis aren't going anywhere. We'll continue to make GIFI  openly available to the wider ecosystem. So I mean, of course, you know, the acquisitions,  people always say stuff like that. But, you know, I'm going to guess this is valuable to Facebook  over and above the value that of simply putting funny dancing bears in your messages.  It's it is, it seems to me often the case in technology that the silliest stuff is actually  the most nefarious, you know, the dark patterns show up as dancing bears, more often than not.  Maybe that's just me looking for a story. I don't know. Facebook is launching a in fact,  maybe Brianna, you were talking about creating a I think this you absolutely should I want you to  encourage you to do this. So maybe a political action committee on tech issues, since that's  your expertise. Facebook is setting up what the Washington Post calls a dark money group,  advocacy group in Washington called American Edge. Maybe they call it dark money, because as you know,  Washington Post's motto is democracy dies in darkness. It's a nonprofit. It's the setup  allows it to navigate a thicket of tax laws in such a way it can raise money and blitz the air  wave with ads without the obligation of and this is why it's dark money disclosing its donors.  The NRA does the same thing. As an example, American Edge has a good name. It's like,  let's keep our edge. Let's keep innovation. And it comes at a perfect time because now and I  read this story and I thought, well, that's the Washington Post, Rupert Murdoch's journal  going after Google, but the Post had a big article that the US government is getting ready to sue  Google. Justice Department State Attorneys General likely to bring antitrust lawsuits against Google  focused on the ad business. There's no love lost between the Wall Street Journal and Google. We  know that. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and some other attorneys general are likely to file  a case probably in the fall. People familiar with the matter said focused on Google's online ad  business. It's funny because we had a little bit hiatus in the anti-tech, you know, the tech lash  because without tech, this quarantine would be a little bit tougher for everybody. But now it's  coming back or maybe it's just the Wall Street Journal trying to gin up some anti-tech sentiment.

Start time: 1146.26
End time: 1177.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the New York Times also had a headed zone separate. Did they? Okay. Yeah, it's typical.  Ken Paxton, who's the Texas Attorney General, who by the way is remains under indictment,  is a, it jumps into a lot of these. He was early on in the state attorneys general lawsuit to try  to block the T-Mobile Sprint merger. And he settled with them relatively early. He kind of pulled out  of it after a while. It'd be interesting to see, you know, if there's something that Google do for

Start time: 1177.96
End time: 1203.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Texas or for him have hit settling quickly. Wall Street Journal says that Attorney General  William Barr has devoted considerable resources to the Google probe, continues to treat it as a  top priority. They have a quote from him that says the Justice Department will make a final call this  summer. I'm hoping that we bring it to fruition early summer, Mr. Barr said. And by fruition,

Start time: 1203.84
End time: 1209.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean decision time. Well, does anybody worry that this is just purely political?

Start time: 1211.12
End time: 1215.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh yeah. You saw the tweet yesterday from the president?

Start time: 1215.98
End time: 1236.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The most chilling tweet ever from the, from, from president Trump. He said that he said that yes,  the Facebook, Twitter, et cetera are run by far left people and we're going to do something about  it. I'm paraphrasing. And so that is not good for the president to be saying that.

Start time: 1237.98
End time: 1251.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I, I've long ago blocked his account. So let me see if I can find it. But yeah, it was a scary,  a scary thing because it sounded like he was saying we're going after them

Start time: 1252.38
End time: 1313.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because they're propaganda for the left. Well, I think that's what's so frustrating about this,  right? Because I think all of us would agree. We want regulatory oversight of Google's ad  business. It's a fact that they've paid some of the largest fines in history in Europe. It's a  fact that they've moved into anti-competitive behavior on many occasions. And even with Facebook,  it doesn't surprise me that they are putting out something to formally advocate for themselves and  to push Congress the way that they would want Congress to move. It's just so frustrating because  we need that kind of oversight from the justice department. But because you have a president  that's talking about it in such partisan terms, it really politicizes the justice department and it  becomes not about protecting people from what's effectively an advertising duopoly. It becomes  just another partisan screaming match. And that's what's so disappointing about it.

Start time: 1314.02
End time: 1331.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Cause I mean, I think we'd all agree that some, it's a conversation that has to happen. I  mean, tech has gotten very big and there's some serious and legitimate concerns. It's not that  we're saying, oh no, it's wonderful and it's perfect. But why did you find it chilling, Michael?

Start time: 1332.96
End time: 1427.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he basically said that first of all, he characterized the owners, like he's hearing  on the individual people who own the services and saying that their politics is far left.  And indicated that he's going to do something about it. So that's a lot of posturing. He's  doing a lot of posturing lately, but essentially, in political science, a conservative Republican  is in favor of minimizing government meddling with businesses. In a fascist dictatorship,  the dictator is interested in using the government to go after the people who own  sources of content that disagree with his politics. That's the difference between a  conservative and a fascist. That's one of the differences. And so his statement, his tweet  taken just by itself is the statement of a fascist dictator. Now this may appeal to part of his base  and he may just have been in meetings where they're talking about, they're going to have  antitrust effort against some of the tech companies. And then he was responding to  Michelle Malkin, I believe it was, who was talking about the leftist leanings of social media  owners. And he was replying to that and saying, yeah, we're going to do something about that.  So who knows? You can't trust anything. This guy tweets, obviously. But taken on its face,  it was just a horrifying thing to say for a president.

Start time: 1428.76
End time: 1479.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  — But so much of what he says is bluster and so much of what he says is posturing and playing to  a base. You don't know if any of that would ever come to fruition. I agree with you that it's kind  of a horrifying statement on its face until you look at who's actually saying it and how often he  says things like that that don't amount to much other than to rile his base. Every time there have  been serious hearings on tech issues, a lot of the Republicans try to hijack them with discussions  of unfairness on social media. And it's just that, it's a hijack. It's not a real issue.  And but it's something that they could use to get the base going. And they've got a base to get

Transcript:  to the polls in November. — But Dwight, I'd love to add on to that.  This stuff is, it's not just bluster. There was another story that came out this week that Google  nuked their inclusion and diversity programs because they were afraid of these exact kind of  characterizations from the conservative movement in this country. — Isn't that a shame? To say,

Transcript:  of the people at Google. They've done the unconscious bias training. It's excellent. It's  really good stuff. For me, it's stuff that made me consider some of my actions because people don't  know this. Women have the exact, it's just a 2% difference in unconscious bias against other women  as men do. So this stuff, it's not just bluster. It's work in the refs. It's a reframed

Transcript:  — So just to be very specific about this tweet we've been talking about, specifically,  he wrote, the radical left is in total command and control of Facebook, Instagram, Twitter,  and Google. The administration is working to remedy this illegal situation. Stay tuned, etc.  So he's saying that for people to be in charge of Facebook, whose politics are leftist,  is illegal. That's what he asserted. It's illegal to be left-leaning and own a company like Facebook,  Instagram, Twitter, or Google. — Where did he announce it? On Twitter.

Transcript:  they would block if anybody else said it because it's scientifically unfactual about the COVID  virus. But he is the president, and so I understand their point of view there that,  well, he's the president, so you've got to let him tweet. It's ironic.

Transcript:  — Well, they should do to him what Facebook has done to me. So for many, many years,  while I was still using Facebook and Instagram, I was a harsh critic of Facebook. And I ended up,  no doubt, on some list that basically said, none of my stuff is going to be widely distributed or  can go viral. So my Facebook posts, my Instagram posts, just everything lands with a thud because  I am part of this. They had this whole group that was there to prevent fake news and terrorist  content and all this other objectionable stuff from going viral at all. And so they lumped into  that sort of anti-Facebook people. And so that's what they should do to Trump. They should sort of  let him say whatever he wants to say. It goes to the people who follow him. But don't let it be

Transcript:  — Yeah, but this is where, historically, we're challenged by a leader like Trump. The press is  also challenged because none of the norms that we have— I mean, the norm would be, no, no, he's the  president of the United States. He should be able to speak to the people of the United States.  That norm, you would be violating that with a shadow ban. It's why this is so challenging  for the press. It's why it's so challenging for Jack Dorsey at Twitter. What do you do?

Transcript:  — Well, it's worse than that because Trump is actually not all that effective  if you look at the performance and engagement of his tweets on Twitter. What happens is—  — Oh, really? — Yes. All the media picks up his tweets,  and that's where it's amplified. It's amplified by the press. That's why we're always hearing  about Trump's tweets. It's not on Twitter. — That's a good point. I don't follow him

Transcript:  because it's too upsetting. — I think that's a really good lesson.  I'm going to say this, and I'm exactly as guilty of it as many other people are, but there's a  certain tendency with Democrats that when someone on the right wing says something that's  snarkable, something you can easily make fun of, you dunk on it, you quote-tweet it for easy  engagement. I don't want this to be a political show, but for some figures on the right, Ben  Shapiro, they really depend on that kind of outrage and snark response to amplify it and  help build their career. I find that I try to be very judicious about which of Trump's temper  tantrums that I amplify because in a way you're helping him win. It's so difficult. Richard  Stangel is a former—he used to work in the State Department with John Kerry. He wrote a fantastic  book called Information Warfare. He talks about, like for many journalists, you go and you want to  be an information idealist. You want to believe that the best information out there, it wins,  give people the best arguments, let them make their own decisions. But the truth is in information  warfare, we kind of have to be information realists and realize the effects of these things a lot more.

Transcript:  I just think it's a no-win scenario. Facebook is trying to self-regulate. They've created a  oh, you already laughed. They've created a new board. They've revealed the first 20 members of  the new review board. Those 20 will then nominate another 20 for a total of 40. I think everybody  would agree a good bunch, a diverse bunch, global, distinguished activists as well as scholars.  They are going to try to help Facebook solve the content problems, which is a pretty insurmountable  problem. Hate speech, harassment, protecting safety and privacy. They say the board in an op-ed in  the New York Times said, we will make final and binding decisions on whether specific content  should be allowed or removed from Facebook and Instagram. On the other hand, wired in its piece,  this is Siva Vaidyanathan, who I love. He wrote, Facebook and the folly of self-regulation.  He took issue. He said, only in the narrowest and most trivial of ways does this board have any such  power. It will have no influence over anything that really matters in the world. It will hear  only individual appeals about specific content that the company has removed from the surface,  already removed, and only a fraction of those appeals. It can't say anything about the toxic  content that Facebook allows and promotes on the site. It will have no authority over advertising  or the massive surveillance that Facebook uses to make its ads so valuable. It won't curb  disinformation campaigns or dangerous conspiracies and on and on and on. It's an interesting idea.  I commend Facebook for doing it, but it's hard for any group of 40 people to influence what happens  with a two and a half billion user service. Let me throw ice water on your enthusiasm for this.

Transcript:  Sorry, Dwight. Just very quickly. Essentially, Facebook has put another football up for the  press to kick. We're like, okay, this time she's not going to pull it away. What they're setting  up here is, like he said, there's no power there. It's an advisory position. They're trying to make  this committee as illustrious and as respected and balanced as possible. They succeeded at that.  So then they'll just go ahead and remove what they want to remove and not remove what they  don't want to remove. And on those cases where they remove controversial stuff that they want  to remove, that is also proved by the committee. They can say, well, they said, they said, and then  when they don't remove stuff that the committee advises them to do, they said, well, we have a  business to run. We have our own reasons, et cetera, et cetera. So it's just a fig leaf to  get the press off their backs, which is basically their only goal here.

Transcript:  It's also very, very narrow. They're looking at individual cases. There's no guarantee that  anything that they do is going to affect overall policy at Facebook. What they're doing is they're  essentially presented with a case. They look at it, rule next. And there's nothing there that  requires Facebook to pay attention to what they're doing in terms of policy.  And it's pretty much Chrome on a car.

Transcript:  I absolutely agree with the pessimism it's dead on. I would say it is a slight movement forward.  And I do like the fact that people outside the company are going to be looking at this very  narrow case of things. I like the fact that Facebook has agreed to independently fund them  for a few years. I think that's a step forward. But is this fundamentally going to change the  way Facebook operates? No, it really strikes me as when Uber got into the trouble with Susan Fowler  and they brought in, wasn't it Eric Holder to look at the culture there? Eric Holder's law firm to  look at it. And they put that in every single press statement. So they were using someone else's  credibility to address a fault that they've had. Maybe that's too cynical a view here,

There's just not enough  zoom. There's not enough zoom to go around. Actually zoom was down this morning for about  three hours in many parts of the country, the Northeast, California, Texas. And it was 9am  Eastern time right when church services hit. And I think there were a lot of churches who were very  unhappy that zoom was down for three hours. We still don't know why that was. Zoom says they're  all back up and running. I bet there are also a few people saying, Oh, thank God. No zoom.  Oh my God, just a little bit. Just give me an hour. No zoom.

We're  doing a lot of cooking and stuff. We're having a lot of fun. It's pretty great. We're in Campbell  in Silicon Valley. So yeah, it's really great. I have a prepared statement about zoom. If you  don't mind, some quick advice and a prediction. So the zoom fatigue is real. Everybody's written  about it. We've all experienced it. It's just awful. There are a whole bunch of reasons for it.  There are psychological reasons having to do with latency and people staring at you. And there's all  kinds of problems with video conferencing that involves lots and lots of people. And so I'm  advising companies in my columns to get away from them as much as possible. And those of us who've  been working from home, I've been working from home, working remotely since 2004. We didn't have  all these video conferencing when we were remote and everybody else was in the office. It's just  now that the managers and the leaders are working from home. Now we have to have video conferencing,  right? Because there's going to be touchy types. So my advice is try to not have the meeting,  do it in an email if you can. If you can't do it in email, do a conference call with audio. And if  that doesn't work, try to keep zoom calls to four people or less because beyond that people go crazy.  But I'm going to make a prediction, which is I think the future of video conferencing,  the thing that will replace it will be avatar based video conferencing where people's Memoji.  I think that Apple will probably announce Memoji on the Mac book platform or the iMac platform.  And people will have their emoji doing their face expressions, moving their mouth,  doing all the things that they would do. But that's going to make it worse.

One of one of my old roommates got, you know, kind of put it together.  There was only about a dozen of us.  It wasn't everybody, but it was it was old friends hadn't seen each other in some cases  in forty three years, in some cases, just a decade or two.  It was wonderful.  And seeing their faces was great.  Although I have to apologize because one guy I go, I don't know who this is.  Who's this guy the whole time?  And then I finally figured out who it is.

It wasn't perfect.  It was it was good.  And then you could walk around it in the round.  As we're sitting here talking today, Magic Leap has basically imploded like the Death Star.  Oh, it's terrible.  It's terrible.  I know so many people laid off because they hired a bunch of game industry people.  But I mean, do you think that in the meeting space, like something like AR, there might be  applications?  Because I mean, in engineering, so much of there's some people that can work like closing  the door and working by themselves all day.  I'm not like that.  I have to talk to my team.  I've got to diagram stuff out.  Do you think that there could be limited applications for AR where you could be with  the team more virtually in a way that felt more real?  Because I think we all agree Oculus is not the answer for that.  It's just too removed from everything.  It feels arcadey.  But I could I could see an opening for HoloLens here.

And I think this is a really interesting conversation is, you know, now that we're all  doing these meetings, where do we go to make them less fatiguing, more productive?  Is there is there some solution in technology?  So this is a great subject.  I love it.  I don't want to cut you off, but let's take just a pause so we can thank a sponsor and  we'll be right back.  What a great panel.  I love it when we get these conversations and they start flowing like this.  And I hate to interrupt it, but I do want to talk about Wasabi, our good friends at Wasabi.  I heard that.  I like them.  They're in Boston.  They're in your neighborhood.  It's David Friend, who I've known for years.  Another Yale.  He was very famous.  He created the ARP synthesizer.  He's got a serial entrepreneur.  He created carbonite.  He has created something that I think is the next step, the next generation in hot cloud  storage.  It's incredible.  It's called Wasabi, aptly named for hot cloud storage.  It's the perfect solution.  For instance, if you're a managed service provider, you're going to love it because  you can make more money and still charge your clients less.  That's because Wasabi is 80% cheaper than Amazon S3.  Significantly.  It's so affordable.  It's actually cheaper than on-prem storage.  In fact, typically you could store that data in Wasabi's cloud for less than just the annual  maintenance fees on the same amount of on-prem storage.  That's how affordable it is.  David was telling me about a Boston high-rise, an office building, where they put in security  cameras all over.  These cameras are pumping out a lot of data all day, every day.  They're buying hard drives.  They're buying more hard drives every week, it seems like.  They're going out and buying more hard drives.  They're going crazy.  He said they moved to Wasabi.  It costs them less.  It's more accessible.  It's better.  It's faster.  It's easier.  I have to say, I think Wasabi is more secure than on-prem storage.  I think it really is.  First of all, they've got an incredible 11 nines of durability.  On average, one file every 649,000 years.  They're hosted in highly secure, fully redundant Tier 4 data centers.  They do regular integrity checking, where every object is checked for integrity every 90 days.  That means one bit is lost.  They've got a copy on the other data center.  They move it over.  You never lose any data.  It's also secure by default.  All data in the Wasabi cloud is encrypted at rest, even if you don't specify it.  It's automatic.  Of course, they follow industry best security models and design practices.  They've got access control mechanisms like bucket policies and ACLs.  My favorite thing, though, I love this.  You can designate some or all of your data immutable.  It cannot be erased.  It cannot be altered.  It cannot be encrypted by ransomware.  It is protected from hackers, from malware, protected from yourself.  It is completely safe.  This is definitely better than on-prem storage.  Because Wasabi has this patented way of writing the data to hard drives,  they are faster than S3.  They are less expensive than S3.  They don't have all the complex storage tiers that S3 has.  There's no fee at all for egress.  That'll bite you a lot with S3 where you say, oh, this is cheap.  And then you start to get your data.  And it's what?  API requests, they use the same API as Amazon S3.  So you already know how to use it.  You have software that can use it, but they don't charge for API requests.  This is a completely disruptive price performance model.  And now there's a new way.  You can pay as you go.  And it's very affordable.  $5.99 per terabyte per month.  That's it, flat fee.  But you can even save more with reserved capacity storage.  If you're that high rising, you know we're going to be eating up petabytes every year.  You can do reserved capacity storage.  You buy the cloud storage kind of ahead of time.  You can do one, three, or five year increments.  Of course, the bigger the amount, the longer the tier, the better the discount.  So you can really bring that price way down.  And there's a lot of situations where you know we're going to need this storage.  We are generating this much data.  So reserved capacity storage is a very good reason to take a look at Wasabi.  You know, it's good to be number two.  You got to try harder.  You got to work harder.  And that's what Wasabi is.  HIPAA compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant, highly secure disruptive technology.  It's turning the industry on its ear.  80% cheaper, up to six times the speed of the industry leader.

There's, you know, it's so affordable that a lot of people are just using it, not businesses,  but it, but it's really intended for businesses.  But I just thought I'd mention that.  All right, let's talk.  Talk.  Because I think this will tie into that future of conferencing.  There's a little battle going on between two Apple rumor mongers Ming-Chi Kuo, who is  in Asia.  So he's the supply chain guy.  He's, you know, I would say Ming-Chi Kuo is maybe 75% accurate.  He's missed on a few things.  He said, Apple will not be shipping augmented reality glasses until 2022.  But there's this new guy, the new sheriff in town, guy named John Prosser, who of late has been  remarkably on.  He, he got the iPhone SE down perfectly.  Kuo said, Apple's glasses will launch 2022 at the earliest.  Prosser says, I can't believe I'm going against Kuo on this one, but I believe he's wrong.  Apple glasses are aimed for March, June, 2021.  Also, I've seen them.  They're sleek as hell.  We'll be showing you soon.  Prosser does not, we should be very clear, does not work for Apple.  He's a, you know, a tech analyst.  He had a YouTube channel for a while, but he's got good sources.  He's been very, very accurate in the last six months.  Now you've been talking, I'm going to let Mike start with this because you've been talking about  this whole idea for a long time.  You were a glass hole.  Yes.

But I do believe in the Apple glasses.  I do believe in the future of augmented reality is I actually think it's probably the thing  that will replace the iPhone in terms of the central device in our lives.  But I do believe that Apple is working on combining multiple devices, including glasses  together into singular experiences.  One of them is what we're talking about, which is holographic meetings where an Apple has  patents for this sort of thing that they described this very scenario where you consider  a conference table or not.  And basically you have people from the waist up, their avatars sitting around.  You can look at them.  They can look at you.

Transcript:  And it wouldn't age.  That's the best part about avatars.  But if you, if you, if you look at it,  Let go of Mike Elgin.  That would be great.  Plug me in.  I'm ready for it.  A little dot on his head.  Yeah, that's right.  But, but if there's a, there's a company called Spatial that is describing this.  They're in the news this week as well, and they're working on this holographic meeting idea  for enterprises.  But Apple's vision would be you have a MacBook Pro in front of you and it's essentially doing  the mapping that, that, that their face ID does on the iPhone mapping you in real time.  Everybody else has got a MacBook Pro in front of them.  They're wearing the Apple glasses.  And so what you essentially see is looking over your, your MacBook Pro.  You see one person there, one person there, another person there, another person there,  and you can turn and talk to them.  They look at you.  You make eye contact with their avatar.  And this is the future of virtual meetings.  This is a brilliant and infinitely doable concept, especially if you avatarize it and  don't try to have, you know, essentially what looks like video.  That, that will come eventually back to this pissing contest between these two analysts.  I think, I think 2022 is more realistic.  It's one thing to predict the arrival of a, of a version of an existing product.  It's another thing to, to predict the arrival of an entirely new platform  from a company like Apple.  Apple's never early on these things.  They sort of tend to hold back and wait until it's already happening.  And then they come in and just take over with a beautiful implementation.  So next year for, for Apple glasses to me feels really farfetched given what's happening  or what isn't happening in the world that they are.  There's no history of Apple doing developer additions.

Start time: 3323.62
End time: 3338.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like, so the Google glass was a developer edition.  They didn't intend and magically did the same thing,  but Apple does not have a history of that.  Typically they keep it quiet.  They, you know, quietly see this to a few select developers and then announce it as a consumer  product.

Start time: 3338.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But, but they're kind of did though, Leo, because if you look at, if you look at the history of  Apple in 3d, so when I first started working with Apple technology in 2011,  Apple's 3d APIs were absolutely non-existent.  They had, they had Sprite kit for games, which is why so many games in the iPhone when it first  came out were 2d.  But if you, if you look at the state of things, they've really been making big investments  into AR and 3d technology.  I believe it was, it was two years ago that they finally went and they supported  eGPUs on any MacBook or iMac or series Mac device.  So you could hook up a VR or AR, a goggle set to it and start learning to work with  Apple technologies.  With, with, with these kinds of devices, it wasn't specifically an Apple product on the  back end.  But if you kind of read the smoke and look at the frameworks that have been announced  year after year after year at the state of the union, they're, they're very clearly moving  in this direction.  And it's, it's really gotten very good.  If you, if you think about what a small sleek Apple device is going to need, it's going to  be less like an Oculus with sensors placed all around the room.  It's going to be closer to the Facebook Oculus, the, the goggle headset that reads it.  Right.  The Quest.

This is actually what I wear as part of my shopping kit these days.  But what if it, I mean, I think you would want Apple to do something stylish that  looked like real spectacles and presumably they, they would have prescription lenses in them.

They were talking about an all hands meeting at which Apple executives discussed a 2022  release for an AR headset and a 2023 release for glasses.  But as you point out Dwight, that was a long, November was a lifetime ago.

Start time: 3538.42
End time: 3683.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's what the information said, which would kind of confirm your thoughts, Brianna.  Apple's headset code named N301 will offer a hybrid of AR and VR capabilities.  It resembles the Oculus Quest, the Facebook virtual reality headset released earlier this year,  with a sleeker, there's that sleek word design.  By the way, as somebody in the chat room pointed out, when you have really good sources  at a company like Apple, it often is the case that Apple is feeding you  stuff that it wants to be kind of put out there.  So the fact that sleek has appeared now twice, it makes me a little suspicious.  Cameras will be mounted on the outside of the device.  Google Glass had a side camera on the temple, right?  The allowing people to see and interact with their physical surroundings.  The Oculus Quest has cameras as well.  In fact, Oculus, Facebook came out with a way that you don't have to hold  a physical device in your hand anymore.  It can see your fingers with the cameras and it can tell what you're doing well enough  that you don't need a device anymore.  That's a huge improvement.  Apple, according to the information, wants to make heavy use of fabrics  and lightweight materials to ensure the device is comfortable to wear  for extended periods of time.  This was all a presentation at the Steve Jobs Theater in October.  Filled the theater, a thousand people for internal though,  intended for people working on this project.  The headset will, so this is a, I would say a well-sourced leak.  The headset will have a high resolution display that will allow users to read small type  and see other people standing in front of and behind virtual objects.  It'll be able to map surfaces.  Apple's working on that, of course, with ARKit and its phones.  Edges and dimensions of rooms with greater accuracy than existing devices on the market,  executives said at the meeting.  They were shown at the meeting a recording of a demonstration  which a virtual coffee machine was placed in a real kitchen table  surrounded by people in a room.  The virtual coffee machine obscured people standing behind it.  This is the ultimate zoom machine.  Apple, now this may be why the year 2021 comes up.  Apple is planning to reach out to third-party software developers  as early as 2021 to encourage them to build apps.  So in order to do that, Brianna, wouldn't they have to have a prototype?

Start time: 3684.46
End time: 3782.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it will be like they did with the iMac Pro and the Mac Pro.  Like you get the Apple ship to a device and it's got wires sticking out of it  and you can't access it or look at it, but you can develop things on it.  I imagine it will be something like that.  I do have to say, though, the one thing that gives me pause about this product  is look at the really big feature on the last iPad Pro that came out.  With the Magic Keyboard shipping, which is a fantastic product,  it works with either the last gen iPad Pro or the one they just unveiled.  The one really big feature with that is the AR capabilities.  If you look in the app store for AR apps and you're like,  okay, what are they shipping that would justify me spending $1,200, $1,300 on a new iPad?  Other than video conferencing, it really feels like most of the AR  applications that they've come up with have been very niche.  It's things like playing Lego games on tabletops or having a virtual tape measure to measure  or shopping at IKEA and drawing furniture in your room.  I'm interested in this technology and I think it certainly has some interesting game applications,  but I do think it's very worthwhile noting that Oculus has not been able to really figure this out.  Apple technology with AR to date and ARKit has not really been able to figure this out.  It seems like a technology in search of a problem, if that makes sense.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by ZipRecruiter.  This is a different kind of ad from ZipRecruiter.  I'm just going to read their message verbatim because I think it's really touching.  During this time of change, we want you to know that ZipRecruiter's focus has not changed.  They're still doing what they've always done, helping people find work  and helping businesses find the right people for their open roles.  If you're looking for a job, ZipRecruiter is working with you to find the right job faster.  They're dedicated to helping you get hired from caretaking to delivering foods and goods to  building medical facilities, supplying protective equipment and so much more.  In fact, ZipRecruiter's app will send you up-to-date job openings  so you can be one of the first to apply.  If you're actively hiring, ZipRecruiter will invite candidates to apply to your most urgent roles,  making it faster and easier to reach the people you need.  By connecting people who need jobs and companies that need people,  ZipRecruiter is working with all of us so we can keep moving forward.  Let's work together.  That's ziprecruiter.com slash work together.  Boy, I just personally couldn't be a better time for a company like ZipRecruiter.  We're very grateful that they're around and that they're part of our family.  ZipRecruiter.com slash work together.  Some of our best employees came to us from ZipRecruiter.  I know with two kids who just graduated from college  and don't have great job prospects, having something like ZipRecruiter  and that both Abby and Henry are going regularly there to find jobs is a really, really huge resource.  The Quest-like device would be 2022,  but then as I said, the glasses would come out the following year.  They're meant to be worn according to Apple's presentation.  They're meant to be worn all day and current prototypes look like high-priced sunglasses  with thick frames that house the battery and chips.  This is the information quoting a person who's seen them.  They've also patented a use of lenses that darken when people are using AR on them  as a way to let you know, oh, this person's not paying attention.  He's looking at something.  And Apple did that.  That would be creepy.

And they stopped.  Right.  And they switched to the phone and then they came back to the iPad.  Right.  So again, if you're looking for an explanation of the discrepancies,  you might think about that behavior with the glasses.

And of course, that's what Apple, really, if I were running Apple,  that's what you're looking for.  What's the next iPhone?  You had such a hit, the company was transformed by the iPhone,  that you've got to be looking for the next thing because it's not going to last forever.

Start time: 3984.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you keep up this growth?  Do you choose to level off and start declining or do you look for another thing that's even bigger  than this cash cow of the iPhone?  And I really think that this is a part of that.  And you can always see where Google's going because they build some of the future technology  into current products.  And I don't think there's been enough attention given to something called the U1 chip,  which is an ultra wideband chip in the iPhone.  They're using it for almost nothing in the iPhone.  You can basically, it will prioritize what you're going to do, the sort of...  Airdrop.  You know, sending people airdrop file transfer, it'll prioritize it based on where you point the  phone.  That's a really trivial use for this really advanced technology.  I really think that chip is going into the glasses and it will be able to identify the  pretty accurate location of things in your environment.  And another thing to point out though is that we always think visually in terms of glasses.  And of course, there will be visual.  The whole point of it is to have a visual frame of reference where you're capturing  information, 3D information with these cameras, and you're also seeing things in your field of  view.  That's the whole point of augmented reality.  But the other part of it is with glasses that you're wearing all day, you have an audio input  that is not earbuds or something in your ears.  It's something that will probably combine bone conduction with little speakers that enable you  to be receiving audio information all day long without discomfort.  And if you look at all the audio based things, moving Apple News to audio, doing all these  different things, they know that audio is the future.  And the best platform for delivering audio all day long without discomfort is a pair of glasses.  And so the way Apple tends to do things is they take super advanced technology and they  roll it out in a very basic way that really, really works right off the bat.  So these Apple glasses at minimum are going to work with their tile system.  Until I find your keys in the living room, you basically see something floating in 3D space.  Those are my keys.  There's my wallet.  They'll have audio input that you can have all day.  Siri will be talking to you whispering in your ear all day.  Also based on contextual information, it'll be able to get information from the environment  with these sensors and then tell you things with Siri's voice that will help you navigate  your day, do walking directions, et cetera.  So the initial concept of the glasses is not going to be some super advanced  HoloLens type of thing.  It's going to be a very basic, very solid practical collection of features that will  basically thrill people and it'll use advanced technologies to do basic things.  And I think that will be very acceptable market.  It's also something they can or could do 2022, 2023.  I think it's completely doable to do something like that.

Transcript:  If you put together all the pieces of the puzzle, it does look like Apple's working  towards something.  The augmented reality in the iPhone, now in the LIDAR and the iPad, the AirBuds or AirPods.  It feels like they're moving in this direction.  You're right.  News plus being audio now.  So it does feel like they're putting this together.  Face ID.  But you brought up the cautionary tale, Brianna, of Magic Leap.  I think everybody here and everybody listening is excited by the notion of this science fiction  thing, these augmented reality glasses.  And clearly Apple is trying to make it happen.  It doesn't guarantee a success.  And Magic Leap is a perfect example.  What happened at Magic Leap, Brianna?

Start time: 4218.20

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just to give listeners or viewers a little bit of background, they had massive, massive  venture capital cash.  It was one of the biggest in the entire history of launching companies.  It was vaporware.  We never saw a product.  Eventually they had this kind of alliance with AT&T and brought this product out.  And long story short, they did not have experiences that sold the product.  So if you went to AT&T and said, I want to look at Magic Leap.  I want to see if this is something worth buying or developing for.  They didn't have anything that made consumers go, I want to go out and buy that.  And Leah, this is what concerns me.  Because when I look at the people I personally know that were laid off from Magic Leap this  week and last week, they're not people without talent.  They are AAA developers, very smart people in UI and animation.  They know how to make good experiences objectively.  And this is what gives me pause.  That if they have all of that money and talent sitting around, granted they don't have the  Apple name, but if they couldn't make an experience that got Magic Leap to the next level,  and Apple doesn't currently have anything in the app store with their AR kit that makes  me go, hey, I want to go buy a new iPad to take advantage of that.  I'm fundamentally asking myself, what are we going to build with this that's going to  get the public to go invest $1,000, $2,000 in a pair of glasses?  Because that's a big ask.

Transcript:  So, you know, a lot, I keep going back to the description that Mike had of this world  where people are avataring everywhere.  And it's, you know, it strikes me, it may exist in the uncanny valley, that it's the  kind of thing that techies think it would be really cool to do that.  But that when you get it, try to put this on the face of everyday people,  that it has to be so intuitive, so simple and so realistic that you don't mind.  And that may be what happened with Magic Leap is that there was too much computer science  in the way of what getting in the way of what they wanted to do.  Apple is better at making things human.  But you still, you know, with some of the things that they do,  you can still smell the computer science.  And I worry that, you know, people like Mike and I and Brianna and you want this,  but that everyday folks, as Brianna said, are not going to want to shell out $1,000 or $2,000  to live like that.

Transcript:  I think if they can get it to do it, it will become the new normal.  I think it will take off.  It's just going to be difficult.  Amy Webb, who's on the show regularly, consulted with Magic Leap.  She had tried the fancy Magic Leap, not the Magic Leap 1, the developer thing they put out.  She's still a believer.  Her thought was the problem is you can't do a venture capital based  company to develop something like this.  It's too long term.  It's too blue sky.  And Apple, well, that's the point.  VC wants to turn around too quickly for this to have ever have worked.  This really is something that should come out of a university.  It should come out of a government, come out of a lab.  It is blue sky R&D.  There are very few companies, IBM, you know, remember Bell Labs,  that will put that kind of money into R&D.  Apple's R&D spending historically used to be very, very low.  Over the last five years, it's gone up and up and up and up and up.  I think Apple's the kind of company that doesn't see this as a short term VC like investment.  I'm sure they see some urgency because they've sold everybody in the world an iPhone.  There's nowhere else to go.  So they need the next thing.  But I also think that they have maybe more patience than the investors in Magic Leap had.  But you're right.  It doesn't mean that they can do it.  It just means that they have perhaps more stamina.  If anybody could do it.

The difference is, though, if you're getting more venture capital than any other company,  especially if you're based in Florida, and you have to say,  okay, we're going to take this new technology that we're developing  and we're going to revolutionize science.  It's going to be used by astronauts.  We're going to recreate the world.  You have to do that to justify the massive amounts of capital.  You have to make a big play.  Apple has to make a small play.  If you look at the role of AirBuds in our lives,  we all used a Sony Walkman back in the day, except maybe Brianna.  And back in the day, when you put something over your ears.

So now how do people use their AirBuds?  They're controlling the audio.  They're getting notifications.  They're interacting with Siri.  They're playing music.  They're doing calls.  They're doing all kinds of stuff.  Essentially, it's a way that enhances the phone, mostly.  It takes all the stuff in your phone and it makes it much better.  And I think that's what these glasses are going to do.  It's going to do for the phone what the AirPods did for the phone,  which is just give you another sense, another physical human sense,  to interact with your phone and its content better.  You'll be able to control things in space.  Instead of double tapping on your earbuds, you can swipe with an in-the-air gesture, for example.  You'll get notifications when you hear the bleep-bleep.  You can just see it.  Oh, so-and-so is, you know, iMessaging me right now.  That's better than pulling your phone out of your pocket.  All of these things are not life-changing revolutions.  They are little things that feel really good.  That's what Apple is going to do with these glasses, I think.

Transcript:  I hope so.  I just want to say one of the reasons I believe VR failed is because  it's exactly like you're saying, Mike.  We were thinking about ideas that didn't take advantage of the technology that we were aiming  towards. VR, what we ended up doing is funding a bunch of startups that were bringing ideas  from the game industry instead of starting new ideas that were kind of from scratch.  Rubble Recall is a great example.  It's a VR game.  It's a fantastic game.  It's made in Unreal Engine.  It's a great immersive shooter.  Even for someone like me that lives and dies by that kind of technology,  I can only play it for 20 minutes and I get bored because it's taking an idea  from the game industry that's really better on a PlayStation sitting in front of a TV.  I think if this is going to be better, we need to be thinking about mundane things, too.  What about someone working in a warehouse trying to find different things there or  working in a data center? Swapping that out.  That's a good application of AR or somebody at a courthouse trying to find records.  I think we have this idea of a science fiction future and I think when AR starts,  it's going to be a lot more mundane.  It's going to be like you said, Mike, like reading Apple news articles to you.

Transcript:  Well, if you think about the Apple Watch started really as just a sidecar to the phone  and has slowly gained some stature, it's not quite a standalone device yet,  but that is a gradual evolution that's taken it what five years.  That's the thing. I think we all would love to get these glasses tomorrow,  but it's not going to happen tomorrow.  It's not going to happen in a year.  It's not going to happen in five years.

Transcript:  I think the Apple Watch is a great example of what is likely with the glasses.  We were all kind of disappointed in the Apple Watch for the first year, two years, three years.  It gradually and when nobody was looking became like this fantastic wearable.  It's really great now.  And it just creeped.  There was no big aha moment.  It just sort of just got better and better and better.  That's probably what's going to happen with the glasses.  They're going to come out.  We're all going to crap all over them.  You know, they're going to disappoint everyone.  And then over the next five years, they're going to become amazing.

Transcript:  I should point out that Apple acquired a company called Next VR.  All that's on the Next VR page now is Next VR is headed in a new direction.  But this was a platform for 3D virtual reality sports music and entertainment experiences.  And so it's an interesting acquisition for Apple.  It fits perfectly in with what Apple's doing, except that Apple has no VR or AR.  So why did they buy these guys?  All right, let's take a little break.  We got more to talk about.

If you can crack it, there is a significant amount of money in there.  I'm just saying.  There's more than seven Bitcoins in there.  So I won't say who won, but it was a really fun contest.  Is it on the feeds?  It's on YouTube, right?  YouTube.com slash twit.  Every Friday now we do twit after hours.  I hope we keep doing this after this is over because it's so much fun.

Then I do want to get to I want to get to Unreal Engine 5.  Because I know you're excited about that.  And I am too.  In fact, we'll show some of the video that Tim Sweeney unveiled.  He said some interesting things about the PS5, including this this new PlayStation 5  is so good PC makers are going to learn a lot about how to make PCs.  Very interesting.  Our show brought to you by LinkedIn Learning.  You know, I love LinkedIn Learning for a long time.  We were using Linda.com and I did all and I have so many friends who were  teachers, experts.  They did great classes.  LinkedIn bottom and they've turned into LinkedIn Learning.  And now it's just grown.  It's gotten better and better.  The platform is so good for education.  Sixteen thousand courses taught by the best in the business, the best industry experts.  You can learn skills like how to master working from home.  We're all dealing with that.  Entrepreneurship foundations, how to be a resilient leader.  There are some amazing.  Sixteen thousand courses to choose from.  I know lots of folks, many of the people you've seen on our shows who are LinkedIn  Learning professors, I don't know, educators.  There's also stuff there, soft skills like 10 ways to stay motivated while job hunting.  I sent that one off to my kids.  Things like managing in difficult times.  That's a class.  One of the things I love about LinkedIn Learning, you get custom tailored course  recommendations, you get project files, you get quizzes.  They're really interactive.  You really get to practice what you learn.  It's really learning.  And that's why they call it LinkedIn Learning.  Courses are available, of course, anytime, anywhere on your computer, on your phone.  You get a certificate when you complete the course.  Perfect for framing or putting up on your LinkedIn profile.  And by the way, we've been doing this for years.  We offer LinkedIn Learning to our team because we want them to get skills.  We want them to learn new things, to grow, to expand.  It's the best way to learn and apply new skills.  Just to grow our business and because we know when our team members get more skills,  it helps us.  You'll learn from the best in the business.

So many games.  It's not just unreal, right?  Brianna.

Start time: 5427.59
End time: 5461.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Well, it's we have a lot of different engines in the game industry.  It's frostbite.  There's unity, but unreal in particular is very exciting because it's used  beyond the game industry.  If you saw the Star Wars movie solo, you saw Unreal Engine used for a lot of the special effects  there.  It's just a remarkably agile 3D engine that's really, really good at cinema.  So people use it in television pipelines.  It's just it's a Swiss army knife of 3D work.

Start time: 5461.90
End time: 5469.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I was asking you, how do you work in Unreal Engine?  Is it coding?

Start time: 5470.24
End time: 5526.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a little bit of everything.  So you have the Unreal Editor with Unreal 4 and you can install it on PC or Mac.  If you're designing 3D assets, you can bring something in for Maya or Max or Blender  and put it in FBX and import it.  And you can certainly code or if you don't want to learn to code, you can just use visual  nodes.  They have an entire visual scripting language called Blueprint, which is excellent.  Many games that are shipped with Unreal Engine don't have a line of written code in them.  It's just people hooking Blueprint nodes together.  It's a really, it's a very, very, it's a really good language.  In fact, with the last game I shipped, I know C++ really well, but I ended up  working in their visual scripting language because it was faster and we were trying to  ship a very complicated game on iOS devices.  So Unreal Engine is awesome.

Transcript:  Before the show, we were talking about, I was showing you some Minecraft stuff the kids  have done.  We've got a bunch of 17 year olds who have their own Minecraft worlds and they're doing  a lot of designing.  You said that's the kind of skill, those kids have the kind of skill that they could then  go to something like Unreal Engine and design real games.  Absolutely.  That's really interesting.

Start time: 5547.56
End time: 5562.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What they're doing is more complicated because they're having to design the static  meshes.  Like with Unreal Engine, it's just you go into content manager and drag the door, the  wall, the box, whatever there, and then do the lighting for it.  So they're actually doing something that's harder.

Start time: 5562.94
End time: 5564.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5566.44
End time: 5574.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's free to a point.  Unreal Engine 5 that's coming out will be free up to a million dollars, at which point  you'll have to pay royalties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, my last license for Unreal Engine, like if we wanted to put C++ code in it, we had  to write Epic a check for, I believe it was $30,000.  So this is a much better deal for many people.

Start time: 5615.92
End time: 5626.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've got some of that video.  Tell me what is this is the Epic.  Instead of GDC, they just did a video.  Tell me what is new in this.  Is it lighting?

Start time: 5627.66
End time: 5647.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it is lighting.  So if you look at this, look at the number of we call them tries in the game industry,  basically the number of vertexes on all of this.  When they get very close, you're not just going to see the lighting.  You're going to be able to really, really make out every single point on these statues.

Start time: 5647.80
End time: 5658.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So all of this stuff is really a combination of polygons, often triangles.  That's why I call them tries.  So look at that rock right there.  That looks like I don't see any triangle.  That's amazing.

Start time: 5659.12
End time: 5710.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, traditionally in a game, if you looked at something like a rock,  we've come up with ways to fake it with normal mapping, which basically puts a 2D image over  a 3D object.  Texture on fake step.  Yeah.  Well, it fakes depth and makes the engine render it in a way that looks deeper.  What they found out how to do here is to render so many tries with this statue  that it just looks unbelievably realistic.  The thing that is exciting for game developers like me is rather than having to go through  and optimize every single statue to have a low poly, a medium poly, a high poly,  an ultra high poly, this new engine is going to do it all dynamically,  which has a lot of applications, not just for PlayStation games, but for VFX,  for television logos, for everything.

Start time: 5710.68
End time: 5718.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at that dynamic lighting.  That is so computationally intense.

Start time: 5722.22
End time: 5730.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what they're doing is moving the light source and then it figures out what it looks like on  each try as it's going through the scene.

Start time: 5730.94
End time: 5756.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  If you look at a video game, you'll notice that shadows and lighting will affect your  character, a skeletal mesh, but it's not going to affect the environment around you beyond shadows.  So this is a way of doing it.  That's it's dynamic lighting.  Is it ray tracing?  Ray tracing is, if I recall correctly, it's not in this demo yet, but we're, we hope to have that.

Start time: 5756.24
End time: 5760.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5764.46

So I don't think the video and you'll look this up,  but as I recall, this is something could run dynamically on a normal PlayStation 5,  but it was precooked ahead of time.  So it's footage in development from an engine that's in development.

Start time: 5809.14

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I imagine Unreal will eventually run on it.  The thing I love about Unreal is you can create a game once and then you can port it to Android,  you can port it to Mac, you can port it to PC, you can port it to even Switch in some cases.  So it's a very versatile Swiss Army knife.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's exciting about this for developers is if I was trying to do something like this  in Unreal Engine 4, I would have to spend a week on every one of these statues.  I would have to go into ZBrush with that particular shield  and create custom normals and spectral maps.  What they focused on is the pipeline here for developers.  So I would be able to take that high poly asset directly from ZBrush,  bring it into Unreal Engine, and then like your kid making a Minecraft level,  just drag and drop that into the scene.  And then it would do that.  This is what they're saying, that it will do all that work from even beneath the hood.

Start time: 5940.12
End time: 5943.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is it just ZBrush?  Will it work with Blender or other 3D?

Start time: 5943.22
End time: 5961.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it would work with other 3D programs, but something this detailed is done in ZBrush.  So yeah, if what they're saying is true,  this is going to really cut down on the amount of time it takes games to create things or  visually stunning.

I mean, the company is going to tell you their product is great.  Everybody can do this.  Right.  I want to see developers look at this and evaluate the pipeline.  I certainly will when I can get my hands on it.  But Epic, I can say this, I've worked with them a lot.  They've always been a very honest company with me.  Their support has always been excellent and they're a very developer focused company.  So from my experience, I have no reason not to believe what they're saying is true.

Transcript:  And that looked amazing for its time.  It was mind boggling.  So NASA uses Unreal to develop training for astronauts.  I did a story about virtual reality at NASA several years ago.  And one of the things they have a lab where they essentially train astronauts what to do  if they get in trouble on a spacewalk.  And I got to use their simulator with VR where I was essentially standing out on the edge of  the arm on the space station, the robotic arm.  And it was incredible.  And they use Unreal.  Some of the other simulations use Unity, but it was incredibly impressive.

Transcript:  Yeah.  The thing I like about Unreal is the cinematic scripting part of it.  If you're looking to do cinematic scripting, they really invented the interactive cut scene  in 3D and games in a way that was very accessible for developers.  So they've literally been working on that part of the engine since 1998.  And they've gotten to be very good at it.  Yeah.

And it was a widescreen monitor, which in those days was probably this.  But we played a lot of Unreal.  It blew my mind then because I had played Doom, which was,  go back and look at the original Doom, pretty gritty.  And then Quake, we loved Quake.  And then Unreal came out and it was like, how are they doing this?  It's amazing.  Let's take a little break.  Mike, do you want to talk about gaming?  I left you out.  No.

In the last 10 years, we've shifted towards a game design that is,  it is designed to bring you in for massive amounts of time to give you a huge learning  curve and to keep you hooked as long as possible.  I love games that you can go beat in five to 10 hours.  And we just don't ship those anymore.  So that's not your fault, Leo and Mike.

Transcript:  Just think.  Yeah, just think what you could do with it.  Our show today brought to you by Extra Hop.  Just think what you could do with Extra Hop with more and more companies going remote.  The cyber criminals are out there.  They're ready to take advantage of the changing IT reality.  More important than ever for organizations to know what's going on in their enterprise.  And I don't just mean your local area network or even your wide area network.  I mean your cloud.  I mean IoT devices.  Employees are at home.  Remember when somebody brought a Raspberry Pi into NASA and it brought the whole thing down?  Now it's the opposite.  You're bringing NASA to your Raspberry Pi.  You're in people's houses.  That's why you need Extra Hop.  In order to protect and scale your business.  Because that's how Extra Hop started with performance monitoring.  You need more than just visibility.  You need fast, reliable information about threats, about remote access problems.  And when you get that information, you need it in the context  that helps you act and fix the problem right away.  That's Extra Hop.  It helps you detect threats and performance issues up to 95% faster.  And respond 60% more efficiently.  You're going to get complete visibility on every asset in your enterprise.  And that's in real time.  In fact, go to the Extra Hop site.  ExtraHop.com slash twit.  And take a look at the dashboard.  They have a demo dashboard.  You will be blown away.  You'll say, how do I get this?  I want this now.  I want to see every asset in real time at scale now.  You can secure your hybrid enterprise wherever it is today, wherever it goes tomorrow.  Automatically detect new, rogue, and unmanaged IoT devices.  See everything in your environment from the cloud to the data center.  All the way down to the customer.  Extra Hop is awesome.  It keeps your business safe and available at any scale.  Look at that.  Wizards of the Coast.  They use Extra Hop.  They use to support and secure their AWS cloud.  Wizards of the Coast Chief Architect, Dan McDaniel said,  there's no other company that aligns to supporting our DevOps model,  the speed, the lack of friction than Extra Hop.  He loves it.  The Home Depot uses it.  The Home Depot's got 2,300 remote sites.  They've got point of sale.  They've got a massive security challenge.  They use Extra Hop to manage and secure those remote sites.  And this is the quote, no data set is more complete and accurate than what Extra Hop delivers.  If you need that information, if you need threat detection,  if you have performance issues, if you are anxious to respond quickly to anything  happening to your network, you can take control of your cloud and your cloud security right now  with Extra Hop.  Get tips on securing and supporting remote access.  And then honestly, it is so cool.  Check out the full product demo at extrahop.com slash twit.  But I got to warn you, as soon as you see it, you're going to say,  why don't we have this?  Extra Hop dot com slash twit.  These guys are great, great product.  In a way, this show has really been all about how cool technology is and how cool it's getting.  And I think so many times we get jaded and complacent and we go, oh, it's all a mess.  There is amazing stuff going on out there.  And the kind of visualizations you can get with Extra Hop, that's a perfect example.  I almost want to just let's talk about good stuff.  Let's make this the positive episode of Twitter.  We've had enough negative episodes of Twitter.  I want to talk about the good things like the University of California college graduation  in Minecraft that they built.  That's awesome.  That's awesome.  I think a lot of companies are saying Twitter just announced they're going to let employees  work at home forever.  Employees love it.

Start time: 6641.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  for decades, 20 years.  That's what you do.  Yeah.  Yes, exactly.  And there's always been this resistance, oh, it can't be done, can't be done.  And now everybody's doing it and people are saying, hey, you know, that really could have  been an email.  This is like totally working.  That's one of the reasons why I've been so anti-Zoom because Zoom is kind of taking away  some of the benefits of remote work, which is that you can focus, you can control your  environment to a certain extent.  But once people are actually working remotely without their kids being at home and schools  canceled and without all these Zoom meetings all day, it's going to really enhance productivity.  The other thing that I think is really interesting for the show is that a lot of people in Silicon  Valley are saying, why are we here paying these prices?  Right.  Dealing with this traffic.  They don't have to.  If we're going to be from home, our home could be anywhere.  And so why don't we go live in a cabin?  Why don't we go live abroad?  Why don't we live in a small town?  And this is really, I think, going to change the dynamics of cities.  Probably not great for the cities, but probably great for the lifestyle that people, especially  people lucky enough to work in tech and other kinds of industries where you can work remotely.  Work.  And I think it's going to be a massive transformation.  It's really an accelerant of a trend that was already inevitable.  I think we've just leaped forward 10 years in terms of how many people are going to be  working from home.

Transcript:  I have a different opinion on this.  After GamerGay, I worked with Twitter quite a bit to update their policies and to figure  out what happened and to stop things like that from happening again.  And when I've gone to Twitter and I've seen in person the kinds of alliances and friendships  that people have as they've tried to navigate this giant corporation with a lot of different  competing departments with different goals.  I've seen firsthand the value of being able to bring someone down to the cafeteria to  hang out and to talk to someone about a point of view that they hadn't considered.  And I think even if you widen that out from just Twitter, I do think that in person has  value.  Does that mean that every single company moving forward needs to spend a huge amount of money  paying for San Francisco real estate?  No, of course not.  But I do think that there's something that gets lost when you move to 100% virtual,  especially in engineering teams.

Transcript:  If you talk to Matt Mullenweg, who is the founder of WordPress runs, parent company  is automatic.  He has a podcast called Distributed and he's kind of a big evangelist for distributed work.  He will tell you that you do need to have in person gatherings automatic does an annual  all hands meeting, but they don't have to meet at their headquarters.  They don't have a headquarters.  They meet at whatever cool location in the world they want to go to.  But for them, that's important.  And I agree with Brianna.  I think what we'll see is maybe a kind of a hybrid thing that will happen.  I can see here at the Chronicle, we are all working remotely.  I can see us maybe not necessarily always coming back to the newsroom every day, but maybe a couple  of times a week we're in the newsroom.  I think you're going to see kind of a combination.

Start time: 6861.38
End time: 6951.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Go ahead, Mike.  You also have to consider the fact that working from home is really something that is or is not  amenable to your personality.  So those, you know, some of us are self-driven introverts who are self-directed and we need time  to think and we need control over our own thought process.  Lots of other people get a lot more energy and ideas from being around other people and  interacting and so on.  And so I think the best case scenario is that the work from home situation reflects not just  some blanket company policy, but actually reflects the preferences of individual personalities.  So the people who really thrive working from home can do so and the people who really thrive  in an office environment can do that.  One ironic slow-moving catastrophe is that several major Silicon Valley companies,  specifically Facebook, but also Google, just invested gazillions of dollars in these massive  open office plans.  Facebook in particular has the world's largest open office in Menlo Park and just as soon as they had  that up and running for a year or two, along comes a virus that spreads like wildfire in an open  office.  And so this is kind of an ironic thing that companies are going to have to deal with.  Even those Silicon Valley companies and elsewhere, they're going to have to figure out how to sort  of wall people off to a certain extent because Facebook-like open offices are not going to fly  in a world of global pandemics.

Transcript:  Microsoft used to always have offices, right?  I don't think Microsoft embraced open offices unless they have more recently.  But all the new guys, I mean look at Apple's campus, you know, it's all open.  And I do agree with you, Brianna, that I feel like, for instance, Twitter is a really good example.  The Twitter was in the South Park of San Francisco and a bunch of startups started up around that  because they would see each other, they'd run into each other, they'd have lunch together,  and there was this collegial aspect that was one of the reasons San Francisco had such a great  startup scene is because everybody was there and there is something to be said for that.  Steve Jobs famously in the new Apple campus, in the initial design only had one bathroom per floor  because he wanted people to all kind of run into each other as they walked a mile and a half to  get to the bathroom.

Transcript:  I think they better, the saner minds talked him out of it, but initially he really wanted,  like we don't want so many bathrooms.  That's typical Steve, right?  Here's the guy who used to wash his feet in the toilet.  So I, you know, who knows what Steve is thinking.  Yeah, I think.  But think about this for a company like Twitter that is really, they've had some tough problems,

Start time: 7031.84
End time: 7108.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right?  Like Gamergate happened at Twitter because, let's just really be honest here,  it was a bunch of white dudes that designed it and they didn't think about harassment and didn't  invest in trust and safety.  And they had to have hard conversations and redo features and they tried slapping band-aids on it.  I can tell you for a fact, there are people at Twitter that put everything on the line to  improve it.  And Twitter today is a drastically better product today than it was during Gamergate.  I don't, I'm unsure how effective that advocacy could have been in an all work from home situation.  Maybe it could have.  I don't know.  My husband's work, you know, he does patent law for a living.  His job is barely affected.  In fact, it's easier for him to write patents without all the meetings.  But I just, I wonder, I could see it working better for a company that's more static in what  they produce or is that smaller.  But when you get to the size of a big company, you invariably have people with competing goals,  different agendas, different cultures.  And I think some of that clash has to happen in person.  Yeah.

Start time: 7109.34
End time: 7119.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So do you think, going back to our original conversation, that these virtual reality glasses  and the 3D mapped skeletal frame would help that or is it not enough?  It would.

Start time: 7119.78
End time: 7148.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I do.  There was a, back before I decided to run for office,  there was a VR tech I was looking at.  They had eye tracking with it.  So for the skeletal mesh I would look at if I was looking over here and you look at,  then the eyes would turn and look you dead in the eye.  It was such an emotionally connected effect.  Yes.  Yes.  It produced something.  So I do think it could have very good, I think it could help build that human connection.  How interesting.

Start time: 7148.81
End time: 7223.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  In fact, Twitter itself said that one of the reasons they were able to get out of their  fail-will situation was that their engineers would talk to other engineers at other startups  in the area that were trying to figure out how to scale and the information shared that  way actually helped them become a more scalable product.  So there's a lot to be said for collegiality.  But unfortunately, most of us in the computer industry are introverts.  I'm very happy at home writing up our patents.  One last story.  I want this from the Stuff May Hear YouTube channel.  It is Shane Whiten's robotic basketball hoop.  This is what happens when nerds are locked in the house for a lengthy period of time.  If you can't shoot hoops,  well, you could get a raspberry pie to make sure that every single basket goes in.  Thank you, Shane.  Love this.  This is what I need for sure.

You let it sit around for a week or two and it becomes this delicious alcoholic beverage.  OMG.  Yeah, it's so good.  So try it.  If you're going to cut open a pineapple, just take the peel, just throw it in a jar,  put some water in there and some sugar and it will ferment on its own  using the microbes that are on the pineapple.

If you keep going, it becomes something that they call in Central America,  they call it chiche, which is a highly alcoholic.  This still has some sugar in it, so it's still sweet.
