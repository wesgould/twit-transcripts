End time: 425.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 437.00
End time: 443.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They called him the anti-editor.  Oh yes.  The idea was they actually paid me to be mean.  That's true.  Best job he's ever had.

Start time: 444.02
End time: 444.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely true.

Start time: 445.24
End time: 465.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  John, I have to say, you wrote one of my favorite columns ever while you were at PC Computing.  And I remember this distinctly because I remember seeing it on the wall as it was being laid out.  You were saying, this internet thing is never going anywhere.  Poor John.  I think you were talking about internet email.  You were complaining that it was unreliable.

Start time: 466.00
End time: 485.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I was using email since the MCI email days.  I would have never said that.  I was saying that the thing in PC Computing, I may have said that the cable modems at the time were going nowhere.  The problem that I have is that I've said stuff that's 40 years old.  A long time ago you said the mouse was never going to go anywhere.  No, I never said that.

Start time: 486.39
End time: 493.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a lie.  Well, I, okay.  I mean, I'm not accusing you of anything.  No, I know, but there's a bunch of-  It's the thing that gets brought up a lot.

Start time: 495.12
End time: 521.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But it's because some joker added a bunch of little fan dangles to the quote and that got passed around.  But what I actually said, which wasn't a positive thing, but I said there's no evidence to show that people want these things.  And then somebody added, and I wouldn't buy any newfangled, they use the word newfangled device,  and then everybody passed that around as though I had said it because it was so funny.  But in fact, I never had said it.

Start time: 522.72
End time: 532.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think if you write about technology, you talked about technology for 30 years,  there's no way that you won't have something that somebody can point to and say, oh, you got that one really wrong.

Start time: 532.02
End time: 540.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I get a column for PC computing that's my favorite, which the editors didn't want,  and it was an entire column on why the caps lock key should be eliminated.

Start time: 541.34
End time: 550.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we had planned, I agree with you on that.  The first thing I do on any new computer is disable caps lock.  Yeah, well, we're a whole column about it.

Start time: 550.28
End time: 556.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  How can you write a whole column about one crummy idea?  And it didn't do any good.  And you have to do a lot of problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at this. Philip Elmer DeWitt, Fortune Magazine, this is writing in January 2009,  and he says, how critics reviewed the Mac when it came out in 84.  And of course, he has your comment.  And originally in the comment, he had all of this extra crap.

Start time: 575.18
End time: 582.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Which I called him up about this, by the way.  And I sent him an email. I said, this is bull crap. I never said this.  And I gave him the original column. And so he did this.

Start time: 583.10
End time: 593.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He says, it's not clear at this point whether DeWitt ever wrote them.  It is clear. I didn't.  We apologize for the error.  But you know, retractions never get as much attention as the original.

Start time: 594.00
End time: 610.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, that newfangled thing, the quote, if you see the word newfangled in the quote,  I never said that. And it's a word I don't think I've ever written.  I could see you writing newfangled.  Yes, but I have never written that word. I think it's a stupid word.  Fangled. What does fangled mean?  I don't know, but a newfangled is obviously a new version.

Start time: 610.04
End time: 614.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the latest fangled.  Way better than oldfangled.

Start time: 614.51
End time: 615.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, oldfangled is very...

Start time: 616.48
End time: 621.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I really want to know where that phrase comes from.  Let me Google fangled.

Start time: 622.00
End time: 628.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Something that Kodger would say, so they would associate it with me,  to as some sort of an insult because I don't want you to say anything to your face.

Start time: 628.70
End time: 667.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, actually, there is a word newfangled.  No, there's fangled. What's fangled mean?  It means foppish.  Based on a misinterpretation of newfangled as fashionable.  But if we go back to the mutiny of the Elsinore written by Jack London, your friend,  Mr. Pike...  Poor guy is dead now.  Mr. Pike refused to quote monkey with the quote fangled forceps in the medicine chest.  I don't think it's clear what fangled means in that context.  No.  Could be damaged, could be bent.  Could be foppish.  Hard to use.  Hard to use. Could be a lot of things.  All right, we've got John set up.

Transcript:  The big story of the week, ladies and gentlemen.  And we've discussed it on earlier shows, because it happened on Monday.  But I think we've not had it on Twitter, and I think we need to talk about it a little bit.  Is this strange new plan from Google to...  Not Google anymore.  Yeah, to rebrand itself as Alphabet.

Start time: 715.24
End time: 718.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is why I thought you brought me on, because I wrote an entire column on this.

End time: 742.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're the guy I want to know.  My first reaction, when we heard it, I was on the air doing iOS today.  And my first reaction was, well, there may be some financial reason, some deep CFO mojo going on here.  But otherwise, I don't really see an advantage if there's not a tax advantage.  Why not just do a reorg?  Isn't this a reorg under a different name?  John C. Dvorak, what do you think?

Start time: 742.64
End time: 746.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think you should leave me to... I want to hear what everyone else thinks.  We'll leave you to last? Explain it?

Start time: 747.24
End time: 748.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right. What do you think, Christina?

Start time: 750.19
End time: 927.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, I think that there are a number of reasons to do it.  I mean, and it's weird.  When it first was announced, I assumed it was sort of a joke.  And then the more I thought about it, I thought, actually, this makes a lot of sense.  And it's a very Larry and a very Sergey thing to do, down to not even checking to see if anyone else had a trademark for the name.  So, I mean, I think that Google, obviously, it started out of a search, and then it's become kind of an advertising company.  And they obviously most of their Internet services are in that regard.  But as they get into other areas, and especially the research areas, it makes sense from a public facing perspective to say,  we want these types of businesses to live side by side, but not necessarily be completely connected.  So, you know, we can have our research division, we can have the Google X or X Labs or whatever we want to call it.  We can have our health care stuff.  We can have our ISP business, all our venture capital business, all that living separately from our core services, you know, Android and YouTube and Google search and all that stuff.  So, I mean, I think it makes sense when you look at the fact that especially as Google is trying to make these bigger and bigger moon shots,  they're trying to do more and more things and simply being under the Google umbrella tends to limit them a little bit because people just assume, OK, well, what's the benefit for Google on this?  How is this going to impact search or mobile or advertising?  And maybe they want to do things that are in other areas that aren't necessarily aided, that don't eventually, I guess, lead to those kind of core competencies that go into other areas, you know, self-driving cars, some of the medical research they're doing.  So I think that it helps in that regard from kind of a public perception issue is that they can have one big company that's solving a bunch of different problems.  And my cynical take when I first heard the news was, well, there has to be some sort of regulatory reason for why they want to do this.  And I don't think it necessarily gets them out of any hot water with the EU or any other countries that are filing privacy lawsuits or trying to get them to do different things.  But I do think that it makes it a lot easier to say that if you have an ISP like Google Fiber is and you also have this mobile business and you have kind of the fact that they capture so much of your browsing data  and other information about your advertising, that if there was a little bit of uncomfortability around the fact that all those things were under the same company, if they're technically two separate companies who maybe just have a data sharing agreement  or maybe don't even have a data sharing agreement, it might be easier for regulators to say, yeah, you can have an ISP and you can have a search engine and you can have, you know, a mail service and a video service and run the biggest ad network in the world.  But because these things aren't necessarily living under the same corporate name and they have to have their own data sharing agreements within one another, it's going to be easier to handle from a regulatory perspective.  Dylan, you agree?

Start time: 931.25
End time: 974.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Not really, because I think at the end of the day, it's the same bag of stuff.  It just has a different name.  I think that, and I don't think that's going to ultimately change the way the EU or the SEC looks at things.  They're not fooled by this.  No, the only people it matters most to are Larry and Sergey and Sundar and Tony, the Fadell who's running Nest.  I think it's most important for them because it kind of sets up a succession pattern and gives them a little bit more clarity internally in how they operate with each other.  But I mean, it's the same stock.  It's the same assets.  Nothing really fundamental has changed in this.

Transcript:  I think it's a good idea.  I worked at IDG for many years.  I was founded by a guy who ended up being a billionaire, Pat McGovern.  And the way he ran that business was there were a whole bunch of, it was a holding company with a whole bunch of independent companies inside it.  And depending on how much Larry and Sergey want to be involved, this could be a really good move in the sense that it could give everybody some clarity and say, Sundar, this is what Google is.  You're in charge of that.  We'll talk to you.  We're basically your board of directors, but we will talk to you and you make these decisions under our observation.  And Tony Fidel, you do that with Nest.  If they manage it so that if Tony Fidel wants to make decisions that are not just feeding into what Google wants, then I think that's good.  But that all comes down to how Larry and Sergey want to manage or micromanage.  If the goal here is to sort of separate the part of Google that makes a lot of money, it is this machine that generates money.  Based on advertising on the web and YouTube advertising and things like that, and separate that from the wild idea and the investment parts of what Larry and Sergey do, then I think, you know, I think that's good, at least from a clarity standpoint to say, look, this is Google isn't making self-driving cars.  Really, that's sort of Larry and Sergey.  When they started the company, everything they did was was Google.  And now what they're saying is, look, we do lots of stuff.  It doesn't all need to be under the Google brand name.  I think that's I think that's good.  And I think Dylan's exactly right.  It's good for somebody like Tony Fidel to be able to put a little distance between himself and Google and say, look, when you're working with Nest, you know, yes, we're owned by Larry and Sergey, but we're not moving in lockstep with what Google's doing.

Transcript:  They say Larry Page in his letter explaining this says we're going to hold the purse strings.  We're going to fund all this stuff.  But we're going to let these companies run essentially autonomously.  It strikes me.  There's actually some negatives, not some benefits.  I don't see any benefit.  Let me tell you.  Hold on.  Then I'm going to give you a chance.  You got something to say?

Because I don't want to be, you know, I want to I want to say, but that's OK.  Yeah, exactly.  I don't want anybody to say, oh, John saved you or you change your mind because of John.  Does anybody know that I do that?  No, no, I'm just but you do.  And I know it.  I'm very grateful.  I think that there are some potential negatives because they're going to now be reporting  returns from some of these companies that it will never show returns like Calico, the  longevity company.  That's always been hidden in the Google results.  Now these will be seen.  So there is actually I think there's some actually significant negatives to this.  I think what really is happening is is this is a lot of hand waving around Larry Page  stepping down.  That really is, you know, imagine the announcement, a different announcement.  Larry Page has decided to step down as CEO of Google and to become like chairman of

Transcript:  Well, Larry's Larry's thought about that would also be, you know, Sundar is only really  interested in this part and I'm interested in this totally other thing.  I mean, Sergey Brin has been running the X the X division, you know, kind of autonomously

Start time: 1171.00
End time: 1220.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  for ages.  Nobody even cares.  It says Sergey's hobby.  Right.  And that's what I think really having is Larry Page is saying I don't want to I don't  want to have meetings about search anymore.  Yeah, I would like to I would like to enjoy my life.  I'm a multi multi billionaire.  Keep sending me money.  Keep sending me money and I'm going to take some time off and we're going to let Sundar  be CEO.  But he realized, I think very occasionally and by the way, the story is apparently this  has been in the works for some time.  Salman Khamenei proposed this years ago.  And so they've been contemplating this.  I think Larry said I'm going to step down.  I don't want the stock market to punish us.  So here's what we're going to do.  And in fact, the stock market loved this, by the way, because they'll get more information.  They loved it.  They loved it.  And so I think this is actually really remarkable hand waving to distract from what would have  been a negative, which is Larry Page not running Google anymore.  I feel like it reflects reality, though.

Transcript:  I mean, this is sort of the truth of it is there's this core Google business that makes  huge amounts of money.  And then on the side, they've been investing in a lot of stuff, buying up other companies  and creating these kind of crazy idea companies to do the longevity research and the self  driving cars.

Transcript:  Absolutely being more honest about what they're doing.  But that's not necessarily something you want to do in a business where you have a lot of  money losers.  Then again, they control the company.  For all we know, NEST loses money like crazy.  For all we know.  We will know that now because they're going to report NEST profits separately.  So I think that this could be a real negative.  By the way, I think Sundar Pichai is an excellent choice.  He'll be a great CEO.  He's sharp.  And really, the market would be wrong to punish a Google stock for Larry stepping down and  some taking over because I think Larry's bored.  All right.  My thought Larry's not that bored.

Transcript:  Now John C. DeVorek will explain this all.  You call a few venture capitalists, you find out a couple of things.  Yes.  One of them is that the two guys are preoccupied with Warren Buffett to the point where they're  just obsessed.  Well, some have said this is like Berkshire Hathaway, but it isn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is.

Start time: 1281.08
End time: 1379.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It's exactly like Berkshire Hathaway.  And the reason is, it's very simple.  They know that exactly what you said, that all these little companies like NEST and if  you go back to what Silicon Valley is all about, core competencies, those two guys don't  know how to run a thermostat company.  It's just that simple.  They don't know how to run a car company.  They don't know how to do a lot of stuff.  The Berkshire Hathaway model, which is exactly what this is going to become, every one of  these companies is separate.  They're going to have their own CEOs.  They said that.  And they're going to report separately.  And one of the little kickers to this whole thing is when somebody sent me a note about  this, oh, this is going to ruin all the little companies that they're starting because we  could freely exchange executives, which is what they could do now.  If you just go with just having divisions, oh, let's have a division.  Let's have a NEST division.  Have some department guy run the thing.  And then they have some problems.  They have some economic issues.  And they say, let's get Bill.  He's the superstar.  Bring him in for a couple of weeks and he'll straighten things out.  They can't do that anymore.  Now these companies stand alone.  And the big fear of Google is the reflection in the wall.  They know it can happen to them.  They don't want to become Yahoo.  That's the way Yahoo was run.  They run these companies.  They start these companies.  They run them as divisions.  They go broke, broke, broke.  One after the other, Google's looked in the mirror.  They said, we're not going to become Yahoo.  We love the Warren Buffett model.  We're going to become Berkshire Hathaway.  That's why the market took a big jump.  They said there's something to this.  And that is what's going on.  It's a Berkshire Hathaway model right to the core.  At some point, they're going to spin off Android and Chrome and Google will be separate.  They're going to be Google, Android, and Google.  They're going to be Google, Android, Chrome, all little companies.  Nest, its own company.

Transcript:  Michael A. Cusimano, who's a professor at MIT Sloan School of Management, says that comparison to Berkshire Hathaway is silly, John.  He says Berkshire Hathaway under Warren Buffett invests in existing undervalued companies, kind of like a mutual fund.  It's precisely the opposite of Alphabet's VC-style focus on risky new ventures.  It isn't a Berkshire Hathaway in the way it's run.

Transcript:  I don't know if I buy the Berkshire Hathaway argument.  I mean, yes, it's a conglomerate in the same way that Berkshire Hathaway is.  You bought that much.  Maybe Wall Street likes that because Berkshire Hathaway has done really well.  But I mean, we had tons of conglomerates in the 60s and 70s, and it turns out that that's not in most cases.

Start time: 1458.14
End time: 1500.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I would stop you there because most of the conglomerates, especially in the late 60s,  and they used to use this term, which is synergy, synergy, synergy.  So you'd buy a company, you'd merge with them.  But history has not been kind to those.  No, that's right.  And that's why they saw the writing on the wall.  Synergy doesn't work.  You can't just buy these companies up and then bring them in and make them divisions because it never works.  That old model is not the Berkshire Hathaway model.  He sets these companies up to stand alone.  There's no synergy.  There's no budget.  There's not the executives switching spots.  Oh, why don't you go here and work for them for a while?  It's all standalone little companies.  It's more of a trust, the old fashioned trust from the 30s and 40s than it is the synergies from the 60s and 70s.  I think you've got the wrong era.

Transcript:  Another guy, Vivek Wadhwa, fellow with the Sanford Law School's Rock Center for Corporate Governance,  says that this is actually a very interesting play because some of these really speculative companies  like the self-driving car companies have crossed the risk point that they've already been,  they've gone through the investment mode, the risk mode, and they're now poised to become another Google.  He says there are already two or three possible Googles in the portfolio.  So that would actually be exactly to your point.  This is a great way to kind of organize a structure like this and eventually spin these off or go public.

Transcript:  And when they talk about transparency, that's what they're talking about.  You can't be fooling around with all these companies under the same umbrella and switching roles and doing all this stuff.  That's not transparent.  It's not clear who's who.  Now you've got to state the company sinks or swims, nest makes money or it doesn't.  You can shutter them.  You can sell them off to somebody else.  You can do whatever you want.  And that's what the transparency thing was all about when they talk about it.

Transcript:  Well, this is what I like about this is that it is when they started this, they were just guys making a search engine.  Right.  This is the moment where they realized, look, we have so much money and we own so many different things and they're not connected.  In the long run, should this be one company that that is just all mashed together?  And this is them saying, no, we need to align this.  We need to split these businesses off and let them be their own things.  I think it's a, you know, it's a really grown up kind of kind of approach to it.  That this is this is the rest of the, you know, of life for Larry and Sergey and their investments is to not have them be in one company like when they started.  I think it makes sense.

Transcript:  Now, the one drawback I see the whole thing is that Warren Buffett is a is a great investor.  Now, he did learn the hard way over the years when his early days, he didn't do that well.  He's a value investor.  Right.  Yes, he's a value investor.  But that doesn't mean that's the only model you can have.  I don't know whether these guys can as as maybe as a team, the two of them work together so well over the years that maybe as a team, they can be a kind of a virtual Warren Buffett.  That remains to be seen.  You know what they've shown?

Start time: 1616.04
End time: 1627.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've shown an ability to hire great people, great minds.  But what they are also what's also been happening lately is those great minds have been moving on.  They've been leaving.  And this may have something to do with keeping people alike.  Let's say, Vicko Doudra under the roof.

Start time: 1652.00
End time: 1678.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think what it means for the my meme for the consumer is some of the companies that are owned by Google.  Like I said, aren't necessarily going to have to do what Google wants.  So like, is Ness going to make a decision that maybe integrates with Apple's home networking stuff,  which is something that maybe if they were under the thumb of Google, they wouldn't do.  But as an independent entity, they're like, sure, whatever is right for your business.  We could see stuff like that.  I think that's the only kind of thing.  And that's like two levels away from.

Start time: 1683.02
End time: 1693.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's because that CEO character that you like, Sundar Pichai.  Yeah, he was the head of Android and he had a lot to do with Chrome.  So they're not going to like pull him out.  Right. I think that's I think that's to come.

Start time: 1694.76
End time: 1718.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, but YouTube's the weird one because YouTube already has its own CEO who's now within Google, which is within Alphabet.  So, you know, Susan Wojcicki is the CEO of YouTube and YouTube arguably, you know, I mean, if anything could could stand on its own.  I mean, I think you could argue that Android and Chrome are kind of the same and they fit a lot with the Google services.  But YouTube could absolutely be its own business and in a lot of ways might even benefit from being its own business and out of the other thing.

Start time: 1718.06
End time: 1731.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because Google would benefit because there's a lot of in fact, part of the investigation comes from Google supposedly favoring its own properties.  You don't want Google. That's going to change, do you?  Well, but that's the point is if YouTube can be spun off, maybe that makes take some of the heat off of that.

Transcript:  But I mean, my feeling is that this is about advertising, that they that they maybe are not as high on the future of just sort of text link ads on the web.  So that's Google's business.  And they are high on YouTube as an advertising platform and they wanted to stick their ad businesses together as the best.  I agree. It's weird, but that was the best that I could come up with.

Start time: 1759.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And their ad businesses have been YouTube's ad business has been Google's ad business since basically the beginning.  I mean, they don't have separate YouTube only people you have if you get on the phone with ad people on YouTube, you're talking to Google people.  I'm just saying it's weird that like there's been this other layer now of reporting where I think she reports directly, probably still Larry rather than reporting to Sundar.  But she's technically within another organization that has its own CEO, which is then within this greater parent organization.  It's just that that's just weird to me that they're saying that most of these companies will be split off, have these different entities and have their own reporting structure.  But it doesn't negate the fact that you could still technically have another company within one of these other companies that also has its own CEO.  It's just it's weird.

I love it.  In fact, it's funny.  Anytime anybody comes to my front door, my phone rings now, which is awesome.  I have the ring video doorbell.  When somebody rings my bell at home, no matter where I am, even here at work, I can see it  and I can even respond to them.  I installed this myself and I'm not the most handy of people, but I just love it that I  was able to take off our old doorbell.  We have a wired doorbell, so there were two wires coming out of the frame there and I  was able to wire that up.  The ring doorbell comes with all the hardware you need, so it makes it very easy, including  the drill bits, the screws, even a level.  But if you don't have wiring for a doorbell, you can use it too because it has a lithium  ion battery that will last a year built into it, a USB charging port.  Now, what you get with the ring video doorbell is this great wide angle camera that talks  to your smartphone, Android or iOS, and rings it when the doorbell rings, whether you're  at home or on the road, anywhere on the internet.  You can respond, you can talk, there's a speaker in there, you can hear what they're saying.  It is a great way to kind of keep an eye on what's going on.  It looks like somebody from Anonymous is visiting the house today.  That's a little scary.  This is on my...  What the heck is going on?  What the heck is going on there?  These videos, by the way, are stored on ring servers, and I can go back and look.  One of the nice features of this is for home security.  It turns out 95% of burglaries occur during the day, and the burglar almost always rings  your doorbell to see if you're home first.  I have a clear picture of a creepy guy with a sword who's about to enter my house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I've played with it. It's nice.  It feels good in the hand.  It has kind of this metal-ish side, but this very interesting textured back.  I mean, it's a high-end Android phone made by a Chinese company.  OPPO is doing some really good stuff, obviously.  Xiaomi, even though those don't really work in the U.S.,  unless you're just on Wi-Fi.  You know, Huawei and ZTE have some good phones.  Alcatel, but it's a really nice high-end phone, especially for its price.  It's got basically all the specs you would want.  I mean, my big question is, you know, they've got all this attention that's on them,  and they have this great fandom, which is awesome,  and it is deserved to a certain extent.  But they only sold a million and a half of the last phones.  Blackberry sold more phones than these guys.  So for them to be more than just a minor player and really truly a blip,  which is what they are right now, they're going to have to get the manufacturing system down.  They're going to have to actually be able to put these things out in massive quantities and ship them,  and they're going to have to be able to do better testing  so that stuff like this USB Type-C thing isn't a problem,  because this is the sort of thing that you usually would catch, you know,  if you were running more tests and more test runs on stuff.

Transcript:  It runs Android very nicely.  It's virtually a pure Android.  You've got a lot of Obama stuff on here.  What do you mean? No, that's a news story. That's not mine.  That's Flipboard, my friend.  But Motorola also has the new Moto X.  In the U.S. it will be called the Pure Edition.  That's another phone.  We don't know when that's going to be out.  Sometime this... it says fall.  This is a nice phone.  I know. For the price, the Moto G is kind of amazing and great battery life.  That's one thing I worry about with all of these phones,  is they're improving the screens, the faster processors,  but they're not able to increase the battery much.  The new Galaxy Note 4 from Samsung, a slight increase in battery,  but I worry that it's just going to have eight hours battery life.  How's that one plus two?  Because the one plus one was 20 hours, easy.

End time: 2323.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, from what little we've had to kind of play with it, it's fine.  Again, you're right.  It doesn't have the super high resolution 4K screen,  which is nice because that means that the battery is a little bit better.  It's 1080p. This Moto G is 720p.  Which is perfect.  No, I mean, it seems solid.  It's got a big battery in it.  They've shoved a really large battery in it.  I don't know about you guys.  I keep thinking the only way we're going to actually get battery life to go to the next level  is we're going to have to go nuclear.

Transcript:  Yeah, a little power station in the back of the phone.  You just took my phone apart.  Now, this is something that OnePlus is doing as well,  which is you get excited because you say, oh, I could take the back off,  but you can't take the battery out, unfortunately.  Yeah, that's what I was trying to say.  I know, but it's so that you can customize it.  Well, you could unscrew it.  In fact, the OnePlus...  Can you get the battery out if you have to get the battery out?  I think you could.  I fixed it tore apart, the OnePlus 2, and it was.  Once you took the screws out, there were like 19 screws,  you could take the battery out and it was sealed.  This is just cosmetic, so you could put different backs on it.  Same thing with the OnePlus 2.  But notice, and I think this may be the last phone available,  an SD card. You could put an SD card in it.  Yep, sure can.

Start time: 2370.03
End time: 2379.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, because Google doesn't like it.  And it's funny because when Motorola was under Google...  Because it makes it hard for the operating system to know  if you've got a card installed or not.

Start time: 2379.14
End time: 2380.98

Start time: 2381.06
End time: 2397.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's a security issue, too.  In fact, the Android 5 really restricts what you can do.  If somebody creates a folder, if a program creates a folder,  nobody else can look at that folder and all sorts of hardships.  So the SD cards are of less use on the latest versions of Android  than they've been in the past.  Right, but obviously people like to be able to have...

Start time: 2398.00
End time: 2412.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People like to be able to have for media photos, things like that, music.  But it was funny because the very first Moto G didn't have a card slot.  Neither did the Moto X because those were released under Google.  And then as soon as Lenovo bought them, the very first thing they did...  What are you doing? You want my SIM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would just disassemble it.  One thing though, I had to go...  The Moto G uses a regular micro SIM, not a nano SIM like Apple does.  And of course I had to cut down my SIM for a nano SIM.  But T-Mobile now, when you get a SIM, they have...  It comes in three sizes on one SIM card.  That's a great idea.  Isn't that great? And you just save the frame  and you can make it as any size you want down the road.  But now, of course, it's stuck.

It's phone season.  It is phone season.  And Lisa says, no, you have to buy it.  I said, I don't want to buy it.  She says, you have to buy this so we can review them.  There you go.  So I've spent thousands...  You got it working again.  Yeah, I did. I've spent thousands of dollars.  Note 5, I got that on order.  That will be out in the next week or so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was fine.  It was funny because they made this big deal about how it was going to be very exclusive and intimate.  It was going to be hard to get into.  They did it at Lincoln Center.  First of all, the place was half full.  It was maybe three quarters full by the time the event started.  Really? That's pretty exclusive.

End time: 2522.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it kind of was because when they've done it before at Radio City, there were throngs of people.  This was one of those things.  Lance Yulanov, who I work with, he showed up at 8 o'clock in the morning for something that started at 11.  I did not do that.  I got there at like 10 because I'm not dumb.  And I knew that it would be fine.

Start time: 2523.00
End time: 2525.00

Start time: 2531.00
End time: 2553.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's obviously smarter than me.  He was dumb to get there at 8 a.m.  And even he was annoyed because he was sitting there for three hours before the event started.  So they had the event.  It was really quick, 45 minutes.  Then we had hands-on time with the phone.  Both phones look great.  The S6 Edge Plus, say that's three times fast.  And of course the Note 5.  Note 5 looks fantastic.

Start time: 2555.12
End time: 2571.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They feel like they're the same phone with a few exceptions.  Both 5.7-inch screens.  The Edge, of course, is bent.  The Note 5 has a touch, multi-touch, what?  It's got a multi-pressure surface and a pen.  But otherwise, in every other respect, they seem like the same phone.

Start time: 2572.20
End time: 2592.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're similar.  The Note 5 is a little bit larger.  I think that they're about the same kind of surface area.  But the Note 5 is a little bit larger.  It's interesting because they made a big deal to point out that it has a bigger screen than the iPhone 6 Plus.  But takes up a smaller amount of space.  I mean, it's very, very slight.  But it is very, very slightly smaller than the iPhone 6 Plus.  iPhone 6 Plus is 5.5 inches.

Start time: 2593.00

Start time: 2603.04

Transcript:  Four gigs of RAM on both of them.  The cameras look really nice.  They've got this new mode called Live Broadcast, which lets you broadcast directly to YouTube.

Start time: 2611.00
End time: 2620.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now that's interesting. It lets you broadcast to YouTube Live.  Only Samsung does this right now, right?  But I've got to think this is a new...  This is something YouTube's going to extend to other companies eventually, right?

Start time: 2620.00
End time: 2635.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they should.  But what's smart about it is that they have it built into the camera app.  You open up the camera app.  It's unfortunately not as easy as just having one really easy to access button.  You've got to go through a couple of levels of settings to get to it.  But it is in the built-in camera app.  So you don't have to have a third-party app to launch it.

Start time: 2636.10
End time: 2642.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just like Meerkat or Periscope, except unlike those, it preserves it on YouTube after the...  Right.

Start time: 2644.08
End time: 2658.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know YouTube is obviously going to be better for that sort of thing.  Because it has a better infrastructure in place.  And presumably has a bigger audience.  So plus not having to open up a third-party app, I think, is a way that could bring it to the masses a lot easier.

Start time: 2659.26
End time: 2664.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did they intimate that this was some exclusive deal they'd made with YouTube?

Start time: 2664.08
End time: 2696.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They didn't make it clear that it was exclusive in any way.  But it certainly was something they were touting as their own.  But I mean YouTube has obviously been doing this live video stuff for a while.  This is just, I think, a smarter implementation.  But I would be surprised if I didn't see similar things from other manufacturers in the future.  But I think this is one of those things where Samsung is trying to kind of show the power of their ecosystem.  And hey, why should you get us versus one of the other brands?  Well, we can offer these types of experiences, including this live YouTube functionality built into the camera.

Start time: 2697.10
End time: 2706.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a weird device from HTC. Remember that little Periscope thing called the Re?  Oh, that was weird.  That let you stream directly to YouTube Live?

Start time: 2707.06
End time: 2714.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean anybody can do it if you've got the right software.  And I think it's clever of Samsung to just build it into their camera.

Start time: 2714.32
End time: 2716.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's not really that they have some special arrangement?

Start time: 2716.40
End time: 2739.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, you can do that. A lot of people do that to do a live stream of games as an alternative to Twitch.  And by the way, YouTube loves that. They've created a Let's Play portal now and they're really pushing that.  Yeah, and all the live stuff gets automatically archived to YouTube, which is also great.  So you just need to do the work to write the software that puts the video in the right formats and does all of that, which is good for Samsung for doing that.

Start time: 2739.56
End time: 2750.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like I would use that. I would like instead of Periscoping or Meerkat, I would YouTube to my personal channel.  If I weren't on the air all the freaking time anyway.  You're on too much.

Start time: 2766.81
End time: 2780.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think they had a problem with their yields is what it was.  I think that they thought that the that six was going to sell better than it did.  And the Edge was going to be kind of the one people didn't want, at least on the streets of New York.  I see the edge all the time. I don't see the six as much.

Start time: 2780.48

End time: 2835.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's beautiful. Well, in fact, I find I love the there's two things that make me three things that made me stop using the Edge.  One is that the Edge is live.  So it's hard. You have to kind of hold it like with little pinch your fingers or you accidentally do stuff on the edge.  That screen goes all the way around.  It's a little frustrating.  Yo, where'd you find that?  Did you download something new?  OK, just questioning.  And then I've got more phones coming.  Would you like that?  Yes, I'd love it.  All right. After you screw it up, you can have it.  Oh, my God.

Start time: 2842.06
End time: 2887.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Excurable. Yeah.  And and the it's got the problem that other Samsung phones, Android phones have had for me of weird hesitations that now Android doesn't have like this doesn't have it.  And this is a much slower.  This is a much slower.  Yeah, the much much slower processor, much less going on there.  Samsung's got this octa core dual processor to dual quad processors.  And I think there's some weird handoff going on the Edge six because probably do the NSA.  Maybe it's the NSA just saying, hey, hold on a second.  Let me write that down.  What you just said.  Anyway, it's the crap that maybe it's the loads on their HPC.  Does the same thing.  You can't get a phone from them without a ton of like crazy contact management management apps that you don't want and all kinds of weird stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dylan's exactly right.  It's the touch with for Samsung's case or the sense in HTC's case.  Having those skins on top really is a bad thing, which is one of the many reasons Google is trying to get people to move away from the skins.  Security being security number one, of course, number one.  But it hinders performance, you know, and it's probably not the best solution.  It hinders performance, you know, and it's problematic for a lot of reasons.  But you also understand why the companies want it because, for instance, Samsung, you know, that's how they're able to have that built into the camera.  You could argue they could just build their own camera app and not have to have their own, you know, ridiculous skin.  But, you know, they want they need something that shows, oh, we're differentiated.  This is us.  You use our product.  Don't use someone else's.  But the net result, I think, for users is that it's negative.

Start time: 2962.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  One thing I will say about Samsung and their note is that they really have nailed the note form factor.  And it's funny because a lot of tech people, myself included, thought that it was ridiculous when it first came out, when Samsung first came up with the idea of this.  What seemed like at the time a gigantic phone with a stylist were like, who's going to carry this around?  You're just going to look like a dork.  But it's funny.  It's funny. I see a lot of people carrying the note and often it's not.  They're like tiny little women with this giant phone and they usually have it in like a folder or something like that.  But they take notes with it.  They play games with it.  I see them on the train all the time.  Life's a comedy.

My clutch does not fit.  So for me, if I'm going out, a clutch is your smaller handbag where you maybe can fit a credit card, a lipstick and sometimes a small phone.  So it doesn't fit my baby clutch.  And so phablets are out for me.

I bought the new note five, but I'm just worried about the Samsung cruft.  To their credit, Samsung is updating for stage fright.  I've been pushed out updates on the edge on my note four and the Zimperium and Lookout apps, which find stage fright on Android devices.  Both say those phones are OK.  That Moto G is not.

That was a crazy little startup that was emulating touch to pay by sending electrical signals to swipe machines as if you were swiping a card.  And I guess they're going to build that into these new Galaxy phones.  It's a little late.  If if if something has NFC, you're probably good enough.

But it will also still work with NFC, presuming, you know, depending on your what those cases, it'll probably be Android Pay.  But I'm with you.  I had the exact same reaction that you have.  I was like, this is a little a little late, guys.  What's the point of this?  It is cool that they can tokenize the, you know, MST stuff.

Transcript:  So Microsoft has written off its $7.6 billion purchase of Nokia,  so that's gone.  That was a good idea.  It seems like Apple is...  We'd think that over time Apple would face competition  and people would rise up.  It feels like Apple just owns this, like it's done.  In fact, Android's market share in the US has,  for the first time in some time, slipped.

Start time: 3644.39
End time: 3706.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, since 2011.  It is the lowest percentage,  lowest number of users since 2011.  And it's interesting.  I think that what happened was, we were talking earlier,  Dylan was mentioning how good of a job Samsung has done with the Note,  and I do think they deserve credit for inventing the phablet market,  and a lot of people made fun of it, myself included,  and I still do think that phablets are too big for me,  but I won't disagree that it's become kind of the standardized size  for a lot of people.  But even though Samsung kind of invented that category,  by simply releasing the iPhone 6 and the iPhone 6 Plus,  I think Apple kind of gave a ton of people what they were looking for,  which was they missed the iPhone, but they wanted a bigger screen.  And it's really hard to compete with that when you're in a market like the US,  which is at this point basically saturated.  So it's not like you've got a lot of people  who are buying a smartphone for the first time.  Almost everybody is buying a replacement phone.  And so you're either going to remember your positive experiences  you might have had with an iPhone,  or kind of the kludgy experiences you might have had with various Androids.  And if Apple is going to offer you something with a bigger screen,  and if carrier subsidies are going away  and they're all going to cost the same anyway,  why wouldn't you buy an iPhone?

Start time: 3750.74
End time: 3773.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the problem, I think, is that Android phones are much cheaper, right?  So unless you...  If you don't have a lot of money, you're going to buy an Android phone.  But the problem is they get to that by having really narrow margins, right?  So Apple's making all these profits.  All these other companies are making cheaper phones, but they're not profitable.  So it's really hard to sustain a business for more than a few years.  How about this?

I was going to say Samsung's going to be okay because they make really good high-end phones,  and if you don't want an iPhone, you want an Android phone, the Samsung phones are pretty good.  They're beautiful.  And the last year, they've really turned over their industrial design.  They are beautiful.  They are solid competitors to the hardware that Apple comes out with.  The danger is that somebody's going to look at those Samsung phones  and look at a phone like this and be like, why would I spend more money?  This is great.  I agree.

Transcript:  We've been overpaying for phones for the last four years,  and I wonder if there's pressure on Apple, which is charging...  I mean, my last iPhone 6 Plus was almost a thousand bucks.  You got nothing but money, apparently.  That's outrageous.  Well, then why did you buy it?  I mean, admittedly, I loaded it up with memory, but it's still outrageous that...

Start time: 3875.10
End time: 3878.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fashion. And so there's a certain percentage that you will pay more for a brand than you will for just specs.  I mean, and that's just the nature of the game.  If you're seen as a premium high-end product, which is how Apple has always marketed themselves,  then I think you can get away with charging more.  The problem is, is if you are a company like Samsung and you're having plastic phones,  which is what they had before, you know, the most recent revisions,  going up against metal phones that are better spec, have better screens, and cost half as much,  then it's a problem because you don't have the cachet of an Apple where somebody can say,  well, yeah, I spent a thousand dollars on it, but it's an iPhone.

Transcript:  Well, if you want, if you're in a pool and you want to get underwater video, it's waterproof for a completely waterproof.  It says up to three meters for half an hour. It's IP seven.  Huh? Just dump into some water.  No, I never said that actually works really well in water.  It's supposed to work really well.  You have to start the video before you go underwater because the touch screen stops working, I guess.  When it's wet, but I mean, it starts again after you get it out of the water.  It doesn't. It's not a permanent thing.  Anyway, I'm intrigued by this next bit.  It feels like because the cell companies in the U.S. are not going to subsidize,  people are going to be aware of what they're actually paying for phones.  Yeah, maybe that won't hurt iPhone, but it's going to hurt everybody else.  So everybody's going to start making phone selling phones for a lot closer to what they actually cost.

Start time: 3972.68
End time: 3979.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a really good point because people up till now, people don't even pay attention to what the phone costs.  They're all 200 bucks.  $200 down and no contract, right? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it might.  It's a big market, actually.  Is it?  Yeah, it's bigger than you would think. I don't know.  I guess Vex's me is that so many of these companies, as Dylan was saying, they have no margins.  And so they're selling these at these low, low costs and they're not making any money.  And one of the reasons they can get away with doing that now is that the Chinese government is willing to throw a bunch of money at these Chinese owned firms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so my question is, what happens if China decides to stop doing that or things kind of go awry?  And what does that do to the price? You said before, you know, we've been overpaying for our phones the last four years.  I don't think we've been overpaying. I think one of the reasons the prices have gone to the point where they are now, no one is making any money.  If anything, people are losing money on these devices, but they've been able to get away with it because they're getting money from other places, you know, whether it's the government or investors or something else.  But if that dries up, then what happens?

No argument for me on that.  I feel like smartwatches in general are a category.  I thought Apple might, as they have in the past, figure out how to make the watch work as a wearable.  And I think, no, they didn't. In fact, Apple Watch is more finicky and twiddly and annoying than Android.  Who in the audience has an Apple Watch?  Two people.  One, two.  Hile Apple.  Three people. And then of course, Jason Snell does.  Yeah, I'm flopping over here. Just flopping around.  I completely acknowledge that there are people who love it and want it and will have it.  I love mine.  But I feel like that's not going to be a big audience.  Because they're not that useful and they're annoying.  They make you stand up every hour at exactly ten.  That I love.

Transcript:  As I am today saying, we'll see. Watch OS maybe will fix this.  But I was hopeful that Apple would solve this conundrum of how do you make something usable that's that small.  I think that's the real conundrum.  And I don't think force touch does it.  I think that the knob doesn't.  Do you really like that, Jason?  I really do.

Transcript:  Yeah, I do. It works for me.  But it doesn't have to work for everybody.  I think that's the point.  I think a lot of the problems that you're having with the Apple Watch are expecting it to be something that it's never going to be.  It's an iPhone accessory. It's going to appeal to certain people.  That appeal may expand over time.  But if you were looking for another iPhone, yeah, it's not going to be that.  It's not going to be that level of success.  No, but I like it.  Ever.  And my wife wants one, and she was totally skeptical about it.  Does she want one?  Well, she keeps her phone in her purse.  And when she's at work, if I send her a text and she's a librarian, if she's out in the stacks, she can't get a notification because she doesn't have her phone with her.

He's never seen anybody cry at their desk or anything like that.  He suspects a lot of these stories are from the early days of Amazon and that the company  has adapted and is not like that anymore.  It may be that they're not like that anymore in general or just where he works.  But I think...  This was really interesting and it makes you at least think about whether when you're putting  a story together about how awful Amazon is for the New York Times, do you ignore the  parts of it that don't fit the narrative that you want to tell?  This guy basically says, look, this isn't true.  Nobody asked me to write this story, but it's not true.

They actually have bosses, but they got rid of all the middle managers and they basically  have little teams of employees deciding how to fulfill whatever it is the bosses say that  they need to accomplish.  That's very millennial.  It seems to work pretty well from what I could tell.  I don't know.  I was only there for a day, but it seemed like a kind of cool way to work.

Everybody gets a trophy and all the rest of it.  And they said, that is a problem.  These kids are just patted on the back for doing nothing, accomplishing nothing, knowing  nothing.  They go to college and the next thing they know, they can't understand how they got to  see.

Transcript:  She's right.  She's right.  Just this week, there was a football player who got into the news because he showed a  picture on Instagram of two trophies that his kids had gotten.  One of these sort of consolation prize trophies.  And he said, I'm taking these trophies away because you did not earn them.  You cannot have these back until you have trophies that you actually earn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's one way of getting people to go.  So maybe you do want a bigger event.  iPhone 6, the next generation.  As usual, this is the every other year where they don't change the hardware.  They just, well they're going to change it a little bit.  Force touch screen.  So what are you guys predicting?  I don't think that force touch really works for me.  Do you like force touch?  I like it on the track pad.  I find it very confusing because I don't really, first of all, it's not a universal experience.  It's supported by the operating system but not by apps.  That's the problem.  You press, sometimes it does something, sometimes it doesn't do something, sometimes you think  you're pressing light touch and you're pressing force touch so the behavior is different from  what you, for instance, I find it hard on my MacBook to drag an icon because I press  hard.  And then it does something else.  So I think force touch, you know, it's always hard to invent new.

Start time: 5468.66
End time: 5505.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Supply chain leaks are the ones that really let you know.  All right, we'll tell you what they say.  Okay, so apparently it's a better reinforced shell for the outside.  No more bend gate.  Right.  I mean, which makes complete sense.  It wasn't really a major issue.  It was, I think, you know, the video got a lot more attention than there were actual  people.  It was definitely blown out of proportion.  But despite that, it makes sense that they would want to reinforce the metal where they  could.  So I think a little bit sturdier shell, I think force touching over the screen.  I mean, why not at this point?  They might as well.  They're making it on the track pads.  They're doing it for the Apple watch.

Start time: 5505.78

End time: 5537.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, sorry.  That's the bend gate guy.  He's here to show us it's not bending this time with calipers.  So these new shells, these are presumably the shells, right?  Because this is a supply chain that starts to leak once you start manufacturing it.  You know, it's weird, though, if there are supply chain leaks, why have we not seen new  iPad shells?  We've seen a new mini, I guess.

Start time: 5538.51
End time: 5574.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  Well, they might not have gone into production yet, and they're probably doing way smaller  amounts of the iPad than they are of the, you know, iPhone.  So they probably need to start way in advance for the iPhone.  I mean, how many did they sell?  I mean, they sold, you know, what, close to 200 million iPhone 6s.  So they probably got to start those earlier.  That said, we do have to be careful with some of these supply chain leaks because last year,  Marcus Brownlee got what was supposed to be the sapphire glass.  It wasn't.  And it wasn't.  I mean, that ended up not happening.  So I have a feeling that this shell is legit.  And I have that was the same source, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 5609.26
End time: 5622.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's funny because one of the reasons people believe the iPad Pro rumor is because of this  feature in iOS 9.  And we're seeing the code now of dual windows on a single screen moving around, which is  they actually showed it at WWDC.  Yeah.  And it works on the iPad Air 2.

Start time: 5622.88

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Air 2 works fantastically.

Start time: 5624.82
End time: 5634.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it makes more sense on a big screen.  And ironically, it looks like the new mini is the place that's going to show up first,  a much smaller screen.  What is it, a 9-inch screen?

Start time: 5634.60
End time: 5662.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the mini's got the tech for it.  It's got all the same pixels as the Air 2.  So if they do that and upgrade its internals to be equivalent to the Air 2 and come out  with an Air 3 as well.  That would be on the mini and the Air 3.  And then if there's a Pro model, I think the Pro model will happen.  I think that there's probably...  A 12.9-inch.  Yeah.  I think Apple has learned its lesson a little bit with phones about saying, you know what,  sometimes offering a bigger screen, they'll figure out how they use it and whether they  want to use it or not.  That's smart.

Start time: 5662.78
End time: 5680.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think that it might be something that they primarily sell with the IBM partnership  just because I can see it having some sort of consumer appeal, but I think it's mostly  a business appeal.  Me personally, carrying around a 12-inch tablet, no matter how thin and light it is, doesn't  appeal to me because I might as well just carry around a Macbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm coming to you on a Surface Pro 3 right now.  I have to say, there's some things about this I really, really like.  I've been using it as my primary computer for the last three or four weeks.  And it is lighter than a Macbook Air to carry around.  It's lighter and thinner.  You pop off the keyboard.  You can use it as a tablet.  It's a little bit heavier than an iPad.  Noticeably heavier.  So it's not the ideal tablet.  But what it's really good for is the pen.  Using the pen with this is like drawing.  I can take notes really quickly.  The keyboard is okay.  So it does a pretty good job of being sort of a general purpose, like switch between  reading longer form things or browsing the web or taking some quick notes in OneNote  or setting it up and typing and doing email for a while.  It kind of works.  So I could see how an iPad Pro with a larger screen and some kind of type cover could actually  be really functional for people.

Even with Windows 10, which is way, way better than what went before with 8.1, it's way better.  But like everything that Microsoft makes, it's got all kinds of little tiny annoying bugs  that eventually they're going to get ironed out, I'm sure.  But in the meantime are just frustrating and weird and janky and they'll never go away  completely.

Start time: 5825.16

Start time: 5832.70
End time: 5852.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  You just got to pay more over time in order to do that.  Well, you have to continue to pay 15 bucks a month.  I wonder if that will happen, that there will be a faster upgrade cycle.  It will probably have more RAM and be faster.  So a lot of people won't care about that.  It will have the force touch thing.  Who knows?  There may be some other little bit of hardware in there or the camera will be upgraded or  something like that.

Maybe they promised better battery life with the combination of iOS 9.  That could be something that could push some people.  But it's a great point Jason makes is that most people are not upgrading from the 6.  They're going from the 5 or the 5S.  And in that case, you're getting the bigger device.  You're getting the Apple Pay stuff.  You're getting the force touch.  And for a lot of people, I mean, I think they'll be really happy with that.

Start time: 5959.90
End time: 5977.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The world has bifurcated between people who will only use a camera phone and people who  are willing to spend time, because in HDR you still have to spend time post-processing.  Right.  They're willing to spend more time in that area.  They're more serious about their images.  But most people...  Remember, most people used Instamatics for years.  Exactly.

Start time: 5978.66

End time: 6000.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 6001.46
End time: 6041.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I mean, because we've kind of learned that it's the sensor size rather than the  megapixel counts.  Right.  To a certain extent.  Having more can help at a certain level.  But I mean, it's really the sensor count.  And Apple, to their credit, they've done a really great job this year with a campaign  shot on an iPhone or made on an iPhone.  No kidding.  Those are beautiful images.  Which is fantastic.  I mean, especially when they blow them up and they put them out in the stores.  And some of that work, when you actually see it blowing up, it's amazing what they've been  able to do.  And obviously there's post-processing involved and there's other stuff.  And it's really good photographers.  But that's just proof right there that these things can take really amazing photographs.

So you want some thoughts on the show?  Sure.  I think the show, for starters, and to be honest, I think it should be a little tighter.  There's too much chit chat on this show, which is fine.  And it should be a little longer.  I think tighter and longer.  Interesting.  I think it's really a two hour show.

Anatko has some weird, is kind of an interesting character when he starts talking.  I know it sounds way too geeky, but he's actually got...  It's somehow entertaining when he talks about comic books.  Yeah, because he loves them.  As you do too, Jason.  I think your network is not serving, I guess you could call it the comic book space.

Transcript:  All right, we will do a comic book space.  There we go.  Okay.  No, we used to send people to Comic Con and stuff, and you know what I realized is we  are for a tech enthusiast who's really interested in technology, computing, hardware, that kind  of thing, and a lot of people conflate that with the geek culture side of it.  Conflate.  There's a word I don't use.  That's a good word.  It's not extrovert.  I may be using it incorrectly, but anyway.

I think it's important for us to stick to our knitting, to really have a laser-like  focus.  When I left...  So you know what you get here.  We used to do Current Geek Weekly, we used to do some of that stuff, and it never did  very well for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  There's some overlap, but it's not 100%.  Well, you're a comic book nerd.  So I've got a whole network of geek culture shows of being comparable, right?  And when I left my job and decided to start up some tech podcasts, I went to a tech podcast  network to Relay FM because I didn't want to mix the two because I felt they are different.  And there are people who are sci-fi and fantasy and comic book geeks who are not tech geeks,  and the reverse is also true.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Gazelle.  As you're getting ready for maybe a new iPhone, a new Samsung phone, or gosh, a new tablet,  you're probably wondering, well, what do I do with my loving old tablet or old phone?  You could just throw it in the drawer, but that'd be like throwing $100 bills in the  drawer.  Nuts.  Nuts.  In fact, worse, because at least $100 bill is going to kind of hold its value.  That smartphone is depreciating by the minute.  Go now, my friends, hythetogazelle.com and get a quote on your old gadgets.  It is never going to be worth as much as it is right now.  Now, the nice thing is that quote's locked in for 30 days.  So by the time the new iPhone comes out or the new phone you want is available, you'll  know, am I going to do this or not?  There's no commitment except from Gazelle that they will give you that price.  So do it right now.  Get all your stuff.  Get all your gadgets.  Get the quotes.  You decide it's time to sell.  You press the button.  They send you a box prepaid.  They pay the postage on anything worth more than a buck.  The turnaround is fast.  They will wipe your data if you forget to do that.  I do recommend you do that, but sometimes they buy broken iPhones or iPads.  You can't.  They will.  They will also send you a check or a PayPal credit or an Amazon card.  By the way, they bumped the price of that 5%.  And you're going to basically fund that next purchase by selling the old stuff, Gazelle.  You've paid out nearly $200 million to over a million customers.  Now you may wonder, well, what happens to the stuff that Gazelle gets?  Well, some of they recycle.  Some they sell on eBay, but the very best stuff they sell on their site.  This is something new.  Gazelle sells high quality used devices, certified pre-owned.  There are two levels.  There's a certified like new, which is basically new, and there's certified good.  Those may show some gentle signs of wear, but you're going to save even more money.  Every device Gazelle sells is backed up in two ways.  First of all, they've been put through a very rigorous 30 point inspection.  They are fully functional.  The screens are clean.  There's no scratches.  These things are nice, sweet, in great shape, and they're backed by a 30 day risk free return  policy.  So for whatever reason you're not happy, you just send it back to send you your money back.  Gazelle.com, do it right now.  Get that quote because I'm telling you, your stuff's not going to be worth more tomorrow.  That's true.  Gazelle.com.  Have you ever seen a gadget?  Never.  Well, maybe.  Like some cars will appreciate.

Recently, NBCUniversal slash Comcast is beefed up its investment in Vox, which bought Recode  and does The Verge and does SB Nation, and they've beefed up their investment in, is  it BuzzFeed?  BuzzFeed.  Yeah.  I think that these companies' thinking is, no, no, no, no, we're not going to go the  Apple route.  We're going to reinvent ourselves.  We're going to become a content company for the internet, and these guys are going to  show us how to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does look horrible.  And so, and as someone who works at Mashable, I was a little annoyed with the name.  Yeah.  But our lawyers, no, I'm kidding.  But no, I mean, it seems to me odd that, like, it makes complete sense that you would invest  in these companies because they're future of content.  And obviously, especially if you're NBC, your content is not doing well anywhere, right?  So you invest in where content is succeeding.  But it doesn't make sense that you would think that all of a sudden you can create, like,  what are they going to do, create a traditional television channel for this stuff?  I mean, that's not going to work.

Start time: 6713.76

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 6727.78
End time: 6735.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not really lame.  You're going to have to subscribe to actual cable.  It's not enough to just have Comcast internet.  You're going to have to, I mean, look, the X1 is kind of an amazing box.  I won't lie.

Transcript:  The idea is you have one DVR and then satellite units everywhere else.  They never, and for a long time, for some reason, the Comcast box didn't know I had  HBO.  So, every time I tried to watch, I could watch HBO, but if I wanted on demand, I'd say, no,  you don't have a subscription.  Well, what am I watching here?  Well, that's no good.  The thing is a piece of crap, exactly as you'd expect from Comcast.  Nah.  So, now they're partnering with, besides Vox and Buzzfeed, Awesomeness TV, Refinery 29,  and The Onion, news sites like Mike and Vice, Mike is M-I-C, not M-I-K-E, and NBC Sports,  and this they say is to rival, I don't know if they say this or this is what the media  is saying, to rival YouTube and Facebook, but it's not internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's not.  I mean, that's the thing.  Nobody, no millennial, the audience they're going after, they're going after cord cutters  and, but increasingly what's scary-  But if you're a cord cutter, you don't have Comcast.  This is my point.  This is my point.  Exactly.  But not only that, there's an even scarier demographic that's coming up called Cord Never.  So these are people, once they graduate from college, never bother to subscribe to cable  at all.  Like I'm weird for someone in my age group where I actually subscribe to cable TV and  that's because I have-  What?  I do.  Well, and I love it and I'm not going to get rid of it and it's fine.

Transcript:  The problem with cutting the cord is that you miss out on a lot of stuff that other  people are talking about, like the fabulous Republican primary debates.  I agree.  I think more people...  You couldn't watch that if you didn't have cable.  And Silicon Valley, like everybody in Silicon Valley is talking about HBO.  Mr. Robot.

Start time: 6880.32
End time: 6890.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That goes over the top.  Mr. Robot, USA Network.  Mr. Robot.  I feel like really the truth is while we pay a lot of attention to cord cutters and cord  nevers, as soon as they get enough money, they're going to get cable.

Start time: 6892.10
End time: 6921.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I feel like the timeline here is going to be pretty simple.  I'm cutting the cord and Comcast will be like, all right, well, we're sorry to see you go.  But you know, we're really your only high speed internet option, right?  Right.  No, no, I'm not cutting the cord literally.  I'm just the TV.  I don't want the TV.  All right.  A little time passes and then Comcast calls you and says, hey, do you know there are all  these TV services that happen over the internet?  And you're like, oh, yeah, yeah, I've heard about those.  We could send you a box.  You're like, all right.  And at that point, you've got...  You've cut the cord, except now you have a cable box in your house.  And a $250 bill.  Get a Roku.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But this is...  But you are what everybody wants this.  Everybody wants more choices.  They want more content.  They don't want less content.  They want to watch the Republican debates.  They want to watch Mr. Robot and they want to watch their Roku.  And so I think the trend is really in the...  And by the way, cord cutting doesn't, as everybody's learning, save you money because by the time  you buy HBO Now and you buy Sling TV, you spend...  And you buy your internet.  You spend the same amount of money.

Start time: 6956.80

Transcript:  But what's happening here?  I understand.  I mean, it makes perfect sense.  First of all, this is the same thing the music industry did, right?  They said, okay, we're not...  Our business model, we're going to go kicking and freaking screaming and we're going to  do everything we can and partner with everybody we can to just maintain this business model,  which is why Spotify is allowed to exist, why iTunes is allowed to exist.  And then on the part of the content creators, well, why not?  It's just one more platform.  Doesn't cost me anything.  It's not an exclusive deal, I would presume.  According to Variety, G90, this is Yanko Records, one of the giga-ohm refugees who's a great  media analyst and now works for Variety.  Go90.  It'll be a mobile service launching, they say this summer, which is like almost over,  so they better hurry.  Yeah, I was going to say so, yeah.  Full episodes of TV shows from select networks as well as music videos.  It sounds a lot like Hulu.  Sounds worse.  The service will be, how do you like this, John, free of charge.  Nice.

Transcript:  I asked my daughter.  I asked my 23 year old daughter,  do kids your age or your friends, are they all using Tinder?  And she said, oh, yeah, nonstop. Really?  She said, but it's not just a hook up.  And it's mostly a hook up app, but actually she has friends.  Who she has friends who are in relationships that were started on Tinder.

Start time: 8160.02
End time: 8187.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely. People do have build relationships that way.  But for instance, my only experience with the app, because I'm very happily  married, is when my friend Carrie will let me go through Tinder for her.  And then it's a game. And I'm like, he is cute. He is cute.  It's basically hot or not. Right.  Yeah, you swipe left if you don't like him.  And then if both people swipe that they like one another,  then you can actually start a chat and a conversation.  And then it makes it very easy to say, hey, I'm in this area and I'm nearby.  Let's meet up and let's go out.

Start time: 8187.40
End time: 8193.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was if you go to a bar, it's a meetup.  If you mean this is of course it is.  So it's no different. Yeah, it is.

Start time: 8193.24
End time: 8205.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nothing wrong with this.  Well, no, there's nothing wrong with this.  It just it's a lot more efficient.  I don't have a problem with Tinder at all.  I think that it does exactly what a lot of us at our most base,  how we choose people, and that's based on looks.

Start time: 8206.20
End time: 8208.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it cheapens the human experience.

Start time: 8209.08
End time: 8215.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's a good point, because when you swipe,  you're you're merely swiping, there's no there's no text, right?  It's just a picture.

Start time: 8216.16
End time: 8324.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, sometimes they have their profile information,  but it's almost entirely based on looks.  But look, if you're using an app like this, it's mostly because you want to go  on a date, hook up, do whatever like it's not looking for love.  And that's the case.  You might want to use, you know, a key cupid or match or something like that  or or meet someone through friends.  You know, in most cases, and I've heard a lot a lot of friends  like using this when they go on vacation someplace or they're going to a conference  and that you want to, you know, go out for drinks with somebody nearby  or somebody in the area.  So I think there's certainly valid uses.  What Tinder took exception to was this article that Nancy, Nancy Joe Sales,  who's a great writer, she wrote this article for Vanity Fair about how it's kind of,  you know, the death of romance and and how it's kind of creating this dating  apocalypse where people aren't dating anymore.  They're simply just hooking up on these tenders.  And rather than kind of understanding that the perspective of the person  that wrote the article, who is, you know, a woman who's, I think, probably in her  in her 50s, who's writing this from a perspective of, you know, talking to young people  and it is is writing that as a trend piece.  It's probably not going to get all the details right.  But it's certainly an interesting narrative story rather than just sucking up  the criticism and going, hey, this is how big we are.  Big magazines are writing about us.  They decided to try to refute things point by point, insult her.  And which was stupid.  In like this 30 tweet, 30 tweets they sent out, 30 tweets  about in response to this article.  And it was absolutely insane.  And I'm going you're you're a brand who owns this entire market.  You have to deal with the fact that people are going to criticize you.  Just just ignore it.  You know, you're making bank.  You're your company that I see is spinning out match.  OK, Cupid and Tender into its own IPO.  Like that is insane. Like and Tender is a big part of that.  Like just accept the criticism and move on.  There's no reason to go after Nancy Joe's sales and Vanity Fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  30 tweets to 30 tweets.  You're doing wrong. You're using Twitter.  You're tweeting wrong.  I suggest using your company blog at some.  Yeah, right. A medium post.  Too many to write a medium post.  Medium posts are great for that sort of thing. Yeah.

Start time: 8347.18
End time: 8357.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that was the whole thing is that it blew up in their face.  If they just ignored the story, it probably wouldn't have gotten a ton of play.  But because they bought into it, people who were never going to read  the article read it and it got passed around.

Transcript:  Hinge that's the in this article, they talk.  He's interviewing a guy named Alex.  It's actually really it's a very funny.  Yeah, it is.  How does he do it?  They're talking about Alex.  He's a Tinder king, a young man of such deft text game.  That's yeah, that's the ability to actually convince somebody  to do something over text.  Marty explains that he's a hinge.  How does he do it? Marty asks.  This guy's got talent.  But Marty, who prefers hinge to Tinder, is no slouch at racking up girls.  He says, I play I could be a boyfriend kind of guy reading from.  But then they start.  This is the vanity for article.  But then they start wanting me to care more.  And I just don't.  Dude, that's not cool.  Alex chimes in his warm way.  I always make a point of disclosing I'm not looking for anything serious.

End time: 8423.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I just want to hang out.  This sounds like good dialogue for the radio play.  You keep wanting to do. Maybe you got the voice.  So hinge is another Tinder.

Start time: 8424.16
End time: 8436.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So hinge is like Tinder.  The only difference with hinge is that it actually hooks you up  with like your friend of friends.  So the thing is Tinder, you can be more of a creep, right?  Because, you know, you might not know anybody.  It might not be the same social circle.

I mean, look, I'm really I'm I'm I'm really glad I'm married  because I would not want to date in this environment.  It would make it really difficult.

Start time: 8455.92
End time: 8464.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a very different environment.  But I've watched that as my kids have grown up.  They never did date.  They went out in groups and there were and there were hookups.

Start time: 8464.92
End time: 8493.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And yeah, there are hookups and you meet people, you know, I mean, like  I was in a sorority and so, you know, you meet a bunch of guys  it for other things and you go out with one after another.  And then, you know, it's kind of one of those things or,  you know, you in the old days, you know, people used to find you on MySpace  or on Facebook.  And if you were in the area or in a class or something, I mean,  it's not that different.  This is just making it much faster.  And the geolocation aspect is what makes it, I think,  for a lot of people really saying and they get down to the bottom line.

Start time: 8493.74
End time: 8497.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Like, like they say things like, OK, you're a mile away.  Tell me your location. Right.

Start time: 8497.96
End time: 8505.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's the thing. It's efficient.  And you can kind of know, do I really want to meet this person  and hang out or not? You can meet in person if it works.  It works. If it doesn't, it doesn't.

Start time: 8511.88
End time: 8540.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's actually not a bad point, because that's one of the things  that kind of took Craigslist, you know, down.  Certainly was the reason I think it would have their personal encounters section.  You know, you've got to be careful to a certain degree.  That's one of the areas where hinge is probably a little bit better  because you are authenticating through Facebook.  So the idea is I can doubt this person can be vouched for  because we have similar friends in common.  And that also means if I'm going to meet somebody on this site  and we have similar friends, maybe if I'm a guy, I'm not going to,  you know, roofy this person because, you know, my friends will get mad.
