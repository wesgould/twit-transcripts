And one of the fun things about doing this show for me is I get to bring in,  whoever I damn well please, fun people that I...  It's always somebody I say, you know, right, Carson?  Oh, I want to talk to Rob Reed. Can we get Rob Reed on?  And lo and behold, he appears.  I said your name three times.  I actually...  I wonder what was going on. I was sitting in my living room in New York City and then puff of sulfurous smoke.  Here I am.  Rob, as you probably all know, but if you don't, you ought to, he's a good friend of the network.  He created, he was a multiple entrepreneur, created Listen.com Rhapsody,  then took his experience in the music industry to write a book that was a really good book called Year Zero  Aliens and pop music. It's a complicated story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And they love our pop music.  They love our pop music.  It's a vast alien civilization that is way too into American pop music and it causes problems.

Transcript:  You said though, you told me in an email you were worried about The Sophomore Jinx, your second novel,  your third book, but your second novel.  Fourth book actually.

Start time: 198.50
End time: 199.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Fourth, but second novel.

Start time: 199.56
End time: 203.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So Year Zero was a play on Year One, your book about your first year in law school, right?

Start time: 203.52
End time: 244.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a joke with myself in business school.  Business school.  It was kind of a joke with myself. It was like a working title.  So my first book was called Year One.  It was about being a first year student at Harvard Business School.  I wrote it long ago when I was a first year student at Harvard Business School.  And then when I started, made the pivot to writing fiction, which is a giant step in literature.  It's basically a reset button.  Just as a playful joke for myself, I had my working file, I just called it Year Zero.  Oh, that's cool.  And it was a phrase that I used in the book.  It was a phrase I genuinely used in the book.  But then the folks at Random House really liked that as a title.  It's like it's going to cause a little confusion with the old book.  They're like, don't worry, Rob, nobody read that book.  Yeah.  Oh, wow.  It was true. It was true.  Ow.

End time: 271.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, his newest just came out August 1st.  I was at the reading, the booksmiths that you did on day one.  On day one.  Of Year One.  And the new book is called After On.  And it is truly a masterpiece.  John Slanina has been saying, finish it, Leo, so we can talk about it.  He says, I don't want to give you any spoilers.  There's some spoilers.  No spoilers here today.  But it is really a great book about a near future Silicon Valley.

Start time: 272.05
End time: 306.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nine Seconds in the Future, Leo.  It's very near.  Yeah.  It's incumbent on the reader to read it very quickly.  It takes place nine seconds from when you start reading it.  So it is a long book.  So you have to read it rapidly lest it fall into the past.  But it's set in present day San Francisco.  It's wonderful.  And an imaginary startup, a rather diabolical social media company.  And everything that's in it, I research pretty rigorously with long  conversations with scientists and technologists so that the tech is very  much grounded in what could just happen tomorrow or nine seconds from now.

Start time: 307.09
End time: 310.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I know you did a podcast with Tom Merritt.  There's what, eight or nine episodes coming?  Yeah.

Start time: 311.86
End time: 380.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what we're doing is we're doing an eight episode podcast.  And it may persist, actually, because I've found that I'm having so much fun with it.  I may just keep going with it.  But basically, I interviewed so many fascinating people in preparation to write  the book, and I ended up learning so much about the main topics of the book,  which includes synthetic biology and quantum computing.  There's a great deal about super intelligence risk and a lot of other stuff.  And I found myself wanting to inject these like 10 page digressions about how  cool synthetic biology is at this moment.  And that's bad storytelling.  So my reward to myself for my compromise was we're going to do a bunch of podcasts  which are basically very long form interviews with scientists, technologists,  thinkers, founders that go deep into the technology and the science that's  connected to the book.  And then also the geopolitical issues.  There's a lot about terrorism.  And so I interviewed Sam Harris at great length for one of the podcasts.  And so those premiered on Thursday, actually, two days after the book.  And Tom Merritt is my host, which is fantastic because he is extremely seasoned  and has all the experience in podcasting.  And I personally like and it's been a blast.

Transcript:  Well, we're thrilled to have you so shortly after the release of the book on Audible.  But you can get you can also get it at Kindle and you can get it at Amazon if you want.  The dead tree edition.  And I have three copies and I didn't have any of them here.  They're they're all at home.  But thank you for bringing in your copy after on is the name of the book.  Also joining us, Amy Webb.  You may remember Amy, her appearance a few months ago on triangulation talking about her book,  The Signals Are Talking, in which she gives away the secrets of her business.  She's a futurist and tells you how you can look at what's going on today,  the signals and determine what might be happening tomorrow.  Why today's fringe is tomorrow's mainstream.  Amy, great to have you back on the show.  Thanks. Thanks for having me.  Looks doing great. I see you just got a business.  What is it? Twenty seventeen business award?

Start time: 442.83
End time: 446.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But, you know, I do write a considerable amount during each week.

Start time: 447.43
End time: 489.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he writes a lot at the register.co.uk.  And I saw your well, I saw your upset there.  Look, see all of that about Marcus Hutchins.  Yes. He so this is a really interesting story.  He came out for Defcon. He's a hacker.  He was the guy you may know the name because he was the guy when WannaCry,  the ransomware was was ravaging Europe a few months ago.  He was the guy who noted in the source code that there was a domain name,  a really long, crazy domain name, and it wasn't registered.  And so he registered it and turned out to be the kill switch.  Pretty much written in probably by the North Korean authors of WannaCry.  We think it was North Korea.  What does Donald Trump think it was?

Start time: 489.50
End time: 506.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Opinion is divided. Donald Trump.  It's a state. It's probably a state.  There are elements of state sponsored coding in there.  Certainly, if you look at the way that it was put together,  it's use of X NSA exploits, but also a whole bunch of other stuff as well.  It was it was not like an amateur.  Yeah. Yeah.

Start time: 508.14
End time: 530.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the kill switch makes sense if it's state sponsored because you want a way to stop its spread.  If it should get out somewhere you didn't want it to like in North Korea.  So there was a kill switch.  Marcus found it. Yep.  Set it off. Saved the world.  Except it brought him to the attention of US federal authorities.  Tell us what happened after DEFCON.

Start time: 530.70
End time: 572.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he came out to the I don't think he actually went to the DEFCON conference.  Was he here for Black Hat or?  No. I mean, he came out with a whole bunch of friends.  There's been an awful lot of misdirection going on here.  He didn't come out on a thousands of dollars expenses paid vacation.  He stayed in an Airbnb with eight friends and yes, it was a very expensive Airbnb.  In Vegas.  Yeah. But at the same time, it came down to less than the cost of my hotel room in the Flamingo for the Saturday night.  And I could tell you some stories about that hotel.  But no, I mean, he came out, he did the party circuit.  He met some people.  He did what British tourists in Las Vegas always do, which was you go to a gun range.  You go to the Grand Canyon.  You go to a gambling hall.

Start time: 572.54
End time: 580.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not coincidental that his decision of vacation in Vegas was during Black Hat DEFCON.  Oh, no, no. I mean, but his friends were here for.

Start time: 580.50
End time: 595.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, he didn't go to the conference for that week.  You have besides you've got Black Hat.  You've got DEFCON. It's the biggest collection of hackers in the U.S.  He came out here for this.  He went to some parties.  He had some fun.  And then as he was about to board the plane, he was actually at the airport on the way home.

Start time: 596.52
End time: 605.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where's he from? Britain?  Yeah.  They arrested him.  Now, that, by the way, is SOP, right?  Because if you're if you're at the airport, it's a lot easier to arrest somebody.

Start time: 605.52
End time: 616.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You've got a bunch of TSA people around who are so bored that they've got nothing else to do but to take control.  It's a controlled environment.  You've got a lot of armed police around.  It's a good good way to catch someone if you're actually doing it.

Start time: 616.76
End time: 625.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it does send a chilling effect to other security researchers.  Oh, it already coming to the United States that they might be arrested now if.

Start time: 625.64
End time: 630.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they didn't bust him for helping us with WannaCry.  No, they busted him because a different accusation.

Start time: 631.10
End time: 633.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, he admitted to writing Kronos, right?

Start time: 633.58
End time: 654.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Trojan? No, no, this is this is another thing he has.  We hate his his attorney has been on as of Friday afternoon had barely spoken to the guy.  So we don't know exactly what he's told the authorities.  Now, he did write a blog post in 2014 putting together a piece of potential malware, but crippling it so it couldn't possibly be used.  Like his instruction, right?

Start time: 655.50
End time: 658.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it was anti-malware instruction.  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 658.60
End time: 664.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you can't research malware unless you know how malware works.  Yeah. And he really did it to train.

Start time: 664.76
End time: 676.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, OK, this sounds like though making a lot of excuses for the guy.  The malware he the thing he created end up being sold as malware.  Am I wrong?

Start time: 676.66
End time: 686.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, no, the thing he created was a Windows XP bootloader.  So it had nothing to do.  It had vultures. As far as we can tell, it had nothing at all to do with Kronos.

Start time: 686.50
End time: 693.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He has been arrested, however, for writing Kronos, not for selling it.  But his buddy ended up putting it on the market.

Start time: 693.50
End time: 703.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Buddy is possibly a bit strong.  The guy's name has been acquaintance is his co conspirator to use the FBI's term, who has not been charged, we should point out, and has not even been named.

Start time: 703.50
End time: 705.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The supposition is he probably turned state's evidence.

Start time: 705.80
End time: 713.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's either that he turns state's evidence or they don't know exactly where to get their hands on him.  They don't want to warn him.  They have an arrest.  Well, he's kind of warned.  It all seems to be.

Start time: 715.50
End time: 717.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you ask me, he knows his name.

Start time: 718.01
End time: 734.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It doesn't matter if we know his name.  Yeah, but it all comes down to I've read through all the court documents, indictment, the rest of it.  It basically seems to come down to his word against Marcus's.  Interesting.  So you've read the Fed's indictment?  Yep.  The heavily redacted Fed's indictment.  Yes.

Start time: 735.92
End time: 738.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it's so he's by the way being.

Start time: 739.78
End time: 750.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't there a question about what for a while didn't like sort of nobody know where he was because the US Marshals had taken him, right?  Yeah, he had a big question as to like nobody could find him for a while.

Start time: 750.66
End time: 782.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And yeah, there were 18 hours when nobody, not his family, not his friends knew where he was.  I was calling.  Nevada area trying to find out if he was there.  Other journalists were doing the same.  The FBI finally came through and said, yeah, OK, we're holding him at our field office.  Yeah.  And they've been interrogating him there.  I got to say, as a Brit who if I was coming to the US an awful lot and the FBI came around and said, you know what, we really need to talk and sat you down in an office for 18 hours.  I'm not quite sure what I'd say.

Start time: 782.78
End time: 806.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you think he might have confessed to something?  I don't think he's.  They had an indictment written before they arrested him.  The indictment was filed on July 12th.  The feds, whether true or not, we don't know, you're guilty, proven innocent.  He has pled not guilty.  And by the way, the bail is not very high.  It's thirty thousand dollars bail.  Has he made bail?  Is he still in prison?  It was a timing thing, right?  Yeah, basically.

Start time: 806.50
End time: 826.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He went up into court at three o'clock.  He was given a thirty grand bail, a three thirty.  They then had to rush across town to get to the bail office.  They didn't make it in time.  So he spent the weekend in a jail.  And then on Tuesday he has to fly up to Wisconsin to go through the preliminary.  Are you upset?

Start time: 826.72
End time: 837.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I don't pretend to know the facts.  I just well, he was arrested.  There's an indictment.  Presumably there's evidence that led to his arrest, which none of us know.  Why are you upset about this?

Start time: 838.04
End time: 867.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not upset so much as I think it's been massively overblown, but also it's going to have a really, really serious chilling effect on security researchers coming to this country.  Well.  Because after he got arrested, there are a whole bunch of people who I know in the field.  Marcus has been a member of the infosec community for at least five years.  And is he respected?  Is he respected?  Is he a gray hat, a white hat?  No, he's white.  He does pro bono work for other other malware researchers.  He was given $10,000 for stopping WannaCry, which he donated to charity.

Start time: 869.58
End time: 871.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a good mark in my book.

Start time: 872.04
End time: 875.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it was also given free pizza from his local pizzeria, which is just for real life.

Start time: 876.11
End time: 879.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Which he did not donate to charity.  Well, no.  He ate that.

Start time: 881.15
End time: 886.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's considered an ethical hacker.  He's considered an ethical hacker, certainly.  Here's what I think.

Start time: 889.84
End time: 897.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of the problem is that we don't have clear case law on what constitutes a violation, right?

Start time: 898.20
End time: 916.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And in the past, the feds have been very overly aggressive.  Aaron Schwartz would be the big example.  Somebody who really was hounded.  Hounded into suicide.  And ended up killing himself.  And so, yeah, I think there is this distrust of federal prosecution of hacking crimes.

Start time: 916.66
End time: 943.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But also, I mean, we're facing a difficult situation because we have a thing called the  Wassenaar Agreement amongst 30 or 40 nations about what constitutes arms dealing.  And under the current U.S. State Department rules, simply having a fuzzer could be considered  software arms dealing if you exported it outside of the U.S.  So there's a tremendous disconnect between what the feds see as offensive hacking tools  and what a lot of other people see as basic research tools that you need to do your job.

Start time: 943.50
End time: 950.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the feds don't understand what he wrote?  That they didn't understand the purpose of it and misinterpreted his malware?

Start time: 950.74
End time: 989.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Far be it from me to sort of disparage the good FBI people in Wisconsin that I've got a reasonable  expectation that they might have over-egged the pudding on this one.  I mean, it comes just after Alphabet.  And my first thought was they grabbed someone at Alphabet, said, spill your guts or you're going to  prison for 30 years.  Pick the first name out for Hattie who you come up with and that's where the indictment came from.  Well, if that's the case, then I'm sure that Marcus will be exonerated.  I'm really not because considering the technical sophistication of most juries in this country,  I mean considering that it's a widely...

Start time: 989.54
End time: 1028.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think it's clear if he is being prosecuted inappropriately and ends up getting punished  inappropriately that that's exactly what the feds don't want because nobody in their right mind  will at that point help the US government in trying to stop malware.  I mean, that'll be that.  Well, that would be a good...  Because that...  Yeah.  I mean, he stopped WannaCry and as a result he's facing 40 years in prison.  That is not the right outcome unless, and I think it's perfectly possible, you know hackers,  it's perfectly possible that in addition to doing all this good stuff, he happened to write a banking  trojan that happened to bring down some banks.

Start time: 1028.54
End time: 1065.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's, I mean, it is possible.  However, I think you're assuming long-term rational thinking on behalf of the FBI.  Yes.  You're assuming the opposite, however.  Well, no.  What I'm saying is the FBI know that they need good security researchers to lock down,  you know, to make sure...  People like Marcus Hutchins.  Yeah.  Our computer systems are secure.  But if you're a regional FBI officer who's looking to make a name for himself in the  field, you go for what you think you can take down.  Now, looking through the indictment, it is very thin and they state that he definitely  wrote the Kronos malware.  Now, they better have really good evidence for that because people are going to take  it apart.

Start time: 1067.18
End time: 1085.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People defending him said, well, he never made any money from it.  You know, he didn't sell it.  Well, I think, and so I've heard some people say, well, it's like prosecuting the person  who made the gun for the crime committed by the gun.  But if you're writing malware, I think that's a little different than making a gun.

Start time: 1085.96
End time: 1115.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, look at the guy, look at one of the people who went down for the TJ Maxx hacking  incident.  You had a programmer there who happened to write a fuzzer for somebody not knowing that  it was going to be used in malware.  He got two years in prison for that.  Yeah.  You know, this guy...  That's wrong.  Yeah.  I'll grant you that.  But all you've got to do with a jury like this is convince two-thirds or maybe three-quarters  of people on the jury.  And I've had a prosecutor say to me, he worries about juries because it's basically made up  of 12 people who couldn't work out how to get out of jury service.  Yeah.

Start time: 1116.60
End time: 1133.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody who's ever been sued or prosecuted worries about juries.  Yeah.  And I tell people, we have friends, family members who have been in panel for juries,  they say, serve.  Because if you ever are on trial, you don't want it to be a jury of people who aren't  smart enough to get off jury duty.  Exactly.  Right?

Start time: 1133.81
End time: 1136.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's your duty if you're asked to serve on a jury.

Start time: 1137.08
End time: 1139.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And if you're technically literate, maybe you want to get on this jury.

Start time: 1139.86
End time: 1147.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if you're technically literate, chances are you'll be kicked off.  You get bounced off.  Yeah, you get bounced off the lawyers.  They don't want people who are technically literate.  One side does, one side doesn't.  Prosecution does it.

Start time: 1147.50
End time: 1149.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  All it takes is one side to boot you.

Start time: 1149.58
End time: 1163.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.  I think the facts aren't really well known.  It doesn't seem like it's a strong indictment, but it was highly redacted.  The other shoe hasn't dropped yet.  Yeah.  But I think we will watch this with interest, of course, as it develops.

Start time: 1163.89
End time: 1171.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, absolutely.  I just got to say I feel for the guy because, you know, he's stuck in a country that he doesn't know very well.  He can't leave it.  His job's up for balance.

Start time: 1174.37
End time: 1188.44

Transcript:  I'm livid about this entire case because the real challenge is that it sets a precedent for law enforcement going after cases involving technology going forward.  And the reality is that most law enforcement agencies and offices don't have enough technical competency.  And our laws are nowhere near close being able to keep up with the changes in technology, whether that's in hacking or in AI or in bioethics or regardless of what it might be.  So, you know, this to me should be a national conversation.  And it's not.  And regardless of what happens to this guy and whether or not he serves time, there's going to be another case and another case and another case and another case.  And that should have us all very, very concerned.

There are plenty of places people can go for DEF CON.  There's the Chaos Computer Club.  It has a great conference in Berlin.  There's plenty of places you can go.  They won't be coming here.

Those are the people of the problem.  America was a country built on bringing people in.  We are the others.  This reminds me of a story, we talked about this on Security Now on Wednesday.  Nice story about a Hungarian kid, a teenager, 18 years old.  There's a brand new subway system in Budapest, the BKK, the Budapest Public Transportation Authority.  He found that on the website you could buy a ticket, any ticket at all, and you set your own price  because the form on the website was so poorly coded, you could just go behind the scenes in the HTML and change the price.  And it would accept it and you'd buy a $400 ticket for a penny.

He bought a ticket so he could show them the code, but he didn't use it.  They arrested him. He's in jail. He ordered a $35 ticket for $0.20.  He is now in jail. This wasn't even hacking.  This was looking at the underlying HTML. He went straight to them.  He didn't buy tickets for his friends. Instead of thanking him, they called the police, had him arrested for hacking.  This is actually, this is in a way a completely analogous story.

There are so many things wrong, but what it goes down to is a million dollar contract BKK with a Hungarian IT company that created this site.

Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So to to to give a little background.  So funny back when I was running Rhapsody, which I found very stressful, part of me desperately wanted to be a fiction writer.  And my personal therapy for late at night after I was done with all my emails and all my managerial chores and all these things that were just so hard, I would I got online.  This is before the I think the playful Amazon review became a thing.  I started writing these kind of deranged Amazon reviews and I called myself Charles Henry Higgins worth a third of Boston, Massachusetts.  It's a sort of character that I invented for myself.  And he was like, you know, 20 years older than me and living in Boston in this crumbling mansion that it was an ancestral thing.  They ran out of money. And so he doesn't have money for heating oil.  He'd start these reviews and you get about a third of the way in and do a 180 and start complaining about his life.  I almost became a top thousand reviewer, which would have been really.  But none of these reviews were legit, right?  Well, no, they were all by this Mr. Higgins worth character.  So all these years later, I realized that these reviews that I wrote in 2002 and are still on the Web actually could plug very nicely into the storytelling of this novel.  You were writing the novel even back even back.  It's like boyhood, right? Because they are still out there.  And John Hodgman does read them. He'd be perfect for this.

And your reviewer Higgins worth writes like a charmed wind.  You're going to love this as writers. You're going to appreciate this.  This is a great lead. Like a charmed wind hurling vital provisions onto a castaways beach.  Fate landed a copy of this in a conference room in which I served a recent sentence to traffic school.  As reading was a scorned pastime among my fellow inmates, I laid easy claim to the volume, a mental sop for a mind numbed by the day's prattle.  I'll give you some idea. Hodgman does it better.  Hodgman does it beautiful.  I'm on it. Tom Merritt's on it. You actually have some great people on the audio version of this.  Felicia Day.  Felicia Day. It's on Honolulu.com.  Yeah. Great folks.

Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com, the post office in your office.  You don't need to go to the post office anymore because you've got Stamps.com  and everything you could do at the US Postal Service.  You could, well, not if you're in Albania, but if you're in the United States,  you could do from your desk with Stamps.com.  You could buy and print real US postage. You do not need special ink.  You do not need a special postage meter.  You just need your computer, your printer, and Stamps.com.  And I have to say, if you do mailing of any kind in your business, this is, it's just a no-brainer.  You've got to do this. But especially if you sell things online, if you sell at Etsy or eBay or Amazon,  I get so many packages that just look, well, like they were made on Etsy.  Like they were handmade, right, with twine and licked stamps going around the side,  and they put too many stamps on.  You want to give a little bit more professional appearance to your mailing, you've got to try Stamps.com.  First of all, we're going to give you an offer that comes with a USB scale,  so you always have exactly the right postage. You know, putting on extra stamps just in case.  You can actually print stamps from Stamps.com, but most people will put the package on the scale  and print a very nice label for the package. You can also print right on the envelopes.  Your label will include your return address, your business logo.  It will even populate the address from the website so you don't have to type anything in.  If you are selling overseas, it does all the customs forms automatically for you.  If you're doing certified mail or some other fancy mail where you have forms to fill out,  it will fill out the forms for you. You even get discounts you can't get at the post office on Stamps.com.  Print official U.S. postage for any letter, any package, any class of mail that even suggests the right class.  So, Rob, if you're mailing out your book, it will say, you know, these are books,  so you want to do media mail and save you big money. Stamps.com.  It's easy to create your account, no special equipment to lease, no long-term commitments,  and we've got a special offer that gives you a chance to try Stamps.com and get some really nice stuff.  Go to Stamps.com, click the microphone, in the upper right-hand corner, use our offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T,  and we've got a $110 bonus offer that includes $55 in free postage that you can use over the first few months.  You can't use it all once, but in a few months. It would be good for your Christmas mailing list. How about that?  You also get that great USB scale. You get a supply kit. You also get a free 30-day trial of Stamps.com.  Actually, I can't say free because you have to pay postage on the scales, about five bucks.  That's why they give you the $5 activity kit. It's a no-risk trial offer. How about that?  Stamps.com. We've used it for years, and if you're doing mailing, you should do it too. You could thank me later.  Stamps.com. Don't forget the offer code TWIT. Actually, that's how you thank me.  We're talking about the week's tech news. It's so funny.

All right, Amy, we're going to put you on the spot. You have to represent all of womankind.  Although a number of men jumped in on this.  So apparently there was a memo placed by a Googler, as yet unnamed Googler,  although if his name is ever revealed, I think we'll find out about it.  He posted it on apparently a Google Memes site, as well as the internal equivalent of Google+.  And the full content of the memo has been finally revealed by Gizmodo.  They got it. It wasn't probably very hard.  And I'm going to try to characterize this so that people can react to it.  The reaction has been very, very strong.  You know, Google has had a diversity problem.  The FTC has been trying to investigate them.  Google said, no, you can't have any documents.  Google says, we're satisfied that we're doing enough to hire more women  and more minorities.  It's apparent, though, if you look at the numbers, they're not.  Women engineers represent one in five Googlers.  African Americans and Hispanics even worse.  I think it's one or two percent African American engineers at Google's engineering division in the United States.  But this memo says, well, this is just another form of discrimination.  There's all this diversity, all this attempt to let me see if I can find the text of it.  It's pretty long. Yeah, I don't want to read it.  I can summarize. Yeah.  Can you, Amy? Go ahead.  So there are different sections of it.

Start time: 2190.52
End time: 2214.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the gist, the sort of gist of it is women don't make good coders, according to the person who wrote this,  because they're genetically just not suited.  Right. Genetically and socially not suited.  Now, they have other skills, he's saying.  Women are extroverts, men are introverts.  Right. So there's like a whole litany of women like people and like machines or things.

Start time: 2216.24
End time: 2224.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is like Larry Summers, the then president of Harvard, saying, well, women aren't good mathematicians.  It's just genetically the case.  Congratulations, lovelace.

Start time: 2225.72
End time: 2294.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Here's what I would say.  My viewpoint on this is possibly a little controversial.  I don't think so. But, you know, I would say that we are not all the same, that, you know, women and men are not the same.  But I would also say that within women, there's quite a bit of diversity, just like there's quite a bit of diversity within men.  And I think that the three of you sitting at that table are not, you know, archetypes or carbon copies of each other.  At least I don't think so.  And by this guy's definition, you know, I would read like a 16 year old teenage boy if we agree with how he delineates the genders in the memo.  So there's a couple of things going on.  One, you know, he's he's making broad generalizations about women and about men, which any sociologist would tell you don't don't track.  So his generalizations are, you know, anybody who's a coder has taken math, which means that he should have known better than to generalize to begin with.  He says the science will back me up.

Start time: 2295.12
End time: 2301.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2302.38
End time: 2395.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Point two, this had to have been a pretty low level engineer because the way that he's describing some of the work would tell me that he hasn't yet worked on any more advanced projects at Google.  He's probably like an entry level, 23 year old kid.  Nothing nothing. You know, there's anything wrong with 20 year old kids.  But what it does tell me is that, you know, his work has been binary.  So he hasn't had to solve any real problems.  And anybody who's ever had to think about the future or about the past or solve any real problems understands that biodiversity is a good thing.  You know, and that teams teams are requisite.  So to me, you know, this this was probably written by somebody in reaction to either a bad performance review or bad day at work or feeling left out of the club.  Or maybe he got rejected by a fellow coder developer who happened to be a woman.  You know, could have been any of those things.  But there's so much inexperience throughout the entire memo to me that, you know, it sounds like a petulant 20 year old who's, you know, who doesn't have a lot of experience and doesn't know what he's talking about anyway.  So I wasn't super angry or upset by the memo.  Now, what's been interesting is the reaction to that memo, which to me almost feels a little inauthentic.  It feels as though in the year 20, what was the year that movie PCU came out?  Do you guys remember that movie was like it was quite some time ago?

Yeah.  So he was actually a very he said exactly the same thing.  He's a very well known Googler, very politically active.  He has recently left Google.  So he said, well, I could speak a little more freely about this than I would have if I were still a manager at Google.  And he said exactly the same thing.  He said, when you first start coding, you are just dealing with the machine.  But as you get more senior, you realize really the job is not coding.  The job is solving problems and in particular, interacting with other people to solve those problems.  It isn't it isn't.  And I think you're right.  I think a lot of young coders starting off think what coding is all about is learning how to instruct the machine.  And he says, essentially, this is younger engineering is all about cooperation, collaboration and empathy for both your colleagues and customers.  Something that the memo writer said, oh, those are female traits.  If someone told you engineering was a field where you could get away with not dealing with people or feelings, I'm very sorry to tell you you've been lied to.  Solitary work is something that only happens at the most junior levels.  And in fact, the traits which the manifesto described as female are the core traits which make someone successful at engineering.  But I think the bigger issue, Amy, is that the lack of diversity at Google and in Silicon Valley, does it hurt Google?  Does it hurt the product?

Transcript:  Well, I would say yes.  And I would say, you know, one of the things that I'm researching most intently is artificial intelligence.  So that's been a big part of my life for the past couple of years.  And you can see the strange and weird ways that AI is starting to break or break down.  And that's a result of having too few people with too narrow a worldview trying to solve problems together.  So, you know, everybody that I know that works in tech likes to talk incessantly about nature.  And yet they seem to not take some very basic cues from nature.  Nature tells us, you know, that biodiversity is good for the ecosystem.  And it's always good to introduce, you know, complementary species and life forms, you know, to be together.  What I find so interesting is that we see, you know, study after study and anecdotally and evidence all around the biodiversity is great.  And yet we don't seem to take that advice when it comes to staffing the offices where the stuff is being built.  Right. Now, you know, it's difficult and it's hard to have this conversation without using those broad generalizations.

It is true that I mean, and of course, every individual is a unique individual and many guys have more female traits.  I have more male traits, whatever. My wife is much butcher than I am.

Transcript:  I think it depends on who you ask. Right.  I think Dinesh D'Souza, who's a right wing conservative writer, would tell you that stereotypes are born out of fact and that they exist for a reason.  Any sociologist who's had any real training would tell you that it depends on the data set.  And gender is not just influenced biologically, but also by the cultural norms and standards in each country and region and everything else.  And yet when I had you have kids, right? Yeah, I have a kid. Yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah. OK. Well, we have a boy and a girl.  And I'm pretty convinced that we did not in any way try to push them in any direction.  But the boy liked playing with guns and balls.  And the girl did not. And this was out of the womb. This was very early on.  I don't think this was socialization. So I agree.  There's a massive debate over nature versus nurture.  And I don't it's very hard to know what's nature and what's nurture.  I guess, look, I don't I think we do need diversity.  Clearly, we need diversity in Silicon Valley and everywhere.  Everywhere is every workplace is better if it's a diverse workplace.  It's just better for everything, for everybody in the workplace.  I know that that's true.  But part of the reason that's true is because every because people bring different flavors to it.  And I think you I don't think it's unreasonable to observe that women bring different flavors than men.  Or is that is that really a bad thing to look at?

Start time: 2762.24

Transcript:  Here's what here's what I would say.  Humans are not wired for change.  We are our limbic systems react very poorly when the status quo is challenged.  That puts us into fight or flight mode.  And it causes us to make bad decisions.  And more importantly, it causes us to pine for the way that things used to be.  And it's because of our limbic systems that a lot of people are not good at thinking about the future.  However, if we look from a statistical standpoint, you know, what that that change is often better.  Right. And that it helps us approach and understand the future in a better way.  What's happening right now is that technology has reached a certain inflection point.  We have enough people who are trained that can go in to the field.  We have enough compute power to be able to work on meaningful projects.  And, you know, because of how things have always been, those roles are predominantly dominated by white males and males from other few other countries.  So this is really about change.  And it happens through every field.  If you look throughout time, it's happened in every field and in every case.  And once that change happens and the workforce has become more diversified, they tend to be more productive.  They do better. It's all this data showing that.  So I think when it comes down to it, we're just dealing with the latest the latest round of this.  And we feel it and sense it acutely because it's the field that we all pay attention that us, the people who are on the show and who are listening to the show, watching it,  you know, it feels acute because we pay attention to it.  But it's the same story that's been written over and over again, you know, in law and in academia and, you know, in all of these other different fields and industries.

Transcript:  I remember talking to a man named Jonathan Haidt.  You probably know his stuff. He wrote a book called The Righteous Mind, Why Gold People Are Divided by Politics and Religion.  He's an interesting fellow with some very interesting points of view, somewhat echoed, by the way.  In this Google memo.  Boy, this is such a complicated subject. I want us to do this in a succinct way so we can move on.  But I'd also the memo says that there is unconscious bias at Google, but it's unconscious bias towards what we traditionally call the left as opposed to the right.  He says the bias in the left. And this is what Jonathan Haidt's research also shows.  Things like mercy, compassion for the weak, disparities, a real sense of disparities due to injustice, open, idealistic.  And by the way, one of the things he says echoes what you just said, Amy.  The left's bias is towards change is good.  The right or conservative, let's maybe say conservative versus liberal, but conservative bias would be respect for authority.  Humans are competitive. Change is dangerous.  We're more pragmatic.  He says Google airs so far on the liberal side that it misses some values that the conservative side could offer.  For instance, he says it's a good thing to have a programmer who doesn't like change, who wants to maintain a product.  And the problem Google does have this problem where nobody wants to maintain an existing product.  They all want to go to the next thing.  And he says in a company too far to the left will constantly be changing, deprecating much loved services over diversify its interests,  ignoring or being ashamed of its core business and overly trust its employees and competitors.  He says it could do it could do with a little bit of this more conservative thinking.  And Jonathan Haidt says neither side is right.  He always say hate. Haidt says neither side is right in this.  But there are these very different ways of looking at the world.  And I don't think this memo is wrong in one sense.  Google and most of Silicon Valley so progressive focused that there isn't a lot of room for somebody who's more conservative.

Yep.  You have a bunch of people who are out, you know, and then you have your outliers. Right.  Again, I think here's I worry about hive mind mentality circulating in any direction in any case, but but also having it specifically to do with this memo.  We you know, this memo goes wrong as far as I'm concerned because of the broad generalizations that it makes.  That's always a danger. Yeah, that's right.  That's right. But, you know, and this is my I was a debate nerd all the way through high school and college.  If I put my debating hat back on, like there's no way that I could argue any argument that comes out of the assertions that are being made due to these broad strokes is a completely worthless argument.

And this is not in defense of Google. Google has some serious problems when it comes to diversity.  But I just think we ought to be careful and cautious and making these assertions that everybody at Google is, you know, left leaning leaning everybody in Silicon Valley is left leaning.

Start time: 3197.74
End time: 3212.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is not a human. This is unconscious bias, because in our culture in America,  when we when we say CEO, women and men left leaning and right leaning,  are trained to think of, you know, old white dude.

Start time: 3212.84
End time: 3232.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, yeah, and by the way, that's the response that a lot of people would say, well, no, no,  this is what we'll do. We'll make a CEO Barbie in a mini skirt. That'll fix it.  That'll fix everything. My wife is the CEO of this company and is a CEO and writ large.  And I know the only CEO I really know is a woman. So.

Start time: 3234.46
End time: 3319.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, so again, like, you know, and to be fair, overwhelmingly, women are not CEOs of companies.  You know, you know, as again, it like as a statistical sample size, you know, we are smaller.  So my point is there is unconscious bias. There is a diversity problem at Google.  And the person who wrote this memo was obviously very, very young and feeling, you know, disparaged at work.  And, you know, but but again, the conversation that we ought to be having, I think, is a different one.  You know, and we should we should acknowledge that we're all pretty different.  But even within our our groups were really different.  And if you want to spin this out, you know, I mentioned A.I. earlier.  The thing that keeps me up that I worry about is that humans pretty soon, we will not have the luxury of of discriminating against each other in in these little taxonomies that we understand like gender and race.  I think within the next 30 years, we're going to have algorithms that are sectioning us off in a more Huxley and way.  And, you know, we're going to find ourselves in tribes that we we don't even understand and being lumped together by machines on the back end.  And that will have real world consequences.  But that's all being built by people like the dude who wrote that memo.  Yeah, the foundations of it.  So that's what Kathy O'Neill would also say.

Start time: 3320.50
End time: 3337.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Weapons of mass destruction.  We talked about her last week.  She's been on triangulation is that there's this unconscious bias being written into these algorithms now, a lot of it from enumeracy from math illiteracy and a lot of it from a lack of diversity and ignorance.

Start time: 3338.60
End time: 3391.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I would say the one thing that where I read this memo and thought actually that it's kind of like a stop clock is twice.  It's right.  Twice a day.  He was just saying that the fact that I'm writing this is going to get decried by some people.  And no, he's got a perfect right to write that to get get all these things out in print.  What he doesn't have is a perfect right to be taken taken seriously and not criticized for inaccuracies or for the failings and what he's written about.  There is a massive diversity problem in Silicon Valley.  There is a much bigger racial diversity problem in Silicon Valley than there is a sexism problem.  And that's not to minimize the sexism side of it.  But we've got to get this sorted out both as an industry and also as a society because you're right, Amy.  The most diverse ecosystems are the ones which flourish the most.  And we've really got to work toward tending those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And you don't write and to segment us into I mean, that's you know, I think I think honestly, I think my child who's who's, you know, young will look back 30 years from now on this, you know, the halcyon days when, you know,  how quaint it was that we were writing, you know, memos about gender discrimination in our workplaces.  You know, we're going to wind up, you know, it truly truly in a sort of brave new world sense being segregated into different type of tribes for financial reasons and mental abilities and all different all different all different kinds of ways that we've never really thought through before.  And we're assigning that decision making ability to algorithms that are being written and tested by people who don't share the same worldviews as we do.  And that to me is is a bigger problem.  But I do think it's interesting that if we cycle back, we really have started to hit a fever pitch, I think with regards to gender and race conversations and then people feeling very much like the conversation has gotten too far, which sort of reminds me of where we were in the late 90s.  And I don't know why at this particular moment in time it's happened again, but it's cycle.  I know exactly why.  The economy.

There are people who have lost their families from playing World of Warcraft.  But did they die happy?  They died with a full bladder.  That's all I can say.  That's true.  They died in battle.

They're very addictive.  And I think that there is something to be said for the fact that we have a generation who are at the mercy of this stuff, who sleep with their phones.  You just walk downtown.  Nobody's looking at anybody.  They're all looking at their phones.  And I'm just as guilty as anybody.  But the difference is my brain was fully developed before this happened.  What about the generation that's grown up in the last 10 years with the iPhone and the Android phones?

I was feeding the pages of the document because they wanted me to fax it to the bank.  And that went on for weeks, literally more than a month.  I think Lisa said it was a couple of months, so much so that we almost lost the house.  The seller was saying, come on guys, you got to get tell them what's going on.  If only they had rocket mortgage.  You could do this at an open house.  You say, I like this house.  Let's buy it.  You pull out your phone.  You go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit2.

Transcript:  Vic Gundotra.  So Vic used to work at Microsoft, right?  He was an executive there, got a job at Google.  And his first job there was interfacing with Apple, with Steve Jobs, on the Google apps for the iPhone in the early days of the iPhone.  He tells great stories.  Vic told great stories about how Steve would call him one Sunday.  He'd call him and Vic didn't answer because he was at church.  He was at Services.  And later he calls Steve back and Steve said, why didn't you call me back?  He said, well, I was at Services.  He says, oh, that's different.  He says, the color of the O on your Google app is wrong.  You got to change it and things like that.  Anyway, great stories.  But then Vic became completely enamored of social and said Google is missing out.  We're not getting so much.  There's so much data that Facebook and Twitter get from social.  We've got social's got to be our bottom line.  He lobbied Larry Page mercilessly, incessantly for more than a year, I'm told, and finally got Google Plus off the ground.  That was Vic Gundotra's baby.  Wasn't that a success?  Yeah, well, it wasn't a great baby, but it was a funny looking kid.  But anyway, anyway, he then left after the kind of the failure of Google Plus.  I think he left not in disgrace, but he said, well, all right, fine.  It didn't work out.  He says, actually started an interesting startup called Cartier, which I have.  It's a EKG and a little device that goes to your phone and get a doctor to read it if you've got a fib, which I don't have.  But Jeff Jarvis, who's on Twig, does and he uses it and sends it to his doctor.  And it's a great way to diagnostic.  It's one of the few FDA approved iPhone devices out there.  So he's doing great.  But for some reason, he's decided he just wanted one last shot to Google.  And he did it.  And I think this is not an accident on Facebook.  He posted pictures of his daughters, beautiful pictures taken with an iPhone and announced this is the iPhone is so good.  Throw away your DSLRs and and especially in the comment he says later.  And you don't need an Android phone either.  This is the this is it right now.

And so there is a true is it's an unambiguous great thing as these phones get better and better and better.  The camera phones.  And we always have that.  But there's until you can you just can't swap lenses on the phone.  There's things you simply can't do with light.  And so people who want to do a wide range of things in photography simply always going to be on cameras.  But I think it is magnificent how great these camera phones are getting.  And their ubiquity does mean that all kinds of things are being captured that never would have been in the past.  I think this is a really big societal change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So my first so I've had two careers.  The first career was as a journalist and I lived in Japan in the in the mid 90s.  And I when I moved back to the United States to go to journalism school at Columbia,  my phone had a camera in it and it was one of the first of its kind ever.  And the very first class.  So and I paid my way through Columbia.  So like I'm sitting in my I moved back to the United States, sitting in class first day.  It was an ethics class.  And the question was, should journalists be allowed to use digital cameras?  Oh, yeah.  And right.  That was that was the question.  Now, to be fair, this was this was 2000.  Right. So it was a while ago.

Start time: 4524.74
End time: 4527.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4529.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This this was not too long after the O.J. Simpson dual cover had come out in time and news.  We could run different covers and one was clearly digitally altered to make him look more menacing.  So, yes, right.  Yeah. So the question was, should journalists be allowed to alter their photos?  Should they be allowed to use digital cameras because you can alter the photos in that way?  And I raised my hand and I said, so I I get what kind of conversation we're having here.  However, I've just come from a country where people have cameras in their phones.  Right. And I pull out my phone, which doesn't work in the U.S., but I pulled it.  I was like, look, there's a camera in this phone and this phone is also connected to the Internet.  So theoretically, like I could publish this photo from my phone to your newspaper's website.  And everybody looked at me like it was an alien.  And I got dressed down by the professor who said, Mark, my word, no news organization would ever be able to do that.  No news organization would ever, ever publish a photo taken, a grainy photo taken by a phone.  And I said, but you're missing the point. It's not the quality of the photo.  It's the immediacy. It's the fact that I can I can publish visual content anywhere I'm at at any time.  And then I thought, well, great, I've wasted 30 grand going to grad school.

Start time: 4607.52
End time: 4621.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can imagine the professor 13 years later when the Chicago Sun-Times fired every one of its photo journalists  and told its reporters, now it's your job to take pictures with your phones.  Thirteen years. That's right. That's all it took.

Start time: 4622.66
End time: 4645.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's but it comes back to change. So we're used to thinking of quality photos.  And so to be now, I don't I don't think the iPhone 7 takes the world's greatest pictures.  Part of our sort of reaction, I think, has to do with the idea that we're in our heads, you know,  great quality photos only come from these kinds of cameras.  And part of our reaction, I think, is this a version of change. Right. So.

Transcript:  But I think it's a good thing.  And I don't I think Vic's point was more I'm going to give him credit, maybe that he doesn't deserve.  But I think his point was more that computational photography is changing our notion of what a camera is,  that the thing that makes an iPhone great is not its lens. It's not its capturing equipment.  It's the computer, the massive computer in the iPhone that takes those images and makes something out of them.  That's so much better than it should be. That has any right to be.  And the Pixel 2 does exactly the same thing.  Google's got a whole lot of artificial intelligence built into the software for the camera.

Inside of Facebook and the sensationalistic and not at all accurate, but really cool headline was that these two chat bots had established their own language that only they could understand.  And it was creepy stuff.  Actually, if you looked at the sentences that were going back and forth and Facebook, somebody had this diving save where they grabbed the power cord and pulled it out.  No, I read that right before Skynet woke up.  This was kind of like when the tabloids got hold of it.  But the first boy genius report article that I saw the first article I saw was on boy genius report.  It was actually the day before my book came out, which has something to do with this.

Transcript:  Well, I talked about this last week because Elon Musk is panicking about artificial intelligence and, you know, an artificial intelligence researcher at MIT, one of the most famous roboticists said that's only because he knows nothing about A.I.  And anybody who's worked in the field knows this is where this is not even close to coming.  You know, now maybe that's disinformation being passed along by the A.I. community.

Start time: 4901.11
End time: 4973.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're pretty far off from.  We're far off from machines making making autonomous big autonomous decisions.  However, the foundation is being laid right now.  And so if you think about a house being built, right, if you if the first layer of that foundation is a little off and then you build the next one and the next one, you wind up with a building.  It's a building, but it's a cockeyed sort of weird tilting, you know, building that probably wouldn't pass code someday in the future.  So, you know, I actually think there's plenty to be worried about, but it has to do with how, you know, how the corpus is being built, what's happening with the data and then what decisions we're asking the machines to make.  Because at some point in order for the systems to advance, they have to write their own software.  Right. And again, this is a little farther off, but it's within our lifetimes.  And then at some point, you know, we we lose some of that control and understanding.  So I do think that there's there's a lot for us to be worried about, but it's it's a lot more subtle, you know.  But it's concerning for sure.

Start time: 4973.54
End time: 4979.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but and this was the point the MIT scientist made. If you're going to make a law now, what are you going to regulate?

Start time: 4979.50
End time: 5025.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's the problem, right?  This is what this is. So much of it comes back to this.  And that is in order for our laws to be enforced and to be applicable, they have to be descriptive.  But it's also hard to because you can't have a law that's so over encompassing and broad because it'll get struck down and it'll get challenged.  People won't know how to enforce it.  On the other hand, if it's if it's too specific, it becomes outdated right away.  So one of the challenges every democracy on planet Earth is going to have going forward is how do you maintain some kind of rule in society and some kind of laws that make sense that are neither too restrictive nor too broad so that they can govern us going forward and that they can be.  You know, it's hard.

Start time: 5026.94
End time: 5050.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But even then, that's only in one country.  You know, I mean, there are a lot of researchers in a lot of countries around the world who are developing this stuff and there's no way one law is going to control them all.  And yeah, we're so far away from a singularity at the moment.  It's a joke. But even so, we've we've got to start thinking about a on a serious way.  And as you say, if the foundations are faulty, then the whole thing comes tumbling down again.

Start time: 5050.52
End time: 5061.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And to Elon's credit, I think a lot of what he's talking about is thinking now about AI safety.  And he's doing.  Yeah. And he's he's he's 10 million dollars to the the Future of Life Institute.

Start time: 5061.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And so even if it's wildly improbable that something terrible will happen.  And unfortunately, it's probably not wildly improbable.  Hopefully it is somewhat improbable.  But the consequences are so devastating that it makes enormous sense to be thinking about it right now and to be to be working about it and laying the right foundations.  And I think that's I think that's generally Elon's point, although he did say something kind of chilling that meeting with the governor's council, which I think is what you're referring to, Leo.  Yeah. Talking to the to the governors.  He basically indicated and it was sort of in passing that he had seen something that we haven't.  And it implied that he'd seen something behind the curtains, whether it was a Google or somewhere else that had really kind of chilled him in recent days or weeks at that point.

But at DEFCON this year, there was a presentation from researchers who'd taken Musk's open AI framework and had used it to develop malware, which would get past security antivirus engines by doing slow iterations and evolution onto the software.  Until finally, after 100000 repetitions, you got up with malware, which could easily slip by a security engine.  This stuff is coming, but it's just part of the problem.  We need to be hardwiring, you know, electromagnetic shotguns to these computers.  Foreheads is another matter entirely in order to test.

Transcript:  So so you have to have adversarial versions of the of the tools right in order to test and train them.  So I mean, that's right.  So one of the problems is in order to prevent and protect, prevent problems and protect us in the future, you have to train machines to recognize problems.  But in order to train them to recognize problems, you have to teach them the problems.  Right. So, so again, like this, this is why I don't think we need rules and regulations, but we do need some kind of meaningful way to have conversations that translate to more than just news headlines and white papers.  You know, we have to have good conversations.  And right now there are seven companies that really do control the fate of AI in our future.  One of those companies is Tencent, which is a big Chinese company, which, you know, last week had an AI chatbot start talking smack about the Communist Party.  Yeah, yeah.

Transcript:  Yeah, which is a pretty, pretty big, pretty big deal.  But, you know, every one of these companies, several of these companies say that they have open source.  They've open sourced their tools, their software, but these are still commercial.  They are commercially focused and in the United States.  So this is where things get really weird and interesting and different.  So China is pretty far ahead in a lot of ways and it's AI research and it's government funded.  A lot of it.  And the work is being done in academia, you know, and a lot of it.  So there's a big government component and it's a national effort to push ahead in the United States.  It's commercial.  All of our government is very, very far behind state military dode very far behind when it comes to AI.  The majority of the funding that that's going into it is commercially focused.  You know, and we don't have the academic.  We have academic research centers that are working on this.  But again, there's a commercial.  There's there's a commercial focus rather than it being for the, you know, taking this much longer view and being done sort of as big national effort.  So that's a that's a problem going forward.

Start time: 5305.00
End time: 5319.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Really? Which would you you don't think the commercial effort could succeed over the government effort?  Well, the problem is I think of the genome project where there was a government attempt to decode the genome.  I think it was a private effort that ended up.  Yeah.

Oh, you have an opinion on this matter.  I'm sorry. I got so Craig was he was so self congratulatory about it.  Just like. Right.  And then he tried to patent it, which was perhaps the hundreds of millions of governments have put into this.  Actually, I got there first time going to patent it and take all that money and I own the genome.

Start time: 5365.54
End time: 5483.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it depends on your perspective.  So I think that when it comes to the war of the future is going to be fought by by software, not by hardware.  Right. The hardware will carry out the software, but it's the software and the data that's going to be making.  You know, so and to be fair, like this is top of mind, because I was in Japan for the past couple of weeks and I was there when Korea sent its North Korea sent its latest ICBM.  Not that we were worried about it, but, you know, I was thinking a lot about it.  And the United States just doesn't have we don't have that same coordinated effort.  And so I'm a capitalist.  So I've got nothing against big companies pushing ahead and for commercial purposes, pushing into a eye.  The challenge that the problem that I've got is that I just, you know, as a nation, I just don't see us.  I don't see us pushing in a coordinated way ahead, taking a much longer view.  And so the AI that's going to get developed and again, you know, the AI that this is about decision making.  We are asking the premise of AI, the premise of AI.  If you if you really go back, all of all of the early systems were built on games.  So checkers chess go right.  And now there's another game that's that that we're training from the beginning.  We have trained these systems to beat us.  Right. That's that's that.  And what do you want them to do? Train them to lose.  My point is at some point, you know, we are asking you to make we're asking them to make decisions.  And not that I have any more trust in our government than I do in, you know, Google.  However, I like the idea of public money and public research being used on behalf of all of humanity going forward.

Transcript:  One of the things that worries me about commercial AI projects as well is that there's such a lot of hype talked about.  Facebook has been banging on about its AI chatbots for over a year now.  And then when you actually talk to them about it, it's not very well, it's not really AI.  It's a line behind it. This is like a line.

Transcript:  But when we think about AI, we anthropomorphize it. Right.  So so the real promise of AI isn't the human form that it takes.  It's the automation of all the crap that we don't want to deal with or do. Right.  And that has tentacles into all different areas of our life.  You know, Goldman's figured out a way to automate three quarters of its IPO process. Right.  There are all these different steps involved.  And, you know, they figured that out through machine learning.  So, you know, I think this is one of those things where, again, we don't realize the great opportunities that we created  and the way that we maybe seeded our future with some things we don't like until it gets here.  And we realize that we're sorted into different cases.  And suddenly we we don't have opportunities that we think we should have or, you know, life.  Life. Real life is very much an uncanny valley. Right.

We're programmed that way. Right.  So right. So how realistic is it that you're going to go back to writing letters and sending letters?  You know, letters and just, you know, it's just not it's not realistic.  So I think that there is a lot more to be concerned with.  It's just not very interesting stuff. It's not as interesting or as exciting as like, you know, autonomous weapons.

I don't know if, you know, I guess we should spend time doing it.  And Elon's funded many efforts to do that.  I don't fault him for that.

Start time: 5643.22
End time: 5712.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's we hope it's very useful. Right.  Because the number of scenarios in which things could go spinning out of control or the list is long.  And a lot of it in a lot of these scenarios, as they kind of get wargamed, are about a lot of people,  about smart people doing the wrong thing for the right reasons.  And unless you think through second and third and fourth order effects,  terrible unintended consequences could ensue as you start designing something that can improve itself  and improve itself at a compounding exponential rate that's much more like the pace of Moore's law than the pace of evolution.  And so I think that, you know, wargaming these things now and having very, very careful thought applied to it,  it may not be the perfect machine or may not be the perfect weapon.  I can't think what else we can do right now. You know, and so I do think it's an important exercise.  Nicholas Bostrom's book is now a little bit old. It's been about three years since it came out.  But it probably paints the most detailed sets of scenarios of what could go wrong.  And I do think that that is kind of been like the intellectual framework for a lot of the safety work that's going on right now.  It's called superintelligence.  Yeah, we interviewed Nick when that came out.  Oh, you did. Great. Yeah, very sharp guy.

When we get computers to do things like driving or...

Yeah, and we didn't plan for either of them, but we've got seven billion people on the planet right now.  It's humans.  And everything is interconnected in such an extent that if society does break down, you're looking at megadeths.  I know.  So we need to sort this out now.

I am a fatalist, but look, I mean, sometimes I feel like certainly our government is in a different dimension, a different world from the world that we're living in.  And anything that they plan to do about anything is irrelevant because they're almost it's an impedance mismatch.  They're operating at a different time scale than we are.  I know.

Transcript:  We don't have enough people who have any kind of science or technology background that go into politics.  We at some point years ago had an office called the Office of Technology Assessment, and it was staffed with, yeah, it was staff who were non-political.  And it was a teaching exercise.  Their job was to go and meet with members of Congress and help them get educated.  Gingrich defunded that in the 90s.  However, that office became the gold standard around the world.  So a bunch of other companies or countries have that office.  We don't.  And so now in the absence of the OTA and with so much change coming so quickly, all technology gets politicized.  And very few people really understand what it is or how it works.  So the US does not have a national biology policy, and yet we're standing on the precipice of CRISPR and editing embryos.  And we don't have a national AI policy.  We don't have people who are elected who even understand what AI is, even though they're talking about technological unemployment and displacement.  I think that's all true.

And has a plan for the future.  I think that could be worse.  In some ways, I think it's better.  Maybe I'm a little more laissez-faire.

I don't care what party they belong to, as long as they're using.  They believe in science and data and they're not politicizing technology to the point where our laws don't make any sense anymore.

Transcript:  OK, it depends on who I'm talking to. Or I mean, even texting, because it really depends on the person.  I mean, I prefer to be talking to someone on the phone if I have enough to talk about.  But if it's been a really boring day and I have nothing to discuss, I'll text so I have more time to think of stuff.  That's also probably part of it with dating is it's easier to text a guy than it is to call a guy.  So if you have that option, you have more time to think and you don't have to be nervous and on your feet, which is probably why dating has gone down.

Which took forever.  Took forever. And finally, about eight years ago, all the televisions, most of the television stations went digital, which was a good thing all around, I think.

His son said, Dad, you should know better than anyone.  There's no broadcast TV.  Broadcast TV is gone.  I had no... he's 24.  I had no idea, he said, of broadcast continuing existence.

I want to give Sonic a huge plug.  Our gigabit, 10 gigabit fiber line up and down comes from the best internet service  provider in the country.  Look at the deal you get.  You can go to sonic.com slash twit.  There's the address form.  You can fill it out.  Look at the deal you get.  One of my friends actually was Bimoni.  We went over the Comcast terabyte band and they asked how do I get out of it, terabyte  bandwidth cap.  How do I get out of this?  They said you have to get business class and he called business and they said it's two  different divisions.  The guy was, he said should I go Sonic?  I said yes.  Look what you get.  Look what you get.  You get fiber for home.  I won't tell you the price until the end although you can see it on the screen.  You get 15 email accounts.  You get a gigabyte of storage.  You get personal web hosting.  You get a domain name, custom domain name.  You get fax line service, phone service with unlimited local and long distance.  You get a gigabit down and all of this $40 a month.  And you can switch from your current carrier and you can port your phone number over so  the phone service is just like your old phone service.  But it's all total.  Flat fee, $40 a month.  And here's the other thing.  By standing up for privacy, Sonic will fight.  Look at their EFF scorecard.  Green checks across the board.  They stand up for their customers.  They fight government subpoenas.  They have no bandwidth caps, zero bandwidth caps.  Use all you want.  They'll make more.  And of course great local customer support.  Sonic.com slash twit.  Join the internet revolution.  Get your first month of Sonic internet and phone service free when you go to sonic.com  slash twit.  Bundle it with Dish and you'll save $120 on your Sonic bill.  And if you can't get it, I'm sorry.  I feel bad for you.  But if you can, there's no reason.  No reason to stay with those other guys.

They're all doing that right now.  It's also rumored to have an on-screen fingerprint sensor.  Should be interesting.  On Thursday, August 10th, Motorola will release its latest flagship phone, the Moto Z2 Force  with a shatterproof screen, dual rear facing cameras, and a design that facilitates Motorola's  modular extensions that they call Moto Mods, including by the way, a new 360 degree camera  Moto Mod that will be released concurrently.  Also on the 10th, Snap will release its second earnings report to date and it's not expected  to be all that great.  Snapchat has seen an escalation of feature parity among its biggest competitors and that  has been part of what has resulted in the value of Snap stock hitting its lowest points  since its IPO at the beginning of the year.  That's a look at a few of the things we'll be tracking in the coming week.  Join Megan Moroney and me on tech news today every weekday at 4pm Pacific, 7pm Eastern  here on twit.tv.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Snap has some really good patents that have to do with visual object recognition.  And so Snap as it exists today, I don't see lasting in perpetuity, but some of the research  they've done in augmented reality and visual object recognition and there's some interesting  things happening behind the scenes.  Wow.

Transcript:  It does show you though that any business that's relying on millennials and younger  for their business model not being fickle is doomed.  Why would you invest in any company that, well because they're hot with the kids right  now.  That's like the lifespan of a mayfly.  That could change at any second.  And it's easy to steal their features.

Start time: 7582.36
End time: 7599.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We used to see that with social networks.  Remember when Friendster came out in the United States?  Jonathan Abrams is a friend.  And then it was MySpace and then Facebook got critical mass and it's difficult to see  another social network actually taking over from that.  That's a good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And when you were talking about Snapchat failing to take $30 billion from Google, I was thinking  there was one even worse decision not to take Google's money which was Friendster's.  Because Jonathan or Friendster, his board were offered, I think it was $50 or $60 million.  So it's a rumor.  A lot of money in those.  Free IPO Google stock.  That's the thing.  And what Friendster ultimately was worth I believe was zero.  I mean they might have been sold to parts or something like that.  So yes it was free IPO Google stock which went up many dozens of fold.  That was a bummer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know of a PR agency that when Microsoft came to their country, Microsoft offered them  stock in exchange rather than fees and they said no, no, we'll take the money thanks.  And that was free IPO.  Yeah, that was free IPO and you were just like wow you could have retired at the end  in 10 years down the line.  We all make these decisions.  We all do.  I advised a friend not to bother investing in Google when it went IPO because there'd  be another better search engine along in a minute.

Transcript:  DJI, I didn't know that DJI, the makers of DJI Phantom, probably the number one sub $20,000  drone.  I didn't know that DJI stands for Da Jiang Innovation Corporation.  It's a Chinese company.  Maybe the Department of Justice didn't know because they've just issued a memo, the Department  of the Army saying guys don't use DJI drones anymore.  They are the most widely used non-program of record commercial off-the-shelf UAS employed  by the Army but as you see in this memo in item three, cease all use, uninstall all DJI  applications, remove all batteries and storage media from device and secure equipment for  follow-on direction.  We'll be sending Robocop to destroy it.  Follow-on direction.  Here's a sledgehammer.  So DJI by the way says we're surprised and disappointed they didn't contact us.  We could have probably reassured them because we're made in China.  Everything on this desk is made in China.  I understand, remember when the Department of Commerce a couple of years ago said don't  buy Huawei and ZTE phones because the Chinese military is a part owner.  Amy, you're an expert on China.  Is this paranoia or is this sensible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's bird's eye view.  Yeah, it's pretty amazing.  My husband and you technically you can fly it and do that at the same time, but I'm not  that dexterous.  So I usually have somebody else fly if I want to look and vice versa.  Listen, I don't know.  If you think about the information that could be scraped, I don't know how much.  Necessarily.  Yeah, that's it.  It's affordable.  You can fly it into a tree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 7877.94
End time: 7932.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  There is no technology that any of us owns that at some point hasn't had some interaction  with China.  So in terms of mapping, anywhere that you would want to that a Chinese government may  get excited about, you're going to have a hard time flying over anyways.  So because there's restricted airspace and it's hard to get to.  And to be honest, there's within two years, there are fleets of CubeSats and Microsats  being launched by companies that will be collecting real time, hourly maps and data all around  planet Earth.  So to harness me to get a snapshot on this particular day of the place where I happen  to be flying just seems like something that wouldn't be worth their while.

Wow.  That's enlightening.  You know, it was like, okay, well, no, fair enough.  And it's it's worked.  Everyone.  Okay, not everyone watches it, but a hell of a lot of people watch it.  And piracy has helped build up that base of people who maybe they parted the first couple  of episodes and then they signed on and watch the next four or five.
