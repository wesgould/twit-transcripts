Transcript:  And somebody new on Twig.  We're really excited to get the news editor from Protocol, Caitlin McGarry, on.  Hi, Caitlin.  Hi. Thanks for having me.  You have a beautiful fireplace. Look at that. That is spiffy.  Can you put wood and burn things in there?  No, that would be bad.

Start time: 223.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a fireplace. I just can't use it.  It's beautiful, though.  Yeah, it's gorgeous. You got a mantle.  Mantles are good for putting all your awards on.  It's always a handy thing.  Anyway, welcome all three.  I guess. OK, let's get out of the way.  How about that?  But I kind of have to report this on Friday.  Elon Musk at 544 AM.  Well, you don't want me to do this, Glenn?  Oh, no, I think it's important.

Start time: 259.18
End time: 269.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just that every it's funny.  I don't want to interrupt you.  It's just every single piece of media is so focused on him.  He's gotten exactly what he wanted.  I know. I know. I don't want to use his.  I know. I don't want to give him anything important.

Start time: 270.14
End time: 329.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's important. It is important.  So we're going to do this quick.  544 AM. He says, Forget it.  I don't want to buy Twitter after all.  And of course, Twitter stock goes down to 40 bucks.  He's offering 5420.  So that tells you the stock market thinks it's over his bid.  He then says, No, it's not over.  He then violates his NDA with Twitter, at least according to him,  because he tweeted that their bot review process only uses 100 tests or whatever.  I don't I didn't even understand what he was talking about.  But apparently the lawyers then called him and said, You're not allowed.  You're not allowed to talk about it.  He tweeted Twitter legal just called the complaint.  I violated their NDA by revealing the bot check sample size is 100.  This actually happened.  I am so sick of this story.  He is a troll.  Is that what is your position, Glenn?  He just wants attention.  I think he wants control.  I think he's an abusive person.

Start time: 330.41
End time: 377.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think he wants control.  I think he's an abusive boyfriend who is taking over the Internet is kind of what he feels like.  Right.  Yeah.  Like he's material.  If he doesn't get what he wants, he starts screaming and shouting.  He will violate any law.  You know, it's not restraining orders in this case, but it's he's being abusive to Twitter key employees.  He may be responsible for Twitter choosing indirectly because of how the deal is structured,  indirectly forcing out to longtime employees in advance of the deal, you know, closing maybe in a few months.  And, you know, it's pretty clear he's actually violated.  All right.  So I'm not a lawyer and there is one on this program.  So I will not comment in a legal sense.  But at a cursory reading, it seems like that he's violated the deal.  So Twitter could get out if it wanted to.  But why would it want to get out when it's trading at this point?  I said he. Yeah. Right.

Start time: 379.21
End time: 426.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's please.  Both of them have billion dollar exit fees.  But I don't think that if you get out for cause, it's not you're not going to have to pay the billion dollars.  Two very important employees were fired by Twitter's current CEO Parag Agrawal,  Kavon Bakepore, who is general manager.  He came to Twitter from Periscope, was, as far as I know, well liked at Twitter.  He was on paternity leave, tweeted, I guess I'm out.  Parag says we want to take another direction.  Bruce Falk, the general manager for revenue, also fired.  Yeah. You have to wonder, is this Agrawal trying to keep his job with Elon coming in or Agrawal?

Start time: 427.76
End time: 444.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  His better deal, though, is he gets a bunch of money if he has to leave.  So Agrawal, if I were him, I don't know.  I mean, this is being very peculiar or something.  But if he's forced out or immediately fired by Musk, he gets a huge pile of money.  Almost half a billion dollars. Yeah.  Right. So why stay? Right.

Start time: 445.09
End time: 447.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's all very weird. It's all very weird.

Start time: 449.37
End time: 465.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's all very weird.  And I think you hit on, you know, does Twitter really want out of this deal, even if it could get out  because of a violation of their NDA, which none of us know what the terms of that are.  Although this seems like something that would pretty clearly violate an NDA.

Start time: 466.30
End time: 476.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it violating the NDA to say that I just got called by the lawyers to say I violated the NDA?  That seems like a double violation.  Maybe they cancel each other.

Start time: 477.00
End time: 498.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's also just statistical Twitter was saying, and I didn't follow this, to be honest,  because I'm not part of statistical Twitter, that said that he absolutely misunderstood what Twitter is doing.  And so he was saying it was a hundred and it was nothing like that at all.  So he tweeted that and there was just statistical Twitter was just like, oh, this shows, you know,  it gave them an opportunity to try to explain what the basis is and what sampling has done.

Start time: 498.16
End time: 510.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, and that actually might make the lawyers even more upset because, Denise, if the information becomes public,  then you're not violating an NDA to talk about it. Is that sort of?

Start time: 513.13
End time: 526.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I don't know that that would necessarily follow.  And the other thing he might be violating is securities laws because any of this is manipulating the stock price  so that Twitter stock goes down.

Start time: 528.00
End time: 530.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Caitlin, you said he doesn't care about SEC rules?

Start time: 531.50
End time: 550.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, obviously not. I think the SEC is just a plaything for him at this point.  It's like he's just he's playing some weird game with them.  And I think he I don't know. I mean, I think his tweets on Friday were just him having fun.  Like, what does it mean to put a deal on hold? You either do the deal or you don't do the deal.

Start time: 551.12
End time: 555.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's actually not in a position to put it on hold. I don't think he's he's agreed.

Start time: 556.22
End time: 565.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They could they could force him to give up that money.  They could take it. They said, no, you agree.  So which would be hilarious. You got to admit that would be funny.

Start time: 565.02
End time: 584.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then he'd have to admit he didn't have the money how to turn off the algorithm.  And then he says something which shows his ignorance of open source.  He says I'm going to post the algorithm on GitHub.  Like somehow that's magical.  Like there is even like a section of code you could just post on GitHub.

Start time: 585.42
End time: 590.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be the algorithm. Doesn't even for anybody who doesn't know what you're talking about, Leo, you need to explain.

Start time: 591.24
End time: 609.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Elon has shown in the past his ignorance about what open source means.  When Tesla came out, he said, I'm an open source.  How to make these cars, which wasn't what he meant.  He meant I'll license it. You could pay me for it.  So there's a significant difference between open sourcing and you could pay me and I'll tell you how we do it.  Sure. So he clearly doesn't understand open source.

Start time: 610.97
End time: 618.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But he's saying anyone who doesn't follow Elon on Twitter.  Right. He's saying what is he what is he talking about when he's talking about the algorithm and posting it?

Start time: 619.02
End time: 713.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So when he when he acquired Twitter, he said there's a few things we're going to do.  It's very simple. It's really easy.  Why haven't they figured this out in 15 years? I don't know, says Elon.  But we're all everything free speech.  Only if it's illegal will we will we ban it.  And we're going to get rid of spam.  OK, right there. That's contradictory because spam is not illegal.  OK, and then we're going to open source the algorithm, which I think is nonsense on the face of it because I don't think it's one like, OK, here's the 15 lines of code.  What algorithm are you talking about?  I think he's talking about an algorithm which on Twitter isn't even like the Facebook algorithm.  It's just that if you want, you can go to your top tweets first or you can go to your latest tweets.  And it's an easy setting. He even describes it.  That's how I do it. Chronological.  Is that the algorithm? I guess that's the algorithm.  And is it is it something that's 20 lines of code?  Maybe. Maybe it's not that simple.  I suspect it's not.  I don't think it's simple enough. You could post it on GitHub.  And finally, there's the problem. GitHub, of course, a place where you could publish open source code.  Then there's finally there's a problem that the people who chiefly would benefit from this and people would like to game the system to get their tweets show up higher.  And who's that? Oh, spammers.  So the whole thing. We've had this conversation a million times. I got dragged into it.  He's just a troll.  I guess the last question that will go on to more important matters.  Is he going to get Twitter? What do you think, Caitlin?

Start time: 717.58
End time: 720.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is tough. I there's no right answer, by the way.

Start time: 721.00
End time: 722.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know. Well, it's not a quiz show.

Start time: 725.86
End time: 756.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure because like there are so many twists and turns.  Like one week I'm like, oh, this deal is definitely going through.  He's going to buy Twitter. And then the next week he says something.  And I'm like, I don't think he actually wants to buy Twitter.  He's like, now the funding is coming from a million sources.  It's not going to belong solely to him.  Like, it's not as fun as it seemed originally when he set out to buy it.  It's getting really complicated. And now I think maybe he's looking for an exit strategy.  So I don't know. Every week I'm my mind just changes.

Start time: 758.42
End time: 797.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Caitlin, isn't he being crushed by the margin or not the margin calls, but like he's got he's leveraged Tesla.  I mean, I don't follow Tesla very closely at all, honestly.  And but it seems like my reading of the financial side of that is he is leveraged so much of his holdings in Tesla and options and so forth that that with the drop in Tesla's price since the deal was announced and the general market downtrend, he could be heavily compressed there.  Like, I wondered when he made this call.  It's like, does this wind up with him losing control of Tesla and losing the Twitter bid at the same time and winding up less wealthy and no longer in that catbird seat?  And I don't I don't know. Maybe he could just walk away and pay a billion dollars at the beginning of April.

Start time: 798.00
End time: 842.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tesla stock was one thousand one hundred forty five dollars.  It is currently seven hundred sixty nine dollars.  And that's because it had a dead cat bounce. It was down to seven twenty eight half that amount, almost half that amount.  So and yes, he borrowed on margin.  He's the richest man in the world based on Tesla stock value.  So he's already lost billions and billions of dollars in stock value.  And he borrowed against the Tesla stock.  There could be a margin call if the stock price goes down enough.  That's probably what's one of the things we're propelling the stock price down.  This is not this is for those.  And every time we talk about Elon, I get email saying he's a genius.  How could you? Why don't you have somebody on that says he's a genius?  So anybody?

Start time: 843.58
End time: 847.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's playing five D chess or five D chess.  That's brilliant.

Start time: 849.71
End time: 920.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's playing us all because we keep talking about it.  I tweeted something about him and then I thought, oh, he got me.  I tweeted about him again. I don't I've unmuted. What the heck?  Do you think he's going to get it, Glenn?  No. I mean, I'm saying that definitively as if I know anything.  But I think that I don't think the market's going to respond.  Again, this is again, I'm saying this.  I try not to be a pundit, but based on what's happening in the market and worldwide,  you know, everything is going on. Right.  We have this whole situation.  A lot of I think fairly smart economists are saying the market is not going to rebound quickly  because of all these fundamental factors.  Tesla's down. Musk is already finding this a slog.  He's already done things that have violated public provisions that were in the data.  He's done things that have violated public provisions that were in the deal that was that was filed.  You could read and say, oh, he's did this and this and this as beyond any NDAs.  And, you know, does he really want to spend another five months going through this?  I suspect he is going to and is this this whatever percent he already bought of Twitter is down.  So he's taking a loss on that, too.  So I wonder if he just washes his hand if it walks away, pays a billion dollars  and decides it was a fun thing to yank everyone's chain for several months.

Start time: 922.20
End time: 927.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I was just working through again that he owns a lot of Twitter stock at this point.

Start time: 927.98
End time: 930.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so if he's out, nine and a quarter percent, I think it lasts.

Start time: 931.06
End time: 945.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. So if he doesn't buy it, you know, is he just cutting his losses selling that stock?  He's tanked the stock. I don't know. It's yeah, he's probably under water.  We're living in a simulation.

Start time: 946.86
End time: 1053.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which he fully believes, by the way, I'm convinced of it.  He's controlling the dials. That's the problem.  Yeah, I think the deal's gone south. I don't know if I think he wanted Twitter.  I think he underestimated the complexity of what he was embarking on.  And I think his shareholders, his boards on the other companies and general sentiment in the public  are going to convince him this was a bad idea and he's going to pay a billion and walk away.  We'll find out. I didn't think he was going to buy it, by the way. I said this is all a joke.  He's not going to buy it. So I consider my track record.  Meanwhile, state of Texas is not waiting till Elon gets Twitter to regulate with the new Texas Social Media Content Moderation Law.  We had Mike Masnick on Twig on Friday. He sent me an email or maybe he tweeted this after the show,  saying I had just read about the decision. There was an injunction that kept the law from being enforced  that the Fifth District overturned and said, oh, no, go ahead.  And it had just happened. Mike Masnick came on Twig and we were talking about it.  He said, I was not clear how awful, how messed up this law really is.  He says, I don't think most people actually understand just how truly effed up and obviously unconstitutional the law is.  I'm going to let our official Internet lawyer weigh in on this, although Mike, I think, is also a law school graduate.  I don't know if he ever practiced. The law declares social media platforms common carriers, which they're clearly not.  Why is common carriers important, Denise? What does that even mean?

Start time: 1055.42
End time: 1063.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's something like the telephone company would be a common carrier.  And they're regulated differently by the FCC.

Start time: 1065.14
End time: 1076.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, didn't the FCC say that Internet service providers are not common carriers? So net neutrality didn't apply?  They've gone back and forth under different administrations.

Start time: 1077.00
End time: 1086.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Depending on what they wanted to do, yeah.  Yes. Our current status is they are not common carriers as far as the FCC is concerned.

Start time: 1086.26
End time: 1102.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The reason that's important is you can't you don't tell the phone company. This is what the Fifth Circuit was saying.  Well, the phone company is not allowed to listen in on your conversations and say, we're going to ban you because you're giving bad COVID information.  And since you're a common carrier, Twitter, you shouldn't be able to either.

Start time: 1103.28
End time: 1212.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. That's just nuts.  That is nuts. But that's not what anybody has to decide at this point.  What was in place was an injunction preventing this law from going into effect until a court actually had the opportunity to have briefing and argument and decide those questions.  And it's the court that's going to make those decisions, the district court that's hearing this case in Texas, that issued that injunction.  The attorney general in Texas appealed that injunction to the Fifth Circuit, which is a very conservative circuit, appellate circuit of our federal appellate system.  And that court undid the injunction.  So the plaintiffs in the case who are challenging the law are actually now going to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in and say, hey, this injunction was in place and it should remain in place.  This law shouldn't go into effect because there is a reparable harm that will happen to, I suppose they'll say, a whole segment of the commercial landscape if this law does go into effect.  So we'll have to see if the Supreme Court decides to weigh in and reinstate the injunction.  That is a thing that could happen.  It is an unusual thing for the Supreme Court to do to second guess the decisions of courts below it on the question of whether there's been a reparable harm or there's the threat of a reparable harm.  So we'll just have to see that could happen.  But in the meantime, the appellate court that oversees this trial court has decided, hey, let's just go ahead and let this thing be the law.

Start time: 1214.27
End time: 1215.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see what happens.

Start time: 1215.40
End time: 1249.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, while it is being challenged on constitutional grounds.  And what might wind up happening is all of the arguments for how unwieldy the law is and all of its negative impact may wind up playing out while the case is actually pending so that the plaintiffs can actually make some concrete arguments.  Hey, we were going to say that this was likely to happen.  Now you can see that it's happening.  So it might actually wind up helping the plaintiffs case to get the law declared unconstitutional.

Start time: 1250.32
End time: 1319.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So there's a Mike Masnick refers to this a good thread on Twitter, of course, by Pope Hat, who despite his name is actually a litigator named Ken White, not the Pope.  And he says, this is why this is an issue.  The anti censorship provision of the Texas law says that any site with more than 50 million monthly active users can't censor based on the viewpoint of a person or the person's content.  So you cannot censor somebody on their viewpoint or how they express it.  What you can censor?  Well, you can censor content that's illegal.  Okay, that's a fairly narrow range, although this is this sounds a little bit like what Elon Musk was proposing.  And the site can censor other things, but it doesn't say exactly what those are, which means pretty much according to Ken, that every single moderation decision will be up to up for lawsuit.  That it just opens it up.

Start time: 1321.30
End time: 1347.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. So you can imagine that if all that starts to play out while this case is pending and the lawyers are drafting arguments about its constitutional constitutionality and appropriateness and validity, that they may wind up with a lot more evidence on their hands for the court to consider.  And remember, this court actually granted an injunction that prevented this law from taking effect.

Start time: 1348.16
End time: 1360.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But then it raises the question, well, even if this court rules in favor of overturning the law, the Fifth Circuit could then take it on appeal and overturn it down the road, since they've already indicated they had kind of been in favor of it.

Start time: 1361.56
End time: 1393.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've already indicated, and they didn't publish an opinion, but there is a transcript of the argument that undid this injunction.  And they've indicated they really don't understand very much about how the Internet works, what Twitter is, what's a common carrier, what's an Internet service provider, what is a website.  So, yeah, I don't have a whole lot of faith in the Fifth Circuit, even really understanding these issues well enough to reach a good decision here.

Start time: 1395.62
End time: 1430.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Denise, I'm not even a simple country lawyer, and I, reading this, I've got no law background, I've tried to stay up on the issues, and I read this and it just feels blatantly unconstitutional.  Because of the First Amendment.  Some ways from Friday.  Right, like so many different ways, like it seems so prima facie.  I look at it and I'm like, I have no specialized expertise, but just the basic phrases in the law that are used, the kind of imposition it puts on private companies, the way in which it imposes a government mandate.

If the Texas law stands, he says, there's no more saying it's Twitter's First Amendment right to moderate.  This is where it's confusing, because on the one hand, people say, well, it's my First Amendment right to say anything I want on Twitter.  That is not the case.  The First Amendment says government shall make no law abridging the freedom of speech.

They would all turn into 4chan or 8kun if you couldn't moderate.  You need to be able to moderate, if only to say you can't use the F word.  I mean, you need to be able to do that.  And you don't even need Section 230 to allow us to do that.  We're private businesses running our own private social networks.

And you can understand how if we're all confused about who to even vote for on these issues,  how a court like the Fifth Circuit might be confused or swayed or it's somewhat in the dark as to  how they should be considering an issue like an injunction like this.  It's a surprise that another circuit court has already held that a similar injunction in Florida should stand.  Right.  So right now we have a conflict.  And that is the kind of thing that can involve the Supreme Court even at this injunctive level.

And he is the justice in charge of overseeing the Fifth Circuit.  So it would go to him to determine if this is going to stand or not.

And I remember particularly because I try to hammer the drum about monopsony, which is the ability for a company to control what price it pays suppliers, essentially the ability to corner a market on purchasing things like Amazon is a monopsony in part.  And the new head of that new now, but the FTC had I think we're going to talk about that later.  Lena Khan. She wrote that great paper that was in part about monopsony and the inability of antitrust laws to affect situations in which the consumer price wasn't the issue.  And Kevin has written very interestingly about monopsony and other consumer protection issues.  So I don't know. It's it's what's a mixed bag like uncertain laws.  You certain things you like. Well, there's a six three majority now and others like Roberts is going to shade and maybe Kevin on and and maybe non blanket on the fellows name who the person.

But there's language in the bill, making it deliberately harder for sites to defend claims.  And it made clear that people can keep suing in different Texas courts until a court with authority over all those courts says the law is invalid.

And because of all the constitutional challenges to this law, and they've they've rapidly added language saying, hey, to the extent any of this law is held unconstitutional, it's severable and the rest of the law goes into effect.

The other interesting part is there seems to have been some effort and I don't know if this is what the lawmakers intended.  Maybe.

The European Commission a couple of days ago revealed long awaited proposals aimed at CSAM child sexual abuse material.  The proposed law creates a new EU center to deal with child abuse content introduces and this is the key obligations for tech companies to detect, report, block and remove CSAM from their platforms.  And you don't get to say, oh, it's encrypted.  We can't see into it.  You're responsible.  Including grooming.  Which is a very nebulous term.  You know that that really poses some real problems.

No.  We sent them to Texas for a spanking.  We did not.  But we have always had great negotiating with them.  So when we discover they've done something they shouldn't, they feel terrible, which is how, you know, that's good.  They know they did something they shouldn't have.  And we talked through like what the risk would have been and what could have happened.  But it was important to set the limits up front.

So it's always hard to know where in this it's right now.  It's a proposed thing.  But if it's passed, tech companies would have to conduct.  It's basically what Apple said they were going to do.  There was a whole furor in the Apple backed down.  They but install.  They said tech companies must start installing and operating technologies to detect CSAM.  And I guess really end to end encryption would be dead in this case because they say specifically it has to be used even when end to end encryption is in place.  And obviously that means there's no end to end encryption or you couldn't do it.  So this is not just Texas and Florida.  This is the world coming for you.

But I worked there six months and I had lunch with him all the time, talked to him all the time, never knew he was going to become a super villain, never thought he had this sort of disregard for other people.  And now he's on Twitter making all these economic pronouncements and things like he knows something.  And I'm like running one company in a voracious manner that disregards workers health and rights that that runs roughshod across local regulation that is in reported and regular violations of various laws that it's had a subtle subtle civil suits, all these things.  Maybe it's become a better company now than it used to be by force and offering better wages and so forth.  But it's the same thing.  Jeff, Jeff Bezos, Elon Musk, all these people.

Oh my God.  What a sacrilege.  Weird.  To which Jeff Bezos replies, by the way, thank you, Twitter, for giving us a chance to hear from these people.  What would they do without Twitter?  The newly created disinformation board at Twitter should review this tweet from Joe Biden.  Or maybe they need to form a new non sequitur board instead.  Raising corporate taxes is fine to discuss.  Taming inflation is critical to discuss.  Mushing them together is just misdirection.  Although I have to say thank you to Twitter, because immediately in the replies, a number of distinguished economists said, no, that's exactly how it works.  That's exactly how it works.  You want to reduce inflation tax the corporations.  Biden was not wrong.  And so it's good.  That's one of the things that Twitter does give you is a conversation.  And I think at its best, that's what Twitter offers us is if we can get it to be reasonable, not crazy, and not threatening violence.

Transcript:  And I do want to talk to you.  You do a podcast called The Source Code Podcast.  And I do want to talk to you.  We've got a lot to talk about with Bitcoin and crypto and NFTs and more.  So we'll get to that in just a little bit.  Our show today brought to you by the best thing I've bought in a long time.  About six months ago, Kevin Rose had convinced me.  And then he was on Twitter and Amy Webb was on.  And she bought it.  And then she said, this is the best thing ever.  Now I've got one about six months ago.  I got my 8 Sleep Pod Pro Cover.  Put it over my existing mattress.  8 Sleep also sells mattresses, if you want to get a whole new mattress.  But they do something remarkable.  It's the most advanced solution on the market for something called thermoregulation.  The Pod Pro Cover can bring your mattress temperature down to 55 degrees or as hot as 110 degrees or anywhere in between.  And there's reason why you want it to do that.  And by the way, it's got two sides.  So each side of the bed can have its own sleep stages.  It measures biometrics.  It measures bedroom temperature.  It reacts intelligently to all that input to create the optimal sleeping environment by manipulating the temperature.  You start by putting in the temperatures you think you want.  I like to get into a warm bed so I have it warmed up.  But then as I sleep, as I go into deeper and deeper sleep, it cools down.  That's actually what your body wants and expects.  And you probably know that if you've ever woken up burning hot in the middle of the night.  That's definitely not conducive to sleep.  And then I have it set so around 7 or 8 a.m. when I'm about to get up, that's the alarm.  My alarm is the bed starts to warm up and I wake up very naturally.  It's amazing.  As a result, eight sleep users fall asleep up to 32% faster, reduce sleep interruptions by 40% and overall get a more restful sleep.  I don't have to tell you how important sleep is.  It's nature's gentle nurse, the best medicine.  It can do so much for your health and just for your state of mind.  Lower your blood pressure to decrease the risk of heart disease, even reduce the risk of Alzheimer.  And yet 30% of Americans struggle with sleep.  Temperature, one of the main causes.  I think we're all starting to learn now that sleeping cool is really important.  But I like to get in a warm bed.  So I do that.  Lisa likes it really warm.  My wife really turns hers up.  Doesn't affect my side.  She gets her sleep information, her sleep metrics.  The bed's very good at that, by the way, because you're sleeping right on it.  So I have a number of ways to measure sleep effectiveness, but I think my eight sleep is really the best way to do it.  What did I get here?  Oh, I had a bad night.  My heart rate, my sleep fitness is only 78%.  I have to say, though, if I go back in time, it's gotten better and better.  I've gotten up to 99% sleep from this.  Here's the temperature dial.  You can see that at 10 p.m., I have plus three, then it goes down a little bit, plus two, wakes me up at plus three.  You control that, and the sleep doctor will automatically, the autopilot will automatically modify that if it notices you're restless and so forth.  Here's it in sight.  Your resting heart rate stayed high for longer than usual.  I must have been up to something.  Your sleeping heart rate was a little high last night.  Really great stuff.  Sleep better, more comfortably, with eight sleep.  It makes me a better person, and I think it will make your nights better, too.  Go to eightsleep.com slash twit.  They've got great Memorial Day savings now through June 6th.  You can cool down this summer with eight sleep now shipping within the U.S., Canada, and the U.K.  You know, those hot summer nights?

Start time: 3327.81

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was intrigued.  I wouldn't say I was impressed, but there were a lot of, you know, forward looking announcements.  Like there's a lot of hardware coming down the pike, which I think is really interesting.  I'm really curious to see the Pixel Watch because Google has just let Wear OS languish and has not been spurring its partners to like really innovate either on the watch side or on the component side.  So I'm really, really curious to see how the Pixel Watch turns out.  And I think trying Android tablets again is a really interesting move.

Start time: 3367.14
End time: 3389.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That is so weird because they basically let tablets languish.  And the real problem has always been with Android tablets.  The developers aren't making appropriate software, right?  It sizes itself appropriately.  So it sounded like Google, they don't have a tablet.  They said maybe next year.  But it sounded like they were trying to encourage developers.  But could you please write some software for tablets?

Transcript:  Oh, it's a business reflect.  It feels like, you know, one of my favorite things that fake Steve Jobs back in the day wrote was about the Open Handset Alliance.  And I quote this regularly because it was a great insight from a fake character and it was winners don't join alliances.  And, you know, that was sort of the story.  Does the real Steve Jobs say that?

Start time: 3466.04
End time: 3470.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 3471.00
End time: 3531.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a fake Steve Jobs.  And I was like, that is it's, you know, chef's kiss quote is the Open Handset Alliance was a way for Google to dominate a segment of the industry and to give handset makers and telephone, telephone carriers, wireless carriers a way to have skin in the game and control the outcome in a way that Apple wasn't allowing.  Right.  But in the end, what have we wound up with is you've got really Samsung.  I know there are other I mean, there's other companies in the business, but are any of them making a majority or they're making real profit doing anything from besides Samsung in the space or doing innovative things at this point?  They were a few years ago.  So does it wind up being Google and Samsung are really the Android makers and Google has to essentially take over that.  Isn't that I mean, by the by announcing a twenty twenty three tablet, isn't that kind of saying, well, we're getting into the hard work.  I mean, not getting into.  I realize, but we're going to make this a priority in the way that Apple has.  It just feels like they've kind of ignored a lot of stuff going by, hoping partnerships would make it happen when they weren't as interested.

Transcript:  Well, I remember they didn't say anything during I.O. about Chrome OS, which is arguably a very successful.  I mean, second only to Android in terms of success.  They didn't even mention it at I.O., which was weird.  So I looked up the fake Steve Jobs quote, which came from 2007 and is just as applicable today.  He says, does it not occur to anyone that Google is desperately grasping at straws lately?  This is 2007.  Nothing they've ever done outside of searches ever worked.  This is 2007.  It's still true.  Fifteen years later.

Remember the whole big thing with the Google earbuds and you'd put them in and somebody else would do it.  You'd put them in and somebody else would put them in and you'd be talking each in a different language and you'd hear them in your language and they'd hear you.  And yeah, remember that?  That was five years ago.  Where are those?  They never came out.

And they added a feature to Skype.  I think it was years ago.  And it's stunningly perfect translation, but also transcription.  So my wife has some vision impairment issues.  I know a lot of people with low vision and hearing impairment and so forth.  I did an interview once with somebody who had no hearing but was using an AI translator to transcribe as I spoke.  So these are incredible innovations.  And so Skype has had this feature built in and nobody knows it exists, I think.

Transcript:  Google does have real-time captioning, which I love, in the Pixel 6.  And I think they're rolling it out to Android 12 as well.  And they said that they will have translation in that, which again could be very cool.  That might be more closer than these glasses.  Ultimately, these glasses are great.  I mean, they showed a video of two women.  The mother only spoke Mandarin.  The daughter only spoke English.  They're wearing these glasses.  As her mother speaks, she's seeing an English translation and the heads up display.  So she's looking right at her mother, but she's seeing the text in front of, you know, projected in front of her.  So she can and then she can talk back in English and her mother.  Again, a wonderful demo.  I thought a great demo.  But a demo only.  And I, you know, this will remain to be seen.  And of course, they aren't going to be so ugly.  Although, you know, they're not as bad as Google Glass, right?  I mean, that's pretty cool.

Transcript:  Well, but there's a problem because you've got to get a computer in there.  You know, what they didn't show is the battery life is four and a half minutes.  Probably.  I mean, it's got to fit in the temple.  This is a hard thing to do with the current technology.  So this is, you know, it's very Google where they show stuff, but it might as well be science fiction.  Even so, they did announce the watch.  Caitlin's all excited.  And I think it's a beautiful.  I think it's a nice looking watch and I'd love to see them do something with Android Wear.  And as I agree with you, Denise, I think it'd be nice to see some competition for the Apple Watch,  which I'm wearing.  But they said, but it's not available this fall with it with the Pixel 7.  It's like, OK.  So, oh, they announced the Pixel 6A available in two months.  July 21st preorder, July 28th delivery.

I don't know if they will be because even the Fitbit, I think the heart rate monitor on Apple is better than anything.  Even the Fitbit's right.  Am I wrong?  I don't know.  Does anybody wear Fitbit?  I wear an old-style Fitbit.

Transcript:  Fitbit's definitely gotten way better in recent years.  And I think Fitbit software has always been really good, but Fitbit's hardware team, I don't know.  There's some questionable decisions being made over there.  So the Pixel Watch looks great.  And that was like a big concern.  So if they can figure out how to marry the Fitbit software and fix some of the problems with Wear OS, then it looks like a really, you know, it looks like it will be a potential Apple Watch rival.  And I think the timing, I think they announced, you know, coming this fall because like people are wondering what to buy.  They know the Apple Watch comes out every September with the iPhone.  So I think setting some expectations there is good.  Or maybe they're trying to rush something to beat Samsung.

Start time: 3901.14
End time: 3908.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Part of this is because it always leaks out, right?  As the Pixel Watch did in the Pixel 7, they even showed pictures of that because it's going to leak out because they can't control it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel like Google at this point is just saying, yeah, yeah, you're right.  Here's what it looks like.  They didn't talk about features at all.  So to answer your question, I think health is one thing, but it's got to be as good as the Apple Watch.  The Apple Watch, I think Apple does a huge amount.  And I'm like, I'm not an Apple fanboy, but I think they do a huge amount of machine learning stuff with people doing a lot of things to figure out what are the rhythms of those exercises so they can accurately measure them.  And I think that they really are the kings of this.  So for that, for a lot of people, there's a great book that just came out, Tripp Micheals After Steve.  In fact, I'm an interview trip on Thursday.  Really wonderful reading it right now.  When the Apple Watch, when Johnny Ive designed the Apple Watch, he envisioned it as a fashion statement.  He you know, that's why they did an eighty nine thousand dollar gold one because he he saw it not as not as you know, as technology.  He wanted to compete with Rolex. He saw it as a fashion statement.  And then later, as time went by and Johnny left and Tim Cook kind of gained a sentencing, it became it was clear that it was about fitness.  But I still do things. For instance, I have drafts on my complication.  I record notes all the time.  Oh, that's good.  So it's useful for that.

Transcript:  Apple used the watch as a way to iterate on this idea, right?  There was nobody who they felt was big enough in the wear space.  So they came out with a thing that was engineered around fashion.  They didn't know exactly what it would do, what the market was.  And they went through a few versions like, oh, it's about fitness.  And then they leaned into it.  Exactly.  You know, I've got a I have an underlying heart condition.  It's fully treatable.  I should live a long and healthy life.  Oh, good.  And I don't need it monitored constantly.  But I got to tell you, the EKG feature in an Apple watch, I haven't bought one yet.  I owned one briefly when the one point came out.  I tested it for a while and I sold it to somebody else and I haven't owned one since.  But, you know, they're slowly the I need a little quantification.  I work at a desk all day.  I need a little quantification to force me to reconcile what I'm doing.  And then these extra features, the pulse.  I mean, I don't know if any of you know, but no people that this has happened to.  But I know at least I want to say it's three people now who an Apple watch has warned them about a cardiac event.  And it may have saved their life.  And a couple of the written articles about it.  But it's you know, then there's that's a incredible benefit.  So they have found use cases that are not fitness is general.  But I think there's a lot of people were generally about health who are happy to to get one for the fall, the fall sensor, the EKG feature.

I remember we've all seen the Apple ads.  It was during the NFL playoffs in the Super Bowl of, you know, I help I've crashed and I don't know and I can't.  And they're calling for help.  And the help comes from the Apple watch.  Google showed the same ad.  They did the same thing.  It's like, did you not see that Apple already kind of did that ad?  I guess they want to show that they also you can call for help with your Google phone.  Well, not yet, but soon you can call for help with your Google.  Don't get hurt yet.  Wait for a little bit.  I feel like Google's lost its mojo, to be honest with you.  Just like fake Steve Jobs 15 years ago.  I feel like they're desperately searching for a follow up and search and advertising is keeping them afloat.  But they have yet to find anything that is, you know, that they're good enough at, to be honest with you.  I mean, Android successful, but not because of Google, because of Samsung and 100 other manufacturers.

Transcript:  I have to drink coffee just to keep up with you guys.  I keep the brain going.  Let me talk a little bit about since we were talking about crypto and you've  probably seen what's happened to crypto over the last week.  Our show today brought to you by Wealthfront.  Every once in a while, I'll see my kids, for instance, my kids, my friends,  my kids, for instance, my daughter was doing your taxes.  And she said, Dad, do I have to report crypto?  I said, well, did you make any money?  She says, oh, no, I lost a lot of money.  I said, no, you don't have to report that.  It's OK.  She said, she was big on Dogecoin.  Perhaps you remember it.  I this is what I tell my kids and I tell you and I especially tell young people.  And I wish somebody told me this when I was in my 20s.  Sure, it's fun to play the stock market.  Timing is so hard.  You can't really know when a stock is going to take off or when it's going to go down.  In fact, maybe you've learned that same thing with Bitcoin, same thing with any crypto.  Look, stock trading crypto.  It's fun.  It's a wild ride.  But the thrill of risking it all is best enjoyed in moderation, like playing roulette or eating  tacos from the taco truck down the street.  If you're playing the market, I hope for your sake, you're stashing some safer money in  a place like Wealthfront.  Day trading stocks is not the secret to investing success.  Wealthfront has a ton of data to show this is important.  It's important that time in the market almost always beats timing the market.  Wealthfront has globally diversified, very important words, globally diversified portfolios.  They do a lot of things you would do if you wanted to pay attention all the time, like  like tax loss harvesting, taking advantage of losses to boost your returns with automatic  tax breaks, rebalancing automatically so you don't get too heavy in any one sector.  Those are all done automatically so you don't have to spend a lot of energy thinking about it.  Now Wealthfront's gotten, it's nice because people, in the past you put money in Wealthfront  and you say, I have a certain amount of risk tolerance.  Here's my time frame.  I'm saving for a college fund for my kids or to buy my first house or maybe for retirement.  And then they would make the investments based on what you said.  Now you can do a little more.  They have a portfolio of funds handpicked by their financial experts in categories you  might be interested in like social responsibility, clean energy, yes, even crypto, cannabis.  So if you have an interest in a certain sector, you can use Wealthfront to get involved in  those sectors, again, using their tools to build your wealth over time with a globally  diversified portfolio.  When we first started talking about Wealthfront, it was early days.  They've done, I'm so proud of them.  They've done so well because they're doing the right thing.  Now $27 billion in assets, half a million people are building their wealth with Wealthfront.  Investopedia just named them best robo advisor for 2022 and we're not even halfway through the year.

And everyone who seemed to have some foresight started getting out of crypto last, toward the end of last year.  And now it's hitting retail investors, just like regular people who bought into the hype.  And they're left holding the bag.  Oh, isn't that interesting?  I know, right?

Start time: 4734.50
End time: 4775.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would point out there is an interesting thing, which is that I wonder how much actual money people lost.  I think there's a lot of stories of individuals investing at the wrong time.  But because Bitcoin doesn't have market makers, I mean, $200 billion shaved off is artificial.  It could be that the actual cash loss that was put in was $5 billion.  So there is a sense that with the huge run up and, you know,  you've seen those numbers about the percentage of people who own any Bitcoin who actually own,  it's a very tiny percentage, own the majority of Bitcoin and Ethereum, I think, or more than the majority.  And so those people, especially people who have held it for a long period of time, they had a lot of paper losses, which can feel very painful.  So I'm not disregarding. I know a lot of people did buy in.

Transcript:  So you said an interesting thing, and I'm really curious.  Why is Bitcoin going down at the same time as the US stock market and other investments are taking?  It's not tied to those.  I mean, doesn't gold go up when stocks go down?  Wouldn't crypto be a good investment now?

Start time: 4832.36
End time: 4843.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because no.  I mean, crypto is just like an inherently risky investment, much riskier than, you know, a traditional stock.

Start time: 4843.22
End time: 4850.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Gold is made up too.  I mean, the value, the price of an ounce of gold has nothing to do with its actual intrinsic value.

Start time: 4850.84
End time: 4864.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, right. Like we all like money means anything and it's all speculation because we all we all agree to it.  Right. It's all fiat.  Yes. If we all decide money is worth nothing, then yeah.  Yeah.

Start time: 4865.16
End time: 4887.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I really puzzled because I do think that when the stock market tanks, as it has, people go to other investments, non-traditional investments like gold.  And I would have thought that Bitcoin would have benefited from that.  I'm just curious. Any any thought, Denise, any thoughts?  I don't know if you're the crypto pro or crypto con, actually.

Start time: 4888.02
End time: 4917.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I tend to think about how and whether crypto should be regulated.  And of course, there's a call.  There are always calls to regulate it because it's at this point not regulated.  And the stock market is.  And as you point out, people are perfectly capable of losing their shirt in the stock market.  So apparently our Treasury secretary is concerned about stable coins.  Janet Yellen.

Start time: 4918.46

End time: 4983.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Glenn, I actually was not super familiar with the concept of an algorithmic stable coin,  which has never been stress tested before.  And that's why the Terra Luna situation has gone so wildly off the rails.  But Glenn, yeah, if you can dive into like the technical aspects of the algorithmic part of the stable coin.

Start time: 4984.78
End time: 5071.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, sure. And, you know, the reason it didn't come up last year is I don't think people were as widely invested.  I think more and more infrastructure got built in this book, by the way.  It started as like a neutral like, well, I don't think you should invest in it.  But here's how the technology works, what you should do.  And it's turning slowly into a like stone investor.  It's going to be like a screed by the time I revise it lately.  But, you know, a stable coin is supposed to be backed just like a money market fund.  You know, you don't want to break the buck.  That's what was what happened during the Lehman Brothers meltdown is the buck was almost broken on funds that are supposed to maintain a dollar.  Right. And of real money.  And that was going to cause a huge upset in the entire financial market and required massive worldwide intervention to prevent a complete financial meltdown in 2008.  Right. It was 2008.  So the stable coin idea is very similar is Tether is the organization that has the highest valued one.  And they said at one point they maintained a dollar in reserves for every dollar they were issuing.  And that has turned out to be entirely not true through their own reporting and work by a lot of other people who are trying to figure out they own a lot of commercial paper.  They own Bitcoin.  They own a lot of stuff that's not dollar.  So that's allegedly the best stable coin and has tens of billions of dollars in it.  The Terra Luna thing is algorithmic stable coin in which the two the boy this is the complicated thing.  It's kind of like the two are interlinked so that if one waxes, the other should wane because there's a fixed exchange rate between the two.  The Terra is a UST.

End time: 5091.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been set up algorithmically so it can be redeemed or minted for exactly one dollar worth of Luna at any time.  That's the problem, though, because the value of one dollar of Luna has dropped ninety nine point seven percent.  It's exactly.

Start time: 5093.63
End time: 5096.00

Start time: 5103.02
End time: 5121.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure sounds like it.  Well, except that the Fed and other government banks have all said we're going to have to do crypto sometime and it's going to be tied to some sort of form of stable coin.  And this is why Janet Yellen is terrified that that that Terra is falling.  It shouldn't.

Start time: 5122.44
End time: 5188.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This it ties back to liquidity, though, and reserves.  And so, you know, what upholds Bitcoin?  Why is Bitcoin worth sixty five thousand dollars each at one point and thirty thousand at another?  The liquidity of the exchanges.  So you have a small number of organizations that have do not have super deep pockets.  They're not central banks where a bunch of people rush in and say, I want to sell Bitcoin.  And they say we will.  You know, they're making the market.  So they're going to be marking it up and up and up or lower and lower and lower and lower because they don't want to be held with Bitcoin.  They can't resell to other suckers.  So without a central bank, you have no way to prevent this kind of race to the bottom because the exchanges only possess a fraction of the reserves necessary to maintain the entire currency.  A stable coin like Tether or USD, let's say Tether USD, a dollar denominated one, is supposed to overcome that by having actual reserves.  So you can't break their buck.  But in effect, they don't.  They've been sued. I think the New York State Attorney General's office has a settlement with them.  They're under investigation by all these organizations.  I don't think you can redeem Tether in a lot of countries even.  It's a mess.

Transcript:  So, yeah, remember in the Great Depression, the run on the banks, banks have never kept all of the money that in theory they hold in the bank.  You can't go to the bank and say, give me my money.  But there are regulations about the percentage of money they're supposed to hold, right?  Well, thank you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes. And your money, you built the baseball.  So, yeah, I don't know where we got to. We got a little sidetrack.  But you're saying that the ostensibly these stable coins claim that they were fully backed.  They were 100% backed by actual holdings.

Start time: 5240.18
End time: 5309.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Tether was backed, they alleged they were backed by actual cash reserves like real cash money.  A percentage thereof or the entire amount?  No, 100%. Their thing was at any point you could redeem a dollar of Tether for a dollar in real fiat currency and they were maintaining reserves.  And at one point their site said, we do this. And then the site stopped saying that.  And then there have been lawsuits and investigations since.  The algorithmic stable coin says, we have two boxes with nothing in them, but we have slips of paper.  And if this one starts to get low, we'll give you a certain number of slips of paper for the other and then that box will fill up.  There's no value to any of these slips of paper. They're just two empty boxes.  It's weird. It's a double faith hypnosis thing.  If you believe, you have to believe in both. If you stop believing in one, I guess you're supposed to believe more in the other.  And people lost so much faith that even in this case, the organization that sort of keeps Tether running,  they have some Bitcoin reserves in order to help stabilize the price.  And I think that's one of the stories is that where did the Bitcoin go that they claimed they had that they could push into this to push the price back up and stabilize the whole Tether-Luna exchange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's going to be a lot of people will cite things like BlackRock and other groups.  It's right for conspiracy theories.  Allegations. Yeah, exactly.  But someone could have attacked it. But the question is, this is always the issue.  If someone wants to attack a cryptocurrency, I mean, people have talked about the 51% attack you could do against Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies where you control enough mining power.  You could roll back transactions and double spend and do all these terrible things.  But the issue is people have so much money invested.  So someone would have to have no stake in Tether-Luna and expend some amount of money or other cryptocurrency to destabilize in the hopes of getting some gain unless they're simply a troll, in which case they lose all this money.  So there's something weird there because why would you burn your own money?  And I don't think that's been determined.  They're putting a squeeze on something else that they had a hedge against.  I don't know. I mean, that's the part that I don't think has been answered.

The value of it depends on somebody coming along saying, well, I'll give you I'll give you sixty thousand dollars for that Bitcoin.  Have we run out of greater fools?  Is that what happened? Did the pyramid collapse?  Or as some say, it's because of interest rates going up that it's better to put your money somewhere else.  I don't you know, I guess we these are questions that just can't be answered.  We just don't know.  What do you say on your podcast, Caitlin, when this must come up?

Start time: 5484.22
End time: 5550.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have I have one quick theory, which is just that we don't understand how leveraged people are who invested.  And because the liquidity is so low at these exchanges, it is possible that a relatively small number of people, including small investors, found that with the drop in the market, the rise in interest rates, they're concerned about paying bills.  They suddenly realized that they needed to liquidate their Bitcoin or whatever holdings they had.  And they liquidated and it could require a small number of people moving out because of liquidity that it caused the price to crash so rapidly that larger players get involved.  And you have algorithmic movements by you know, there's all these institutional investors now involved in cryptocurrency who are doing, you know, second by second millisecond arbitrage and all the other nonsense.  So there could have been a essentially an almost an accidental crash as people pulled money out, which fed on itself.  A flash crash kind of.  Yeah. And then those because those people actually the money they have to pay their rent or bills or mortgage or food.  And so they took it out. And unless you have big institutional providers, central banks and so forth supporting that's an interesting financial instrument at that time, it can collapse.

Transcript:  All right, we're done.  I also think that people are starting to realize there's shenanigans going on.  For instance, we're starting to learn a lot of NFT situations.  There's a lot of trading back and forth to get to boost the price up between people, you know, selling it to themselves and buying it back and selling it to themselves, buying it back to boost up the price, hoping then for a greater fool to come along and say, oh, I got to get that.  Look at the price is going through the roof.  And those shenanigans, I think, are scaring people.  There's also the story of corn, but Coinbase, which, oh, my.  Now, I want to say this. I don't think Coinbase is going bankrupt. I don't think that's the issue.  In fact, Brian Armstrong is the CEO. So there's no risk of bankruptcy.  But they were required in their most recent SEC filing to say, should we go bankrupt?  You as somebody holding cryptocurrency in a custodial wallet at Coinbase would not be like if your bank went belly up, you'd get insurance.  It wouldn't be like that. If we went belly up, you'd be an unsecured creditor.  In other words, get in line to get your money.  And now Armstrong said, look, this is just legalese. We had to say it. We're not going bankrupt.  But it probably gives people a little cause to pause to think and say, oh, wait a minute. It's not an insured. It's not a bank.  It's, you know, in fact, I think probably a custodial wallet is a bad idea in general.  You should do like me. You should have a wallet that you control and lose the password.  I'm telling you, it's the safest.

I mean, I feel terrible for him. I met a guy once. I was researching a story for The Economist back, I don't know, like eight years ago.  And there was a guy in Seattle I met up with. And it turned out, I found out later, he was personally generating in his apartment a single digit number of bitcoins,  like a high single digit number at that point because he had happened to get some of the more faster chips during a brief window.  And he said, oh, yeah, I've got a, you know, a dead drive over there. I've done everything to recover it.  It's my off cold storage. And it has I think it was like two hundred fifty thousand dollars in Bitcoin on it, which would be worth, I don't know, like fifty million dollars, a hundred million dollars today.  And it was just dead. It was dead. He had the keys.  And I'm thinking what percentage, how many, you know, ostensible, fake tens of billions of dollars are just permanently in a dump or in Leo's hard drive?

I think I remember him saying, I just try not to think of it now.  He got divorced over it.  Well, our own Steve Gibson, who in the early days of Bitcoin, we did a whole episode on and he was entranced by, as am I still, the mathematics of it, the cleverness of the blockchain and what Satoshi had put together was quite a lot of forethought.  Brilliant idea. And so he said, well, let me create a Bitcoin mining rig and just see what happens.  The next morning he gets up 50 Bitcoin, fell out of it.  50. He has since, he didn't, you know, because it was worth maybe a hundred bucks or something at the time.  They put the hard drive, the hard drive's long gone.  50 Bitcoin, gone.  So whenever Steve mentions that, I don't worry so much about my 7.85 Bitcoin.

And I actually had to get the physical shares and do all this weird paperwork.  It was like, oh, this is what they're like.  There is a story about a guy who I've never been able to track down the details.  Someone told me this, so maybe it's apocryphal.  He had worked for a company.  It had the value of the shares going down so low that he wallpapered his bathroom with him and he forgot about it.  And one day he's sitting in the bathroom and he realizes the company was sold.  Its fortunes were restored and he steamed them all off his bathroom to exchange them.  If anybody knows the origin of that story, I was told it so many years ago and it sounds, it could be apocryphal.  But I love the notion of sitting there on the john and going, oh, my God, I'm rich.

There's a New York Times article about a German programmer living in San Francisco who put his wallet on an iron key hard drive that gives you 10 guesses the password.  He's forgotten it.  He's forgotten it.  He's guessed eight.  He's got two guesses left.  There's about 220 million or was.  It's now half, half that.  220 million dollars in currency.  He lost the paper where he wrote down the password and he only gets two more guesses.  So he's not, he's not thinking.  They estimate and I don't, I don't know how much we know, but about 20 percent of all the Bitcoin mined has been somehow lost.  18 and a half million Bitcoin.

Transcript:  Stranded wallets, things like that.  Yeah.  Let's take a little break.  Lots more to talk about with our fine panel.  Glenn Fleischman is here.  Glenn dot fun with two N's in the Glenn and one N in the fun.  For all of the stuff he does.  We're going to talk about that, that thing you just bought, which is very cool.  Exciting.  A little bit later on.  Denise Howell is also here.  The Internet's lawyer, Denise Howell dot info and brand new to our panel, but very welcome.  Caitlin McGarry of News Editor of Protocol.  I want to show you all my blue land because we were talking about plastics and it's, you know, what?  I was talking with Rod Pyle, this week in Space Show, about Bakelite, which was a plastic invented in the 1900s.  That was the precursor to all the plastics we know today and how it would just crumble.  And we've gotten better and better at making plastics.  And unfortunately, they get thrown out every year.  About five billion plastic hand soap and cleaning bottles are thrown away.  That is a lot of plastic.  I am personally in my life trying to get rid of single use plastics and blue land has been a really great solution for me.  This is an example of a blue land forever bottle.  It's made of plastic.  Yeah. But the idea is you don't throw it away.  In fact, notice it's empty when you get your blue land and they have hand soap.  I have the actually those are nice heavy glass so you can pump them.  I have this is the multi surface cleaner.  There's window cleaner.  I have blue land tablets for my laundry and my dishwasher.  They even have oxy tablets for like for like bleach, but not bleach.  All of it is environmentally friendly for a couple of reasons.  So what I'll do is I'll fill up this multi surface bottle with warm water up to the line.  I'll put in one of these blue land tablets.  They smell great.  This one is let me see what the set is on this one.  I think this is a parrine lemon.  I can't remember, but they smell great.  You fill them up and they does the tablet dissolves.  And now you've got cleaner, good cleaner in this bottle.  You never throw away the bottle.  It's built to last, but you get more tablets.  And by the way, the bottles are about ten dollars when you buy a kit.  The tablets about two dollars and they even have subscriptions.  You can have a refresh plan, which we do.  So I never run out of tablets.  The only thing you're going to have to get rid of is your preconceived notion that eco-friendly products  don't work. These work. They're fantastic.  A cleaner planet starts by eliminating plastic waste.  Powerful, effective cleaners for your entire home.  By the way, there's another form of waste that comes with all those cleaning bottles.  They're about the stuff in the bottles, about 90 percent water.  The active ingredient is 10 percent.  So that means we're spending a lot of money to have trucks bring water around  instead of just delivering the active ingredient in a tablet, which you add your own water to.  So that's another way Blue Land is really environmentally friendly.  Beautiful, Instagrammable bottles.  Fill them with warm water. Pop in the hand soap or spray cleaner tablets.  And within minutes you have powerful cleaning products in amazing sense.  Iris, agave, parin, lemon, lavender, eucalyptus.  I got the Christmas package last Christmas.  I smelled like a gingerbread house for a whole couple of weeks. It was wonderful.  Peppermint. They have new scents all the time.  Or unscented. In fact, we use their unscented laundry detergent. It's really great.  Blue Land even sells wool balls.  We have three wool balls we put in the dryer that reduce static without those wasteful static sheets.  They work great.  Oh, and very popular, the Blue Land toilet tablet cleaner.  You throw in a tablet, you let it dissolve, scrub it with a brush, you're done.  They sell out like crazy because they're so good.  You can get a kit from the Clean Essentials kit to their Hand Soap Duo.  The plastic free laundry and dishwasher tablets.  I actually, they make a great house warming gift. I gave the complete set to my daughter when she moved into her new apartment.  It's so great. It's so great.  Bottles start at just $10 when you buy a kit. The tablet's just a couple of bucks.

The first communities to benefit, the Isles of Silly.  Aptly named. And this is a very Monty Python name.  And the Scottish Islands of Shetland, Orkney and the Hebrides.  50 drone routes.  They're actually pretty big drones. They can hold a significant amount of mail.  100 kilograms, 220 pounds of mail. Do two routes a day. Two round trips a day.  They don't say in this article, good article from Engadget, but they don't say in the article,  how they deliver it. Do they just drop it out the back?  I don't know. Or put a parachute on it?  All it says is after the drone arrives at its destination, a postal worker will retrieve the mail.  Maybe they land. Maybe they land.  It can withstand difficult weather conditions with its autopilot system. Wingspan of 10 meters.  Pretty cool. Nothing to say about it, but...

Transcript:  I got a good UK Royal Mail story though, sort of. It's a UK story that's related, which is a few months ago,  I got an email from a guy, somebody else I know, the Macworld, saying, I got this problem.  I live in Wales and whenever Apple or new addresses get added to the UK, like flats of building anywhere in the UK,  they put them at my address, Apple Maps does.  So I have people showing up, sometimes many times a week, driving down my muddy driveway,  because he's in a slightly rural part of Wales. Is there anything I can do about this?  And we don't know anybody at Apple. We try to get in touch with people and pass it along.  Eventually, months later, it apparently resolved itself.  But literally, they would put up a building with the flats and the Royal Mail would assign out new zip codes, new postal codes, rather.  And Apple's mapping team, that was the zero point, you know, like there was a couple was in Kansas who sued Google or someone  because people kept showing up because they were that kind of thing.  So it was just like that, except in rural Wales.  So people would drive, they'd be going to obviously a building full of flats and they would be driving to rural Wales and show up at this guy's house.  He and his wife were very perturbed about it.  But it was resolved before I could forward him to a journalist to write a major story.

Transcript:  It's funny because, yeah, Cashmere Hill did that story in The New York Times about that poor Kansas farm.  Oh, my gosh.  That was this is the the you know, the the problem with GOIP location is if your IP address doesn't show a real location,  they just put you in the middle. You know, it's kind of the random location.  And so Cashmere Hill wrote this story, which is hysterical about how an Internet mapping glitch turned a random Kansas farm into a digital hell.  People would drop off, you know, they say you stole my iPhone.  No, no, I know, because it's on my iPhone.  It's this house. No, it's just because we're the default.  So this happened years ago.  I guess it's happened again.  So this started in 2002 when a Massachusetts based digital mapping company called MaxMind did GO location via IP address.  And if they couldn't figure out where it was, they put you in Wichita.

Transcript:  Yeah. Link rot.  That's a good name for it.  Speaking of rotting corpses and carcasses, the iPod is dead.  That's got a grim way to put it.  Wow. Wow.  They had a good run.  Well, the first iPod came out in October 2001.  The last iPod, the iPod Touch, Apple has announced they will make no more.  Actually, what they said is something like while supplies last, you can order an iPod Touch.  The implication being they're going to last much longer.  It's all over for the iPod Touch, all over for the iPod, which was a revolutionary product  that in many ways saved Apple.  Again, I'm reading this great trip, Michael Book, after Stephenie.  And he talks about, remember, Apple was 100 days away from bankruptcy under Gil Amelio, right?  In the mid 90s.  They were just they were dead meat because, you know, first Scully, you know, drives them in one direction.  Then hair Spindler, Michael Spindler comes in and he does other things.  And then Gil Amelio is brought in by the board to save the company.  And he had no idea what he was doing.  And by the end of those three, there was not much left after they fired Steve Jobs.  But the one thing Amelio did that was smart, he brought Steve Jobs back.  He bought next.  And Steve came in, swooped in, saved the company first by making the beautiful Bondi Blue iMac, which did sell very well.  But I think it's it's probably the case that four years later, when the iPod came out, that was when Apple really started its climb.  And of course, it was the it was really the precursor for the iPhone six years later.  So the beginning of creating the most valuable company in the world, actually, it's no longer the most valuable company in the world, is it?  Who? I think who's the BP or somebody is now Saudi Saudi Aramco.  OK, sorry.

And she immediately within five seconds had music playing out of it.  I like there it is.  And I think the iPad, one of its unique characteristics was that it never stopped being cool for its kind of primary lifetime before the iPhone took over.  You could be five or ten or 17 or 85.  And it still wasn't not cool because adults were using it.  Right. It was I don't know.  There's another product that's quite like that.

He's copying.  He's using firewire.  What?  And now the same song.  And he's dancing out the door.  This was the famous thousand songs in your pocket.

Transcript:  I think you can pay more.  Hulu and I think is what Netflix will do.  They all have low price tiers where you watch ads, which is a horrible experience, at least it used to be because they didn't have very many ads.  So you'd see the same ad over and over again.

Start time: 7063.28
End time: 7109.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, Netflix just banked on being the only player for a really long time.  Like, it didn't really have a lot of competition.  And now, you know, every other streaming service also has really good original content and pretty good library of older content that they own.  And now it's like, I don't need to pay for Netflix every single month.  Maybe I just subscribe on a month when everyone's talking about the show I want to watch.  And like, you can kind of pick and choose how you subscribe.  And they also keep raising prices, which is kind of ridiculous when no one else is raising prices.  And then you have Disney Plus, which just owns children and their parents.  And that's a disastrous combination.

Transcript:  Even Apple TV Plus is getting better and better.  It was impressive in the early days, but Severance is very good.  Slow horses.  Isn't slow horses great?  Really?  They're doing stuff now at a level to compete very well with Netflix and Amazon Prime.  The other problem Netflix has is unlike Apple and Amazon, they have to make all their money on subscriptions.  Apple can lose money on Apple TV Plus.  Amazon can lose money on Amazon Prime because it supports their other service and their other businesses.

Transcript:  Do you get the sense when you're scrolling through Netflix that they're actually creating the programs as you go right?  You go right and more and more and more and more improbable stuff starts to appear.  You're like, is that a real show?  Make up some stuff, quick, he's scrolling right.  If I click, you're just like, that can't be real, is it?  And then you click through and you're like, there's four seasons of this.  I've never heard about it.  They do a good job.  I mean, they do a good job of, I think, understanding what people want to watch.  But I think they've leaned in too heavily into the algorithm because it starts to get, the shows they've commissioned start to get very weird and specific, like an AI gone wrong.  So maybe they need more human involvement.  I mean, I'm sure we've all done this sort of doom scroll through Netflix or Hulu or Amazon Prime.  You're like, where did this come from? Who was this made for?

Start time: 7186.16
End time: 7233.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I honestly think Netflix should put their investment into their software, that their actual apps do a terrible job of recommending.  If you're watching something, it's often not the first thing that shows up.  So it's hard even to continue watching something that you watched.  I just think the app is terrible.  There's too many things.  They need to do something.  And remember, they had a prize for a better recommendation engine and nobody came up with a better recommendation engine.  They couldn't do it.  Really? These are the top 10 movies in the US today? Senior year? Our Father?

Start time: 7250.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you've also got cross-subsidization going on because I've got T-Mobile subsidizes my Netflix account.  So I pay so little, I actually don't cancel it. Disney Plus subsidizes Hulu.  Maybe that's the solution.  T-Mobile is now subsidizing Paramount Plus.  So I only pay a fraction of what I think we have five services.  We have Amazon Prime because we have still have their delivery deal.  So I don't think I really paid directly 100% for anything but Disney Plus.  And we watch the heck out of it. So why not?

Start time: 7277.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's another problem for in the long run for Netflix, which is for a long time they spent I think $11 billion last year on original content, but they owned the market.  Now, here's Apple TV getting Academy Award for CODA.  It's going to be a lot harder to convince creators like Martin Scorsese to go to Netflix.  Yeah, the money's there, but you're going to be, you know, you're the Irishman is buried with a thousand crappy movies.  Right. And that's not what Scorsese wants. He wants an Academy Award.  He wants to be featured.  So I have a feeling Netflix's problems are multi-layered.  I honestly think, though, they could do so much better job with the app.  I just don't feel like the apps are very good.  It's hard to find something good.  Or maybe because there is nothing good.  They want to. They're looking at live streaming, unscripted series, stand up specials.  Reality shows like live streaming because you can vote while it's airing.  I don't know if that's a good solution for them either.  Honestly, I'm not sure what I would do if I were in charge.  Meanwhile, Disney Plus added 8 million new subscribers.  Is that because they own Star Wars and Marvel? Is that really the secret there?

My 15-year-old and I are watching something.  An ad on YouTube comes up for the most deranged-looking Chippendale movie I've ever seen.  It looks like a Roger Rabbit.  It's just bizarre, although I think it's John Mulaney and I forgot the other person.  There's some prominent voices in it.  And then I discovered it's going to be released in a few days on Disney Plus.  So it'll only be on streaming.  And I thought, well, this is kind of a brilliant strategy.  They caught us. They figured us out from the YouTube algorithm.  They're pushing us to a service we already subscribe to.  Maybe they don't know that. I don't know.  We cheer, by the way, when we watch YouTube, my 15-year-old and I cheer,  when it gives us totally inappropriate ads.  We're like, yeah, they don't know who we are.

I think it's pretty soon it's going to be time to wrap it up.  We have a couple of a few extra little stories.  Usually the fun stuff's at the end of the show.  We'll get you some stuff.  But first a word from Zip Recruiter.  Zip Recruiter is the best way to hire.  Certain people make life so much easier.  People, you just don't know what you do without them.  Maybe your partner, your friend, your personal assistant.  It's like if you need to grow your business.  Zip Recruiter makes hiring so much easier.  They're kind of like your partner, your friend, your personal assistant for hiring.  They do the work for you.  And they really do a good job.  And I can say that from personal experience.  Many of our best employees have come to us from Zip Recruiter.  And now you can try it for free at ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  When you post on Zip Recruiter,  you're posting to 100 plus job sites with one click of the mouse.  That's good because it casts the widest net.  And when those applications come roaring in,  it goes straight to, not to your phone or your mailbox,  but it goes straight to the Zip Recruiter interface,  which makes it easy to rank candidates,  reject the people that don't fit, and select the right person fast.  But there's one more thing Zip Recruiter does that's really the secret sauce.  Zip Recruiter's technology actually finds the right candidates for your job  and then tells you about them.  You can invite your top choices to apply.  It's really clever.  They go out through all the existing resumes they have,  and they say, this person would be right for your job, this person, this person.  Now, they don't tell that person.  They tell you, and you get to invite them.  Something happens that's kind of magical.  When you invite people to apply for your job, they're so flattered.  They respond immediately.  They do the interviews.  It's a really great way to reach out.  No wonder four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter  get a quality candidate within the first day.  That's probably why Zip Recruiter's rated the number one hiring site  based on G2 ratings as of the beginning of this year.  The hardest thing you have to do, just remember our special URL  to try Zip Recruiter for free,  ZipRecruiter.com slash twit.  Again, ZipRecruiter.com slash TWIT.  The best way to hire Zip Recruiter.  We had a fun week this week on Twit.  I think we've made a little mini movie you can watch right here.  See how it went.

This is a lot of computing power, millions of years of computing power.  Because the way they got this picture, Rod Pile was talking about this on the tech guy today,  is they used hundreds of telescopes all over the globe to do some sort of weird triangulation of this thing.  And it took a huge amount of computing power.  300 researchers, 80 institutions turned a network of telescopes into essentially a planet sized observatory called the Event Horizon Telescope.  Like mind boggling.

Start time: 7898.08
End time: 7948.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is a great bit of technology.  Back with the Voyager missions, the deep space network used for communications with probes and landers and so forth through relays.  There's a principle that the area of a transmitter, and the same thing would be true with a telescope,  if you combine multiple transmitters at the same time, it's effectively like having a bigger transmitter,  but you need the technology to unify them and use them simultaneously.  So you could get much fainter signals.  That's why they were able to get pictures back from Neptune and Uranus with Voyager 2, I think was the one that swung by there.  This is a similar principle.  It's just like, you know, well, if you have a bunch of telescopes, you can combine them and have a super telescope,  because if they're all pointing in the right way and you have that vast amount of power behind it.

Time spent scrolling through TikTok.  38.6 minutes on TikTok on average in 2020.  Four minutes more than Facebook's 34 minutes of what?  Minutes per day?  I guess it must be minutes per day.  Time spent with Facebook decreasing.  TikTok coming close to YouTube.  Of course, YouTube has created their own short videos trying to compete with TikTok.  40% of Gen Z spends more than, this is a disappointing stat, 40% of Gen Z spends more than three hours a day on TikTok.

While TikTok's time spent, according to eMarketer, will top YouTube's this year, the revenues, the ad revenues won't yet.  That will happen in 2024 when TikTok nets $11 billion in US ad revenues, topping the 10.7 billion that YouTube has today.  And actually, according to TechCrunch, TikTok is starting to share revenue with creators.  So, Salt Hank will be glad to hear that.  Actually, you can make some good money, I think, on TikTok, but you have to kind of do it on your own by selling ads for yourself and stuff.

Oh, that's a cool thing to have.  And so somebody saved this because these were all melted down.  The same thing.  The Flongs were made of paper, you know, paper wood pulp.  They were burned.  The paper mache, I mean, sorry, the metal would have been re-melted and used.  Newspapers used thousands of pounds of lead alloy every night and then melted it down and used it for the next edition.  And newspapers could go through 10 editions in a day.  You know, they'd revise the news.  It was like the web or something.  It would just keep melting lead.  But it was the web with lead.

Transcript:  How would the lead do the halftone?  It's amazing how high resolution this is.  You can feel it.  It's in relief.  And so it actually, literally, they would cast it.  They would cast a halftone from it that was printed.  This is how, essentially, all newspapers were printed.  There was a flong before this.  But this hard paper flong was used from about 1900 to the 1980s.  And it's a whole other thing.  I'll show you one more thing.  Because this is a prized possession.  I've got more coming, though.  It's a peanut flong.  It's a four-color strip from the 1970s.  And Lucy, Dr. Lucy.  And then this is the printed, you know, it's a one plate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have all the colors.  And then here's the, I found the eBay.  This is the printed version from a San Francisco Chronicle in, whatever that is, 1977.  So this is kind of a late example.  But this is how I while away my non-digital time is looking at analog things like that.

Transcript:  And I'm guessing that's where we got the word stereotype, right?

Start time: 8439.76
End time: 8468.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Exactly.  Yeah.  That's funny.  So stereotype comes from that because you're making a copy of something.  And cliché is the French word for stereotype, which is funny.  And then typecasting is from casting types.  Somebody who is, you know, your casting type.  And so we've got three different words that all came into English.  But cliché is good.  Apparently the sound when the plates were being printed was cliché, cliché, cliché.  No.  That's a cliché.  That's what they claim.  I don't know if it's true, but it's all from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is what I love.  So that was the most important news of the day.  But the big pictures on it are with some kind of blind date competition.  Honestly, they're set for blind.  And you're thinking, so it's the Reds go to, you know, Sputnik.

Start time: 8504.60
End time: 8538.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I buy stuff on eBay because nobody cares about Flong except me and a handful of printing  historians.  So we have a fun time of it.  But I just I have the mother load of Flong coming from a guy in Sweden who bought a huge  set.  I have almost 200 peanuts Flongs from the U.S. that made their way to Sweden that are coming.  I think they're running tomorrow.  And I'm not a collector because I do not have enough room to collect stuff.  I'm bringing stuff in, taking photos, documenting it and then sort of distributing it.  So I'm donating some to museums.  Oh, nice.  I've been in touch with the Schultz Museum about donating or selling some of the peanuts  collection.
