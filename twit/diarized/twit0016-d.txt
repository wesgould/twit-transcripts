Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is TWIT This Week in Tech, Episode 16 for July 31, 2005.  Kevin Rose is missing in action once again, ladies and gentlemen.  We think he's in San Diego.  We're not sure.  We saw him briefly on Skype and then as soon as we called him, he hung up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So I don't think that...  I think he's war driving for an accident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Patrick Norton is with us.  We're glad to say back from his...  Were you in Palm Beach?  Where were you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was in Key West, Florida.  You were in Key West.  Which Key West, Florida does not suck.  I've never been there before and I plan to go back again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So Patrick Norton is back, but he's not home with us.  He is in Las Vegas at DEFCON 13.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, actually, I'm about a half mile away from DEFCON 13 because I won't log in anywhere near the network at DEFCON.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's on Skype at an undisclosed location where hackers can't get to.  David Prager is with us in Los Angeles from Irvine, California.  We're so glad to have him back.  Steve Gibson of ShieldsUpGRC.com.  And of course, the great spinwright.  Thank you, everybody, for being here.  Oh, I forgot to mention John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dvorak.org slash blog.  His blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I kind of like your blog, John.  Do you?  You keep you put a lot of content out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I put a lot of content.  I got two other guys posting there and it's we try to keep keep it kind of interesting with one or two themes.  You know, one of them government incompetency, some tech news and then weird stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I enjoy it, actually.  I really enjoy reading it.  Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or just Dvorak.org.  It'll jump there anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It all gets to the same place.  So I guess we should really start with an update on DEFCON because Patrick's been there.  Have you been having fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, DEFCON is kind of like a weird sort of homecoming, rolling weekend knowledge festival and party.  And it's always highly amusing to see what people are up to and what has people spooked and what has people  having fun.  There's been all sorts of really cool stuff happening over the last couple of days.  The we think there's been a new record set for the longest distance reading an RFID tag.  There's definitely a new distance for an amplified Wi-Fi network, actually 125 miles by a bunch of  teenagers who basically they did the Wi-Fi shootout this year from they found basically a small  mountain outside Las Vegas.  And these kids set up two giant satellite dishes and put one on this hill outside of Las Vegas,  the other one just outside of St. George, Utah.  And they did a 125 mile connection off of a pair of 300 milliwatt cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was the original record?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They set the record last year somewhere around 50, I think it was 55.1 miles with some 30 milliwatt  cards last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, this is more than double.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, they used 300 milliwatt cards this year, a pair of 300 milliwatt cards.  And I guess the story is about 11 o'clock on Saturday, they shot a distance of 125 miles.  Wow.  They set a Guinness record last year and they think this might qualify them for a new Guinness record.  Is there any...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait, wait, can you stop for a second?  What was the...  You tell me they did this with 300 milliwatts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they did this with a pair of 300 milliwatt cards and they attached them to...  Basically, you remember the classic satellite television receiver dishes from the backyard,  the big 10, 12 foot dishes?  They use a 12 foot dish?  They use those as the antennas to do the shoot.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they passive though?  They're not powered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A 10 foot dish at one end and a 12 foot dish at the other end.  They're not powered.  They basically, it's my understanding, they had a 300 milliwatt card at one end,  a 300 milliwatt card at the other end and they were each connected to the antennas with no amplifiers.  That's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not like they were running three or four watt amplifiers at all.  And of course, it's line of sight.  Yeah.  You couldn't do that without a line of sight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And did they have people both in simultaneously?  Obviously, they're not driving back and forth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I haven't had a chance to talk to the guys, but apparently they set up the antenna at one end  that it was actually remote controlled so that they could make a couple of degrees or maybe more  of adjustment in case it wasn't quite pointed in the right direction.  Because what a lot of people have said is the biggest problem with doing these really long  distance Wi-Fi records is actually being able to point the antennas at each other.  Once you get out of, you know, once you kind of start, you know, dealing with  shooting over the horizon, I think it gets a little troublesome to figure out where somebody is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  I mean, one tiny, you know, quarter inch adjustment and you're miles off.  Wow.  Well, it sounds pretty amazing. 125 miles with 300 milliwatts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. They're they use a team pad is the name of the group that did it.  And they were using a couple of VCOM 325 PCMCIA cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What kind of data rate did they get though? I mean, it must be very specific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the computer is running Linux. The link quality, this is a quote from wi-fitoys.com,  which has a great article on it. So wi-fie-toys.com. And it said their link quality was so fantastic.  They got 12 millisecond ping times ran shell commands, secure shell commands,  and even used VNC remote desktop. No, that's amazing. Wow.  Yeah, wi-fi. It's been interesting. Wi-fi has really been all over the conference.  Jennifer Granick addressed and there was a is part of her sort of 10 top security questions  or 10 top legal questions talked about. That was one of the things she talked about was  whether or not it's legal to log on to somebody's wi-fi router, a protected wi-fi router. The  war driving guys were talking about that today. And the general consensus is that  unless you're in Florida, it's yeah, well, what's in it. Well, what's interesting is that the thing  that they said is except for in one, you know, basically the Florida case is one of the only  cases where somebody's been logged into an unprotected wi-fi and was basically arrested  for logging into an unprotected wi-fi or unprotected WAP. And mostly cases when they say somebody's  been arrested for war driving or somebody's been arrested for stealing wi-fi, it was usually  because they were caught doing something else at the same time. In one case, a guy was basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sending out child pornography. Well, that's legitimate. I can see why they'd want to prosecute

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  him for that. Yeah. But I mean, like the I guess what I'm trying to say is that the wi-fi violation  was a small right side step, you know, it's a small footnote to the actual activity that was

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  taking place. So if you log on and you get some email, you, well, what did she say? Did she say

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that it's the consensus is legal? Well, the problem is the consensus is that if you, you know,  it was interesting as one of the reporters at CNED actually interviewed a prosecutor at the  Department of Justice who did not want to be named, but they basically said, you know, we can, you  know, this is one of those moments where you start thinking, they were explaining like how they might  prosecute somebody for this. And it's kind of like, just because you don't lock the front door  of your house doesn't mean me walking in through the front door of your house is trespassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I mean, it's still illegal to go in. Yeah. Of course. Yeah. But going into somebody's house

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is not the same as having somebody drag you in the house. When you're like sending out a wi-fi  signal, let's go on out into the street. You're not going in the guy's house. Well, yeah. But then

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we get into the, then we get into the question of how bad are the tools? Should you be as, you know,  should you be responsible and know how to use, you know, the SSID identifier so you know that  you're logging onto the right wi-fi station? That's true. I mean, you could do it by accident.  A door, is there a sidewalk running from the house to the street, John? Is that an invitation for me

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to walk in your front door? Walking inside, no, but what's the difference between just standing there  and having somebody drop the house on you? This is not, you know, as though I'm sitting here passively  and I'm being inundated with your signal is really an imposition on me. They should sue the homeowner.  They've got this thing backwards and I've been writing about this for a couple of years  and they're going to have to do some case law because right now it's a confused mess and nobody  really knows if you're going to get thrown in jail or not. But as far as I'm concerned, you're  responsible for that signal. If you want to send it all over creation, hey, and somebody links it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to it, that's not their fault necessarily. Your wi-fi got in my chocolate. No, your chocolate got

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in my wi-fi. Exactly. But what it gets down to is there's no real case law for anybody to work with

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  until you actually, yeah, not yet. What I've been advocating is that there has to be public policy.  Once that's established and you know, if you just tell people, look, if you're going to do this,  if you're going to, you know, you're the responsible person. You've got the wi-fi router sitting here.  If you don't want to put a simple password on it, I'm not talking about, you know, somebody out  there trying to crack passwords. We're talking about totally unprotected broadcast. As far as  I'm concerned, what about the person who wants to send the signal out for free? I mean, there's  plenty of those in the Bay Area. So how are you supposed to know? I'm obviously, you can tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  what side I'm on. I agree with you, John. I've been saying it for a long time. I took a lot of heat.  I was in the Nets tumbler forums over this a couple of years ago. I was saying it's, I was saying it's  a de minimis use of a resource. What if, as here's the example I gave, if you leave your garbage can  on the street and I'm walking by and I throw my piece of trash into your garbage can, I'm using  your resource, you're paying for the garbage, but it's a de minimis use. It's not going to be  like I'm trespassing on your garbage can. If you borrow a sip of bandwidth from somebody to get  your email, how can you complain you've been damaged in any way by that? Not only that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but they're paying a flat fee anyway. It's not as though that, you know, because you showed up,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  they have to pay more money. It's analogous to the garbage, you know. Unless, if I don't fill up your  can, if I throw a piece of coke can in there, what's the big deal? Well, the other thing is,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  if you look at the terms of service for most broadband providers, Speakeasy being a notable  exception, they will try to nail you to the floor if you're sharing your broadband connection with  multiple houses. Oh really? Oh, that's interesting. Yeah. Yeah, it's in the terms of service of most

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  ISPs. Yeah, but that's just a bluff. Who has ever been prosecuted or who's ever been shut down  because of something like that? They, what they don't want you to do is to put up a splash screen  and start, you know, selling the process. I understand that, yeah. I think some of the larger

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  so supposedly some of the larger vendors have gone after some people where they thought like,  you know, five houses in the neighborhood were pooling one broadband connection. You can do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that. Steve's been playing with OpenWRT, which is the software that modifies your Linksys WRT  router. And one of the mods is setting up your very own, your hotspot. Yep. And you are able

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to crank up the output power so that it'll reach further. And of course there's all kinds of little  antennas now you can add to these things to increase their range. Yeah, you can get seven

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  extra decibels with that new Linksys antenna. And that's only just a little bitty add on. You  can buy the big antennas. All those guys have them. I've been collecting them. I have to talk about  collecting junk. I've got a bunch of these large antennas that are often,  can be used and they have a pretty wide pattern. They can push the thing away. If you don't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  them, John, I'll take them. I can use them somehow. I was in, I was in the CNN, the San Francisco  Bureau this week doing a thing for showbiz tonight. And one of the news people are going,  you know, you can use a Pringles can to steal wifi. And apparently there's some high school  in California that's banning Pringles can antennas. Like that somehow. You have a coffee can's worth

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  much better. First of all. Everybody says the coffee can is much better. Well, the, the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the, what cracks me up is, is that, first of all, that these guys were talking about it and, you  know, I mean, we did this years ago. But second of all, that then in fact, it is an issue. Apparently  some high school, the high school student faces eight felony. Well, let me see where it is.  Cantina is illegal. Police arrested a high school student. They found a Cantina in his room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What did they arrest him under? Under what law? According to the Sacramento Valley high tech

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  truck crimes task force, Cantina's are illegal. Where, where's the link for this? This is, this

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  is tech dirt.com. I'll send you the link. A series of arrests of people for using open wifi  networks, which we've been talking about. Now this, the issue is according to the Sacramento  Valley high tech times task force, these Cantina's, which they say are designed to steal wifi.  What's the difference between that and a commercially sold antenna that you can plug into,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  you know, maybe those are illegal too. There's according to the quote high tech police,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  according to the quote high tech police officer, they're unsophisticated, reliable,  and it's illegal to possess them. This sounds like folklore. Um, let me see if I can find the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's been a lot of cases, there's been a lot of cases where stuff's been misreported by newspapers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is from the Sacramento Bee. Yeah, it's like,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there's been a lot of bad reporting on it. I mean, what is technically it is illegal,  according to the FCC, the whole point of having different, you know, pigtail connectors  on different brands of wifi cards was to prevent people from mixing and matching antennas that  common area antenna combinations that had not been approved by the FCC.  You know, I don't really think the FCC is going to start, you know, hunting down everybody who's  bought a, you know, a 24 DBI, uh, you know, parabolic antenna and connected it to a wifi  card. But technically that is illegal if it hasn't been approved and tested by the vendor,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you know, and FCC approved. They're quoting and I'll give you the guy's name since it's a  Lieutenant Bob Lozito of the Sacramento Valley high tech crime unit. This is the quote from the  Sacramento Bee, which is a reliable newspaper. They're unsophisticated, but reliable. He's  talking about a Pringles can antenna and quote, it's illegal to possess them. Now, whether that's  true or not, at least some police officers believe it. You got to send me a link to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That goes right on there. That's, there's my column for, uh, for PC medicine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what we're here for. John. Hey, it's a great one. Hackers, hackers prey on unguarded  wireless links. It just, when I heard this, you know, I just thought, my God, I'm sending it to  you right now, John. Uh, it's, it's just, it is, it's stunning. And I guess it doesn't matter  whether it's really illegal or not. If the police believe it's illegal, you could still get arrested

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for it, right? What are they going to throw you? I can just see the jails filling up with kids and

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yuba coffee cans. Well, that's the thing. The cantenna doesn't work so good. You know, there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  actually a company called cantenna and I think their website's cantenna.com and they make a  commercial cantenna. I mean, it's a little more, uh, you know, slicker than the, than the, than the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  cheapy. Didn't we find Patrick that the Pringles can just didn't have enough metal in it? I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  really it's a cardboard too. I just thought that it was just, it falls apart. It crushes. It's,  I mean, the work, but, um, the, uh, I actually, uh, you know, like I said, I like to use the coffee

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  cans a lot better. You, you fell in, fell in you, you bet has a lot more caffeine too. And, and you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  know, Steve should know as, as one of the, one of the most hardcore you and between you and Patrick,  you probably do half the output of Columbia coffee beans between the two of you as it were,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  but you realize this is the, this is the third week in a row that we keep coming back to and  talking about the fact that it boils down to people using other people's bandwidth because  they might be doing suspicious activity and they don't know how they're going to trace it.  Since it's someone else's, since they're not paying for it. And even in the article in the Sacramento  B, it keeps talking about people stealing credit card numbers from the Lowe's hardware store. I

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  mean, Hey, are you still stealing your wifi today? I'm using it from across the street right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. It works great. It does. That's why I'm not, I'm not paying for it because I don't have to,  but if I didn't have any access, then I'd pay for it. All right. You know, I, I, this is just,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it's what you were saying, John. I mean, nobody's made any policy. It's, we're all just kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  making it up as we go along. And how many cities are there right now? Like the city of Hermosa  beach, California provides free wifi access to anyone in range of this, that gets the city,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's paid for by the city. Right. Yeah. I mean with Ymax, you know, the thing going on now with  Ymax is just kind of curious because the cable companies and the phone companies are trying to  get laws passed. In fact, there's a new one, which I'll be bringing the blog into this actually,  maybe I'll throw this on the column. There's a new law that they're trying to pass, which will ban  the municipalities from doing what Hermosa beach does by federal law. Well, this is to me is a big

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  issue because these federal law, cause I know states have been passing laws for a while now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Let me see if I can find the reference while we're chatting here. Cause that's really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  bugs the heck out of me. And it's, it's clearly because, you know, ISPs, you know, the big ISPs  don't want, you know, states to get in the business that they're trying to make some money at. And of  course, the biggest, the most ridiculous one was the case in Pennsylvania. And that's called the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pennsylvania case law, which was a, they passed actually passed legislation because the city of  Philadelphia, I believe, or Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, they wanted to put up a big, you know, a data to  11 system and then it gets gravitated to Ymax and make it as a civic thing. So everybody in the city  of Philadelphia would have broadband. It would end up digital divide. It would do this. It would do  that. Comcast and Verizon got together with the corrupt governor. And then the next thing, you know,  you end up with a, some laws passed and they finally backed off on some of the, some of the  provisions in this law because the public got hold of this. But now apparently this is going on at a  federal level and I'm going to dig it up here. Cause I'd love to know what senator or congress

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  member is pushing this one. Some crook. Yeah. There were, I think it was 11 or 15 states that were,  I believe it was for Verizon. So I should say that I assume it was Verizon was pushing similar  legislature to what they push through in Pennsylvania. I think this is risky because

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think you start making these kinds of activities illegal. You push, this is the same problem I have  with going after file sharing. You push a whole segment of the population that is considers itself  law abiding into this realm of not being law abiding. And at that point, these, these kids  basically are going to say, Hey, I'm already a crook. I'm already a criminal and they're just  going to go for it. And you're going to have a whole generation of hackers who are so fed up  with the corrupt government that they're completely outside the law. And I don't, I think that's very

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  dangerous. Yeah. Well, and it's also, you know, government is notoriously bad at legislating  technology. You know, they'll write the law wrong. Absolutely. I mean, that's what's happening. If,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  if cantenas are illegal, somebody wrote the law wrong. What else is going on at in Vegas right now,  Patrick? How did you, you did the spot, the fed did, was that fun? Did you end up getting there

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  in time? Well, I've actually, I, I, I missed the spot. Sorry. They moved it to another location.  No, no, no. It wasn't your fault. They moved it to another location, but there's going to be another  one right before the award ceremony today. Although I can say that I did meet a couple of members of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  three letter agencies while I was there. I just, this is one where, where, you know, you, as, as a  attendee of DEF CON say, I think that guy's a fed. And then they do this, if the fed or supposed  it fed goes along with it, they do a 20 questions. And I'm just surprised that nobody has yet spotted  Patrick as a fed. Don't you think that surprises me? Yeah. He doesn't even look like he's a cop,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  like undercover. Well, he looks like a lousy undercover, but more like a secret service guy.  You only need to be talking to the guys. You've never seen me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need a little earbud and a lapel mic, Patrick. You'd get busted right away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd have a lot of fun. What I need is one of those little flip down,  you know, fanny packs you wear around the front that hides the gun and the spare ammunition clips.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you think a lot of people at DEF CON pack heat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think anybody at DEF CON. Well, I take that back. I'm, I'm pretty sure a few people  at DEF CON pack heat, but I'm pretty sure they also pack heat when they go into the 7-Eleven.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How many people at DEF CON pack lockpick kits? I have a picture of three people demonstrating

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  their lockpick kits. There was a huge series of tracks on this year on lockpicking and even a  session on safe cracking. That's become a really serious hobby for a lot of people. And there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  some of the, some of the, we need a safe cracker. We've got a safe that, to be honest about it,  if anybody's out there that can do this, we have a safe in our, we have this duplex in Berkeley and  we put a safe in it and then we've looked it up and the safe mechanism failed and needs to be  open somehow. You don't want to just... I actually, one of the guys that was college...  Is your stash in there, John? I'm looking for a safe cracker. We're serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no, John. A guy, a guy went to, a guy went to college with his family ran a business that  sold safes in Manhattan from 1888 till I think 1995 or something. He could do it. So he probably  knows somebody. Yeah, if he can't do it, he probably knows somebody who can. Can't most,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  aren't most locksmiths kind of trained in that or is that such an esoteric field now that it's,  locksmith wouldn't help you? I think safes are a little esoteric. Yeah. Well, if you can't pick it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know a guy who's really good at making thermite. That's the problem. There's something in there

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we don't want to damage. I'm telling you, it's something from the 60s he's been saving.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right. It's actually a gemstone. Oh, a valuable gem. Yeah. Well, now you just raised  the price of the safe cracker, John. That's not that valuable. Keepsake. Keepsake. It would

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  survive the explosion though, right? I don't think so. It's an opal. Oh yeah, that opal will get

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  burned right up. Sure. Hey, so was this guy Michael Lynn, who is the former Cisco employee, was that  Defcon or was that a black hat when he was presenting? Well, he was black. First of all,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he's not a former Cisco employee. He was a former ISS employee. I'll call him a security research  firm. And he, actually, Jennifer Granick actually kind of brokered his deal because he was about  to be sued by ISS and Cisco. She brokered his deal with them. And then he, in the words of a  friend of mine who's at the, who was both black hat and Defcon, he's pretty sure he's hiding  somewhere looking for a rock to hide under for a while. Let me give you the who, what, when, where,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  why on this ISS. Michael Lynn is an ISS employee, a security expert who was going to give a  presentation at Black Hat on how to use these well-known flaws in Cisco's routers to hack them.  Cisco sued and Cisco and ISS agreed to pull the presentation. In fact, Cisco hired some interns to  rip pages out of the Black Hat conference bulletins and to re-burn all the CDs. Then Michael Lynn  quits ISS, says, I'm delivering it anyway, and delivers it. At which point, no, he actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he didn't get to ISS. He started doing sort of an alternate presentation and about 10 minutes into  it, just went for it and started doing his original presentation. He quit by default,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  at which point everybody sues everybody else. But there was a deal brokered, as you said,  so nobody's going to be sued or what? What happened? What's the upshot of it? Well, he's,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  he had, there's a couple articles online that are probably going to be a little more accurate  than I am right now, but essentially he had to turn over all of his source code, all of his research  and pretty much agree to never do any research on Cisco routers again in the future. And yet,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this is a well-known hole, isn't it Steve? I mean, this, this, well, no, it was completely

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  quiet and no one knew about it. And it was, it was, it was, it was, it was, it was Lynn who decided  it was really, really dangerous to keep this a secret because this is a huge, potentially a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  huge problem he felt for the internet. This is in the, in the Cisco internet network operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, it, it, it potentially allows them the, it's the so-called shell code,  sort of the Holy grail would be to be able to take over a Cisco router remotely and,  and get root on the router and, you know, wreak all kinds of havoc on the internet.  Now Cisco has a patch for this. Yes. Yes. There, there are, there are patches available and it  turns out that when you look at it more closely, it's, it would be hard to use this thing to do much  damage because you're not able, it involves using a malformed IP version six packet,  which basically crashes the router like any buffer overflow does, or if it's,  if you're really good, it allows you to get some privileges, but the packet itself is so  messed up that it, that one router won't pass it to another. So you're not able to target a  distant router. You're only able to deal with the one that you're directly connected to.  So you need a physical connection to it. You need a physical connection. Now in theory,  if you did this correctly, you could, you could design something so that you, you, you take over  the one you're connected to and that router then takes over the ones it's connected to,  to create sort of a propagating attack. But that's purely theoretical at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And so Michael has gone into hiding then he's, he's done. And apparently the FBI has, has started

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  up something too. I heard just recently that they're, that they're doing an investigation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. What's, what's interesting to one of the things that there is somebody does a backbone  testing and who did a pretty long seminar yesterday. And she actually said she is not that  concerned about it, but the general advice is if you're running the Cisco, you know,  routers to update them, patch them and patch them now. Right. But that the patch has been  available since April. So, but there's a lot of discussion with routers. People are slow to patch

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  even more slow than they are to patch their operating system. So yeah, this is a good time

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  to not be slow with that because it's a lot of people were tired. A lot of people were,  a lot of people were upset with what Lynn did. I think partially because they have to protect,  you know, large and diverse systems. And a lot of people were, you know, a lot of people were  pretty impressed. You know, there's a lot of people were like, wow, that was amazing. I  wouldn't have done it because, you know, I wouldn't have done it, but, but a lot of people were pretty  impressed that he decided to, to, to get the information out there. At the same time, his

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  career as a security researcher is probably over now. Well, there's some interesting debates back

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and forth because there's, there's a couple of security research firms. I've, I've, and this is  completely unverified rumor, but there's, there's, there's some speculation that a couple of firms

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have offered him jobs. Security research firms are notorious, not notoriously finicky about who they  hire. Are they? I mean, they don't really care. If a guy's good, they're going to hire him. In fact,  they get a lot of publicity from hiring people like that. Has anybody installed, I was going to  do this and I didn't get around to it before we broadcast today that the 2.0 patch for PSP,  because I've heard some amazing things about this. I don't own a PSP. Why do they not?  Anyone here own a PSP? I do. Yeah. And I was hoping Yoshi would be on this one because I'm

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  sure Yoshi's done it already. John was probably set one. It's under a pile somewhere. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Johnny, you have one in that pile. Actually, Sony cut me off some time ago. Oh, really?  It happens. Did you say something bad? I don't know. I think it's just that, you know, these,  a lot of these people, they switch around their agencies a lot and Sony's one of the worst for  that. And then you get taken off a list and you can't get back on it because you don't know who

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to talk to. I've had bad results with Sony. I called them before I was doing, I mean, I was  doing a Regis and Kelly and I wanted to show, remember they have that wireless TV, the location  free. Right. And they, and I said, I want to show it on Regis and Kelly. I said, no, we don't have,  yeah, we're not, no, nevermind. Wow. I said, what? Yeah, no, that's totally Sony. Sony is one of the,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  probably one of the poorest companies when it comes to techie oriented PR. They believe,  in fact, you know, when they first rolled out their bio, the initial one years and years ago,  that there was a desktop machine, they actually made the comment that we're not interested in,  you know, we're a PC magazine. We wanted to review it. And they said, we're not interested.  We don't want that type of people interested in our computer. We want the public. Apparently

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Regis and Kelly, they don't want them either. So I don't know. Who do they want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they probably think that you're just like a nerd, you appeal to a nerdy group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. And they don't need you. Yeah. The housewives don't watch when I'm on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and frankly, those early values were not very impressive. So that's why exactly,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they didn't want techies to see them exactly, but they spent a lot of money on the booth when they,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  when they introduced them, it was purple Zodiac out of business tap wave. I'm kind of sad about  this. I really liked the Zodiac. It was a Palm, but it was also game oriented. I thought it was  very cool. A lot of good reviews. I guess nobody bought it. So to speak. I never heard of it.  You remember the tap wave with the Zodiac? It was a sideways Palm. It was a little gaming device,  but it was also, you don't remember that, huh? No. It also made a nice little media machine.  Yeah. Did you, could you, you could play videos on it, couldn't you? Yeah, absolutely. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  How different is it from like some of the Arcos?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a Palm. That's the main thing is you would be buying a Palm device and playing a premium  for a somewhat larger screen and game pad style controls on this thing. We gave it great reviews  on tech TV. I know a lot of people loved it. It was around for a couple of years, right? It was  around for a couple of years. They made little cartridge, you know, SD card games for it. It  did photos as well as, and videos as well. And then, but I guess, you know, it's not a good business

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to be in right now. That's a tough one. You know what I find really interesting is that we're  already seeing people producing movies on both DVD and PSP discs. Yes. I mean, it happened

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  immediately. Yeah. It's like, wow. But aren't they all Sony movies? I think Sony also had a lot of,  has a lot of influence in the movie industry. And so they influenced a lot of that to get it onto  their universal media discs, their UMDs. Right. Which I don't know what the capacity is of those.  Smaller than DVD, which means I would think that the compression has to be a little maybe. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's such a small screen. You don't care. I mean, yes, certainly you wouldn't want to hook  it up to a TV and watch it off of that, but it looks fine on a small screen. Pixel vision.  Yeah, exactly. Anything else anybody wants to talk about? Should we talk about this Google  Microsoft? Like, yo, Vista beta one. Yeah. Did you get it? You were looking at it, weren't you? The new  copy of Vista. I spent a couple of days with it. What do you think? It's going to be really

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  interesting. What's also interesting is like, I got to spend some time with a couple of people  who are related to people on the Windows Longhorn and IE7 development teams. Apparently it's,  they're running in seven different directions at Microsoft and they've been changing the  focus of the Longhorn team constantly in the last two years. Well, I remember the biggest thing though

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  would. Go ahead. I remember talking to somebody about the file system and they had already written  a good portion of it and decided to start all over again last year. I mean, it just must be very

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  demoralizing for them. It sounds like, I mean, it's interesting the Windows Vista outside of the  nifty, you know, field of grass when you open it up, you know, it's got the glass interface. If  you've got a 3D card that'll support it, which is the transparencies on the window, it's the arrow  interface look or style, which is kind of clean. They're doing some interesting stuff. They're  finally doing a lot of security to prevent, basically to prevent spyware from being able to  write stuff anywhere it wants to in the operating system. A side effect of that, and the beta one  that I was using was you can no longer, you know, store files directly on the C drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, that means of course they'll take it out before they ship it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, well, they may not because they're part of what they're doing with the  search is being integrated into everything and they're using virtual folders. So the idea is  that they're going to, I think they're going to try to lock down the locations where you can  actually place your content in an effort to try to, you know, give it a more Unix-like,  you know, file folder structure. The minute all of these ISVs, the software vendors see this and say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but wait a minute, my program relies on writing to the C drive. They're going to say, oh yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're right. I guess we better not do that. Okay. I found that the bill we were talking about

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  earlier. What's that? Oh yeah. The federal bill to the broadband investment and consumer choice

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  act. I like the way they were. They do it every time. And it was then introduced by Senator  Anson and co-sponsored by our friend, John McCain. Really? Yeah. And I'll just read that  there's a couple of websites. I'll put it on my blog later today or tomorrow morning. Well,  I guess we'll be running about the same time. And I did number nine, which is the, one of the  elements of this thing is preempt local governments from building competing networks. The act basically  adopts a Pennsylvania plan. If the local or state government wants to build a network,  it must issue a request for proposal to see if any private company wants to build a network instead.  Now only if no, only if no private provider offers to build a comparable network in the  state or local government build and operate the network. Any system in existence at the time of  the act is grandfathered, but only if it does not expand. Anyway, this is going on and on. There's  a couple other things. It takes away whatever, whatever regulation there is eliminates any state

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  or local control of quality of service or prices. And of course all of that is to improve consumer

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  choice. Yeah. There's a consumer choice thing. Yeah. Eliminates any build out requirements or  anti redlining provision. Well, that's good. Eliminates any private right of action against  video or telephone providers. Your only recourse is the FCC complaint process.  It limits FCC authority to regulate anything but nine one one eliminates any requirement for phone  or cable companies to resell capacity. No more of the, you know, you can't buy any lines. Eliminates  the need to open up competing law for long distance guys. It's just basically a throw. It's just one  of these omnibus bills that designed to screw the consumer. And of course you'll get through

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  because nobody will pay any attention to it because it's too complicated and it'll just go

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  right through. It could. Well, why don't we tell everybody who's listening, good thinking,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right? Their Congress critter. All 12 of them are going to get it. What's the article you're reading

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there? Leo posted on the Twitter website. We can, that'll do it. Well, you'll do it with a few

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  200,000 people that listen. That's good. That's a start. Yeah. Tell your friends.  Yeah, we gotta get this going here. I'm sitting here fuming. It's unbelievable that they keep

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  doing this stuff. I mean, it's one thing after another, but you know, it's like, like who's  interest? I mean, these, some of these people that are in Congress need really, you know, that if  you're running for the house of representatives, you, if you're in the, the amount of times you get  reelected is run at a 96 to 98% rate, which means the only time you can even get into the house,  if you want to run, is you have to find somebody who's retiring and then you hit it's an open race.  But if, once you're in, you might as well just, you know, you can just throw your feet up and do  whatever you want. And I just, just baffles me that the public puts up with this. It's the old adage

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that everybody hates everybody else's congressmen, but their own, you know, they keep reelecting our

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  guys. Great. But everybody else is terrible. Well, the thing that's happened over the last few years  is, is what, well, at least what I've been seeing is where you have special interests, not really  working within their own congressional boundaries. For example, you'd have like the Senator from Utah  representing the liquor industry to make sure that you can't ship across state lines and things like  that, which benefits a couple of the big distributors. You, and you have people out in the middle of nowhere  or West Virginia representing Hollywood interests, because, you know, they, it's like their local  constituency doesn't really care. It's like, you know, this guy wants to represent Hollywood. No one,  you know, there's nobody to vote against that because it doesn't seem to have it have any  impact on the local economy. It's just weird to me the way the whole thing is structured. Sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Does that count as politics or can we say all that? No, I'm actually not. I think that's all tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all dead center. I mean, some of the most ridiculous laws that have been passed, I mean,  they're just so self-serving. I'm just going to keep my mouth shut. So,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so HP is pulling out of the, so HP is pulling out of the iPod business. Couldn't sell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do they ever get into the iPod? Why are they pulling out? Do we know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they said it wasn't the quote a huge deal for HP. In other words, it sounds like they didn't  sell very many of them. They, most iPods are still Apple branded iPods. HP. It was the same price,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  wasn't it? Yeah. Well, what about the HP? I'd want the Apple. I think the idea from Apple's point of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  view was they got a more better distribution and maybe some windows users would be more reassured  by buying it from HP, but everybody knew it was a Mac product. According to the stories about HP  sold about 8% of all iPods in the June quarter. So it wasn't a, it's probably, yeah, I'm surprised.  It was that high. Yeah, I am too. I thought, you know, maybe the, so Samsung was in town

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  this last week and they had, they were showcasing all their new electronic gizmos from the camera  and the MP3 player division and they've got some, they're getting pretty aggressive with

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the MP3 players, I have to say. I like Sam, I've always liked Samsung as a company. I think they  do good stuff. The iPod's obviously not going to be dominant forever. Who's going to, who's going

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to break the iPod monopoly when and how? It's going to have to have somebody that knows how to make a  really cool looking product. You think it's looks? I think a lot of it's looks and you know, Apple's  always been credited with having, and I was in fact with having a lunch with the CEO of  Frog Design a couple years ago and he was mentioning to me that Apple is known in the design industry  as having the absolute best industrial design team in the world. Jonathan Ives, who's the guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  who did the iPod. Brilliant guy. And it's not just the look though. I mean, I think they also have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  easiest to use interface. I think I've been, I've recently spent a bunch of time playing around with  some other hard drive players and boy, there's some incredibly awkward interfaces out there.  No kidding. I mean, just impressively painful to use and what's really amazing is some of them,  you know, they're still not actually cashing the contents of the drive so there's a lag time as it  sort of figures out and the more songs you have, the longer that lag time is. You know, every time

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  you launch the player. I thought it was a more price sensitive market than it really turned out  to be. I remember when the Mini came out. I think Patrick, you agreed with me. We thought it was just  too expensive for too little storage and that nobody would buy it. Boy, were we wrong.  You guys seen that you can spend, you can save money. I mean, look Dell, you can get a Dell DJ,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  20 gigabyte DJ now for 162 bucks. Half. Yeah. No, which one were you talking about a second ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The iPod Mini, remember when it came out? Oh yeah. It was hugely expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you guys seen this new Mobi Blue Gigabyte  Cube Digital Audio Player that's sold at Walmart? No. Yeah, that's a hoot.  I think it looks kind of cool. It's $129 for a gigabyte. It's 24 millimeters on a side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh. Yeah, one inch by one inch by one inch. Mobi the singer or Mobi MLBI?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Mobi Blue. Mobi Blue, B-L-U. It's got an OLED display. It's got a FM tuner,  USB 2.0. Plays 10 hours according to the website. It's cute looking. How big is it? You said 20 gigs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no, no, no. It's solid state. Solid state. One gig for one. Well, of course,

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they want to take on the shuffle. Heck man, you got a display. You can actually see what you're

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  doing. Yeah. But you don't want to sit on it. It's got points on the corners. Yeah. Yeah,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know how useful that display is going to be because I've used some of the Mobi Blue players.  They're not that good. A couple people have seen them. Better a display than no display.  I think. I don't know. I'll be honest with you. I've used, I've tested like nine different flash  based MP3 players in the last two years. And I got to be honest with you, a lot of the displays  on them are useless. And the menu, when you get up to a gigabyte and you've got 300 songs,  some of them don't even do foldering, which means you actually have to skip forward to the song you

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  want. So is it going to be that somebody's going to do a better UI? Is that how you're going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  beat the iPod? How do you beat the iPod? I think the Apple is a status symbol, right? I mean,  among kids, it's like, Hey, do you have an iPod or one of those clones? I talked to a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Status symbols die over time. Well, like, yeah, some day something's going to come along. I talked  to a designer and said, the best thing, this guy was a brand expert. The smartest thing Apple did  was make the headphones white. And his thinking was, you don't know what MP3 players somebody's  carrying. You can't see it. They're in a pocket, but you always know if they've got an iPod because  they've got the white headphones. And that was the best thing Apple did for branding. Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I can't stand those earbuds, any earbuds. Ever since I started using these animotic earphones,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hate everything else. But you look like a dork if you wear big cans over your ears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, no, no. Those little, well, I don't know what you mean. I use the animotic too. I love the  You can stick them in your ear. I don't know if they're the most fantastic, but  Although they're very good. No, they're great. Compared to the stock stuff, they're fantastic.  Of course, they also cost about half the price of the iPod. Patrick's been trying to get me to do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that for years. I finally went and now I'm like, I'm a hooked. I can't use anything else. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, one of the problems with those old fashioned earbuds is that they project the sound  straight into the ear and they're dangerous on your earring. What? Well, you know, earbuds are

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  dangerous in technology. I'm deaf. I'm so deaf anyway. I'm so deaf. Hey, are we worried about  the foam coming off the shuttle? What's the deal on that? Gosh, I hate to be one of the astronauts  and hear that. Oh, yeah, something else fell off. I think everybody's just demoralized at NASA now

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  because they were all, you know, after all this delay, they were finally saying, okay, we got this  all figured out. And, you know, apparently they know that they're going to have, I mean,  it's part of the design. Lots of little pieces are going to come off. They just know that.  But it's and of course, those pose no risk at all to the piles on the shuttle. But it's when  these one pound chunks come off that it is really a problem. Well, I think the problem is that they've

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  always had stuff falling off. They spent a lot of time and money trying to reduce the amount of stuff  falling off. And then they also spent a lot of time and money trying to be able to analyze stuff  that falls off. So as a result, they see everything that happens and they still have to deal with the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  problem that stuff has always fallen off. And now we have cameras that they're showing everybody  stuff that we wouldn't have even known about before. Well, I like the backflip. I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that was kind of neat. Yeah, I mean, they got some great analysis. And now of course, they're  they're actually considering using one of their spacewalks or adding another one to look at,  I think near the nose cone of the of the shuttle because they have some some bits of material  sticking up from the front that of course is a result of them being able to do over analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I'm always surprised. There's two things that have surprised me about this one is that  how can this is all happening now this thing has been flying around for what 15 years,  I don't know longer 1981 1981. So okay, it's been almost 25 years. Yeah, it's been up. And now this  problem is like, sudden, I mean, what was things falling off before? Were they using are they  using lousy glue? I mean, what's changed? I mean, what changed between then and now? And the other  thing is, it seems to me that they should have always been doing an inspection of the shuttle  when it's in space to you know, like any pilot does with his with his craft, when you get a chance  to inspect it, you inspect it to just to see what the hell's going on with the thing before you have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to take it back and land it. Apparently, one of the problems is that the shuttle's been around  for so long, as you say, 25 years, and hopefully, it's going to last us another five, is that many  of the technicians who who developed the craft have retired. And so we don't have the trained  personnel anymore who like, you know, knew the nuances of how to get the foam on and keep it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's probably true. That happens with all technologies that linger. Right. If we can get

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  another five years out of it, I think they're trying to get 19 or 20 more missions out of our  existing fleet, such as it is a diminishing fleet, then everyone's going to be happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, it depends on whether or not they're going to fly something else. And then before the end of  the year, now they're even wondering about because they keep having to go back to their  proverbial drawing board. They want to phase it out by the sorry, what other depressing news do

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  we have to discover? I'm trying to find something upbeat. I'm trying to find a happy story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People are getting arrested for cantonas, technologies are falling apart. I thought something

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  very cool. At the very end of Meet the Press this morning, Tim Russert announced their podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, everybody's doing podcasts. And now we're falling down the charts, you know, we used to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  number two. Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, don't get that. Don't get so worried about  that because I finally found out today from somebody how and maybe somebody from Apple will  tell us if this isn't true. But the story is that the iPod ratings are based on new subscribers in  the last 24 hours. Ah, that would make sense. Not a total number of subscribers. That would actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  make sense because it seems very volatile. And by the way, something weird happened this week.  And I was, you know, we were number two and I was watching this porn podcast, the violet blue  porn podcast. Were you watching or listening to it? No, no, no, I was watching it only I was only  watching the charts. I was watching it climb up towards us. And then all of it. And I thought,  boy, I wonder how Apple feels about the fact that the number four podcast on its list is a porn  podcast. What's a porn podcast? It's a well, it's a it's a read erotic. Ever hear of phone sex?  It's it's I haven't listened to it. It's by somebody named violet blue. And I don't know  what it is. It's some talk sexy or? I don't think so. I think she does interviews. Some of  those old dirty joke albums and podcasts. You know what? Those would probably do very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Maybe the old red fox and rusty roads or whatever her name was. It's it's well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  here's the thing. I thought maybe I was ready to start a conspiracy theory because as it climbed  and climbed and climbed, I thought, wonder how long Apple's going to and all of a sudden it falls  precipitously. It tumbles down and it's now number 45. So I'm wondering, what's the story

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  morning, Gordon? If there was a little bit of intervention on Apple. That's what I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now currently we're number four Ebert and Roper are number two skeptic ality, which actually is a  good podcast from bat pig studios is and I'm in an independent podcast. I'm so I'm glad to see  that they're number three bird and Roper are ahead of us. They're number two. Oh, please.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What is their podcast? Is it an audio version of the show or they do some as a supplement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They do reviews. They're 20 minutes long. I think it's the whole show. They do. They do reviews.  I haven't listened to it. Listen to a movie. I think two thumbs up for stealth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I happen to like Ebert and Roper. I like them too. Well, you know what? You know what I like  about them? You go to the last five minutes, they run down their thoughts and you're out of

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it. Maybe that's why it's such a popular effect. That's all they should do is just podcast the last

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  five minutes. It'd be a lot easier. I liked it better when they, when Cisco used to always get

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  fights with, with Ebert. I agree. I'm learning some more about the iTunes music store as well.  Patrick, I found out from a very reliable source that iTunes music store caches the podcasts.  Now there was some speculation about that before, but apparently the top 200 podcasts  are being served not from our server, but from Apple's own servers, which means our stats are  completely off. Oh, that's annoying. It means we have no idea how many people are listening. Well,  it's annoying on that respect, although we still have such high stats that I know we have. It just  means we have more listeners than we thought. I can't wait till Google releases their Google  podcasts. That's going to make a big difference. I think in a way it's good though, because what  it means is you can be a success on the iTunes music store and not have to worry about being

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  banned with, you know, slaughter. Yeah. Which is probably a good thing. Yeah. Does that, can

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  somebody tell me what Google's up to with their podcasting? Does anybody know? I just made that

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  up. I just assumed that they were going to come out with some podcasting. Well, I thought they

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  might do something, you know, a podcast search engine or something like that. There's got to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm sure Google videos going nuts. Have you seen podscope.com? P-O-D-S-C-O-P.com. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  search our podcasts and a number of others and they do what they do. It's interesting. They do a  podscope.com. They do a OCR, not OCR, a voice recognition. They actually listen to the podcast  and turn it and are able to index the words in the podcast. It's dictionary-based. So you know,  don't do a search for twit or, you know, laport, but if you did a search for, you know, a dictionary  word, you know, a search for, you can't do cantana, but you could do, you could probably do antenna  or wifi. And what's interesting is you could play segments of the podcast with that portion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it's actually, I think, a very efficient way. Put in wifi. It looks and listen. We couldn't find  any hits. Maybe that's not in its dictionary. Let me try. Yeah. You need to do techie terms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, better. I just typed in, I typed in windows Vista, both words in the dictionary. And it says,  we looked and listened, but we couldn't find any hits. So this sucks in other words. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's going to be a really hard thing to do too. I mean, you know, the whole,  the whole speech recognition against the dictionary deal. I mean, with all of us  talking at the same time on top of each other and on most podcasts are terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'd probably get enough words though, to make it up some value. You know, I don't,  I think it's a start. You're right. It's a difficult challenge, but I like the idea.  I think it's going to take a good year to make it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Uh, speaking of, of Google, I, uh, just for you, John, I, I Googled pilot blue,  the podcast that was the naughty podcast that was rising so high. It's a open source sex,  radical sex ed and more with sex education. It's open source. Open source, open source, sex,  fit in doors. No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  now John was the joke that had to be made.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a open source, sex 15 beginning with a little bit about sex podcasting. I also talk  about being interviewed by newsweek, the wall street journal, a funny newsweek anecdote. Then  I read the as previously promised antiques road show smut by author Don say Davidson.  So she's reading it. She's reading erotic, discerning ears. See, is it? But, but, but,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  but let me just point out newsweek and wall street journal interviewer. Why?  Cause she was number four on the podcast on the iTunes podcast interview or no, they didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Leo's not, you know, I'm not, I'm not even violent. Well, you are, but not in that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's just, I think it's the wall street journal saying, who is this beating us? Cause

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  we're number six. Who is this beating us? I've got to find out. The wall street journal has a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. The wall, they have a tech podcast. They do. Yeah. Wall street journal tech news. It's short.  I don't know. Have you listened to it? No, I don't, I don't know. Yeah. You know, why do we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  need to listen to these guys? We got our own. We know more than they do. Do we? I think so.  Probably. I just went to pod scope and typed in Bush and I got, you know,  looking for Georgia Bush, obviously. Yes. And it's in fact, there's a bunch of stuff here.  You get asked for information about Supreme court nominees. Mostly. Yep. And you could probably,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I believe you could play sections of the podcast from there. I don't, you know, it's, it's brand  new. Who knows who they are or how much, you know, how well they'll do, but I, it's a, I like it

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because it's an, it's an attempt. And did you say the wall street journal has a tech podcast? Yeah.  It's number six on the iTunes. I found on something called podcast four one one on their  64th show, we'll do an interview with Walt Mossberg and Katie. I don't know Katie,  but from the wall street journal, but that's someone else's. That's somebody interviewing them.  Why would they want to get interviewed about tech stuff when they've got their own tech? Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  no, that's publicity. So we'll never, we'll never get Walt on this show. I'm afraid.  I like Mossberg. I like him too, but I just don't think he'll ever, he'll ever do our show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we could ask him, Mr. Mossberg, if you're listening, I personally like to,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have access. I have access to the twit treasury. Mr. Mossberg, I'd like to offer you $25 in cash

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to be on this. I don't think he can take it. I think he's got, he's, he's required by the,  the ethics of the wall street journal, let's take anything worth more than a t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll do it under the counter. I'll tell you what I will, I will make a twit t-shirt.  For Walt Mossberg. It will be on the twit cast. All right, well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the gauntlet is thrown. We've got a check waiting for you. No, no, I'm sorry. A bag of quarters  waiting. 1000 quarters waiting for you. I hope that's right. I didn't offer him much of money.  Then did I? A thousand quarters. Isn't that 25 bucks? No, no, that's, that's, that's, that's,  that's a lot of money. I'm no Walt. I'm sorry. I take it back. He can't take that money. Anyway,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's just impossible. Besides that, you know, he makes $450,000 a year. Does he really? Well,  actually we think it's maybe more than that now. He's, he, well, you know, cause he was going to

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  quit at one time and they had nobody over there. Is he now I'm asking the wrong guy, John, but is

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he the most powerful tech journalist out there? I don't think there is a powerful tech journalist  to be honest about it. And I don't think he's, he's not the one Markov's not the one. Nobody is.  There's no powerful tech journalists because nobody gives a crap about Gilmore. Gilmore is a blogger.  He doesn't even have a, he doesn't even have a platform. Talking about tech is mostly about  complaining about the Bush administration. You know, we're talking about blogging. I mean,  most of the guys who've gone into blogging have, are still kind of targeting blogging more. I mean,  they talk more about blogging as though they're all members of a cult. Well, it's like podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's all podcasts talk about. That's what we're doing. Oh yeah. That's right. Nevermind. Let me,  there wasn't there, who was it that used to do that list of the most influential tech journalists?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I used to be a marketing computers and it became technology marketing or something, but it lost.  It's, you know, it does, it's a meaningless list. It's put together by PR people and the people on  that list, I have to say it's because the PR people like them. Right. I never made the list.  Well, not always. John was always on it. You were always on it for a while and then they took me off  and, you know, I got bumped off the thing eventually. It was my dream.  Well, you should have been on it because they had a broadcasting section. They had people on there.  They had their names misspelled. They're not even doing broadcasting. At one time they moved Fred  Davis up to the, out of the blue, they moved him onto the list as an influential for something he  never even did. Blue Marriott never did it. If he was over, the company was broke by the time the  list. I mean, it was a miserable list. It wasn't very well done. It's pretty funny. Yeah. It's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's the, I guess really I make that point because all of these lists are silly top podcasts.  You know, all of this stuff is silly. Well, you know, having been in it, we would like you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if you have a chance to vote for, you know, I've been at a lot of these meetings where these things  are decided and it's a bunch of guys sitting around drinking coffee and you know, saying,  what do you think? I don't know. He's a jerk. I don't want to put him on. He's pretty  influential. I said, idiot, screw him. Let's put on so-and-so. And so the lists are basically made  up in the, in the edit room and they're not the reflection of just a few people. It's almost a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  joke. Yeah. What about this at Black Hat, this demonstration that they did, maybe you saw it,  Patrick, where the guy showed that he could receive an RFID or read an RFID tag from, you know,  what was it? 50 feet away, a hundred feet away. Yeah. I was actually telling you about that. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  did it. They can only do it 50 feet at Black Hat because they only do 50 feet at Black Hat  because that was how big the room was. So they could go farther. They have a huge antenna.  I'm sorry? They could go farther. They did a little over 69 feet at DEFCON. And actually,  I know both of the guys who are doing the research. I'm trying to remember the name of their company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is his name Kevin Mahaffey? I have it on my blog. Let me go look it up. Well, and the issue is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  the U.S. for instance is going to require RFIDs or start putting RFIDs in its passports soon. You're  going to see RFID everywhere. If your identification card has an RFID and somebody can read it from a  hundred feet away, what kind of privacy implications does that have? Yeah, it's Kevin Mahaffey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's, yeah, but he's trying to find his company. It's called, what are you talking about,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  flexless.com? That's the one. So, you know, all you need to do is you go down to an art supply  store someplace that has, you don't even need thick stuff, but you just need a piece of lead foil.  And you take your lead foil and you just cut it out to be about the size of a dollar bill  and you put it in your wallet. And there are all the cards inside between the two pieces of the  foil when the, when the, when the wallets folded in half. There's no, nothing's coming out of there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got a foil jacket I'm going to wear. Foil jacket would work also, you know, those bag,  film bags that you could put stuff in there. Oh yeah. Well that, in fact, when you get the,  here in the Bay area, you know, they have the toll tags and when you get the toll tag,  it comes in a special bag that insulates it. And they say, if you don't want us to collect the toll  when you drive through the, across the bridge, put your RFID tag in a bag in this bag, keep this bag  with you. And it's just a little, it looks like mylar. It's just a little plastic bag. It could be

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  yeah, it doesn't take much. I usually, I do know that I've kept that tag you're talking about in  my glove box and it's nailed it from there. Oh really? Yeah. Right from the guy here, beep  going off in the glove box. But I noticed when I don't want to, you know, use it,  because sometimes when it's getting near the end, you don't want to over, you know, run it out.  If you sit on it, it seems to stop it. That's cause you got a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what they called Walter Cronkite, old iron butt, because he could just sit in the chair  and anchor the newscast for hours and hours and hours. That's what the space shuttle needs. We  need another Walter Cronkite. He did more for the U S space program than any, any, any 10 astronauts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, back to the RFID. I miss Walter Cronkite. Experiment with some different  substances like see, even aluminum foil may prevent the thing from getting tagged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just, it's radio. So you metal would theoretically be, be, be able to shield it.  Hey guys, we've used up our, our allotted time. I thank you all for being here. We don't have time  for questions, but it's great to, I don't Kevin Rose, where are you? Where are you Kevin? I offer  you the bag of 2,500 quarters, which you get Walt Mossberg or Kevin Rose. If, if Walt won't take it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's yours, Kevin. It's all yours. The fee just went to 2,500 quarters. Now you better go. Oh,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  geez. Wait a minute. No, that's wrong. Yeah. That's all wrong. It's starting to sound like a rough  night on the slots. I don't know. Well, however many I can fit in this baggie here. That's yours.  It's yours to take with you and the two dollars in quarters, whatever's in,  whatever's in John C. Dvorak safe. That's, that could be yours as well. Oh yeah. I'll be looking  into the safe cracker by the way. Yeah. Safe crackers. Please email John Dvorak.org.  Steve Gibson's at grc.com. Everything going well for you, Steve. When are you going to release this

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  new leak test program? I'm going to start working on it shortly. I've got, we're going to do some,  another upgrade round to Shields Up. I've come up with a way of making,  essentially allowing Shields Up to figure out how many packets it can send even on a guy's  firewall connection so that it will be self-pacing. We'll be able to do much faster and much more

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  comprehensive scan. And it'll bust through the firewall. Essentially. Yeah. Wow. Should people

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  forget software firewalls? Is it just useless? You know, every layer of security that you can add  without inconveniencing yourself, I think is a good thing. But you know, I'm just so pro-NAT  router as a hardware firewall, but I think that makes a lot of sense. That's the way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  David Prager, how are things going at the system? I know you got a new issue out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. We wanted to put something out. You know, really right now everyone's getting up to San  Francisco, getting an office. And once that happens, it's really going to get going. But  wanted to definitely put something out. I'm a big fan of actually of David Randolph, who is the  broadcast engineer that helped us out in doing something that I guess a lot of people had some  interest in. Some people didn't, but it's a cool guide to audio and video cables in home theater.  System 3. Yeah. But there will be a lot, a lot more coming out very, very soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's great. SYSTM.ORG. Correct. Or revision3.com. Is that going to be the new site? Everything's

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  going to go to revision3.com. Revision3 is the production company. And then there's like,  there's the Dignation show. There's the Broken, which by the way is being worked on. And I know

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  there's a lot of people understand that. Oh, there is going to be another Broken. Oh yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh yeah. Oh good. And there's actually another show coming down the pipe too, which will have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  more information on very soon. Yes. Patrick Norton, when are you coming back from Vegas?  Flying back tonight. All right. Well, we'll see you back here at... Smile on my face,  song on my heart. We'll see you at Twit headquarters next Sunday then. I also want to  tell everybody we're very close now to having a venue for our live Twitcasts. We're trying to  find a place that is equidistant between everybody in San Francisco, me up here in Sonoma County and  Dvoraka in the East Bay. And I think we've got a spot that is actually as close to physically at  the intersections of those three lines as you can get. It should be equidistant and it's either  Larkspur or Fairfax guys. So we'll let you know as soon as we find the location. It's two really good  candidates and both of them have beer on tap. And... What about Diet Coke? Cappuccinos, all  a Diet Coke you could drink Patrick. They've promised. Okay. And one of them's offered Bordeaux  for John. Ah. So they have a wine bar. Sounds like the place. Doesn't that sound good? Do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mind going to Fairfax? It's just a little farther. Don't you have to be a drug user to be around that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  area? I don't think... Not anymore. They won't dry it up and blown away. I think this is the Cafe  Amsterdam. I'll give it... I'll say it. The Cafe Amsterdam, Fairfax.com. And it looks like a good  candidate. They're fans and they've said, we promise it to you, but there's one other spot I  want to look at. So I'm going to look at them this weekend. And in fact, you're all invited to come  with me if you want and try the chairs, make sure they're comfy. But we hope to be able to do this  with a live audience, certainly by September, maybe sooner, as soon as Kevin's settled.  Okay, everybody. Thank you for your time. Have a great time. Another tweet. One more thing we

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  should do. What's that? Leo? Yes? We should politely ask all those people who enjoy listening to the  twitcast that we would appreciate it greatly if they would click on the donation. Send us money.  Otherwise, twittv.com. That's true. So that we can get you to buy the hardware we need to solve the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  production issues. Yes. We're getting there though. I feel like we're getting some good... We've got  some good equipment and we've spent your money wisely. But it is true donations have slowed  down considerably. And that means that, you know, one of the things I'd like to do when we go live  is be able to get a sound engineer to do this and things like that. That's the kind of things we need  to do. So please do. It's at thisweekintech.com. It's only $2 a month, less than a latte, less than  a gallon of gas a month to keep this show going. A single gallon of gas. One gallon. That's all we're  asking. The cost of one can tenna. And it's felony free. Thank you everybody. Another tweet is in the can tenna.  Hold on a second guys. Be right back. Okay, we're gonna let Patrick P. and then I think we got everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a bathroom in the Kinko's? Sure. Yeah, it's called the Xerox cupping machine. I couldn't hear what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John was saying when you were trying to patch him in, but why does he sound so good this time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's on a phone. Oh. No, you got a... John, you got a new headset? It's... Yeah. What'd you get?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yay! It's another Plantronics. I found it in the drawer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's one of the... Something else John was sent. Exactly. Some other piece of s*** that's just laying around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I got all these people saying, well, why doesn't John just get a good headset? And I said,  you don't understand. John doesn't buy anything. So if somebody doesn't send him a good headset,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  he won't use it. Well, you have to have your standards. Yeah. Hey, yeah, I was gonna say,

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  never let it be said John is living the dream, baby. Yeah. With crap. Is that why you got into

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this business, John, to get free crap? You know, I never thought about it. I'll admit, that's why I  got into reviewing software. I just wanted free software. It's fun, but you know, I mean, it just

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  feels... You feel good. When I was doing the InfoWorld column, it was the same sort of deal,  you know? And just the stuff just came every day. It's kind of neat, yeah. Well, actually,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's actually a burden. Not that I'm complaining about it, but the fact is you get a lot of stuff  you don't have time to look for and you feel guilty about. I tend to refuse most things,  to be honest about it. It's only when I'm targeting something I need to see it, I'll call a vendor up

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  and tell him I need to. I agree with you. It becomes a burden. I've seen John's gas station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you still have that above the gas station? No, that's long gone. But that was a typical example.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He had a room, big one too. It must have been a couple of thousand square feet over a gas station,  jammed with crap that people had sent him. Yeah. In fact, the first time I ever went to your house,  John, you had a pile in the living room. Yeah. Well, you know, whatever house I have,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's a pile in the living room. This is Week in Tech. The shortest distance from the mailbox to  the office is the living room. Most of the stuff piled up there is kind of a... It's called way station.
