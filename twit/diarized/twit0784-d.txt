Thank you. Thank you. Purpleish pinkish wig, strange future glasses. Very kind that Amy predicts we'll  all be wearing in the next decade or so. There's certainly augmented reality going on in those  glasses. I can tell. I can tell. Yes and I printed a necklace. Oh a tesseract necklace. That's cool.  Excellent. So do you do the 3D printing thing? Obviously you do. I don't know. I can take it

It seems like these 3D printers are  more work than they're really fun. They are and especially if you're trying if you're if you don't  have any background in CAD trying to get a design.

Transcript:  PLA. I'm dressed apparently it's a it's a toss-up between Eddie Munster and Uncle Fester. I don't  know which I am mixing the memes on that one and also we're thrilled to have from Tech Dirt the  return of Mike Masnick who is now regretting probably is agreeing to appear on the show today.  He's living in his blue room. It's wonderful. Dabu dee dabu da I was blue dabu dee dabu da.  Actually the reason we're here armed whoa  I didn't know the gun was loaded. The reason we're here armed. A lot of Americans say that yeah.  Is uh whoa is because uh you can't play Fortnite on iOS anymore or Android. I get it's hard to hit  the camera. Let me just see if I can really yeah we'll get there. Fortnite clearly was itching  for a fight and decided to take this time to modify the in-app purchases on its app both on  iOS and Android in order to get pulled down on both. At which point they released a video that  oddly they had just ready to hand called 1980 Fortnite that may remind you a little bit of a  video that we saw in 1984. People sitting watching a giant screen a young woman with  well it's not a sledgehammer actually it's a unicorn hobby horse and she's running away  from the police. She arrives and tosses it through the screen which smashes and then  Epic Games has defied the App Store monopoly in retaliation. Apple is blocking Fortnite from  1 billion devices. Join the fight to stop 2020 from being 1984 hashtag free Fortnite. They were  ready. They also went to court, sought an injunction. They did the same thing to Google. They didn't have  a video ready for Google. I don't know maybe they thought Google wouldn't pay attention.  You may remember that Tim Sweeney of Epic didn't put Fortnite on the Google Play Store at first  saying you should side load it because we don't want to pay the 30%. Eventually they gave in.  Mike is there legal merit in what Epic is doing? Will they prevail in court or can they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a big hill to climb. That doesn't mean that they won't win. They might.  But if I were taking odds on whether or not Epic would prevail I would say they are unlikely to  prevail. I was impressed not only did they have that 1984 video they actually referenced 1984  in the complaint so that their marketing and legal team had everything aligned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's not though. I think if I'm the judge that's going to taint this a little bit because it's so  clear that they set this whole thing up. That they prepared for months for this moment.

Start time: 531.60

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Part of the thing that's interesting about it is that if you look at it from Apple's perspective  they were going to be in trouble no matter which decision they made. If they let Fortnite get  away with this then everybody else would be complaining that they're giving special treatment  to Fortnite and then when they say Fortnite is violating the rules so therefore we're going to  pull them from the store then they have all these other issues. No matter which way it was going to  go Apple didn't have any good choices and I guess Google was picking sides and decided they were  realizing that if Apple loses they're going to be in trouble too.

Transcript:  Apple of course is already under the gun in the EU over App Store monopoly. In the United States  Tim Cook was brought up in front of Congress along with three other executives as you know a  couple of weeks ago and that was one of the issues that Congress was interested in. The  antitrust subcommittee will have a report probably not till the end of the year or early next year  about this but there's some concern the FTC is looking into it that maybe Apple is monopolistic.  On the other hand and I'll give this argument so you guys don't have to a lot of people I know say  hey Apple it's as if Apple built a great mall and Forever 21 moved in and said well but we don't  want to pay you any rent we just want to be in your mall. They're freeloading, Epic's freeloading  on what Apple has built with its platform and its store. Do you agree Amy? Does that seem reasonable?

Start time: 630.28
End time: 711.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah so this is there's a couple of things happening here. One we don't have a clear  definition for what the future of distribution would look like. So what's interesting about  I think it's interesting that Epic is trying to initiate an antitrust  battle because the hearing that happened a week ago or two weeks ago  reflects lawmakers sort of scrambling to first of all group together companies that really are  doing disparate things and second of all using policy that was written in 1890. So the Sherman  Act was written. I didn't know about app stores. Right but this is important because there's very  little substantive analogy to make about the means for distribution in a digital setting and  the railroad system. So that being said this is an interesting this could be an interesting and  possible possibly the only way to really crack through and that's because this is a limited  circumstance. So Apple charging 30 percent if you look at other industries that percentage of  rev share is higher than than what you would see elsewhere. It's not though higher than on the

Start time: 712.28
End time: 732.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  consoles Sony, Microsoft and Nintendo charge the same 30 percent fee and have the same control.  This all dates back to the days when Atari and Nintendo were swamped by crappy games and they  learned very early on we got to keep tight control over what's on our console. Fortnite doesn't seem

Start time: 732.86
End time: 819.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to mind that 30 percent. No it's the data on the other end. So the key difference here is that when  you've got a console game with heavy DRM protections you're talking about a limited  you're talking about limited use case. Now with a game being on a different type of device  one that hinges on the Play Store and Apple Store there's a wealth of other data  there. So I think if they were it depends it really depends if they try to define  antitrust very narrowly I think they have a shot. I think it could be more compelling for them to  talk about the future of all of this data that's being generated and the fact that that that in  and of itself is also you know but that has value and they can't easily access those data  in addition to having to pay the fees and you can't you know there is no other way to play  Fortnite you either have to jailbreak and I guess somehow. That's true on Google you could side load  but there's nothing you can do on Apple. Right so I think I think Google had I don't think I was as  strong of a case against Google but the reality is that Google you know Facebook Amazon and Apple  are all facing some flavor of antitrust and the blanket application we already know doesn't apply  so what's interesting here is Epic could force the hand of Apple and start to change parts of the

Start time: 819.30
End time: 849.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  industry. What is the so Apple's response to this by the way let me let me paraphrase it is  this is disingenuous of Epic. They've had apps on our app store for 10 years they've benefited  from their presence on the app store for 10 years now Apple says Epic's business interests  lead it to push for a special arrangement that would be unfair to other developers.  Whose reputation is more at risk here? Epic's or Apple's Ian?

Start time: 851.38
End time: 883.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Honestly I think this is a really interesting case because I mean let's face it you don't get  Fortnite because it's on the Apple store you get Fortnite because it's a really good game  and Apple has said they run a closed ecosystem if you want apps on our phones or on our hardware  you have to go through us and that seems blatantly anti-competitive. I admit I'm a  foreigner over here and but even so I mean what does that have anything to do with anything?  Well I mean not knowing quite how. Oh what are antitrust laws? They're different I've been told

Start time: 883.88
End time: 894.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mike's probably more an expert on this than I am but they're different in the EU than they are  here in the United States. Oh very much so yeah you would not get away with this in the EU but I mean

Start time: 894.88
End time: 919.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  US regulators are very much the sort of oh well do whatever you like and we'll issue a minor fine.  Honestly I'm with Epic on this one and yes Apple slept walked into this you know they walked right  into an ambush they had the epic had the trailer ready to go they had the lawsuits ready to go  this was done around about the time that Apple was facing antitrust talks in Congress this was

Start time: 919.92
End time: 937.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a hit job. Although if I'm a if I'm a Fortnite player I might be pissed off on the one hand  because we know Tim Sweeney personally made seven billion dollars last year from Fortnite  the game Epic made even more so it's not like they're hurting giving Apple their 30 percent

Start time: 937.56
End time: 949.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  hasn't hurt them. It's the principle of the thing surely I mean yes okay Apple says if you're if you  want to run software on our phones you have to give us 30 percent that seems to me to be

Start time: 949.80
End time: 978.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  anti-competitive you know it's Apple. It's not the percentage it's the fact that there aren't  others in the market where you can easily you know if it's the case that most people have one of two  operating systems and the preponderance of young people who play Fortnite are on iOS then it would  follow that you can't play the game reasonably in any other way because Apple has minimized the  market and and and collapsed whatever competition there might have been. By the way we should

Start time: 978.98
End time: 1015.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  mention I don't know how this will impact it but Tencent has a significant ownership stake in this  so the ownership and stake in everything yeah everybody yeah pretty much everybody so  but somebody wrote I think in Ars Technica they wrote there's also a risk to Apple here because  they're going to miss out on a whole if this continues on a whole generation of young gamers  who will not but where are they going to go are they going to go to Google I mean and and  and or maybe they'll just go to a console I don't really know

Start time: 1016.52
End time: 1022.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it reminds me remember when Sony went through the the DRM challenges and pissed off everybody

Start time: 1022.78
End time: 1027.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  yes the root scenario people still hold that against Sony I still talk to people all the time

Start time: 1027.88
End time: 1050.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  say I'll never own anything Sony right so you know Apple's in the process of trying to launch  its own system Google is still trying to get its system cloud-based gaming system off the ground  you know there are there's a lot of nuance here that just the average person playing  Fortnite either doesn't care or doesn't know anything about most people have never heard of  Tencent right so I I think that Apple has a lot to lose here in terms of again you know so the

Start time: 1051.08
End time: 1056.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  backlash will hit Apple more than it would hit I think from a long term strategic vantage point

Start time: 1056.56
End time: 1061.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  this is potentially a you know challenge it's bad for Apple Mike but it certainly could go against

Start time: 1061.74
End time: 1115.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Epic too I mean it kind of depends on how people how all this shakes out and there's certainly been  some anger about Epic and the way that they've done certain things I don't think for instance  the Google boycott worked so well for them yeah I think there are a lot of things where  you know Epic sort of made the first move here and I think a lot of people will see that and say like  yeah this is obviously just sort of a negotiating tactic and as part of that negotiating tactic they  they push things and effectively got themselves banned from the app store is that Apple's fault  or is that is that Epic's fault I think people can come down on either side but I'm not so sure  that that I would be positive that Apple is the one that most people would blame I think a lot  of people might start blaming Epic for for you know they made a ton of money doing it this way  for for a long long time and suddenly they want a better deal and you know Epic Epic has pissed off

Start time: 1115.60
End time: 1190.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  a lot of people it doesn't look it looks greedy yeah yeah by the way they said that they won't  they wouldn't take a penny from this settlement they're not seeking damages they just want Apple  to change its policies now I should point out the my opinion the company that has a much stronger  case is Microsoft here Apple also is not going to allow the x cloud service Microsoft streaming  game service on iOS and I think Microsoft can make a very strong case we're no different than  Netflix you allow Netflix it's a streaming game not a streaming movie it's interactive  but otherwise it were pretty much the Netflix of gaming and you're not going to allow us on here  because you say you can't vet the individual games that makes very little sense I think  Microsoft would have a stronger case that that Apple's doing this in their own economic interest  that they don't want you to play Stadia the Google games or x cloud the Microsoft games  or GeForce now or any of the other streaming services they want you to play Apple Arcade  and I think that's a very interesting economic argument interestingly Microsoft is as at least  to this point is not pursuing this in court I think Microsoft's going to let the court of public opinion  beat Apple on this one and I think maybe there will come out better than than Epic has got to

Start time: 1191.04
End time: 1200.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  come out on this well I mean who would have thought Apple would be monopolistic in its business  practices oh I know never would have never then again Microsoft pointing the finger is but I'm

Start time: 1200.60
End time: 1255.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  going to I'm going to I'm going to put on my purple wig here and say oh I already have it on  I'm going to say there is a case to be made maybe you guys can shoot this down I'm not making this  case but I've heard this made many many times Apple created all this value they created the iPhone  they created the app store they created an ecosystem people wanted to participate in  and for most developers Apple's doing a great service they're providing us a marketplace  they're providing storefront they're providing bandwidth it's much easier for the developer  if you went to Ingram Micro to distribute your game in the old days they took a hell of a lot  more than 30% so Apple's 30% is a small amount for distributing a program if you compare it to the  old days when you had software in boxes this is a preferable system and some developers do think

Start time: 1255.98
End time: 1321.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's preferable Mike and and I would say even if you go back to to early phones if you go back to  pre-iPhone days you know when you had like Verizon and AT&T that they had total control over their  phones and in order to get even you know you didn't have a marketplace even if you wanted to get an  app onto the phone you had to negotiate some sort of deal with Verizon or AT&T or whoever and they  would you know they would take a huge chunk of cash up front you had all these you know phone app  developers who were raising a bunch of you know venture capital just to hand it off to the telcos  you know the the iPhone Apple App Store setup is much more preferable it's why we have a mobile  ecosystem today in the first place so I actually think that argument makes a lot of sense the  question then is you know to get back to what Amy was saying is you know how do you define this  market from an antitrust perspective and is it is it monopolistic is it anti-competitive  well that again sort of depends on what what do you consider this marketplace to be but  you do have to admit that Apple created this whole entire space in the first place and that's you

Start time: 1321.40
End time: 1349.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  know that's not nothing yeah so what is the how does this get resolved I mean I I don't think we  want to let this go through the courts what could Apple do to make people happy Amy do you have any  thoughts about I mean part of the problem is we've never as you point out we've never seen anything  like this before so there's no precedent our current antitrust laws have are completely  unrelated to what's going on here so is there a compromise Apple could come up with that would

Start time: 1349.82
End time: 1490.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  make everybody happy right so all of the big tech companies Apple included have government  relations departments right whose job it is right to meet with and help write policy they all have  corporate foreign policy departments now I think when when I remember first starting to hear  grumblings about the 30 percent and Apple booting developers out of the store I think I think what  happened was there's just a lack of transparency and I think with a lot of these companies you're  not divulging IP I don't think you're giving strategic or competitive advantage by simply  saying in a very transparent way this is our roadmap this is what's happening here's why we're  doing it I think the problem is none of that communication happened and people are pretty  and all of this is also happening let's not forget during an incredibly volatile time when people are  having a hard time just confronting this uncertainty because of you know the virus and crazy weather  events this time of year and all of the social injustice protests that are happening so from a  regulatory perspective at this point you know we'll have to see if a judge picks up the suit  we'll have to see if congress does anything you know and and and whatever direction it winds up  going in and it'll be several months if not years before the whole thing gets sorted out but in the  court of public opinion that's the real court right Apple would do itself well at this point  I think opening up that line of communication a little bit better and talking about its plans  for the future Steve Jobs used to do that really well you know you sort of saw the future when he  took the stage and they unveiled a new product but when there weren't big press conferences or  events happening he was constantly talking about his vision for the future I think I think a lot  of this felt like it came out of nowhere and that Apple was suddenly trying to be super greedy  it's a business and this is what in business school we we call network value or I'm sorry  a value network right so right the whole thing falls apart unless everybody's contributing and  earning value and creating value and making money well there's another phrase they use at

Start time: 1490.14
End time: 1608.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  business school rent seeking and I think from Tim Sweeney's point of view from epic's point of view  is you want a piece of our action for doing nothing yeah right and so that's rent seeking so  uh this is I think here's my take on this is Apple's painted themselves into a corner when they first  started this up it made a lot of it was a simple thing they probably didn't look far enough down  the road to see these problems they they thought about it and they said look we're going to give  you bandwidth we're going to give you a storefront we're going to give you the option to be in this  ecosystem we've created we're going to give customers a safe place to go where they don't  have to worry about their kids they don't have to worry about themselves they don't have to worry  about malware the store will be highly curated it's going to be a win all around developers are  going to love it uh users are going to love it uh and I think that they were right in the initial  thing but what's happened is the world has evolved and now we've got to this position  where the lines aren't quite as clear x cloud is a really good example what exactly is it a game  store is it a is it netflix what exactly is it and I don't think that Apple's policies  encompass the range of activities now that are going on in the store I don't think Apple  honestly I don't think Apple acted out of greed I think they acted out of trying to make a good  marketplace and have an sensible plan but they didn't see far enough down the road as to the  problem that was going to crop up here and you can now they have been themselves of course because  you can't give epic a deal because then now that opens the door for a lot of other people  uh a lot of small developers have quite rightly considered uh criticized the app store for  inconsistent policies not being clear why stuff was pulled you do you want us to make that blue  that's that's the problem there's all sorts of little issues that have been bubbling around in  the app store for years it's it's kind of partly because it's too successful there's too many new

Transcript:  I mean Apple sorry I mean Apple obviously doesn't want to have to negotiate individual deals with  individual software companies because that's a massive pain in the ass for them but I mean in  terms of you know pure okay Apple has said yes we've created this app store we should take 30%  but a lot of the a lot works for a lot of apps but a lot of the people who want to buy a specific app  couldn't care less where it comes from they just want solid code and for Apple to claim 30% on that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  seems problematic to say the least well so so here's here's the issue um Leo said this somewhat  in passing but the the real challenge here is that there was no longer term strategic plan there  hasn't been at foresight I mean at uh fortnight there might have been some big picture idea but  fortnight's had its its fair share of ip battles so part of the problem is a lot of the planning  process gets front-loaded we want to do this this is our big strategic plan and maybe companies go  out 18 months two years five years that feels like there's this distant future and what they  forget is that the that sort of beginning of that plan gets reset at zero with every new business  day right and so if you're not able or willing to recalibrate and and see strategy as something that  gets worked on all the time and foresight is something more than cool trends um you know that  then you're okay but very few none of these companies that we've talked about you know among  all of the other big tech companies um foresight's not part of the product process you know what should  happen is you should go from cool idea or hackathon or whatever um to risk modeling right next um and  also opportunity modeling because there are probably ways to derive value that you know  and new synergies within the organization that nobody thought of and once you get past you know  something that's a rigorous modeling session then you go and you build um the or you mitigate some  of that risk and then you build what happens is that doesn't happen until way later in the process

Transcript:  go ahead mike go ahead i was going to jump in and just say like you know i i still think to some  extent that this is really just a negotiation right you have two giant companies that are  effectively negotiating with each other and i think in the end you know it would not surprise me at  all if apple effectively caves and says okay we're going to cut you know epic a better deal here and  yes the fear the reason they don't want to do this because they don't want to have to negotiate  with every single developer but the fact is not every developer and very very few developers are  as big or as powerful as epic and so therefore they'll probably cut a favorable deal with epic  and because of that they'll probably end up having to cut a favorable deal with you know a few other  very large players and everybody else will have to suck it up and take the 30% they kind of already

Transcript:  did this with amazon didn't they in order to get amazon prime yeah and and that's part of the problem  is they've already done special consideration if i were honestly if i were apple i just hold the  line and say sorry 30 it's our store there's one thing apple could and probably should have done  and i wish they had done that would probably help them in court uh the problem right now is that  apple has an iron grip on what can be run on that phone because they're the only unlike google  they're the only one with the app store i think google gets off the hook because google just says  sideload no big deal but apple no no they have an iron grip what apple should be doing and i wish  they would do is supporting progressive web apps that is uh websites that turn into apps when you  bookmark them on the phone it's kind of like back in 2007 except that the technology is much more  advanced both google and microsoft support it very well uh and you could easily have there's a  twitter mobile app for instance it turns into a twitter app on the iphone that's indistinguishable  from the native app you could easily do that and then apple could say but your honor there is a way  that this could be on it if they would do this we're not preventing that we just think that  our customers want a curated experience in the app store we think that's worth something we think 30  given the history of distribution deals is a very fair amount it's exactly what consoles charge  and it's not more than we deserve for what we've created and there's an alternative and that's  that's what's lacking right now is they can't say and there's an alternative is that is that going

Transcript:  else wanted to use the other one or here's another way to think about it you know amazon i think of  all of the different companies that are under the microscope right now is going to have it will be  the hardest to prove a case against amazon because there is amazon.com which is an online  marketplace where you can buy stuff there's aws there is the spatial mapping system for coal mines  there is the medical transcription service i mean amazon has done an incredible job of being very  diverse and not dominating any one particular market they are not the biggest online retailer  not by far they are not they don't have market dominance and logistics the value of amazon is  not any one individual business unit it's the connections between all of them it's it you know  having all of these systems work together functions as a kind of continual level up  so most of the ire is usually directed at amazon when we're talking about consolidation and  you know competition in the united states the problem is it's going to be very hard to to take  them down so we have to change how we're i think we don't have the right language yet to really  describe what it is that we're after right what we're after is you know fair practices and people  not being kind of crappy and you know companies make make you know feeling like we can trust  companies and that we don't start sort of with instant skepticism and that we feel okay using  the tools but you know facebook is an easier case i think apple and google are slightly easier  amazon is a totally different beast and yet that's the company that everybody is kind of gunning for

Transcript:  because and i'm listen i'm not trying to defend amazon but in the case of bezos you've got the  money that the that people say that you're worth on paper and then you have actual spendable  you know liquidity right and the problem is that the that our government in the united states is  not funding by anywhere by any reasonable level we are not funding basic research in science and  technology so we've sort of offloaded all of this to the private sector and i find it difficult for  us to to criticize and again i'm not defending certainly not defending past behavior but like  elon musk you know bezos they're in a way self-funding with loopholes and taxes and  everything else but you know they're building the next generation of of the technology that will be  needed for space right we can argue about whether or not that's even necessary at this particular  moment in time but but if the we can't both um say there shouldn't be lots you know we we can't both  close the wealth gap but while at the same time not reinvesting in our the critical infrastructure  that is our intellectual property in the united states it's so hard to have conversations like

Transcript:  i'm i'm and i'm keeping it on it's not going away you are brave  and i'm sweating up a storm you can take it off you can take it off you don't have to worry  so anyway so to get back to the point that you were saying about the marginal tax rate right so  there was just uh just a couple days ago i saw that california was proposing to to effectively  boost the the marginal tax rate on the wealthiest folks here and there was all this talk of how all  the the successful silicon valley entrepreneurs are going to move out of california because  there it was going to i think you know for the highest earners was going to push the marginal  tax rate up to like 55 percent or something like that nowhere near the sort of 90 95 percent that  was from from you know a few decades back and so you know you have this issue of you know people  will go elsewhere too if the tax rate is too high and i think everybody's correct that there's two  separate things to being talked about here one is the sort of fundamental basic uh research the the  the r of the r and d and then there's the d side of it and we've we've now moved you know from a  world where there was a ton of money going into r and less into d to a world that now everything  is just it's all focused on development yeah and and very little on the fundamental research the  other side of this is finding that balance is is important space is a bad example because we spend

Start time: 2887.90

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  so little on space uh you know almost shamefully but uh very shameful but but for instance the amount  of money bill gates puts into uh public health and vaccines is a tiny fraction of what governments  can spend so you can't expect you can't put this on the private sector they're just not only is it  that it's market driven that they're going to be development folks there are all sorts of reasons  but it's also a tiny fraction of the kind of money government can spend and i just think that  that's abrogating your responsibility to say well let the private sector do it is is  i know that that's a popular current in american thinking right now but i don't think it's the right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is automatic right uh yeah so they have these you know systems these bots that go and are  constantly monitoring different websites that have adsense on it uh and you know what we had written  originally about the with the federalist was that we had gotten similar notices but we got them  you know once every month or once every two or three months we would suddenly get a notice from  google and was saying there's a problem on this particular article and it was usually our comments  something in our comments that they didn't like and they didn't want their ads to appear next to  it and that's apparently what they had told the federalist and the federalist turned into this  big thing that google was you know against them for their conservative viewpoints but that's always

Transcript:  a concern for advertisers uh i as with our advertisers too they don't want to be in an  environment that doesn't reflect well on them so that's why it's difficult youtube's difficult  twitter's difficult and so it makes perfect sense that adsense would be monitoring the pages that  the ads are going to appear on and if there's anything controversial they'll say okay well  you're not going to get an ad until that goes away right mike what was it well do you know what the

Start time: 3600.94
End time: 3661.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  content was well this is the problem so what happened was two weeks ago suddenly instead of  getting like one every two or three months we started getting like two or three notices every  day uh and you know you would have to and there would be no information in the notice you would  have to log into the to the platform and then it would give you very little information but it would  list out you know it kept changing so somewhere between 20 and 30 urls some you know were very  very old uh some didn't even exist my favorite one was one that didn't even exist if you clicked on  it would just take you to the front page of tech dirt uh what my my two favorites were uh the  tag page for google was deemed dangerous and derogatory uh and so therefore they could not  put ads on that and then the second one which felt somewhat ironic was that the tag page for  content moderation was also deemed uh derogatory dangerous or derogatory and so then is this kind

Start time: 3675.24
End time: 3749.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that's that's what i thought and i had actually emailed some people at google and said hey  did something go haywire because suddenly you know now we were getting like two or three of  these messages every day and the list kept changing we weren't doing anything and so like  you know urls that were bad would suddenly disappear from the list and the new ones would  appear and there was no explanation for it and so i said you know did something go haywire and they  said nope nothing's changed uh and you know the feedback i got was basically like well pass along  your criticism to the teams about how to better communicate and it's like that doesn't help me  and then we just sort of kept getting you know angrier and angrier messages whereas in the past  usually they would just say you know we we just won't put ads on this page and to us we're like  fine whatever we don't get money for that page no problem but now they started putting these notices  that said you must fix it and then they told us if we weren't able to fix these things and again  they weren't very clear as to what the problem was by the end of august that they were going to cut  us off and then it just got worse and worse and we just said you know forget it i don't i don't  want to spend all my time dealing with this so we pulled all the ads down and so right now we have  no ads on the site other than uh you know sort of house ads and we're trying to figure out what  we're going to do about it but you know right now we're we're we're not making advertising revenue

Start time: 3749.74
End time: 3772.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  so that's terrible you really are defunded well but you're also so you're not earning revenue but  they're not earning revenue either so it seems like if this is happening across the board yeah  they don't want this there there would be somebody within the organization looking around for  for broken code is what it sounds like to me but again like our experience sorry our experience of

End time: 3849.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it really is i'm mike sorry i interrupted no that's okay i mean you know the the thing is that was my  assumption too is that they had code that had gone haywire but we from we haven't heard other sites  having the same sort of you know sudden rush of notices and we've doubted people at google and the  the response that we've gotten is that no this was this was an accurate uh thing and so if you  want to keep having the ads on your site you have to fix it and again like what is what do we think  me yeah yeah and so like you know even in the cases where you know in some articles some are  articles like i could figure out like yeah sure they probably don't like these particular comments  or you know we had some articles about the uh the the george floyd protests that were pretty angry  because we think that's a situation worth being angry about and they said that was shocking content  and so like okay that's shocking content but we're not going to change that just because  google doesn't like it if they don't want to put ads on that page fine but like you know things  like the tag page for google what are we supposed to change on that you know i'm not going to be  nice to google just so that google keeps their ads on the page if that's the problem i think  that's a bigger deal trying to influence our coverage like hey that's not cool advertisers

Transcript:  said well no sorry stuff that way yeah we won't let advertisers dictate editorial i understand  though advertisers are trying to avoid controversy so uh because they that you know their their  interest is pure commerce they just want to sell a product they don't want to get people mad at them  so i understand that but why for instance google suddenly say that your newsletters your daily

Start time: 3889.58
End time: 3931.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  emails are phishing yeah that was the other thing that the exact same day that this started  all of our daily newsletters which are just the the literally like a snapshot of the day's blog  sent out as an email were put into phishing and so for people who had g suite they were just  automatically deleted and you've got a note saying we're not showing you tech nerds newsletter today  because it was a phishing attempt and for people who just had gmail it was put into spam with big  red warning letter you know on top saying this is this is consistent with a phishing email we're  like what where's the phishing aspect we're not asking anyone to sign in it's just a the you know  a snapshot of of a blog you know of all the stories of the of the day and so mike you've got to have

Start time: 3992.72
End time: 4024.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  that day will come it's possible i mean the thing honestly what would what would make this better  though is if at least they would explain to us what the deal is right i mean the only information  that we get is you know this was deemed dangerous and derogatory or this was deemed shocking and  it's like well well how do we fix that right and it's like i'm not gonna i'm not gonna try and  figure out how to make our our page on google not something that they find derogatory like that's  not worth it in any sense of the word and so like it's the kind of thing that would make kafka just

Transcript:  to be the issue and it's you know it's funny i mean i find the whole thing somewhat ironic i  totally like i sympathize with with google being in this position because i recognize they're  trying to you know they're trying to keep their advertisers happy and i would bet that you know  most of the sites where these things pop up and where people complain you know they probably are  people who are doing bad things and trying to game the system and so they have these processes in  place it's just that you know we happen to be one of the exceptions now i'm so sorry i think  yeah we're pretty good actors but they don't think so very good now we're in the market for  for different different different advertising solutions we are exploring our options as we  speak yeah it sounds like adsense is not a there's not a long-term solution no i mean i know how you

Transcript:  feel mike because we're advertising driven the same way and we're still putting our content out  for free but i don't know it's it's scary times over the next few years we're gonna have to see  how this shakes out but i don't honestly think that giving a company like google that much control  over your revenue flow there's no way we can get around it but there has to be a better way

Start time: 4138.32
End time: 4164.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  well yeah no and and look i mean we've we've been trying to explore different ways for a long time  and you know to be honest like you know adsense is you know it's not a huge part of our revenue  stream because we've been exploring all different things and so like losing them sucks right i mean  it's still a loss of revenue but it is not that is not 100 of our revenue it's not even 50 of our  oh that's good it's still you know it is still a certain amount of it that we would prefer that

Transcript:  think about the long term so yes something needs to be done to provide better services for the  people who are contract workers but this referendum on uber and lift has very long-term consequences  for the state of california katie binley and the wall street journal the weekend journal has a  huge story about tech migration and people because of the virus choosing to live somewhere else and  then just you know if you're working from home you could work from home anywhere it doesn't have to  be california but if you're in a situation where you're a contract worker and there's  lingering economic recession and the virus is protracted california stands i think to  you know one of the unintended consequences of trying to get people better benefits is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  their all their stuff on the on the roof i agree that something should be done but this is so like  the problem with every government is that there's no planning there's no long-term planning in place  so this addresses an existing problem without thinking through the next order impacts and how  how you could wind up you know it's all coming from a very good place but you could wind up with

Start time: 4501.52
End time: 4593.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  serious problems on the other side yeah so yeah i think that part part of the thing with ab5 was  just that it assumes that that everyone who is a contractor or a freelancer or a gig worker wants  it to be a full-time job right and i think for those who actually do want that then there's  there's benefits there but for a huge number of those people they actually don't want it to be a  full-time job they like the flexibility they like the ability to have it be like an additional income  or or to you know be able to to change things up or to make their own hours and things like that  and ab5 doesn't take that into account and you know certainly in the journalism space the number of  freelancers in california i know a bunch of them certainly who are all suffering because this  law and they're saying you know we never wanted to be full-time i don't want to be tied to a  particular publication which is probably going to go out of business soon anyways right you know i  want to be able to bounce around and so you know and i think that there you know people say it's  very cynical that that uber and lyft have been pushing for sort of like a third option between  freelance contractor and full-time employee but when you look at it there's actually it makes  sense like there should be something different because it is a different type of work and you  know you want there to be you know some sort of safety net for them in terms of doing their job  but saying that it has to be a full-time employee or or you know a you know fully  benefited employee is not necessarily the right answer so figuring out something in between would  be good but that's not what the california legislature has done i talked to a lot of really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  new york is part of the reason why uber so uber was able to grow because that was again lack of  planning yeah they never issued more medallion as somebody who's in new york intentionally limited  them that was intentional right and it became absolutely untenable so just before the virus  you had a hundred thousand uber drivers crowding the streets of the boroughs many of them in  manhattan you know also was bad but the whole thing again a lot of our current problems are  the result of nobody thinking that through the next order impacts right and having the the  wherewithal to make short-term decisions that benefit the longer term versus cause risk and

Transcript:  the thing the thing that i don't fully understand that uber and lyft haven't done that i think they  might have been in a better position if they had done is make it a real marketplace where it left  the drivers effectively set their prices as well and then let uber and lyft sort of match you know  you know prices based on what what customers are looking for and what drivers are willing to accept  instead like basically they're doing everything uber and lyft are setting everything including  exactly what the price is and therefore it's harder to call them a true marketplace if they  had set it up as a real marketplace then i think they would have a stronger argument here

End time: 4780.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that they're doing that for a reason because they want to dominate the market and once they've got  oligopoly or monopoly control then they can jack the prices up but their business model doesn't  work unless they can pay less than taxi you know taxi drive and i'm with you amy the the taxi system  in the u.s and i spoke to a vc and he goes you want to know why uber really took off an sf  because sf taxi drivers are amongst the worst in the world for screwing you over  and i can understand that totally but i'm sorry if someone's working 60 hours a day for uber  sorry 60 hours a week for uber they are a full-time employee and they should be treated as such

the future  today institute future today institute.com ian thompson from the register.com mike masnick from  tech dirt.com always a pleasure having you guys we were going to have a little fortnight fight  but we decided not to i'll get this camera yet now i'm out of ammo  i should have been at 330 for these naming i have to calibrate the sights on this nerf pistol  uh we you know when we moved into the brick house uh many moons ago i guess almost 10 years ago  i had this crazy idea because we had this giant 10 000 square foot basement that at the time was  completely empty we eventually we filled it with crap but at the time was completely empty and i  bought like 20 nerf guns i thought we'd have a great big battle this is the last one left i  don't know where they've all gone to our show today brought to you by wasabi hot cloud storage  i think this is amazing but i wish more people knew about everybody knows about amazon s3 what if i  told you there was something that was compatible with the s3 api but was 80 cheaper  didn't didn't charge for egress didn't have all those crazy tears that was even faster than s3  provided 11 nines of durability wouldn't you be interested but everybody talks about oh amazon  google the cloud's gotta be microsoft it's wasabi wasabi's disruptive price performance model  is putting everything it's upending people's storage plans wasabi is actually less than on  prem storage less than just the annual cost for maintenance fees on on prem storage that's how  much you save with wasabi there it is a fantastic way and if you know you're going to be creating a  lot of data most companies do you know we're going to have a terabyte a week or whatever  wasabi is a great choice just compare that to the cost of on-prem storage you your boss might say  well on prem we know it's safe for it's secure no wasabi's 11 nines of durability they're hosted in  premier tier four data centers that are not only fully secure but they're fully redundant they do  active integrity checking all objects stored on wasabi servers are checked for integrity every  90 days and because they're on redundant network centers if there's one bit off you can restore  it and you never lost a bit you that's how you get 11 nines of durability it's secure by default  everything stored in the wasabi cloud is always encrypted at rest even if you don't specify it  of course they follow all the industry's best security models and design practices you've got  access control mechanisms bucket policies acls the one of my favorite things and it's great if  you're if you're reading about garmin and all the people being hit by ransomware you will love this  your data in the cloud is can be immutable you can say this can't be changed it cannot be erased  it cannot be altered either by malware hackers fumble-fingered employees your data is safe  wasabi is highly secure disruptive technology that's turning its industry on its ear 80  cheaper six times faster than amazon s3 and now there are two ways to go there's flat fee  very affordable or you can pay you can pay one time and get reserved capacity storage this is  for companies that know we're going to be using a certain amount of storage every week every month  every year so what you do is you reserve it with wasabi ahead of time it's just like you would buy  storage ahead of time you're not going to buy the hard drive the minute you need it you buy it ahead  you buy reserve the capacity with wasabi for one three or five year increments the more you reserve  the longer the term the more you'll save you can save a lot like i said it's significantly less than  on-prem storage it's less than the annual cost of maintenance fees for on-prem storage wasabi is just  a no-brainer and if you're a managed service provider and and you sell you resell this stuff  you're gonna you're gonna love it because you can sell it at a lower cost and still make more money  everybody wins with the sabi calculate the savings for yourself you can start a free trial right now  for one month go to wasabi.com click the free trial link into the code twit play with it bang  on it mess with it i think you'll see really but since it uses the s3 api all your tools will  already work join the movement migrate your data to the cloud and do it with confidence wasabi.com  look everybody's using more and more storage wasabi is the place to do it wasabi.com use the offer code  twit hey before we go on we had a fun week this week on twit and i uh i understand a small movie  has been made to

Transcript:  a degree in game theory okay good that's very useful so i tend to fall back on the belief that  the best way forward is one in which um we can't win unless china also wins right right so so we  need to be in it we need to create a situation in which we both lose together we both win together  um that is much easier said than done we need to set up a prisoner's dilemma in effect an artificial  one um that and but it but it needs to be economic in scope right and um the challenge is that the  weight the longer that we wait to develop something like that the harder it's going to be  and china has been in the process of of making new alliances around the world at the same time  that we are angering our alliances around the world so i think there's a way forward but it  has to be much more you know mike is right this is not just about tiktok and we shouldn't die on  the mountain that is tiktok but you know tencent is an issue alibaba is an issue bidu is an issue  you know megv is an issue that sense time is an issue that we have a lot of issues microsoft buying

Transcript:  yeah i i mean i i think that i think that he was a whistleblower right i mean he exposed  things that the nsa was doing that were bad and i think violated the fourth amendment and caused a  lot of problems and i think that the government has treated him very very badly i also will note  by the way that in 2013 trump himself issued a tweet where he said that he thought snowden should  be executed so his own view seems to shift over time depending on what is going on and there is  a feeling that you know like so many things with trump when a reporter asks him a question he will  say yes of course we're looking into that when he doesn't really have much of an idea of what he's  actually talking about so i i would be surprised if he does anything but i you know that would be  like you know one of the rare good things that that i think the president would do if he did  issue a pardon i'm not holding my breath and i don't think edward snowden is holding his breath
