Transcript:  Okay and then last but definitely no means least considering you've been I was thinking about it  we've actually got probably a century of technology experience just in the four of us here. You don't have to get nasty.  No no I'm proud of it. I got my RSA badge and had 20 year veteran veteran on it. It was like okay I'm an old fart but still but Dwight. Dwight's joining from Houston from Houston and you know you've been doing this now

Start time: 213.10
End time: 226.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so you're online in 2000 so I mean way ahead of most of the field. How's it going down there? Oh yeah good. I actually have been doing this since like 1990 so it's been it's been forever. It's great here at Houston we got a beautiful day almost

End time: 280.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  California like weather and I hope it lasts. Oh yes although Houston and humidity tend to go together like  eggs and bacon but yes we'll see. Right well it's been a very very busy week. We've had not one but three security conferences in San Francisco.  Started off with B-sides on Sunday then we had the main RSA 40 000 people jamboree kicking off  in the main town but also the RSA conference which was set up after RSA managed just to get one female  keynote speaker and a bunch of people in the industry said uh hang on a second we we do have more women than  that in infosec and then RSA gave out the solution which was well there's only very few women in  infosec so it's not something worth worrying about and in a couple of days they'd managed to sort out 14  female speakers and one token male. Did you get down to RSA or? I signed up and then didn't go

Start time: 280.46
End time: 297.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  because I just didn't have the time but I've gone before. I miss the old days because then you could  just use the women's bathroom and there was no line. It's fantastic if you had the guts to do that but  yeah I guess you know things change and now you have to wait in line. It was a total sausage fest. It was

Start time: 297.70
End time: 319.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a good one down to the enigma conference earlier this year and they said one of the really  encouraging signs is that there's a line for the ladies as well for the gents. It's progress.  We're getting there. I mean it's um I mean was there anything that really sort of grabbed your  sort of grabbed your attention from this? I mean RSA is always very tricky because they sell a  lot of their keynotes. Often not a lot gets said but um I don't know there's some interesting stuff.

Start time: 319.44
End time: 379.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There was a lot of interesting stuff going on. I think that one of the most interesting things in  the sort of culture of security technology in general is that the threats and the problems and  the exploits and all that stuff is so they're so common. They're so large. They're so frequent  that there's at any given time now there's like 15 major things for people to stress out and worry  about and you know you really almost have to go to this a conference like this to have the slightest  inkling of exactly what the threats are, what the threats aren't and we're and it just keeps  getting worse and so you know I think it's getting to the point where platforms like the Chromebook  it's getting to the point where people are just going to have to do pretty serious if they want  to have any security at all pretty serious extreme measures just to have basic security  because you know it's an arms race and I feel like people who want security are losing that arms race.

Start time: 380.12
End time: 390.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think very much so. I mean it's a question of I mean defense is always much harder than  offense but I mean in terms of stuff that we've got coming through the line,  Dwight, Greg, anything that really grabbed your attention?

Start time: 391.90
End time: 395.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no the RSA conference is generally a waste of time. I have a completely different opposite

Start time: 395.86
End time: 400.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  view to Mike Algon. You know there's a couple of RSA marketers putting their name on a dartboard

Start time: 400.60
End time: 444.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  right now. I don't go to any of the mega conferences because there's basically so  much noise and effectively zero signal. The challenge with the RSA conference is  it only happens once a year and the thing about security is we're actually in my view is you're  actually patching what is fundamentally broken products. So how much effort do we expend trying  to make Windows safe and fit for use? How much effort do you spend making Android bug free or  you know trying to get your patches on all that sort of stuff? The simple fact is the whole security  industry exists because IT vendors are so bad at making products and then they've doubled down on  convincing us to fix their products by going into an aftermarket to fix the faults that shouldn't

Start time: 444.48
End time: 453.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  have been in there in the first place. See Greg the reason you think that they're a waste of time  is because you're not going on a press pass. If you're in the press it's a convenient way to meet

Start time: 453.62
End time: 478.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  all kinds of people plus free alcohol. I've done the conferences on the press pass and same thing  holds true you still don't meet anybody that's useful or worthwhile. You meet executives who  make one or two decisions a year and think that they're really impressive and important  but the real work is actually done amongst the hackers and they don't go to RSA except to go  and hang out in bars and to practice karate moves on each other and stroke each other's ponytails.

Start time: 482.10
End time: 528.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  So lest anybody be confused that there's actually the full the in general the quality of the people  you can meet is in the middle so the big conferences like CES you can't meet anybody  like you know this or you know Mobile World Congress is difficult as well although there  are some smaller European vendors you can you can reach. The very smallest conference nobody's  there either. The middle-sized conferences which I actually think conferences like RSA or are is in  the ballpark you actually get some really interesting you get technologists who are leading some of the  sessions you can buttonhole them after their sessions and learn some things as an opinion  columnist it's a great way to like sort of get a spark of an idea where you're like it's not  the information it's the it's the guy with the ponytail stroking thereof and so on.

Start time: 530.00
End time: 553.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That wasn't RSA this time around this was that was B-sides. Okay. B-sides was two days of hacking.  Not only do they do they have just it's a two-day run they've got genuine hackers there they also  to come back to your earlier point give out drinks tickets with the conference  conference passes and Marcus Hutchins from the WannaCry thing was there this year there's a lot  of interesting research. I mean Dwight what's your view on big conferences are they worth the trouble

Start time: 553.52
End time: 610.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  or is it just like marketing fluff? I think well I think it depends kind of on who you are you know  if you're if you are somebody that they want to talk to you know if you're from the New York Times  or the Wall Street Journal the Washington Post you're somebody with has a big megaphone  and a large audience you'll find the people who want to talk to you and you can you can button  hold them. You know I have worked for a long time for a mid-level paper that sometimes gets some  attention and sometimes gets some love from these folks and so I think they can be if you know who  to talk to and you have something very specific as far as security conferences go I kind of like  Defcon and Black Hat those are the ones I mean if you can survive it as a member of the media  because they'll harass the hell out of you but I think Defcon and Black Hat are probably the  better choices for if you really want to talk to people and find out what's going on. Then you have

Start time: 610.36
End time: 619.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to go to Vegas and nobody wants that. Well that's right well that's the downside. Yeah I have to do it every year and it's the one thing that will get me into Vegas in in August besides a cattle prod

Start time: 620.30
End time: 642.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but I would disagree on Black Hat because that now is basically RSA with hookers whereas Defcon has got very big  there are 20 000 people there last year so it's kind of getting too big to be functional but again  B-sides in Las Vegas going on just before the main shows kick off I went there for the first time last  year pretty damn good but yeah I mean Black Hat. Once a conference gets beyond 5 000 people it just

Start time: 644.08
End time: 698.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doesn't you there's just too much just physically getting around is very difficult finding signal  and the noise finding the people that you want to talk to it stops being a happy day and but  particularly security conferences most of the time what you're seeing is grandstanding or  stunt hacking the security companies are saving up their best product announcements for that week  and you end up with all this news crammed into a week and then you can't cover it because you know  the news cycle is such that when we cover those conferences in the shows that I publish  you really have to pick out no more than three or four things but so much is announced in a single  week and really these vendors would be better off just going into the release cycle and looking for  the quiet periods and announcing their products or the transitions when you know not at a football  game but when there's a quiet time and places for us to cover it. Yeah it helps to go in with a

Start time: 699.10
End time: 715.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  focus I mean if you just go in and wander around and you know talk to people you'll get something  but if you do your homework do stuff look for stuff in advance figure out exactly what you want  to know and who might be able to talk to you about it things will come out a lot better.

Start time: 715.58
End time: 745.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well this is it once the speakers list is announced then every journalist is just like right okay let's  go through the speakers list see if they're willing to talk to us early that way I can save myself  trogging around Caesars game trying to get to the right place but yeah I don't know in many ways the  conference season seems to have got a little bit too large in some areas but then again we have  you know we have Caesars over here we've got Mobile World Congress in Spain you've got CBIT  in Hanover if you're really a masochist. So one of the things that's interesting two of the things

Start time: 745.28
End time: 828.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  that's interesting in technology in the Bay Area is that there are so many conferences and the other  one is there's so much experimentation in terms of startups so every you know half the startups  that have some experimental thing will roll out in one city that city will be San Francisco  every once in a while it's Bay Area like Pizza Robot started in Mountain View the whole thing  about you know somebody would concierge would come and park your car that was in San Francisco  people come and take out your trash that was San Francisco and so it's the Bay Area is an interesting  place for conferences and the reason for that I don't think it's the attendees I think it's  the speakers and so on so if you have a conference on artificial intelligence and you have it in the  Bay Area there's some really good speakers there and you have Google people showing up and all this  kind of stuff and so it's a it's a really nice place New York City is pretty good too but generally  speaking conferences are a whole different plot but the downside is half the conferences that you  see on a calendar of tech conferences are complete garbage they're for wannabes who just and you go  and you go to these things and it's just wannabes talking to wannabes nobody's really doing anything  interesting and so you got to pick and choose but there's some really good conferences in  in San Francisco again around artificial intelligence some of the some of the sort  of leading edge you know interface conferences very specific conferences that are actually pretty  cool and you know like like Greg said these are you know you're going to have like a thousand people

Start time: 828.14
End time: 843.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  or two thousand people at these things yeah it's really easy like you said it's easy to get speakers  in San Francisco and a lot of easy to get speakers who don't want to get paid in San Francisco which  is a big deal to making conferences profitable so or indeed selling off the keynotes themselves

Start time: 843.32
End time: 852.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  which is another way to make them insanely profitable but one of those things okay well  we'll return to security matters a little later on but right now Leo may be far away but he

Transcript:  does have this message from our sponsors thank you Ian let me interrupt just for a moment I know I'm  in Japan but I had to come back and tell you about last pass I am such a believer it's really nice  when we can get an advertiser that I've been using forever actually a lot of our advertisers  are that way certainly last pass you've heard me talk about last pass we like last pass so much  Steve Gibson interviewed the creator Joe Segrist boy that's a few years ago now Joe was you know  very kind to Steve showed him everything how it works all the code and Steve gave it his absolute  seal of approval he uses last pass if you have to keep track and it's not just passwords although  that's the big thing but of passwords but I also use it for driver's license social security numbers  private stuff of all kinds where I know it's safe and it's both safe locked up but also accessible  wherever I am desktop laptop smartphone tablet my last pass goes with me everywhere that means I can  log in to any site anytime Patrick Delahanty our programmer guy here who's also a last pass user  says he likes it because he forgets you know he'll create an account for a site like DMV once every  three years right you got to make a department of motor vehicles login to make an appointment  you don't remember that you may not even remember you made the site but when you go to the site  the last pass little logo pops up and you fill it in you go oh yeah I do have an account I do that  all the time all the time last pass goes through all of your if you want they have a great security  check goes through all your passwords tells you which ones need to be updated it has one button  automated update for many many sites it works so easily android and ios where it just fills it in  automatically so no typing means no more mistakes I can go on and on last pass is the best way to  keep track of all of your passwords and credentials and serial numbers and special documents my you  know when I travel I put my passport in last pass it's secure there but then I have a copy  of my passport on everything and that's the cool thing about last pass it it it synchronizes with  everything now the password vault which is synchronizing is completely secure 256 AES  encryption even last pass can unlock it which is nice and I add in addition to that I add  second factor authentication so it's got a good long strong password I use two factor authentication  I feel very very confident that that password vault is safe and yet it's everywhere when I  set up a new computer first thing I put on my computer first thing I put on my new phone last  pass because it's going to help me log into everything else we use last pass at work we  have last pass enterprise and one of the benefits we give all our employees is a last pass account  for free because I'm I'm such a strong believer in this it's the number one most important thing  you can do to protect yourself online last pass products for enterprise for premium for personal  use for families last pass for teams they've got a product that's right for you find out more  fix your password woes protect yourself improve your security and it's more convenient last pass  dot com slash twit you know he's always say there's a trade-off between security and convenience  in this case you get both you really do last pass dot com slash twit if you're not yet a last pass  customer what's holding you up pause the podcast and go do it last pass dot com slash twit  are you all right you're done okay now we can resume ian thompson and the twit family go ahead

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  guys right okay so it's been a headline grabbing week for apple when has it not been but we just  have to report that when it comes to actual smartphone sales apple and the product line  taking over a third of the entire revenue straight out the back so all those mobile phone  manufacturers out there the billions of smartphones out there apple is sucking it up now we have a  mixed panel here some apple users some android users mike you've actually bought your woodframed  ipad here you have you haven't gone for the iphone 10 or x depending on how you describe it

Start time: 1100.92
End time: 1198.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  10 or x which one would 10 yeah with the 10 yep because i i think the next one's going to be an  11 they pulled a microsoft they skipped a generation there has been no iphone 9 but  yeah iphone 10 for sure i've got seven eight nine or sorry one of the things i was surprised about  obviously you know apple always dominates profits if you think about what is apple make the one  thing they make better than anyone is profits but iphone 10 actually had much significantly  higher profits than any of the other iphones the numbers are ridiculously priced yeah well i guess  i mean we're probably going to talk about the samsung the cost of the samsung screen and so on  so it's it's expensive for them to make and i you know they it's amazing they got as many people to  buy it as they did but 35 percent of of the industry's profits were the iphone 10 19  the iphone 8 15 percent iphone 8 plus 6 iphone 7 5 iphone 7 the first non-apple device on the list  is the galaxy note 8 at 3.9 percent basically four percent of the industry profit so apple once  again is winning it all and this doesn't even tell you what they're making on app sales they get a  third of of all the app sales getting on on the streaming services like apple music and so on  it goes on and on and on they make money on everything every aspect of the just about every  aspect of the phones but this is just for selling the hardware and it's really it's the business  story of i think the the decade or the millennium or something like that they just are printing  money and it's kind of ridiculous they're on track to be the first trillion dollar valuation company

Transcript:  i think amazon might get there first i'm not sure could be it could be they they may have a fight  for it at the moment and not president trump has anything to do with it yes we may come onto that  later on i mean greg and dwight what's your view on this i mean are you are you apple fanboys are

Start time: 1213.96
End time: 1268.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you android users are you i am an apple user and and i've i use pretty much all their products  i'm you know it's not a surprise they are aiming at the high end of the market the where the profits  naturally are better they made apple an aspirational brand so you want to have it  maybe even if you can't afford it and they have and they have a variety of products you know in a  in a variety of price ranges so i think they're being very smart about it the question is is how  much can can they sustain you know they have earnings coming up on on may 1st and and there  has have been several analysts who have said well they're just not doing as well as as expected on  the iphone 10 and so we'll actually we'll get a better look at what is actually going to happen

Start time: 1268.64
End time: 1376.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  when those earnings drop so i'm an apple user or an apple consumer i'm not a i'm not a fanboy  i was a fanboy but increasingly i'm less inspired by apples going forward i think the price is  getting out of whack with the value being delivered and so you know as it says here in the  21 percent of the total revenue goes to apple but they make 35 percent of the total industry  profits i've heard different numbers i heard they sort of take 30 percent of the total revenue but  70 percent of the total profits or whatever but either way apple's charging is working in the  premium end of the market and charging premium pricing that it has a vast profit margin but then  not only that but part of the reason they're making the profit margin is a couple of things one is  security unlike a microsoft or an android your device is more or less secure although there's  signs that there's cracks in that coming forward it's not buggy compared to anybody else's  smartphones or anybody else's products and so they do actually have a reason for being regarded  as a premium supplier but i think the other thing that we are not covering here that's not covered  in this report of course is that avid apple is very much increasing its arpu avenue revenue per  customer or average revenue per user to be literal by having things like the the headphones you know  the apple earphones they've got with the x1 chip inside apple tvs the mac has increasingly an  accessory to the iphone the app store the music the home pod you know all those accessories mean  that you're not just buying the phone anymore the phone is the linchpin of an entire ecosystem  around which you're going to buy you know one or more of those fries with the with the iphone burger  and i think you don't don't underestimate that much that part of the the strategy greg just to

Start time: 1376.22
End time: 1402.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  follow up on that and and clarify you you said that you your understanding was that the apple  was north of 70 total profits that used to be the case and now they're up to 87 that 35 is the  iphone 10 alone so the iphone 10 by itself as a sink as one of the many profitable apple devices  makes more profit than the top 600 android makers combined it's absolutely bonkers i mean it's

Start time: 1403.14
End time: 1426.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  almost like with android it's a race to the bottom whereas apple has just said yeah let's make this a  premium thing but then it isn't really reflected in their other product lines in that i mean greg  you said this is the linchpin but i know a lot of macbook users who are really really annoyed at the  moment that their laptops are not getting love we're using outdated hardware they've just said  that the next macbook isn't going to be coming through the line until 2019 i mean has apple given

Start time: 1428.78
End time: 1543.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  up on on on laptops i think there's a few i think there's a few things happening there one is intel's  product line has been disrupted they've missed a couple of generations in the cpus we always expected  to see intel release new cpus they did the tick tock and we expected them to happen every year and  then intel shifted to a three-year strategy and i just have the sense and this is just pure  speculation on my part apple was doing something and they missed a generation or two because  whatever it was they were working on didn't work so i know that for example apple intel completely  failed to deliver on mobile processors and mobile cpus and yeah that's right and so if you were  betting you know you had a whole production line ready to go and then intel suddenly pulls the pin  on that cpu that that they were going to push out there and your apple because apple had puts all of  its all of its weight behind a single product there's not like you know samsung they have like  nine to ten product families apple has two smartphones in the market today basically the  x and the eight they don't have this massive diversity which allows them to fail in one  product line and fail over they go all the way in so if if intel pulled the product line too late  then apple might not have had a backup strategy in place and that's why we haven't seen the iteration  so i'm not entirely sure that putting the blame at apple's feet is the thing to do of course it  is because it's up to them to meet the market and meet users expectations and to manage user  expectations i think that's the thing that apple's failed to do here we have an expectation as apple  customers to see a refresh cycle on the mac roughly every two years a major trend and we haven't seen  that and they haven't come out and talked about it or been public about it and we really feel a bit  a bit abandoned like i'm sitting here with a 2012 macbook waiting patiently for the next one because

Start time: 1543.90
End time: 1598.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  i'm not leaving my ports behind so yeah well and the other thing is is that you can wait  with the 2012 macbook pro because it still works it's still fast it still uses the most recent  operating system you know one of the things i think apple has kind of some  runway to coast on because its products do last forever i'm working here with a 2015 macbook pro  i have no desire to go to anything else i've got a 2012 mac mini at home which is a core i7 and i've  i've put in two ssds and it's as fast as anything that i could otherwise that i could get from apple  i'm very happy with it and so they have some grace there i think with their users that allow them  while they do have probably the pro side people who the ones who want something new all the time  i think people who buy them and hold on to their machines for a long time can do that

Transcript:  just it's buggy as all hell at the moment well i think that's why they're creating fuchsia for a  long time i was a fuchsia denialist uh fuchsia if you're not super familiar with fuchsia the fuchsia  os is a is an operating system that google has been working on from scratch uh and you can find  it on on github uh and it basically you can even look at it in a browser i just wrote a  piece about mobile operating systems on computer world if you want to check out the link to the  browser i guess that's the most efficient way to find it uh go to my twitter feed mike elgin you  can find it there um but but basically it looks like it this is an operating system that could  run on phones and on tablets it could replace android and chrome but i think that the model  for it is going to be like uh what do they call what does google call it the the instant apps  where only the parts of the app that you need are downloaded you never install an app imagine  operating system when all the apps are like that it'd be pretty i mean fuchsia is an attempt to fix

Transcript:  the problems of android as i understand it so the android operating system has reached the practical  limit of what it can do uh the and when they oem'd it and open sourced it all the other  uh companies out there who've been using the android operating system to sell smartphones  most of them still working on a version of that code from 2011 i believe or 2014 version 4 whatever  that is and they've got no motivation to upgrade those devices and move forward so the purpose  beyond fuchsia is to actually build an operating system which automatically patches automatically  updates so that when oem vendors take it they won't be able to like ignore the requirement  for security and patching right and then as you say the the feature that google wants or that  that google things can differentiate itself from its competitors is to have the instant install so  instead of going to an app store and downloading the app and having it download a whole bunch of  stuff why not just download a stub and then while you start playing with the app in the background  it's streaming down that's something google's been trying out for quite some time i don't think  that's going to be successful not because it won't be technologically successful but because  there's not enough bandwidth in the world to make that happen you have to be in places where you  know 4g 5g with massive fat pipes and content delivery network nodes close to the point where  you can actually stream the app out to the phone you're assuming there's enough bandwidth and if  you look at countries like indonesia and uh you know out there where the vast numbers of these  low-cost phones go that technology isn't going to work well you you can also um you can imagine

Transcript:  in tech now back to the show thanks leah okay now we just mentioned google's messaging and there was  a piece in a couple of titles google sort of hasn't said anything official on this point but  has leaked some friendly media people who it knows just to i think float some trial balloons about  once again trying it with messaging now we've seen over the years google try an awful lot of  things with messaging lots of different apps all over the place then trying to merge them then  splitting them apart um mike google should they just stop trying to do messaging it's not going

Start time: 2268.54
End time: 2304.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  to happen for them no they should keep trying and in fact this this uh the latest move which  is being portrayed in the press as oh here's another thing in messaging from google this isn't  another thing this is the thing that google's been working behind the scenes on for many many  years and it's a very positive thing and here's what essentially we're talking about sms has been  with us forever sms stands for short message service it's basically the long story short it's  something that already existed it was a channel that already existed it was an engineering  exactly and then so let's use this it's free for the carriers and yet we can charge for it it's

Start time: 2305.14
End time: 2318.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  free money well only in the u.s and europe you've got to you got it for free yeah one of the things  coming over here was just like hang on you're charging me for sms it's ridiculous but yeah i  mean it so how are they actually building that into the new messaging client that you can see

Start time: 2318.80
End time: 2394.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  well basically what what they're doing is google has been working on this replacement for sms  which is rcs and rcs is problematic as a news in the old days you could build standards there  weren't a million multi-billion dollar corporations all trying to get advantage in new standards and  so you could just have a single standard the internet was built on these these single standards  and that's why it all works together whereas nowadays it's very difficult so google has  actually been doing the right thing for a change they've been exercising their heft and leadership  to get all the carriers to buy into rcs to a single type an implementation of rcs that will  make it interoperable because again without somebody like google you can see moving from  sms to rcs and then going back to the days when you had to be on the same carrier you know  multiple incompatible versions and it's a big nightmare and it wouldn't work and so rcs just  to be clear is not something that will function like sms it will it's a feature it's a technology  that's built into the apps so any app could support the google implementation of rcs you need a phone  to support rcs you need the carrier to support rcs right now rcs exists but nobody uses it because  you need perfect alignment you both parties need the phone the app and the carrier and it's still

Transcript:  any number of other messaging apps have end-to-end encryption but they have the flaw that not everybody  supports it so only iphone users can use take advantage of you know if i send which i do  commonly if i send a message to somebody who uses android well that that is not encrypted the the  pictures and videos are are are dumbed down and become low quality there's all kinds of problems  with it so this is a this is a best case scenario for a leader like google to get everybody singing  from the same hymn book for the future of the sms replacement it's in general a very good thing  their app their history with apps is a very bad thing but this is actually a very good thing yeah

Start time: 2441.44
End time: 2546.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  doubtful though i think rcs is probably dead it is is flogging a dead horse the carriers don't want  it um the people in the telco industry who monitor this sort of thing basically can't see  there's certain technical challenges around rcs you're asking the telcos to go out and replace  all of their base stations um and to not only keep the sms functionality but to layer rcs over the top  and there's no money attached to it so for these telcos to go and implement rcs where's the money  that they're going to get from supporting this new service and there is none because sms's are  basically free so why would they go out and deploy this rcs to the technology behind rcs is actually  pretty rubbish people don't like it very much there's not too many products out there that make it work  and then the final thing is is that getting everything right so it's one of these network  effects once everybody's got rcs then it becomes useful and yes it would be i agree with you  mike that it would be a very good thing to replace sms with the rich communication services which  does you know allows sms to look like it's something from 2010 instead of like 1999 but i don't  you know and have have a universal messaging platform that's not linked to somebody like  apple's eye message or facebook messenger or whatsapp or you know or whatever it is but i just  don't see telcos globally coming together to implement rcs in their networks to replace  sms when there's no money attached to that service where there's no value add there's nothing that  drives customers and there's nothing that improves the customer experience so that even then they  would there's there's just nothing that brings the carriers into this into joining this well except

Transcript:  you're getting in there dwight so yes so one of these you know i've been i mentioned this  galaxy s9 the the review unit i got came from samsung so it's an at&t phone but it didn't come  from at&t but even just coming from samsung it has already on it two messenger messaging services  there's an if i if this had come from at&t it would have their messaging service on it as well  and so there's no guarantee that you put one more messaging service on it that anybody's going to  use it over any of these others you know i have a friend of mine who just switched from iphone to  the samsung galaxy s8 and he came to me said so which one of these messaging things is the one  that talks to other people and i said you know they they have their features where they will  where they will do things if they talk to the same messenger but they'll both do sms and so  there's no guarantee that that if you put yet another android chat thing on here that people  who are already using what they have are going to use it and so you know even if it's even if it's  as wonderful as as mike hopes it is there's no guarantee that users will actually pick it up

Start time: 2632.68
End time: 2675.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  and use it but one of the one of those apps that you mentioned is no doubt google's own  app which is actually very popular has 100 million users and and many of those users  love it is probably their best messaging platform and that one will get rcs the carrier one will  also probably get rcs so of the four apps you mentioned at least two of them are almost certainly  have rcs built in so you know i i think what google is trying to do and i think that they might  succeed it looks like so far they might succeed is you need to get a certain amount of momentum  behind something and once you have a sufficient momentum behind something like this then people  have to join because they'll their users their customers will be left out of this ability to

Transcript:  communicate with each other but this was the original problem when telcos started to try and  shift from sms to different services that they could actually monetize in that you know we had  the whole mms the multimedia messaging services which just died on its ass because nobody was  prepared to use it there was a whole bunch of conflicting standards isn't this the same kind  of thing i mean google wants to create this unified app but just doesn't seem to be able to get

Transcript:  people to use it well again if they can get the carriers to use it and get a significant number  of app developers to use it and they themselves in their own apps will use it you're seeing  you know you're getting pretty close i think as journalists though we should be cheerleading this  thing because anything that gets people off facebook messenger is a good thing yeah i agree

Start time: 2719.64
End time: 2782.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah i'm with you on that i love messenger but yes i mean sorry greg i was going to say i mean  the point of it this is to give you a rich text messaging service that's independent of the vendor  that's providing it so in theory rcs should provide us with an iMessage, Apple's iMessage,  Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Snapchat type experience but using the telco network and  that means that any phone could talk to any phone regardless of operating system regardless of app  it becomes ineffectively what TCPIP is to the internet this messaging rcs messaging service  however there's the challenge that and i love Mike's inspiration and his belief that if we  talk about it enough i don't can't see where the money is where's the money for the telcos to spend  to deploy this technology to upgrade their infrastructure to support this messaging across  their backbones which is you know not an insignificant cost you're talking hundreds of  millions for those sorts of organizations to do where's the motivation for them to do this

Start time: 2782.76

Start time: 2792.42
End time: 2815.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  no it needs to be in the network so where your 3G, 4G comes in yeah they've got to put appliances  in there that receive the rcs and then forward in the same way that there are SMS messaging  platforms inside the telcos network handling the SMS it's not IP uh today in 3G, 4G it comes in as  3G ppp format of packets and then gets translated through a bunch of appliances etc etc etc so is

Transcript:  when SMS was invented it was actually meant to be inside the network it was meant to be an  administrative back channel and the idea was that the SMS was you know send a query to the phone are  you out there yes no uh you could do some diagnostics on the handset and that's what the  original idea for us before it was very loosely based on the ISDN was always two two b channels  and a d so when they built the SMS standard they decided to build a d signaling channel but just  left it open and then they realized they could use it for messaging so back in you know the late  1990s there was no encryption a because we couldn't the cpu why is it this encrypted why isn't this

Start time: 2863.28
End time: 2872.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  what governments don't want to see encrypted messaging they want to be able to intercept  and unencrypted messaging running across private networks is perfect for telcos because they can  then exploit your messages get in there and sell that data off to other people verizon is already  making a 50 billion dollar industry out of selling data about you to ad brokers today so if they can  get their hands on your messaging data and start selling that off to the ad brokers or you know and  you can patch it up in say call it you know law enforcement we give you what you know legal intercept  and all that sort of stuff but i think the real underlying healing here behind rcs is that verizon  and at&t want to see your sms messages so they can sell that data just like facebook does i think the

Transcript:  best model for how it should work is is apple's model which is basically yes one thing that is  end-to-end encrypting very secure for people who are also using the app on the other end  and then you have the other thing which is not secure it's not encrypted but it's very universal  and so we're talking about replacing the second one without getting rid of the first one i think  that you know all of us should be using encrypted apps or signals a whole bunch of them that are  very good and we should be using those when we have sensitive communication and so on if we're  sending stickers around with our friends and stuff like that doesn't have to be that secure  theoretically and so we're talking about whether sms continues another decade of life or gets  replaced by something a little better like like greg said it's nowhere near as good as the the  better messaging apps that that exist today but we but it has the potential quality of being the  universal also ran that you use instead of the very proprietary specific encrypted messaging

Start time: 3002.72

Start time: 3008.08
End time: 3034.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  was thinking about that because otherwise you've got to have a root certificate authority and you've  got to cross sign it and every telco would actually be answerable to a root and getting all those telcos  to agree to trust a given certificate authority i mean imagine getting the chinese carriers  to agree to a us-based certificate authority that's encrypting all the rcs messages i don't  think yes so unencrypted so it'll be up to the apps the rcs apps on the end to then encrypt and

Transcript:  he's been calling for them to break up face all of big tech actually and he's making a fairly  compelling case now he's got a great uh youtube channel where he explains it he's published a  book recently um he's a professor at nyu stone and what he's saying is that you're going to have to  break them up somehow so facebook could be forced to take instagram and whatsapp and float them all  for separate companies and they need to start breaking up apple and google and his point would  be is that these companies are so large that there's no longer any way for a capitalist market to  function and we've seen this before and he lays out the entire case in his book and in his youtube  videos um that you know uh we saw amazon recently announced that it was going to go into uh  pharmaceuticals was going to distribute pharmaceuticals and that caused a 30 billion  dollar drop in pharmaceuticals market that's not a capital market working that because amazon's  actually got a product and coming to market and therefore you should be shifting your money to  amazon because it's going to use that capital more efficiently than the old people than the  previous companies that's a as soon as amazon does anything they're going to squash the competition  that's monopolist power there and so i do think we're going to have to start seeing more moves  against the companies to break them up into pieces so that they don't dominate the market

Transcript:  said that they're not going to do that yeah yeah and but you know they're still thinking about it  and working on it and stuff like that the problem with um with with uh regulatory breakups um as  opposed to just uh i mean the ideal thing would be for people to wander away voluntarily from  facebook and have them become the new myspace uh and there's i think there's a real chance i think  there's a chance that that could happen i mean right now the the public esteem that the the  percentage of the public that says in in in polls that they don't trust facebook after the these  hearings jumped from 20 something or 30 something to 70 something or 80 something i mean it really  there's really been a turning point in the lack of trust of facebook and that's really the way to do  it um and and you see in a lot of the antitrust action in the u.s it's so delayed that it's you  know you look at the classic example of uh you know the big threat of internet explorer dominating  the world um i cover that heavily like like uh and like microsoft got away with it in the u.s in in

Transcript:  they knew what was going on yeah and and they threw a lot of uh effort and resources their  fundamental argument was the reason internet explorer is dominant is not because it's bundled  with windows it's because it's the best browser if another company came along with a better browser  then then we would become the minority market share and that's exactly what happened yeah but

Transcript:  seen the the story today in the wall street journal online christopher mims i can't read it  because it's behind the paywall since the guy who works for a newspaper that's also behind the paywall  but it's essentially he looks at the data that google collects and talks about if you think  facebook is bad look at what google collects and what it does with it you know i when when this  broke and i did a story about how to download your data from all these different services and when i  downloaded google's data it came in at like three and a half gig of data i've been using google a  lot longer than i have facebook so that's not too much of a surprise but it's just a huge amount of  data and um and i think people underestimate when they look when they point the finger at facebook  i think a lot of them underestimate just how much information and data that google gets and monetizes

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  in the same way that facebook does yeah and there's a couple of reasons for that  um there are three things that people should be or might be freaked out about uh one of them is  the fact that google knows is very likely to know your exact location at every moment of your life  for the last 10 years or whatever if you go to if you go into their uh what do they call it the  google dashboard and you go in there it's actually quite fascinating like oh yeah i remember when we  went to that little town even if you have location turned off it's still triangulating they have lots  of ways to you know because you're using google maps you're using this you're using that and they  basically uh collect all that in a single place the second uh thing that kind of freaks people  out if they didn't know this was happening is that google records and retains every time you  talk to google home uh they were so you can go in and listen to your own voice talking to google  home and you're like wow everything i've ever said to google home is right there or or the or

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  discard that data quickly the biggest egregious thing that google does that uh that people don't  care that much about is that in google photos um anyone can identify you personally with the  face recognition of your face so facebook does this as well except facebook is actually more  transparent than google in this regard so in facebook there's a place where you can go in  facebook if you care about it and you can you can see that it's happening you can turn it off you  can do this that and the other thing whereas in google photos i uh that may be the case i'm not  i'm not certain but in fact so many people use google photos and i go and i actually use this  i'm guilty myself i i use this feature i go into google photos i see that the people who have been  identified all rise to the top and and in my case i probably have 40 people that that are identified  by name and i go in and like oh look there's leo um there leo is identified up here but down here  is a picture of leo that it didn't correctly i'm gonna tell them that's leo so you're always  refining their ability to do face recognition on the plus side google is very secure they don't  make that available information available to other people but they have it they they and again just  to be clear about what the transgression is they are getting other people to perfect the connection  between your specific identity and your face without your knowledge or permission that's the

Start time: 4159.50
End time: 4181.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  problem but you see now facebook is i mean i i and i agree facebook is massively losing on the pr  stakes even though google as you say doesn't sell their stuff they just collect and use it for their  own purposes but they also came out with a bunch of private and new privacy standards i mean the  reg we did a deep dive through these and found them to be pretty much useless i mean the rest of  the panel what do you think have you actually tried this out and checked out your own status

Transcript:  i've dug around in there and you know it depends on what you're looking for i found things that i  wanted you know that i did want to know um and the same thing is true with with the capabilities  for facebook but i always got the impression there was something else there that i was missing

Transcript:  hmm so i'm deleting my facebook account i'm just waiting for may the first when the gpdr comes in  because i don't believe that if i deleted it now that facebook would actually delete my data i don't  believe they're trustworthy enough to be relied upon unless there's a force of a law behind them  i don't use facebook for anything so i'm not going to miss it i don't understand why people  would want to use it so to some extent the whole kerfuffle about facebook kind of baffles me i've  never used facebook for anything meaningful but hey there you go i think the the point here is  that exploitation of data is happening in multiple points you're talking about facebook and google  i'm thinking about verizon at and tbt telstra those types of organizations are capturing the  same data and actually have just as much personally identifiable information there was an article in  the guardian for today for sunday sorry it's monday here now and it was talking about how  the company that owns an insurance company you know the ones and you have to submit all  your personal details to get a quote they're now giving the data to a cambridge analytica  and cambridge analytica is then using that data to then do political profiling  that is the concern to some extent i'm less concerned about facebook and google although  they're evil to some extent in terms of it's facebook's exploitation of the data it's not  actually that facebook i think the problem with facebook is that they let someone else take the  data and now we don't know who's got it well and cambridge analytica has gone from saying it was  22 million to 57 million and today it's now 87 million and they gave us data on the pinky swear

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  they have changed that policy and stuff like that but i don't personally don't believe in this  this is based on the the information that we have there's probably a lot behind the scenes we don't  know but my current belief is that facebook and google don't belong in the same category in terms  of trustworthiness i think google is far more trustworthy i think google actually tries pretty  hard to be honest and upfront about what's happening with your data whereas facebook seems  like a weasel behind that you know dirty tricks and all the rest to get your data and do things

Start time: 4330.00
End time: 4464.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that you don't want them to do. So the flip side of that debate is there's no way for somebody to  come up and compete with google because they can't get the data that's google's got so the  reason that google doesn't share the data that it has or your search history with other people  is because that it locks in their dominant position whereas facebook has made a serious boo-boo here  it's made two boo-boos a it's got children in charge i mean mark zuckerberg is clearly not an  adult who should have the responsibility of having children much less having control of it i mean  like silicon valley is a is a factory of failure does it actually produce anything except accidentally  like you know the one in one thousand there's a defect and goodness me that's a successful  defect but anyway that i digress so i think the point here is that first of all we're seeing  how incompetent people like zuckerberg and the people who are in charge of these companies like  we saw google go out and get grown-ups who are now in charge of the company and they were you know  this dopey evil thing sort of came around when you know what's his name the weirdy guy that  used to be the ceo of google came in and sort of put good procedures and stuff like that around  eric schmidt yeah that's right and so you know we put an adult in charge somebody who's got a  grown-up and normal person actually has a you know some sort of an emotional attachment to the world  instead of living in some ivory bubble and the second thing about facebook is that they actually  don't know what they're doing they gave away their data to their competitors they aren't secure  when you're inside facebook you've got access to anything so the employees inside of facebook  actually have access to the entire system so if i'm the chinese government and i want to get access  to all the detail i'd just go and put an operative inside of facebook and start nicking all the data  i don't think all that data is gone and we're starting to see that people are realizing this  that it's not safe to be associated with facebook and i think facebook is going to lose its friends  if it had any fairly quickly as people realize just how much of the impact is that facebook's  been leaking all of this capability and just how little control it's got over its own business it  just doesn't know what it wants to do and that i think is the message that keeps coming out is  clearly facebook doesn't know what it's doing it doesn't know why it's doing it and it doesn't know  how it's doing it and that's why we keep stumbling from disaster to disaster to disaster i don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  necessarily disagree with you greg but i i would i would think of it i think of all of what you  said in a different way so first of all i think um i think silicon valley uh there is something  there there's a lot of blundering there's a lot of failure but there is a lot of success you can't  argue with the fact that you know silicon valley invented the semiconductor for example or the most  valuable company in history or the the search engine that dominates the globe in terms of search  engines or the social network that dominates the globe and so on and it's problematic that they  dominate the globe but they certainly you certainly can't say that facebook and google and apple and  so on aren't successful you can't say twitter is not successful maybe but well twitter has yet to  make a profit we should rip into twitter at some point yeah we should but but but back to the point  about facebook i think the thing about facebook is not that they're a bunch of frat boys uh who  don't know what they're doing i think that their culture is based on uh sort of mark zuckerberg's  personal mindset which is a mindset of amorality i i i my my working theory is that mark zuckerberg  personally doesn't understand ethics uh i don't know why i don't i don't know what it is about  it but basically they see all ethical issues as sort of an engineering problem so they try everything  uh and when there's pushback they're like wow that's surprising i guess we shouldn't do that  there's there's sort of a complete absence of an ethical compass zuckerberg is is as

Transcript:  they're just basically going through the motions i agree with the whole concept that zuckerberg kind  of charges in set something up says oh there's a problem and then backs away from it i think  when you saw him testifying before the house and the senate committees you know he had a fairly  good handle on what he knew about but when you went into issues of business and you went into  other areas that he basically wasn't versed in it really showed and there were comments from  afterwards saying from people who had talked to employees inside facebook saying that zuckerberg  doesn't care about the business end of it that he's more interested in this connection and in  this community and that i think is what keeps people in facebook you know i did a story when  a lot of this first broke about why people weren't leaving facebook or or wanted to and if you talk  to like everyday users they are angry about this but you know they still want to see the photos of  their grandchildren and they still want to make sure that they're included in the event invites  for their high school reunion and the thing is is that facebook has 2.2 billion users it is used  extensively in everybody's everyday life and if you're not on facebook you are left out of a lot  of things and the penetration for the usage of it is such that people look at it and go yeah but i  really i have to stay here because all my friends are here and i don't think anything well that's

Transcript:  shown some elements of brain cells to rub together no no there's no signs of having brain cells to  rub together but there's no signs of um voting machines being adopted here nor in australia  which is the other place that i watch the politics for and i think voting is compulsory in australia  right voting is compulsory in australia yep it's 96 97 participation rate in the voting in australia  nobody gets to say i didn't vote for that president or that person in charge because  everybody did um i i think the interesting thing is that most countries have not implemented voting  machines for the simple reason that you couldn't audit the results so that part of the uh  constitution of countries like in uk and australia was that you must have an audit  trail there must be able to be a counted vote and there has never been a push into voting  machines because it was always felt that the audit trails or the integrity of those was not  actually up to snuff and we've seen these voting machines it turns out they're using like microsoft  access databases from uh like in the 2000 era and you can actually see for goodness sake and that's  cool wins for a good reason and you can use well-known vulnerabilities to compromise them  on the land port which is exposed on the back and you can just hook your computer up and you can  crack it in less than three minutes using any sort of off-the-shelf tool that you need on the other

Transcript:  but in texas i just feel that that the paper trails is still the way to go for the for the  time being and that i i understand that cost is a big issue voting machines are substantially  cheaper than paper and you know having to move the paper around and organizing everything i  understand that and american government is very big on not spending money because people in america  don't like to spend to pay taxes so there's not a lot of money to spend on like building up  infrastructure and doing things in ways that other people might choose to be but it probably is time  for them to just roll it back and start using paper i would think yeah i mean how do they do

Start time: 5599.84

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  in texas dwight so there are different counties handle the elections in texas that's true in a  lot of the states around the country and so the counties actually buy the voting machines  one of the problems is is that a couple of decades ago there was a or maybe about 10 years ago there  was congress approved a bunch of money that to help counties modernize their election systems  and they bought voting machines all over the country including here in texas and in harris county  where houston is and what has happened is those machines have aged but it's very expensive to  replace them it costs tens of millions of dollars in a county the size of harris where you have  about eight million people living and so if you try to do that it's you know we're essentially  they're stuck with these older voting machines there's a company based in austin called heart  inter civic that is one of the biggest suppliers of voting machines in the country they also make  the paper stuff as well and they have been going county to county and trying to sell their wares  with their newest version which is an electronic voting machine that also has a paper ballot  attached to it and that is seen as kind of the the compromise that a lot of people want to see  where you have some way to back up what the voter actually intended to do yeah you know it's a

Transcript:  question of everyone keeping their pieces of paper at the end of the vote but while we're on the  topic of data security we also had the uh the supreme's super u.s supreme court actually chuck  out a case which has been a bubbling under for about the last four years just in terms of  background this was the microsoft dublin case uh what microsoft was doing was fighting a subpoena  from u.s law enforcement who wanted this data that was stored on their dublin servers they said under  irish protection law we can't give this to you and also you're going to need something more than  a subpoena something a judge might actually have to lay into um this had been bubbling under for  four years microsoft has been saying you know we will fight for the rights of our cloud customers  and also make sure our cloud business doesn't disappear entirely if we actually fall over fall  over on this then in the omnibus spending bill earlier in the month then the cloud act got  shoved in at uh page 2000 i think was 2023 out of a 2200 page act which basically negated this whole  thing and now the supreme courts have turned it down and microsoft can cheerfully with its hand on  its heart say yep have all the data was this a win for us or a loss uh who knows but i think

Start time: 5754.06
End time: 5820.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it's definitely a win for whoever came up with the clarifying lawful overseas use of data or cloud  i hate that i hate those it just yeah i don't i mean on the one hand you know we all want better  security we all want data to be out of the hands of governments and others and just get you know  we need privacy and if that means the criminals get privacy too that that's just going to something  that's going to have to happen uh that's that's my own view um on the other hand you don't want  these shell games where you can just move data around theoretically in other countries it's like  it's a ridiculous concept that data exists in a specific country just on a server somewhere um  uh all this all this gymnastics about data and where it resides is just uh is just a ridiculous  idea and you see company you see countries like russia and china demanding that data on their own  and there's only one reason for that is so that they themselves can get access to that data so that  they can uh repress human rights and democracy and things like that yeah i mean greg gdpr coming in

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  philosophies going to interact it's going to be interesting i think i don't think gpdr is the  right regulation to consider here gpdr is saying if you're a company and you're holding data on  users you must only hold the minimum amount of data that's related to what you need to run the  business and you must throw it away when you have finished needing it so you can't just gather up  all the you can't do a cambridge analytica suck up all this data and keep it forever you must delete  it and if you're found to be otherwise the punishment is quite broad so that's got nothing  to do with this case as such i think in what's we're going to see a really interesting thing here  us sort of extending an imperial arm to say we can use any us company as an extension of our law  enforcement operation what happens when the uk government legislates to say we're going to use  that to take stuff out of the us or if we start saying they reach into ireland and demanding data  that they want and or what happens if the irish government creates a law which says it's illegal  for the us government to have that data yeah i mean these are these are these are issues that  are currently underway the european government has shown its willingness to confront those types of  issues head-on and to have those and to go against what it is that america wants in this situation  and they if they just made it outright illegal to take data out of europe then where does that leave

Start time: 5911.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  us who's in charge well clearly the answer is for for for the us to drag european leaders into a  sort of a coliseum type of situation and feed them to the lions two men answer one man leaves  it's an old-fashioned solution but still yeah the traditionalist i mean whose jurisdiction applies so

Start time: 5931.96
End time: 5961.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the the us government has decided that you know they can reach into that a us company operating  in ireland is actually part of the us legal jurisdiction and therefore they can demand that  that company cough up the data but technically it's actually in on irish soil and that data  belongs to ireland there's a there's a definite clash of intention here that i don't that's going  to be played out over time isn't that going to lead to countries siloing off information within

Start time: 5973.98
End time: 6025.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well you can store data in one specific location and i think that when you start when you do that  you must be bound by the laws of that country and i i think that that's it has to be sovereign in  that way but the thing is is that you don't have to store data in any one country i mean google's  data for its search engine is stored all over the place when you when you end up with  making a call to a website you know the data that it uses may not even come from your own country  and so i think that you need to keep that in mind as well and the laws need to be written to  take that into account the problem is we don't have lawmakers in any country who understand that  or who can write laws that are technologically savvy i don't think it doesn't seem to be much

Start time: 6025.58
End time: 6050.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  evidence certainly in europe well europe's i always tell me there are some tech savvy  legislatures in europe in the u.s there are a few but the bulk of them seem to be lawyers and  operating on about 50 years out of date do you have any hope that politicians can actually get  this right or is this going to be something that's just going to be worked out by hack and slash and  a lot of people are getting caught in the crossfire no no hope at all okay well with that note

End time: 6135.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  next 20 years and this stuff won't be determined by technical merit it'll be determined by the  flaws in human nature and also politics so you in all of these scenarios uh the problem is that  the case being made is well we can have law and order but we can let the bad guys get away with  hiding their their their dirty deeds on foreign servers that when it's framed like that you're  not going to get enough uh high-minded people enough fair-minded people to say you know what  that's not really what's happening here we have to balance multiple no no that doesn't happen  everybody wants to pander to law and order everybody wants to you know human nature is such  that we tend to focus on uh the the problem of bad people getting away with stuff rather than  the threats to good people uh when data is generally abused in that in that fashion so i  i really don't think that that uh the politics of our era will allow the kind of solution that  will make everybody happy at least everybody on this show right now happy we're not going to be

Transcript:  interesting that this whole show has been a discussion around politics business um privacy  and we haven't really privacy we uh and we really haven't talked about a technology at all  and this seems like a major transition in technology that we're no longer talking about  the technology itself we're really talking about how uh we as a fit into society how do we fit into  the political system um how do we make it so that technology can go beyond that first step that we've  sort of been through over the last 20 years and now it's seriously so in a sense i think what  we're seeing is this emergence of tech as becoming mainstream and this is the convulsions of a of  teenage years in tech turning into an adult and now we have to become part of society and part of  politics politics and part of the business process that we never used to have in 10 years gone by  because you know five years ago on this show the only thing that we would have talked about is  apple ios and the latest memory and the cpus and that's it that's all we ever discussed

Transcript:  well yeah but i mean that's in evident in part an evidence that the technology has matured to such  an estate that we don't need to be constantly you know i mean you remember what it was like in a  we'll all remember what it was like in sort of the early 90s where you know you bought the new  processor because you had to buy the new processor to make the latest software run now i mean this  computer is what five six years old okay you're ahead of the game but a lot of us are using you  know computer hardware which is in terms of the 1990s obsolescent or completely obsolete  and i think greg you're right in that we're becoming because technology is becoming that much  more mainstream that much more accepted you know our grandmother well our parents are using laptops  which we would have been you know gold mines back in the day but you think i mean mike you  think it's gonna be 20 years before we get this sorted out uh well i think i think that technology

Transcript:  they sell ads according to zuckerberg uh but uh but actually that that was actually to me the single  most disturbing point of all that where they were talking about fake news and they were talking  about all this kind of stuff and zuckerberg said they were saying well what are you going to do  about this fake news it's a real problem what are you going to do about it he said well we're  to the point where within 10 years we'll have ai that can catch it and delete it instantly  and they're like okay that sounds great i was like are you kidding that does not sound great  this is all going to happen invisibly behind the scenes we don't know what was deleted or why  they're just going to decide what's deleted and what isn't some some algorithm is going to decide  that like with no record or trace of what's happened i mean that's a that's a disaster

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah i mean yeah i mean coming back to what you were saying but yeah no exactly and but  just to own one final point because we ended up the week on friday with um some quite unusual  news and a bit of you know war of words going across line when twitter out of the blue decided  that they were no longer going to carry ads for kaspersky now we've seen the u.s government has  already put um you know a moratorium on kaspersky software being used in in the government european  governments have said we don't have a problem with it we work with them all the time  what is behind all this was this just twitter in its endless quest to carry on losing money  and not make a profit or is there something you should be seriously concerned about about this

Start time: 6669.06
End time: 6715.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  about kaspersky software and the way it works well a lot of this again is is is politics and there  may be more that we don't know behind the scenes of all this but there's is this association it's  the use by the russian government and and the russian intelligence services of twitter for to  forward the the objectives of the putin administration in russia that is generally disturbing so on the on  the most on one end of the spectrum it could be that twitter wants to look like they're being tough  on the russians and on the other end of the spectrum there could be genuine problems with  kaspersky and what they're doing and they want to bump them off the network either way it's not going  to make much of a dent i mean it's like you know really how much how much does kaspersky need twitter

Start time: 6716.02
End time: 6746.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  yeah i mean it's it just seems slightly hypocritical you know in that you don't see i mean the cia's  investment arm in qtel has funded an awful lot of security companies like you know fire eye and a  bunch of others and you don't see other companies saying well they're funded by the u.s government  we're not going to use them i mean i'm getting a little bit sick of being told kaspersky is a threat  kaspersky is a threat what's your evidence oh you're just going to have to trust us on that one  and we're still looking for chemical weapons in iraq and i'm i'm reaching the point where i'm not

Start time: 6747.04
End time: 6951.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  really leveled ready to take blind trust so the scuttlebutt around kaspersky is there was a person  so here let's sketch out a potential story that may or may not be true there was an fbi  or cia person who was taking data from classified secure data and keeping it at home yeah yeah and  as part of that process that person had the machine at home was running kaspersky and as part of the  process of kaspersky scanning for viruses it found a document in there which had a virus in it or  thought it had a virus and the document was then uploaded to kaspersky servers and they think that  somebody in kaspersky who was probably an operator for the kgb or one of the or the fsp  realized that this person was actually holding on to confidential or tops top secret documents  and then use kaspersky to leak that data either to run a run a full-blooded op to get in there  and steal the computer and thus all the data in it now this person this employee should not have  had the data at home and the fact that it leaked through kaspersky may actually be an accident so  that is kaspersky as a company may not have been acting deliberately or intentionally as an arm of  the russian government but maybe there was an operative just happened to be in the right place  at the right time and saw what was happening the net result is that kaspersky ends up looking like  an instrument of the russian government the russian government has already took steps this  week of course if you want to take the reverse political play to make sure the telegram can  operate so they've made a decision the courts over there have decided the telegram is a danger  to the country and the russian isps are now blocking all the ip addresses the telegram users  which basically took large swathes of aws and the google's clouds offline so that certain services  stop working over there so there's a lot of tit for tat i don't forget that the chinese government  has been blocking out us services from working over their google documents for example apple  rolled over on vpns in china as well exactly so it's it's not fair to say that the u.s  is the one that's taking the hits here i think there's an awful lot of you know geopolitical  maneuverings going on here and today kaspersky is getting it in the neck in the u.s but there's  hundreds of other movements going along we saw the cisco this week there was a joint announcement  from uk's gchq and the nsa in the u.s and the dod in australia highlighting the fact that cisco  routers have known vulnerabilities and that there are actors believed to be state actors russian and  chinese actors who are actually implanting those routers to hold them as potential staging points  for future compromises and sort of pleading with operators to get out there and patch these systems  so that those implants can be removed from in the network so this whole security issue this is why  i'm not at rsa because this sort of stuff doesn't get talked about at rsa and that's the real  security issue is that 300 000 routers out there are now open to a remote code exploit single packet  hammer it you've got yourself you own the router you can then use the router to configure a gre  tunnel and snuff in the traffic off if you know what you're looking for you can send the traffic  off and then capture it and then do what you want with it or you can pop the router and wipe it  take it out like big swathes of the iran isps went down when somebody went in there and popped

Start time: 6952.04
End time: 6974.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  all the routers and wiped them all out and also i mean was we saw with slingshot when you've got  access to the router who's the person that goes in and configures the router that's the it admin  and they are the golden ticket if you're trying to hack a network get full admin access for your  administrator and then job done i mean dwight what's your take on this i mean do you would you  would you trust russian software on your computer or is it do you think it's it's overblown

Transcript:  uh i think i want to see more evidence i'm i'm also just as skeptical of the u.s government's  attempt to um make sure people don't use a zte and hawei and and other chinese uh products  you know you keep hearing from from uh the feds that uh there are issues and you shouldn't trust  it but i have yet to see any technical discussion or any technical proof that there are indeed  backdoors in any of these products there may be and certainly uh you know the the chinese government  has has that history but i have not seen any technical uh uh proof of it unless i've missed

Start time: 7015.72
End time: 7089.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  it mike have you seen anything on this uh no not proof not not uh smoking gun proof um but i i do  think that um that governments and agencies tend to suspect that their rivals do the very things  that they in fact do and you can sometimes tell what spy agencies are doing by what they're  accusing others of doing so i remember a few years ago the nsa was caught intercepting laptops that  had been ordered abroad they were intercepting the package operations yeah installing stuff inside of  the laptops repackaging them shipping them off um with amazon's full support as well but this is the  kind of thing that that the the u.s government is accusing uh zte and huawei of doing um and it may  be because they are doing something like that it may be because they might possibly be doing  something like that or maybe because the u.s has done something like that and figures well they  ought to be doing it if they're not so we can't take any chances and in any event it's good to  sort of swat down they're more concerned about uh zte and huawei's telecommunications equipment  not their not their phones zte's travels are something unrelated to to that whole issue which  is the iran you know violating uh the iran sanctions and so on but um but yeah i i don't

End time: 7114.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  quite quite heavily hammered on that one and we also had the announcement today with this week  with the block on zte which has actually hit some american companies quite hard i mean qualcomm have  got other markets but one of the other companies name they saw the stock price go down by a third

Start time: 7114.02
End time: 7159.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  after it's really bad and a lot of uh i've heard some reports that zte is actually the number three  smartphone vendor in the united states and they they hit the very very low end they're they're  they're an android go a partner within the u.s and so on but it's still not clear a whether they be  able to uh uh continue to you know get around the sanctions somehow get good around android google  and zte are working together to figure that out but even more something that people aren't talking  about enough is that they may not be able to update current phones it's possible that they  will be blocked from actually up giving security updates to the millions of zte phones owned by  americans right now so this is a this is a real question that has to be resolved and i hope that

Start time: 7159.82
End time: 7164.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it's resolved in a way that that's going to leave a swamp of infected phones out there just spreading

Start time: 7164.30
End time: 7247.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that stuff around everyone else now there's also some business issues here if you figure that  by just while we and zte are two of the most aggressive competitors in the technology space  and if they've now been frozen out of the u.s market which is fine the the government can  and the people can make that decision then that leaves what those companies now aggressively  competing in europe so if you're a u.s multinational who's already losing ground in china  now all of a sudden your european market is going to start to wither away because those  because the chinese people are going to go uh sorry the chinese firms are going to  latch on to europe so and the u.s economy will now may suffer as the u.s um companies say well you  know where they only met last people standing there's no competitors here so we'll raise our  prices and not worry about innovation and not worry about advancing the product cycle and then  over in europe we're buying the same technology for half the price and the competing against the  u.s companies and you know we get the best of all the bet all of those worlds there's an argument  to be made here that this actually has long-term impacts on u.s companies where if they uh by  kicking out while we and zte it actually leaves europe uh gaining the benefit of those vendors  and their technology and and leaving the u.s vendors in second place i would say the u.s i

Transcript:  mean certainly comes to mobile phones then you know it's the china just seemed to be you know  really obviously most mobile phones are made in china but the chinese brands how is that t  they seem to be coming on because they aren't going for the same market that apple's going for  coming back to what we were talking about at the start of the show they're going for the low cost

Start time: 7267.54
End time: 7301.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  easy to use you know and now for both of these things i was talking about is um 5g so both  while we and zte are doing 5g networks while he's got routers and switches and wireless solutions  and servers and storage arrays as well as smartphones so while he is a 50 billion dollar  a year 50 billion turnover a year company and it's not just smartphones it's right across the board  of technology zte is one of the biggest telco suppliers um in the world today and that's why  companies like sienna took such a hit when they got penalized by the u.s government it kind of

Transcript:  makes you feel that it wouldn't be nice to go back to the old days when nokia was handling all  this stuff because a nokia and ericsson because everyone trusts you know the skiers the swedes  and the fins but no one trusts the chinese in the u.s that's right so where do we go from here

Start time: 7316.52
End time: 7357.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah that's right it's very complicated in the sense but you know if you say to  if you pull the competition out against the u.s companies do the u.s companies maintain their pace  of innovation maintain their their their push and their momentum can they come to europe and then  all of a sudden when they get to europe they're competing in a completely different market  they've got to compete against the chinese makers and and the chinese vendors and their products  and their aggressive pricing um and then all of a sudden they may start to lose ground in europe and  then the u.s companies start to pull back to just the u.s and then you hope you will go back to where  we were in the 80s and the 90s where u.s telecoms was you know arguably the least best technology in

Transcript:  well there's a lot of profit in that and if they can maintain their lead in the components business  and also keep their foot in the in the in the global smart phone you know if you go around the  world you go to you go to the african continent and it's all samsung well used to be and and now  increasingly that's being taken over by by chinese companies but in terms of the market mind share  in africa uh you know half of the billboards that you see in a lot of african countries are for  smartphones and 95 percent of those are samsung they spend a fortune to to market samsung phones  globally um so i think samsung is is in a info world heard i don't think i think apple would be  okay and and google will probably be okay you know they're not dominant now but i think they'll  they'll slowly rise in their position so i think we're facing a world that yeah will be us and  china and i think the days where it was uh you know the swedes the the fins and the canadians  dominating the world phone market yeah with blackberry uh uh i don't think we're returning

Start time: 7440.22
End time: 7456.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to that no i mean blackberry is essentially a patent monetization company now nokia got killed  by microsoft in the worst possible way and well also because they dropped the ball on the market  alcatel is going nowhere it does seem like it's it's china it's china robust at the moment

Transcript:  well i mean nokia and ericsson are still very strong in the 5g market and still hoping to make  substantial revenues in that market and they remain the strongest players in the 5g market  today although zd is very much the third wheel there and qualcomm also has a lot of patents  and stuff like that around the 5g technology so it's going to be interesting to think about this  in terms of that dynamic as the technology rolls out around the world maybe you end up like back  where we were in the 2000s where you know the u.s all the u.s technology was built by qualcomm and  then outside of it was all done by nokia and ericsson for 5g and uh the question now of course  china's arrived and you've got zd handling the asia pacific in the chinese regions maybe that's the  way it's going to pan out and it's going to go back to a sort of local technology for local solutions
