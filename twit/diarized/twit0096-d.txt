Transcript: amtisated for  this is twit this week in tech episode 96 from May 6 2007 0 9 f9 11 0 2 9 d 7 4 e 3 5 8  8 8 4 1 56 c 5 63 56 88 c 0 welcome to this week in tech I'm Leo Laporte and this is the week the  prime number hit the fan and joining us to talk about it and all the tech news John C.  Hello John. Hey what about them Warriors eh? Go Warriors that's right they won on  Thursday night. That's the biggest upset in the history of the league. Against all odds beating  the dominant Dallas Mavericks and Mark Cuban at the same time. Yeah well you know Mark's a good  guy. It was a grudge match though I think Don Nelson claims that Cuban owes him millions of  dollars from when he worked for the Mavs. Yeah that seems to be the case. Not a lot of love  there so I think Don Nelson the coach of the Warriors is very happy about this win for many  reasons. Somebody who is not celebrating right now because he's in Boston Andy Anotko. Oh it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a lifelong celebration we're in Boston. Seat of freedom and democracy. Home of the Red Sox who

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  won the World Series once long long long. Wasn't that long ago they won recently didn't they win

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  recently? Well we still have your tax dollars so we're happy. That's all thanks for the roads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And brand new joining us for the first actually second no I guess the first time on twit Jackie  she is the editor for and writer for ours Technica which is as we've said several times now become  rapidly becoming my news tech news source of choice. Hey guys. Does the Mac blog there. Hey Jackie  thank you for joining us. Yes thank you. You're not a complete stranger because you were on Mac  break weekly when we. Yes that's right. Live from some crowded bar in San Francisco. Yeah that was  really crowded that time. Hey but Jackie you got through the crowd. That's what counts. Yeah  definitely. I think crowded is probably the word that Kevin Rose is using these days to describe  his experience at DIG. An interesting story there. Why don't you set us up Jackie. How did it begin  what happened. We have an interview I recorded with Kevin yesterday so once you set it up we'll

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  go to Kevin. Well as I understand it one of DIG's users posted made a I guess made a submission  with the ACS key and they removed it because they had received a cease and desist. And I guess I  mean that's when I make a long. That's when the number hit the fan. Yeah I mean to make a long story  short you know DIG users were not happy and they you know they thought it was censorship and this  and that and so they just started submitting stories. Let me. I asked Kevin Rose yesterday we

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tried to get him on the show but he was not available for the show but I did ask him yesterday  and he recorded a little bit with us when he first knew he was in trouble. Yeah I mean I knew the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  second we did the take down I mean it's just a series of you know numbers and letters. Obviously  you could post this anywhere you want to in our comments or anywhere else.  But I think that this really just kind of struck a chord with people in that they  really see DIG as this place where they can come that is this neutral kind of level playing field  and that this is was very much a gray area and that they didn't want to see us you know cow down  to a larger corporation and wanted us to stand up for their freedom of speech. But you've done

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  takedowns before I mean if you don't do the takedown don't you open yourself up to losing  the safe harbor? You know I really don't know. Did you guys just go to lawyers what did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well we anytime we get a notice from anyone we sit down we figure out where it's from then contact  our attorneys and you know sit down and discuss you know what we should do about the notice.  And this case wasn't it wasn't clear right away what we should do. I mean obviously when you get  a takedown notice from someone that is linking directly to you know a zip file of Photoshop  it's pretty it's pretty straightforward you know you remove the link.  But in this case it was you know something that was just a series of numbers and in letters and  and for us we didn't know how to respond and of course you know you talk to your attorneys  you take their advice and their advice was to to remove it to try and avoid a lawsuit.  You banned the poster though? Well what we did is when a user what was happening is that people  were creating accounts and posting it over and over and over again and so yeah what we did is  went in and banned the people that just kept posting it and a lot of the times it was  it was a little bit of of people being upset and so there would be you know profanity in the posts  and just you know really lashing out at dig over the the fact that we started removing this. So of  course we're going to remove that stuff from the site but anyone that contacted us that you know  has said hey I want back in we just unban their accounts right away. At what point did you start  thinking maybe we should change our policy? Well it was it was kind of a weird day for me because I  was I've been been all kind of all over the place. I was I was actually heading to the airport  because I was flying down for a conference in LA why this was going on. So I was I went to the  airport I was talking I hopped on the internet while I was there for you know 20 minutes and  then I was on a plane and then you know LA traffic took me like an hour to get back to my hotel room.  So I got I got back online about 8 30 that night and then it was very clear to me I mean we we just  I pulled up the home page of dig and it was just filled with stories and and I was just reading  through all these comments and it was it was pretty clear that you know they they were disappointed  that we didn't stand up for them and go to bat for the community and you know so I I I was talking  to Jay on the phone and we both said hey let's this is something where we we should have the  back of our community and and and go to bat for them and and stand up for what we believe in. So

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  we decided to make that that call. I had this fantasy this vision of you all in a room shouting  let's do this let's you know there was no there was no dissent everybody agreed this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No you know honestly there was a lot of mixed feelings with internally here at dig.  It's a risky thing to do. Isn't it a risky thing to do? Yeah absolutely you know it's it's it is  one of these things where if we if we do get sued this company has a lot more money than we do  and you know they could damage us and they could put us out of business.  So you know but you have to decide what's what's most important to you and for us I mean as you  know it's not like we're writing the content on the dig front page. I mean we we live and  breathe by our users in our community and you know if no one digs no stories make it to the  front page and we die. So you know we have to take them into consideration on every decision we make

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  on the website. I don't know if you talk this over with your lawyers but once you  make that decision you're you actually are at a greater risk of losing your safe harbor protection.  Is are you I mean that that's another risk which would make you  a publisher in in a different way than than you are right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you talk about that at all? Yeah I mean we've had a bunch of different discussions  with our lawyers about the different risks involved here and you know we we feel fairly confident in  and I mean I'm sure you've read the stuff on the EFF and other websites about you know how this is  it's so out there now that that this is kind of I mean there's nothing you can do.  Yeah there's there's not much you can do to stop it. Corey Doctorow when he got the take

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  down took it down but replaced it with the take down letter which included the number in the letter.  Right. I thought that was which was brilliant. That was a clever response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah absolutely. I mean we're honestly Leo I mean you know it with any of these community sites I  mean you run a very large community site yourself you learn and we're learning about our community  and how how best to to interact with a million users. So it's a it this whole thing for us has

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just been quite the 48 hours. What do you think the upshot of this is? I mean you're still going  to do take respond to take down notices. I'm sure you have to. Well I mean we're going to look at each

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  individual notice you know as they come in but I mean this isn't something that we receive all the  time. There is there is we do get notices from time from time to time and for the most part it's  pretty straightforward. I mean you know there's there's there's certain things that we that we  will remove from the site of pornography and you know a lot of this there was a time here about a  year ago when there was a large group of it was a hate group a racial hate group that came on the  site and decided to do nothing but but racial hate stories and and we weren't going to allow that on  the site either. So that was stuff that we pulled. But I mean the good news is that the dig community  is very good at policing this on their own. I mean we receive between seven to ten thousand new  submitted stories per day and in the community if even when these stories do start to surface  that are against the terms of service you know 99 percent of the time they're buried. I normally  don't like to bother which is nice because that means that we can maintain a small group of  employees here and we don't have to have you know 100 people moderating and watching the site. We  want to continue to provide tools and give the community the power. I'm trying to pull up this

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Michael Malone article on ABC and every time I do some some idiot starts talking here. Did you read  the article? No I didn't. Pretty critical. He said it was digging their own grave. He said I don't  I mean I think he's full of it but he said he's quoting your blog post which you put up on  Tuesday night saying at the end if we lose and what the hell at least we die trying.  Now quoting Michael Malone in other words dig was willing to block porn and hate sites was  perfectly willing to violate trade secrets if its users said so. It was a breathtaking abrogation  of responsibility by a person in a position of authority. You must love being in a position of  authority. Oh boy. If you sign up to be sheriff he says and are rewarded handsomely for doing so  your job when the howling mob shows up outside the jails to defend the prisoner under attack even if  you despise him. Do you think you caved to the howling mob? Well I mean I think what really

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  happened internally is everyone sat down and we realized that this isn't a clear cut and dry case  of someone violating and breaking a law. I mean we've seen this happen Leo before. I remember  the original DVD encryption was broken and we saw it on t-shirts and we saw it all over the place  and the community has a lot of great pushback in that there's a series of numbers and  is it free speech? I mean this is something where we believe in the rights to free speech.  Everything that is submitted to dig automatically falls under the creative commons and his public  domain and we want to keep it that way and that's something that we should have seen earlier.  We didn't and we made a mistake and we corrected it. Iowa Hawk said in response to the it's a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  series of numbers argument well so is Kevin Rose's home address and he posted it. That must have

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  been a nice feeling for you. You didn't see that? I didn't see that but people can come hang out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  at my house if they want to. You don't have to say that. It's got to be difficult for you because on  the one hand I know what your personal opinion is. Everybody does. Oh yeah of course. And I share it

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with you. I'm totally anti-DRM and I'm not a huge fan of the DMCA so it's like and I've been that

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  way and so have you for quite some time. And yet you know and I posted this in our forums. If I'd  got the same takedown notice I would have had to respond. I mean you can't. It's difficult. You risk  your sight if you don't do it. It is the law of the land whether you like it or not. Yeah. So  you made an interesting decision, a risky decision. Are you comfortable with it now still? I am  absolutely. Yeah well thank you for joining us. I appreciate it. Yeah thanks for having me. It's  Kevin Rose. Come back and join us on Twitter when you get a little time. Definitely. Recorded  yesterday Kevin Rose and his reaction to the events of May 1st. I want to correct one thing  before we discuss this. I talked today with Denise Howell who does This Week in Law on the  Twitter network as an actual lawyer and she tells me in fact it's not a takedown notice that they  got. They got a demand letter and there's a significant difference. This has nothing to do  with the Safe Harbor DMCA clause. This has everything to do with what they call copy  circumvent, copy protection circumvention and the demand letter merely says that you have  content on your site that contains information about circumventing copy protection and we ask  you to take it down. It's the first step. It doesn't have the weight of a takedown notice  and you can be ignored easily although of course you risk a lawsuit if you do. So he doesn't  risk their protection under the Safe Harbor clause of the DMCA. So John you've been listening  to all this. You must have some reaction to it. Actually, oh I'm getting. Oh I'm sorry. Let me turn

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  myself off. Go ahead. I do that so it gives you a more, you know, gravitas. Yeah, I sound like  we're gravitas. Anyway, yeah I actually was on CNBC on Thursday. I heard. People thought you did  a really good job actually. Yeah, I could have done a better job if they would give me more than  35 seconds but anyway the point I was, you know, there's a lawyer that was there and I said,  well you know, my question to him was what can you do with his number? What's his number good for?  What's who cares? It's like a useless number and he says, well I don't know. I can't, you know,  I'm not technical enough to, you know, he's bumbling away. So well you know I'm pretty  technical. I don't know what to do with this thing. It's like a useless number. It's like just a number  and I mean you would take somebody to design software. The software's out there.  And they say, well you know, I got just a memo from somebody a few minutes ago in fact that  described the mechanism to actually use this thing and how to do it. It's a horrible system.  I mean you'd be there for, what is your time worth? And you get a 9 gigabyte file that you  can't really do anything with. It's so huge. It's ridiculous. So anyway, so it's a useless situation.  But anyway, so I called him on that and it was like, you know, it was, I think the whole thing  is silly and my comment was that if you had done nothing this number would have just been a  curiosity floating around but now you've alerted every hacker in the world that they have this  code that they can implement and software will appear now. I don't know whether it would have  or not. I think it would have stayed underground. It would have been used by a few people who  don't mind, you know. Generally speaking, if you want to watch a DVD on your laptop you don't,  I don't think you really care if it's HD or not. It's not, your screen's not that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you boing-boing this number, I mean boing-boing, if you google this number, this comes from boing-boing,  it's something like 600,000 places now on the internet. And Cory Doctorow has pointed out on  boing-boing that more people have this number now than have HD DVD players.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well maybe this is how they should sell the players. So but the whole thing is ridiculous.  And my point, and I made this point over and over and over again, is that these lawyers  do not talk to public relations counsel. They do these crazy things. They send these things out to  supposedly protect their client. They get their clients in trouble. They popularize things. MP3,  I think, would still be underground if it wasn't for all these lawsuits. And the next thing you  know, they throw, they put a business out of, or an industry out of business because they make a  big stink in a situation where they can't really do anything except shake, you know, rattle,  use saber rattle. Here's a good example. This is one of our stories, which is, you know,  they made a list of all the top 10 counterfeit or pirate countries in the world and there's a  whole bunch of them listed, you know, including Israel. They don't mention Malaysia, which I think  is the center of a lot of this, because they just assume these guys, these lawyers, these, you know,  hotshots, they just as soon go after some teenager, you know, at a college who's got a big record  collection he really doesn't listen to because he hasn't got that many hours in the day. But will  they go off the coast of Malaysia and bust some of those ships that are run by the triads?  Real pirates.  By the gangsters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Real pirates. The guys who are real, real pirates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They won't touch those guys because they don't want to get hurt.  So this whole thing is just irks me to no end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Patrick Norton is, I think, on the line with us. I haven't heard a peep out of him. Can you  talk to us, Patrick? No, he's just sitting there quietly. As soon as Patrick gets his input device  working, I'd sure like to hear from him because he's always been really kind of strongly against  piracy of any kind. But as you point out, John, it's just a number.  It doesn't have any utility until you go through all these hoops to make it do something. But what  about Dig? I mean, Jackie, there's an article on your website, Ars Technica, in which the AACS,  I don't know if he's a lawyer, but the people who make this, the licensing authority for AACS,  this copy protection, is furious. He says this is an internet revolt and he says the line is  crossed when we start seeing keys being distributed and tools for circumvention.  You step outside the realm of protected fees free speech then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I actually haven't followed quite that closely today, but yeah, I've heard that they're  just... They're raiding, rattling their sabers. Yeah, they're saying, I don't care about any

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  internet revolts, they're still backing it. This is a quote from Michael Ayers, the chairman of the  AACS LA. If the local neighborhood gang is throwing rocks at your house, some people might...  There's an analogy. Some people might tell you, he says, not to call the police because they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just going to throw bigger rocks, but the point... So he's really kind of patriot. I don't know.  God bless him. He's confused. He's protecting you, Leo, and me, and everybody else. Yes,  because they're rock throwing kids. Tax dollars should go towards helping... Oh, wait a minute,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  tax dollars are going out to help. It does raise a point that this dig revolt is clearly a children's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  war, right? I mean, these are adults. Yeah, I mean, it is a children's crusade. When you see people,  I mean, goodness gracious, I saw a guy with a tattoo of the key over his heart, and I'm like,  okay, let's go out for a nice little walk in the park. Let's notice that the sun is still shining.  Let's see that democracy still reigns over the United States of America, and that this really  isn't so bad that you need to have ink subcutaneously applied underneath the surface of your skin.  I imagine this guy 30 years later telling his grandchildren, yeah, this is when grandpa stuck  it to the man. That's why you live in freedom today. I'd like to hear him explain what it means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I do think there's a little bit of civil disobedience here, and I kind of like seeing  that. I think for many of these kids, it might be their first political act ever, and it's a way of  saying, I mean, what are they protesting against? Is it protesting against dig and banning people?  Is it protesting against the AACS encryption? Is it, or is it just protesting against DRM in general?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's plugging into a whole bunch of different things that are just free-floating  in the atmosphere right now. One of them is corporations who want to take away your rights.  And when you talk about refusing to allow people to copy material for your own personal use that  you've actually legally gone out and bought, that is taking away a basic right. You're talking about  the basic stupidity of these organizations who think that slamming the internet with these  cease and desist orders is actually going to work towards their own best interests. I mean, if anything,  every time one of these incidents happens and I see the firestorm that these guys just didn't see  coming, I really do feel a little bit of sympathy for the RIA and the MPAA and all these other  four-letter organizations. Not because I think they're idiots and they're dinosaurs, but because  it's sort of like, you know, if the news came that the planet Earth is dying, we burned out the  atmosphere, we're going to be, you know, this is a dead planet in 500 years, we need to get off,  we have technology that will take us to another planet, and it looks like it'll work, but we don't  know for sure. There are so many billions of people who would say, no, no, no, you must be wrong,  we're going to stick to this dying planet because you must be wrong, you must be wrong. It terrifies  us, this idea of this new world that we're going to have to explore and figure out for ourselves,  and that's exactly the situation that content providers are in when they think about a world  in which there is no DRM. It terrifies them to such an extent that it makes them do things that  are just not in their best interests. Do you think, John DeWarck, we'll look back on May 1st, 2007,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and say that was the beginning of the end for DRM? No. I think there'll be a lot more incidents

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that'll be the beginning of the end. This is just a skirmish. Beginning of the beginning?  You know, the funny thing, this group that's sitting here doing this chatting on our show,  you know, we are actually, all of us combined are serious content creators. We're not like a bunch  of, you know, commenters, even though there's content there too. I mean, I've been a content  creator for a long time, and I have been in total disagreement with most of these boneheads because  they don't, you know, I mean, writers, for example, have been, essentially had their materials stolen  since the invention of the Xerox machine. It just happens all the time, and we've all adjusted to it.  Just live with it. You live with it. I mean, you know, obviously live with, you know, somebody  just taking a whole book that you did and then reprinting it like they used to do in Southeast  Asia, but that's again what I'm saying. These guys are more concerned about what's the equivalent  of the Xerox machine. You know, guys making one or two copies of something than they are with the  Triads, you know, off the coast of Malaysia and a big ship with a stamping machine making millions

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  of dollars worth of disks. To be fair, the people in this country have access to email and fax machines  and legal system. They don't have access to zodiac boats with M50s to go out hunting for Triads.  I really do agree with your sentiment that they're swatting at flies and they should be going at  elephants, but they're doing what they can easily do right here and right now. They're doing, they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  taking the easy way out. They're taking the software to make it look like they're doing something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why they're doing it, because they're working with the United States government that's  willing to help them, because we have laws in this country to defend copyrights. When you're  talking about laws overseas, sometimes the governments, they just don't care. They're  perfectly happy with all those counterfeiters going out there. Well, obviously. I'm not signing  with them and saying that they're doing smart stuff. I'm just saying that, you know, just because  some guys stealing gasoline out of my truck out front, that doesn't mean that I'm not going to  put a lock on the door. That doesn't mean I'm not going to put a camera out there to try to catch them,  even though there are people who might be stealing me blind elsewhere. I did a radio interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I did a radio interview on... Well, wait, wait, wait. Let's go back to this argument. So you're  saying that the people that are stealing you blind are less important than the guy stealing your gasoline?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I'm not. I'm saying that why do I have to pick one target? Why can't I quickly swat at the guy  who's stealing my gasoline and also try to figure out the guy who's operating plants out of my backyard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. All right. Well, you're talking about taking on both. Now, I'm saying that these guys don't care  about those other guys off the coast of Malaysia. I'm very certain that they do. Well, they, well,  I don't even hear lip service about it. What makes you think they do? I mean, what specifically have

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you heard? I have basically heard about them supporting the anti-counterfeiting measures in Taiwan

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  and Korea. They do try to shut these places down. Not very successfully. Right. I did a radio interview  the day it happened, and the reporter kept asking me this question. Well, what do you suggest we  replace this with? What do you suggest we replace this with? Are you saying, John, forget copy  protection entirely? Yeah. It doesn't work. I mean, she didn't get that. I kept saying this.  You can't have it. It doesn't work. This is an example. It doesn't work. Find something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Find it. You know, what are you putting all this content on? It's essentially computer disks,  which are readable by computers. Once you do that, I mean, if you want to do something that works,  find some proprietary media and a proprietary player that you sell that can't be read by a  computer. Well, that's kind of what they're trying to do with Vista. Hey, I think I hear Patrick  Norton in the background. Trying to do with Vista. It's still a computer. What are you supposed to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  do here? Patrick, are you there? Having, for some reason, the line input on my Macbook seems to have  died. Well, I'm hearing you, so that's good. That's because I've just switched to the internal

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  microphone that I'm speaking very carefully. That's right. Everybody's on an internal mic today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's fine, Jack. I mean, I'm using a PC. I don't have these issues. If you look at an IFPA

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  report, the International Phonographique, whatever it is association, the sort of international  version of the IFPA, they do a breakdown of pretty much all of the countries they're concerned about  for piracy. And there's similar things that exist. They're trying to fight it. They are trying to  fight it. Yeah. I mean, but they are trying to fight it, but what they kind of do is they've got  an international organization that kind of looks at everything in the recording industry. And then  the regional organization like the RIAA is responsible for sort of doing its thing in the  United States. AACS is really interesting because AACS's job, who's been issuing a lot of the  ceases or whatever they're calling the official legal term for this. The demand letters, which is  basically, we don't want to get involved in all the heavy legal lifting. We're going to send you  a letter. Do you have a relationship with you? Yeah. Quit it. Right. Hey, stop it. And this way,  we don't have to, you know, we don't have to fire up the attack lawyers and so, you know. So  what's going on here is AACS, they don't care about DVD sales, you know, directly. What they  care about is protecting, you know, the reputation of AACS. Nothing left to protect from a very real  standpoint at this point. You can purchase online software that'll do, you know, what, you know,  people, you know, John's like, it's 32 stages and it's a wicked, ripping pain in the tuchus to  implement this. Keith, I agree, but you can actually already download somebody, people have  already put together applications that allow you to back the information up. Yeah. Slice off,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you know, any DVD. There's a couple others. Let's remember that the DCSS code, when it first came  out, all it could do was give you like a Game Boy resolution, four bit useless file. But now we have  really great tools like Handbrake that just keeps evolving and evolving and evolving. I think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what's happened here is the motion picture industry said, shoot, we blew it with DVD,  but we're going to create a new format, HD DVD and Blu-ray. And by God, we're going to make sure  there's no way it can be cracked. Here it is a month or two in, it's been cracked and it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  must be driving them crazy. But the taller friends, the rabbits will never burrow under this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And thus went Australia. But the, but what's interesting, I mean, John, like I get you,  right? You know, there's huge copyright, you know, there's basically huge piracy operations in Russia.  There's huge popular pirate operations in, you know, in China and a number of other countries  around the world. You know, and I think, you know, mostly what the MPA is worried about is,  is a, you know, this makes it that much easier for those guys to start stealing, right? If these  tools become so commonly available on the web and two, they don't want people, the more people get  used to not paying for things, the harder it is for them to implement a long-term strategy that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  involves making money. Actually, they, people do pay for those discs when you go to China. Only the  thing is it's a dollar or two. So it's not like they're getting these things free. Well, you know,  I've never been convinced of that either. And when Patrick makes the assertion that this just makes  it easier for these guys to copy, that's nonsense because most of these discs that you run into,  if you go to Southeast Asia and wander around, these discs are coming out months before the  movies themselves. Of course, they already have the files from whoever the manufacturers are,  or maybe even from Hollywood itself, that they have the original data files. They don't need to  use any of these kinds of tricks to decode these movies. They've already got the original stuff  right there and it's already being cranked out before these movies even appear. So that's bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Okay. Well, I stand corrected. I sit corrected. In some ways, I felt good about this whole thing.  It felt like to me the internet, yeah, it's just a number and blah, blah, blah. But they kind of  stood up to these guys and said, look, who has more power? We do as consumers, very rarely do  you see consumers en masse stand up and say, we're not, we don't like it. We're not going to take it

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  anymore. And we're, yeah, but Leo, this is, I'm not buying this because this is, you know,  maybe 5,000 core users, registered users out of the million thousand 15,000, whatever, 15,000.  How many digs the first story got? So it's got 15,000, right? But, but the stuff that really  nailed, you know what? That's how there's 1 million registered users on dig Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  15,000. I feel like, I feel like people would not have, have started all of this if dig didn't,  I guess, remove and ban the first article. So I kind of felt like it was a lot more a revolt

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  against what they thought was censorship on, on Kevin did make his reputation as the dark tipper  and the broken. And so for Kevin Rose to say, Oh, we better pull this down. The man says, shut up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think I understand. That's part of the terms of agreement. And it's something they've been  doing for the two years. Dig has been around. I mean, this just went viral. It went viral. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I, to me, that's exciting in some ways. I think just, I feel like it's, but you could, but Leo,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're calling this a consumer revolt. I mean, who's the consumer? This is a, this is a more,  I could, so the number somebody posted, somebody pulled it down and somebody put it back up with

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  consumer. What are we consuming? This is the whole point is this is a symbol. And I do think  there is a consumer revolt building against copy protection. If nothing else, more and more people

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are learning how to crack it. I think it's the same people. I don't think there's that many people  that are interested in copy. I mean, they are interested in cracking. I'll be honest. I,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I, I did DVDs all the time. There's no way I'm going to rip an HD DVD. It's too big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what would you say? But you're a little slower and more clearly for the audience.  I think it's why, what do you rip them for? Are they DVDs you own? Yes. Are you backing them up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I'm putting them on my laptop so I can take them on the road. Or I'm putting them on my

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple TV. That seems like a practical use, but that's not, you know, I don't know. I think a

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  lot of people do that. Yeah, but there's something that I keep saying. I have to be careful when I  say it in print because it's exactly the sort of phrase that can be really wildly misinterpreted.  And that's, it's a great idea, but a lot of people are going to have to die first before  we can make this work. And it's not a case of, you know, having your killer robots come out and  kill everybody who isn't going to be using this technology. It's that there's a whole generation  of people who will never get the idea of buying a DVD and transmogrifying it onto your cell phone,  onto your iPod, onto your laptop, onto your network device, all this sort of stuff. But the generation  that's coming after them, well, they grew up with this idea. Not only that it's okay to rip DVDs  and CDs, but it's okay not to even buy that stuff to begin with. There's a huge, huge fundamental  shift that's going on that people are just going to be very grateful to get to. That is bold too. Andy, do you have any teenagers or any kids?  I have nieces. Here's where you go. I got a video iPod for my godchild.  What are you talking about?  I got, no, no, no, I wish. I got a video iPod for my niece last Christmas. And I thought, well,  Uncle Andy just wrote this whole new book on converting stuff to your iPod. She knew how to  convert movies from DVD. She knew where to find TV shows. She knew all kinds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It doesn't take much to download Handbrake. You put the disc in, you say, Handbrake now says,  well, where do you want to put it? Your PSP, your Apple TV, or your iPod?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How many copies of Handbrake are sold?  Sold, it's free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Zero, because they're free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, okay, how many have been distributed?  We don't know, but I bet it's millions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Every kid knows how to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, like the last version of VLC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because kids know how to do it doesn't mean that they've given up on it or they expect to get  everything free. My son, for example, if anybody knows how to do all this stuff, he does. He's always  buying stuff.  I agree.  I'm not saying that my older son is the same way. He buys stuff constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's to me the brightest point to make to the Motion Picture Association, the recording industry.  We're spending more on content than ever before.  No doubt about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the killer is that we're spending money for content we don't have to buy. Once again,  if I've bought the DVD, I've already bought the right to put it onto my iPod. And yet there's  this artificial barrier standing between me and that other step. I think the young generation  already understands that, well, technological barriers between copy and copy protection are  really pretty much meaningless. The generation that comes after that is going to be even more  detached. And I think that the idea of why buy a DVD or why buy a piece of media explicitly when  you can simply download it illegally for free, that's the incredibly important connection that  might be unraveling because of all these actions that are being taken by the media.  Go ahead, Patrick. You were going to say something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no. I've talked to a fair number of teenagers because the audience of DLTV  has a fair number of teens and college students. And there's a shocking number of people who have,  you know, who won't think twice about dropping 150-month on a cell phone bill with ringtones,  but don't buy CDs. I know a lot of adults, John, that don't buy CDs anymore and don't really think  twice about it. You know, for a lot of people, it's less controversial than speeding. They just do it.  You know, and to be honest with you, I probably know more people out of high school and college  that talk about it. And obviously, okay, my audience is skewed because I know a lot of  their geeks, you know, hardcore techies. But the thing is, is like, I've got cousins that are as  Luddite as you can get and still use a computer and are completely comfortable. They run Bittorrent,  they download stuff, they've been pulling MP3s for years, and people don't think twice about it.  All right. I'm going to know.  I think it's a significant change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to move on, but there's a lot more to say.  Well, wait, wait, wait. Before, let me make one more comment, which is the fact that Leo

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  just mentioned that the content, the amount of money being spent on content is higher than ever  before. And in fact, it is. It doesn't seem to jive with what you're saying, unless what you're  saying is that, I mean, I'm sure that somebody's looking at some bean counters, looking at this,  well, that just proves that we could really be making a lot of money.  We should be making more.  This wasn't going on. But the fact of the matter is, is not these guys aren't starving to death  because everybody's stealing music. It's just not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nobody's saying they're starving. I'm just saying there's a lot of people that are comfortable with  not paying for copyrighted material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Bottom line, copy protection's got to go. There's plenty of money still to be made.  There are a lot of people who still buy content, even though they know how to steal it.  I think that's what we're all saying. And I don't think we're breeding a nation of freeloaders.  I think maybe you're right, Patrick. Maybe we need the word has to go forth that if you want  content, eventually you've got to pay for it because people will stop paying for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I still like the whole flat rate, $50 a year, download anything you want everywhere off of  this sort of universal fit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. You're going to see new models. And that's what has to happen is the Motion Picture  Association has to give up on this whole notion of protecting our stuff and come up with some new  models for crying out loud. There are plenty of new models. That's a great idea. 50 bucks,  all you can eat for anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they got a new model now, which is take Spider-Man and put it on an IMAX theater. Here,  go copy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's true. Although you can get now on Bittorrent already Spider-Man 3. Of course,  does that cut sales? I don't think so. The people who download that are the same enthusiasts are  going to go see the movie five times anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I've heard a lot of bad things about the new Spider-Man movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All bets are off.  Prepare the rat hole button.  Maybe that's to protect really bad movies. You need copy protection so that people can't see it  before they go.  That's why I understand I won't even stick to the video.  Another big story breaking in the Wall Street Journal today that perhaps Microsoft back in  discussions with Yahoo to create an alliance, a single company teamed up against Google.  Do you credit this at all, John? What do your sources say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not buying into this.  This is the second time we've heard this.  Yeah, I know. It keeps cropping up.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Was somebody petting a cat when they made the announcement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A year ago, Microsoft and Yahoo explored the idea of combining to form a greater competitor  to Google. The talks led nowhere. The same situation is playing out again.  Microsoft and Yahoo in recent months discussing a possible merger. This is the Wall Street Journal.  The two companies are some kind of match up that would bear their respective strengths.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just actually, if you go to PCMagazine.com, you'll find from Friday, you'll find the  article that Lance Yulonoff wrote. I wrote the rebuttal saying why this deal would never  happen if the government would even let it happen. Why it's a dumb idea? Because you have two  companies that the corporate cultures don't match at all. You have them both in the same businesses,  so you have mostly redundancy. What email system are you going to go with? Yahoo or MSN or Hotmail?  The whole thing is a five plus five equals six at best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like an HP compact kind of a thing is what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, my real argument though is if there's a, by putting these two companies together,  what do they expect? Some genius to emerge who can beat Google? If that genius is there in either  one of those companies, why hasn't he emerged already? Or she?  Good point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry, I'm just trying to envision the sort of copycat mentality at Microsoft combined with a  billion dollar Microsoft research combined with the let us not make waves but buy everything at  its peak price. Yahoo, maybe that's it. Yahoo can now buy everything they want to buy to compete  with Yahoo or with Google at peak price with Microsoft's cash reserves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's brilliant. You'll make the worst company ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I don't think the government would let it happen. It's just bad, bad every which way.  By the way, what's going to...  It'd be funny though. I mean, I would be highly amused if this kind of a thing ever happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's an interesting story. Good news for internet radio. Jackie, you wrote the story  for ours. Technica, I guess what we were looking at May 15th as the drop dead date,  the copyright board's original ruling internet stations, radio stations that have to pay  retroactive royalties a year's worth on May 15th. We interviewed on that at night. We interviewed Tim  Restegren of Pandora and he was saying, you know, we might be able to survive that. We could  probably pay that big bill, but we wouldn't be able to survive much longer than that.  Now they've got to July 15th. What happened? How did that change?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I'm not... I actually am not entirely sure what spurred the decision to push the  deadline back, but obviously it's, you know, it's to the advantage of all the internet radio stations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jackie, I'm going to give you a tip as a Twitter panel member. Never say you're not sure.  Never admit ignorance. Just assert, you know, here's what I think.  Well, I definitely know that.  What do you know? NPR certainly had something to do with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh yeah, definitely. Well, I mean, NPR originally, they kind of spearheaded the campaign to, you know,  appeal the original ruling. And even though the copyright royalty board kind of rejected the appeal,  they must, I mean, they must have just come to a decision late or something and then extended the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  deadline. Jay Inslee and Don Mazzullo introduced a bill, HR 2060, the internet radio equality act.  That would have reversed the CRB's decision. What's the status of that bill now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't think the bill has actually really moved forward since its introduction. I mean, not in  any significant way anyway, but I think the current thought is that this pushback deadline will now,  you know, allow lobbying groups and, you know, everybody to, yeah, to push, you know,  push Congress and push, you know, representatives to take the bill seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't want it to pass. I don't want it to pass because it's good for podcasts that don't play  music. It's good for us. Talk radio. We don't have to worry about music radio. We'll be the  only choice in town. Go ahead. Put those guys out of business. Right. But otherwise, I mean,  everyone's- Public domain. Public domain. Yeah. No, I mean, it is an opportunity actually for  independent artists. Yeah. It's hard to imagine how, what the RIA is thinking here. Why would they  want basically to put out completely out of business all music, internet, music radio?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think the thought is that the intention with the royalty hike is actually to do exactly  that. I mean, they're not making any money off of songs being played online. So, you know,  it's just like with DRM, you know, they'd rather people just not listen to it at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Tim Lestergren told me an interesting thing. He said that the, you know, there's two royalties.  Internet radio, of course, all radio, music radio, broadcast and internet pays a publishing royalty.  But internet radio has paid all along a secondary royalty, a performance royalty,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  which regular radio- Satellite radio that pays a similar performance. And one of the things Tim  said is he suspected that, you know, the folks from the organization that went up to the Copyright  Royalty Board, they do what you always do when you go into a negotiation, right? You ask for  everything we want. And I think they didn't intend, they didn't expect to get like the Copyright  Royalty Board rolled over and said, great, you can have everything. No, we don't really want to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was great. They thought they were going to make more money on these royalties, but they didn't,  but I don't think they do want to put internet radio out of business. Is that way you're getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  too better? Yeah. I mean, they're not saying, oh, you know what, just pay us half. So apparently  they're not that worried about internet radio. They've always said, we don't believe in internet

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  radio is of any value to the artist. There's no promotional value. You know, well, I think that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  bull, but you know, I think that's a very interesting theory. What you're asserting,  or whoever it was- Tim Westergren of Pandora. Yeah. Yeah. Is that the internet radio people  were so naive and I guess dopey that they just, they signed what you would call the dummy contract,  which is the contract is anyone who has done books or anything knows is this  dummies contract that they give you. If you're stupid enough to sign it, you know, you're just

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a dumb copyright board said, uh, okay, if you want that, that's kind of funny that they be careful  what you wish for. You might get it. Yeah. I mean, the thing about the dummy contract, John,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is if it's the only way you're going to get what you want, you know, sometimes you have to sign the  dummy contract. Now, in this case, the dummy contract, you know, I mean, they paid, you know,  on one hand, yeah, it's wrong, but on the other hand, you know, post, you know, uh, you know,  if somebody is looking to get the rights to the, to the music they want to pay, uh, it's, it's  become, you know, if, if the satellite radio stations got hammered, I don't see why the,  you know, internet radio stations, yeah, they've gone from paying a percentage of their revenues,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  which, you know, they can afford obviously to paying a flat fee, which many, many, many,  many internet radio stations can't pay. I just want to go on record saying I do want internet  radio to survive. I do want music radio to survive. And if you feel the same way save,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  well, you finally realized you'd be getting a lot of letters. Yeah. Somebody might actually believe

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that. So go to save net radio.org. We now have 71 days, 70 days left. Curiously. I believed it.  No, you didn't. You did. You knew I was joking. That's, I said a rab on the Mac break weekly.  I'm starting to get hate mail now from a rabs. And now who you are saying it again. I mean,  I love a, just repeat that a few more times all the way. I was joking, joking. Catch it.  Senator Obama wants his MySpace page back and he was pretty mad about this. Who wants a MySpace

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  page for God's sakes. I'm starting to question this guy's ability to believe he wants a MySpace

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  page. There is a MySpace page. Is he mad about it? Obama's MySpace page is currently this,  according to Slashdot, is currently the subject of an underground battle for control by the  campaign itself and the volunteer who created it back in 2004. It apparently Joseph Anthony,  who worked with the campaign initially, has grown the site. He's got 160,000 friends  and it's probably bigger than the main Obama page. And so Obama's campaign is saying, hmm,  maybe we should, they actually, they asked, actually offered to pay him for it. He asked  for $49,000 plus $10,000 a refund of some of the $10,000 fee he paid to get become an impact  channel. Obama's campaign said, ah, I'm not paying that. So they started a new MySpace page. Then  Anthony posted a response on his blog. It's gotten ugly. You're right. You kind of wonder

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  about the leadership here. Maybe they're going after that really valuable Obama.tv domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I have the fake Obama as like one of my friends on MySpace actually. Well, it's not fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly. The volunteer. Right, right. That looked great on a buffer sticker. Vote for the fake

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Obama in 2000. Now I do have to appraise him for, or his campaign, whoever it was, for  insisting or requesting that future debates be Creative Commons licensed. Remember that MSNBC  asserted a copyright and said, you can't post any clips from the Democratic debate on YouTube or  anywhere else because we own it. It's ours. Dang it. So now not only at Obama, but many of the other  candidates are saying, yes, let's license under Creative Commons. Obama says, I am a strong  believer in the importance of copyright, especially in a digital age, but there's no reason that this  particular class of content needs the protection. We have incentive enough to debate. The networks  have incentive enough to broadcast these debates. Rather than restricting the product of these  debates, we should instead make sure our democracy and citizens have the chance to benefit from them  in all the ways that technology makes possible. Now that's, I think, exactly right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, that guy sounds like a politician.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, I agree, but he's definitely saying it for, you know,  It's balanced.  Impact.  It's a good press.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see what Sony did in Greece?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we blogged that on dvorakic.org.  Somehow I thought you would.  Yo, it's got our blog all over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Perhaps you saw the picture in the Daily Mail of a slaughtered goat.  Deheaded.  Decapitated goat. So this is a promo party to celebrate the launch of God of War 2 for  PlayStation 2. Guests at the event were even invited to reach inside the goat's still warm  carcass to eat from its stomach.  Yeah, but there wasn't anything in there but gummy worms.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, this is a, somebody pointed out that this is a common party kind of a trick  that's done. This was done in Greece, where this is a very common practice.  It's okay in Greece.  Yeah, it's Greece.  They didn't kill the goat just for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Greeks, they used these things.  The goat was already dead. They got it at the butcher shop.  But it's still funny.  And by the way, they also had bare-breasted maidens.  So, yeah, it's a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So yeah, that was interesting. You could see that if you looked on the Daily Mail's website,  they had a picture of the goat with a girl standing or walking by and they painted her  top on. But with some sort of paint that you could see through.  Yeah.  So it's just, you know, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what you're saying, it was a really good party.  Sounds like for a bunch of gamers.  Yeah, literally.  It was the ultimate.  It was like a 1997 launch party.  Yeah.  All they would have needed is Elvis Costello or maybe Alice Cooper playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  From the country that gave you Bacchus.  The ultimate bacchanalia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So anyway.  It's still worth it.  Sony is just there losing it, it seems to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sony's UK office had been shocked, shocked to see the report in the official PlayStation  magazine. That's what's really funny.  They put it in the PlayStation magazine.  Sony is recalling the entire 80,000 copy run of the magazine.  Collector's item.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh no.  You've got a copy.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because of poisonous glue, no doubt.  They're looking out for the needs of the consumers.  God bless them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The firm refuses to say how the goat died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He has no head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a, is that for a reason?  It's probably, you know, it could have been a possible cause.  The head is now in stable condition.  The animal was not slaughtered for the event.  Reported delicious.  But bought for, but a local butcher store.  We are conducting an internal inquiry into aspects of the event in order to learn from  the occurrence and put the place into place measures to ensure this does not happen again.  I like that.  Well, if it does happen again, we should be invited.  I want to know what the goat being killed or the story getting out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, really.  Yeah, it's almost like they just didn't consider that, you know, the internet exists and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was worse than that.  They put it in their magazine.  That's the funny thing.  I don't know what they were thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This sounds a lot like the dig story to me or that a small vocal, very savvy group of people are  trying to make everybody, you know, I mean, one thing, yeah, it's, it's, it's a despicable  treatment of a goat carcass and it's wrong.  And certainly if I was slaughtered, I would not like to find myself on a table.  Gummy worms.  You've been with people eating gummy worms out of my, don't get me wrong, right?  But on the flip side, it's a goat.  They eat goats.  It's part of the culture.  You know what I mean?  It's like, it's like I've, I've, I actually saw somebody in New York once throwing paint on people  coming out of a first store while wearing a black leather jacket.  I don't get it, right?  But, you know, maybe the people are more consistent.  I mean, who cares?  You know, it is a PR event.  There was a dead goat.  It's, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not politics, though.  Come on.  That's a dumb thing.  You're a go Sony.  It's not.  What if it was your go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What do you mean?  It's not.  What?  Politics.  What?  But it's not like it.  Look, if it was a six year old was like a PR person stole my goat and slaughtered it.  Sony game station event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Then I was like, what if the goat were named Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, you know what?  You know, I can't, I can't.  I eat burgers.  I like meat.  You know what I mean?  I'm not going to, I'm not going to be like, you know, you're right.  You're wearing leather shoes.  Where's the rest of the cow?  It's not like, you know, it did a little donation.  Sony party.  The cow 20 bucks.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not offended by the killing of the goat.  I'm just offended by the just abject stupidity of PR people who can't think two steps ahead.  I mean, this is almost like Tom Cruise's last PR person would have set up for.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And then we'll get Oprah to come over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although that was pretty cool.  It does tie in with the whole God award thing.  It's not like you're going to be having a nice fluffy Hello Kitty layer cake.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So I want to hear from you journalists because you're all journalists.  Harry McCracken.  Yeah, that's a good one.  Editor in chief of PC World resigned Tuesday in a huff in a huff in a minute and a half  over disagreements with the magazine's publisher regarding stories critical of advertisers.  McCracken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was more to it than that.  This guy comes over from Mac world, which is an obvious pandering magazine,  and he decides that we should run our, you know, the PC magazine or PC world  magazine the same way, which is essentially kiss Apple's butt.  I think it all stemmed from that story, that lame story they did about 10 reasons I hate  Apple, which is based on, you know, that was the precipitating incident.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The guy wanted it pulled.  He didn't understand it.  He didn't want it in the magazine.  It was on dig.  It was everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That story got everywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was good for people that have talked to Harry and Harry said the whole story hasn't  gotten out yet.  The publisher who was the guy that Harry got into it with has posted on his own blog that,  we hold the relationship with the consumer to be above all others inside of this editorial  integrity.  Yeah.  I mean, based on who he's supposed to be.  But well, let's get him to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's he's he's available.  What's he going to do?  12 years at PC world.  That's a big deal.  16 plus 16.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's probably online now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Harry, you got him.  You got his Skype.  Let's call him.  I just like the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I mean, I'm proud of him.  If the editor said be, you know, pandered a pandered advertiser, pandered a vendors.  Yeah, that's worth quitting.  I love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According to the PC World Source Wired magazine, quoting the PC World Source,  when Crawford was working, this is the guy they brought over from Macworld.  When Crawford was working for the Mac magazine, Steve Jobs would call him up any time he had  a problem with a story the magazine was running about Apple.  I you know, I understand if that's the case, McCracken, right on, dude, right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I just I just wish that they'd finished that sentence.  Steve Jobs would call him about a story he had a problem with and then what happened, right?  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That doesn't there's nothing wrong with.  I've I've heard from some folks that that worked for a couple of those magazines back in the day,  MacWeek particularly, who said that that that they were pressures.  It was suggested to them that that they take it easy on Apple.  Well, that's too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's one of the problems, though, when you're in a house organ like that.  If you cover one company, the whole magazine, it's kind of I mean, that's tough.  Most of your advertising dollar comes from that company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do kind of feel bad in some sort of way that the story came out, because I mean,  you know, the magazines are likely to suffer at least a little bit.  You know, now that the whole world has come to this horrible realization that,  you know, there's some possibility that the magazines might be,  you know, chilling for whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not convinced of that.  And I'll tell you why.  The audience generally feels that that's going on anyway.  Oh, they assume it.  Of course they do.  And I think I mean, you have to constantly always hear this as a writer for one of these  magazines.  They always say, well, the only reason that you're not writing about that is because  Microsoft is, you know, which I've always especially with PC magazine,  I always try to point out to people that Microsoft doesn't even advertise in PC magazine,  except maybe once or twice a year.  They're like a lousy advertiser.  Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think there are certain types of people who think all writers are being paid off.  But I think, I mean, I don't think this particular story would have spread so much if,  if, you know, some people, you know, I guess didn't realize it before.  And now suddenly their whole world has been shattered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  I think it's an I told you so spread viral, you know, it's like, ah, see, see, see.  Maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Also, also realize that we're just getting one side of the story.  I can't, I don't, I don't have much experience with PC world.  I have lots and lots of friends inside Macworld magazine.  And all I can say is that they don't seem to me like the sort of person who would just spike  stories that are in the public interest because a higher up said so.  There is a firewall, supposedly, between the business side and the editorial side of  every magazine.  Now, sometimes there are chinks in that wall, but I really want to see the other sides of  these stories before I go choosing sides.  Although again, I really don't imagine that an editor would have left a job after 16 years  unless he either a was planning to do it anyway, or B really, really got horked off by, by,  by bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's not much of this is not the time to be planning to jump out of a job like that.  I don't know.  You're right.  We should try to check out the other side.  It'll boil.  It will keep following it.  I'll bet you would get to the bottom of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could just come stand away.  He said, she said situation.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But don't you think it'd be cool to hear the both?  Yeah.  We're going to both on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We got Crawford and McCracken on.  They could battle it out.  At the same time.  Team.  We'll put them in a cage match.  I just want you to know that the firewall between advertising and editorial at  Twit is intact.  We don't have any.  Yes.  No one wants to come near us.  Hey, there's no advertising.  I finally realized we're never going to get any advertising, but they're all, it's all  going to go to CNET, ZDNet.  It's going to go to you, Patrick.  It's going to go to John's show, Cranky Geeks, because they know those guys.  They don't they think they don't know what I might say.  I might say something bad about them.  So they just.  Oh, you are so full of it.  I'm never getting any money.  Broadcasting still hasn't paid us here.  We are.  What is it?  Eight months later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, is that his pod track submitted to bill?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sure they will.  This is standard practice in the advertising industry.  You hold on to that money as long as you can.  I think it's standard practice in every industry these days.  It's fine.  I don't who needs money.  Yahoo apparently.  Yahoo shut down Yahoo Photos in favor of Flickr.  We have a winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think do we really?  Well, what do we really have a winner?  I can't even use my own Flickr account.  Zoomer.  I can't.  I had to change my name.  I had to go.  You have to start using your account.  And then I couldn't access this.  I got a bunch of tech TV pictures up there.  I can't do anything with it.  I can't even load them anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's terrible.  I didn't have to.  I didn't have to change squad.  All I had to do was I have.  I just signed up for Yahoo email address.  Plugged in that as my sign in.  And I'm still using the same ID.  You have to do a magic merge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had the magic merge.  See, I didn't sign up because I already had an account.  And then you do this magic merge and it gets all fouled up.  You got some bad luck here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does anybody at Yahoo listen to this podcast?  Help John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They don't listen to us.  And Google never invites us to anything.  These guys all hate us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually.  Speakers.  They don't all hate us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They all hate us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They all hate us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got invited to Google a couple of weeks ago.  I've been invited to speak at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got one of them flashing badges too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, isn't that interesting?  I don't want to speak at Google.  I'm embarrassed to speak at Google.  They got to speak at Google.  I'll go speak at Google.  I'll have college degrees.  It's like when you and I went to talk to the Secret Service, Patrick.  That was embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, no, it wasn't embarrassing because we learned a bunch of them.  And there was actually a bunch of subjects they learned a bunch from us.  I know, but it was kind of scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's tell the public here that's listening in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What did we learn?  What did you learn?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's three years.  Actually, what we learned is Nigerian 419 scams take up an embarrassing percentage of the Secret  Service's time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They said, please tell your listeners and viewers, don't answer these 419 schemes.  There is no one going to give you money in Nigeria.  So unbelievable that people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, by the way, if you ever go to dvorak.org, cage match across the logo, the guy, there's a little  Nigerian on the logo who is literally a genuine 419 scammer that somebody talked him into holding  up a sign.  Oh, that's neat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's really a 419 scammer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he is the real deal.  Is he really little?  He's not that small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I might have to edit that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Guys, I was saying, let's take a step back from this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just wanted to identify my own scams.  Is he an A-Rab?  So you can differentiate them from the rest of the boys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Somebody brought it up, the 419, I'm just telling you we have a Nigerian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On the cage match forums.  Oh, there he is.  He's naked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently, yeah.  It was... there's a bunch of clubs out there that people can join, which are called scam...  that, you know, they generally scam the scammers and they're all 419 clubs.  And they go out of their way.  They don't do that.  And one of them is the one who got me this picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's another thing that the Secret Service said not to do.  Don't go to Nigeria and try to get your money back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they don't do that.  What they do is try to scam the scammers by just wasting their time and making them take pictures of themselves.  Oh, that's a good idea.  Like this little sign.  That's one of the examples.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of sad.  I mean, these guys probably are dirt poor and they're just trying to make a living.  No, no, a lot of them are multimillionaires.  That's true.  He's a good looking fella.  All right.  I don't know how I'm going to save that segment.  There's no razor blade sharp enough to fix that segment.  One last story.  You brought it up.  I was trying to save you.  I was trying to save you, John, by deflecting all the rancor on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you put a teaspoonful of vanilla in a saucepan and let it simmer for a while, it makes your entire house smell like cookies, everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's my tip for the day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Andianacos, calmness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Perfect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One last story.  The Iranian government noticed that the US military has created that great army game.  And the Iranian military now has a video game recruiting tool called Saving the Port, released today by Tebian, the official information dissemination institute of Iran.  It's an attempt to replace the, quote, excessive amount of aggression seen in strategic Western games with rational thinking.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I want to download it.  Why don't these guys just write patches?  Yeah, your mods.  Or scripts or something like that.  Yeah, mods.  That's the word I'm looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, make a mod.  Apparently the story comes from Iranmania.com.  I'll leave it to you as an exercise for the listener to go to that site.  We're all just stunned and amazed into silence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure I want that IP address on my trackpad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you know what?  Let's all download a bunch of software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why don't you go there and describe it to us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Iranmania.  Well, first of all, it's in Arabic.  But if you click the button that says See the Site in English.  Look, they've got an ad for Mother's Day Special.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you hear that humming in the background as Leo installs this on his hard drive?  That's actually his entire hard drive being skimmed and a summary being sent to someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's a directory of Tehran movies and events.  Business rates in Riyals.  That's the, of course, currency of Iran.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Leo, tomorrow a man in a plumber's overall is going to knock on your door  and ask to see your pipes.  He's not a plumber.  And we're never going to hear from you again.  We need to write the new pipe through your phone closet.  We'll just be four or five hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No problem.  I'll just be doing a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just don't flush your toilet before I'm done.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Folks.  So besides the last story, what is the story about Commodore that is on our list?  Commodore?  Yeah, it says Commodore is back in the game.  That's a really, really old story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it is?  Well, I'm looking at an old...  They're making, I don't know why, they're making,  Commodore is making game machines.  It's really not Commodore.  It's the same thing as those Packard Bells.  Somebody's licensed the Commodore name.  And I probably just mistagged it or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Whatever.  But anyway, it's like Westinghouse.  Yeah, exactly.  Although, you know, Westinghouse apparently makes a pretty good monitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that funny?  I see those in the price clubs and so forth.  Yeah, they're dirt cheap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They get great, they've got good reviews.  But is it the same Westinghouse or is it somebody licensed the name?  No, no, they licensed the name.  They're actually another one of those Asian companies.  But it's a bunch of like ex-Samsung marketing guys and a bunch of...  Princeton Graphics for one of the...  Yeah, exactly.  Princeton Graphics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those used to be great monitors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yep.  Yep.  So anyway, the Westinghouse monitors may be worth looking into.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, gang, this has been a very fine and enjoyable podcast.  And I thank you all for being here.  I'm going to sharpen my razor blade now and cut out all the offensive material,  which should leave us with a good 10 minutes.  Jackie, I want to thank you so much for being with us and putting up with us.  Jackie Chang is a Mac blogger for Ars Technica,  also writes for the news at ArsTechnica.com.  A great site.  Thank you for having me.  Great having you.  Thank you for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We'll come back anytime you want us.  Good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll see you later.  Thank you, Jackie.  All right.  Patrick Norton, of course, is the host of DL.TV with Robert Heron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we've got a good segment for everybody.  Everybody who saw the ruined rear projection HDTV,  because the guy used too much windex to clean it.  We've got the after pictures from after the windex dried out.  And Heron and Robert X have put together a guide on how not to ruin your HDTV while cleaning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So after all, but you know, can we talk about that just for one sec?  That is one of the most important things I think anyone's ever discussed.  You know, because I ran into that and I said,  I don't think half the public realizes that this possibility exists.  The fact that you spray windex and would to explain it,  you can explain it, Patrick, if you want to.  But the way I understand it, you spray a bunch of windex on your rear projector,  the windex, you got too much.  It runs down to the bottom where it leeches into the crack.  And then it just gets through capillary action,  gets sucked up into the screen and ruins your set.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, basically, the front of a rear projection TV is,  it's a sandwich, is like sort of a front screen,  then a Fresnel lens and then who knows what's all behind that.  And the Fresnel lens, of course, has thousands of little tiny circles.  Capillary action will pull the liquid up into, you know,  all of the little scribes that make up the lens.  And it's pretty ugly.  I mean, basically, first of all, you got to be really careful  what you use to clean any monitor because a lot of the coating,  a lot of the things you might spray in a window,  not think twice about will damage the coatings on the front of your monitor,  especially notebook flat panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I use spit and elbow grease, is that okay?  Spit works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's very good.  But what was nuts about this, the front of ours just got in this huge 60-inch rear projection  like four or five weeks later.  I mean, the worst thing you can do is spray a whole bunch of Windex  or any other wet cleaner on the lens because it just, you know, spray it on a towel.  If you're going to use a cleaner, spray it on a towel first, you know,  spray it on your soft rag, whatever you're using to clean the front.  But Heron's got some good stuff and it's not expensive stuff either.  It's, you know, microfiber and patience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it brings me back to the point, which is I don't think that these  manufacturers have ever mentioned this problem because I know people must be spraying,  you know, gob as a...  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think most of them are pretty clear about what, you know,  things not to do with your monitor.  I think it's on there.  You know what, it'd be interesting to check.  I'll go home and check the manual for my little LCD flat panel tonight too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Natural thing to want to do.  I mean, Windex, good for cleaning windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I haven't used any sort of a wet product on any of my monitors in years.  Ever since I bought like a really good $12 paint brush, like a four inch wide paint brush.  Now I just simply go...  You just paint it.  You find latex or is better latex paint or...  Well, it's all one of three.  It's going to be three coats of gray anyway.  Oh, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You use a primer then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anything to keep Lifetime channel off of my screen.  That's funny.  I'm sick and tired of Marquee Post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Enough Marquee Post!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the thing to be concerned about is, you know, it's hard if somebody sneezes on  your monitor, then the paintbrush isn't going to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this big expose will be on dl.tv.  It's up there now.  It's right on the homepage.  Go there now.  Look at the pictures.  That's dl.tv and pull my Dvorak now.  Please.  That's all the pay you're getting until Dell sends us a check.  So make sure you make those plugs.
