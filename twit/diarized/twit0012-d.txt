Transcript:  This is Twit, This Week in Tech, episode 12 for Sunday, July 3rd, 2005.  Welcome to This Week in Tech, we're back again for another fine blended recording.  So, the report is off in Europe on a cruise with Mac Afexionados and digital photography enthusiasts.  I'm Patrick Norton, joining me here in the interweb land of voice conferencing, voice over IP, whatever you want to call it.  Kevin Rose and Robert Heron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey. Hey, Leos need even Trekkies too right now, let's not forget.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what I heard, like the, so he's on, yeah, he's basically trapped on a cruise ship with a bunch of...  Trapped.  Well, have you ever been on a cruise ship?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I have, I actually enjoy them, I love cruises.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been on one and it was me and a bunch of people who were just really way too happy to be locked into a boat.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Obviously I was on the wrong boat.  Is that during your drinking days or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no, I think I probably would have enjoyed it much, much more if I had been drinking.  I was going to say, that's part of the fun.  Yeah, see the problem is, I think sober it's a bit much to take wandering around a boat from one end to the other going,  hmm, there's the other end of the boat.  Buffet style dining.  No, we didn't have buffet, we had the fully seated dining.  The food was pretty good, but it definitely had that like, you know, chicken for 800 kind of feel to it.  A lot of bouncy stuff.  Yeah.  But yeah, so Leo's in Europe, big announcement we've been talking about, which we can finally talk about,  AOL is going to be carrying our feed and AOL has, quote,  more bandwidth than most countries available for its podcast downloads.  So the podcast should get a lot easier to download this week.  So if it was much faster, you now know why.  The other thing that happened this week is iTunes started its podcast coverage, or as you say,  Apple finally integrated iTunes 4.9 with podcasting.  What was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dude, I'm sorry, that's my neighborhood right now.  It is the 4th of July weekend and every 15 seconds somebody has a brick of firecrackers going off.  Oh man.  It's pretty impressive right now in my neighborhood.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh man.  So yeah, iTunes is now supporting podcasts.  We've been floating around number seven last I checked, which is pretty exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I've had some problems though.  I've been messing around with some of the RSS that they've put into the,  they actually introduced some new tags for RSS to kind of define your description,  the author, all the relevant information so that you can be listed correctly within the iTunes directory.  Have you messed around with that at all, Pat?  Have you seen how we don't have our own little, we don't have an official logo or anything?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, because I thought we had to actually talk to them to change it,  but it looks like we're going to have to actually change the way our RSS feeds are run.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it's kind of a pain because we're going to have to rewrite some custom code or something  to write out those feeds correctly.  Well actually, you know, we go all through FeedBurner though, right?  Yeah.  Yeah, so FeedBurner, I know they're working on it,  so hopefully in the next week or so we should see iTunes compatible feeds coming directly from FeedBurner,  so that'll help out quite a bit.  That'll be cool.  They said a million subscriptions now since they launched the 4.9,  two different various podcasts out there, which is pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they still listed about 3,000 podcasts?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know, I'd have to look again for it.  There's quite a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you used the service yet on iTunes to search for podcasts, and how easy is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just started to play around with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Podcasts, right now, has a little over 4,000 listed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that sounds about right, 4,000 to 5,000.  I'm up at, I should point out, I'm up in Leo's office by myself,  so I've already sorted through all the drawers looking for valuables  and contemplating taking them home with me.  Either that or the Matisse print, it's a tough call.  But yeah, it's very quiet up here in Petaluma right now.  The compound, baby.  We've got like three big stories this week.  We've got AMD suing Intel.  We've got the MGM versus Grokster decision in the Supreme Court,  and the RIAA is suing another 784 swappers.  What do we want to hit first?  Wow, we're all just so tired and sad about it by now.  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm curious what Robert's take is on the AMD versus Intel,  because I read some of the different articles around there,  and I really don't see, I don't know, I've really seen,  AMD has been gaining market share all along,  so what are they really complaining about?  I understand what exactly is happening here.  Darn good question, really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, does anybody even know what this suit is about exactly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There it is, AMD sees upside in court battling Intel.  Mass Micro Devices Incorporated has filed a broad antitrust lawsuit  against Intel Corporation claiming Intel illegally maintains monopoly  in the PC processor market.  AMD, which announced the suit on Tuesday, offered a long list of examples  in which it says Intel has used its position,  including its ability to offer product rebates or dole out funds  to influence PC makers to limit the purchases of AMD chips.  The suit filed Monday afternoon in Delaware claims that Intel  violated the Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Act,  and the California Business Professional Code by influencing  the product plans of computer makers and therefore limiting consumers'  ability to choose between different types of products,  AMD said in the statement.  And I should point out that I just read that from ExtremeTech.com.  It's a pretty e-week story up there,  and I point that out so that they don't sue me  for reading their copy off of their website.  Basically, I mean, it's kind of funny,  some of the pundits have been pretty funny about this,  is pointing out that Microsoft gets slammed all the time  for fairly predatory practices within the marketplace  and talking about how nobody really goes after Intel.  Now AMD actually is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. It's kind of interesting.  It's just, for me, it just seems like, well, it's AMD whining a bit.  And odds are, you know, is it simply, is it Intel's fault  that they can dump chips so cheaply to manufacturers  and create incentives?  And I'd be curious to see what incentives they've teamed up  with Microsoft to co-bundle for these OEMs.  And if anything exists there, if that's the case, you know,  AMD may have a strong suit in the courts,  but otherwise this is probably nothing more than them trying  to raise awareness of the fact that, look,  there are longstanding deals in place,  and with the pricing structure the way it is,  the way that Intel can dump a chip or an AMD  is maybe less able to match that price or take such a cut,  it's really hard to say one way or another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. Well, I don't know.  It's interesting because, like, if you start looking at the Sherman Act,  the basic idea is to prevent supreme concentrations of economic power  so that, like, one corporation, like, Standard Oil  is like the classic case of trust-busting.  The idea that they just had far too much influence  over what was going on.  I don't know.  Kevin's all silent over there in the corner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, I just, I'll need to see what happens when this, you know,  case actually opens up because it is interesting  because I've heard several times that Dell was considering  to actually introduce AMD chips, you know,  in their desktop lines and their server lines,  and as we all know, AMD makes some of the best processors out there,  and the reason why they haven't done that, I don't know.  Maybe there was some, you know, behind the scenes stuff going on  that we don't know about, like, certain price breaks  that they wouldn't get if they introduced, you know,  AMD-class chips into their line of machines.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, that's my gut feeling about the whole situation is that, look,  AMD saw what prices Intel was trying,  was able to provide for some of the top-tier vendors.  They couldn't match it, and they found it cheaper  to simply put this case in the courts, A, to raise awareness,  and B, to, you know, just bring it out into the public eye a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know how much I bought into that.  Who knows? That's my speculation totally.  There's definitely, if you talk to some people, there's always been,  you hear people talking about their relationship with the Intel rep.  Like, I remember talking to Insert Name of Giant PC Manufacturer here  where they talked about introducing AMD chips,  and they got such a sweetheart deal from Intel  that they agreed to withdraw a product  that they literally were like 72 hours from shipping.  And I've seen that happen at one of the three largest U.S.  or at the time it was, I think, the second or third largest U.S. manufacturers of PCs.  Intel certainly wields a lot of power,  and they also, you know, if they decide to not offer you the standard rate  or decide to up the prices they're charging you,  they can pretty much destroy a company's ability to be profitable  or at least harm it quite a bit.  Definitely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Per chip cost too, it has a lot to do.  I mean, a lot of the cheap systems that you'll find out in the marketplace right now  are based on like a Celeron design,  something that's very inexpensive for Intel to punch out.  And for most people, I think a lot of it,  and this whole, you know, Intel versus AMD thing,  for a lot of consumers, they simply don't need the latest and the greatest processor  to do what they do on a daily basis.  And they can get away with an extreme value part in that sector in particular  where you have these cutthroat pricing schemes for just powerful enough CPUs.  I think that maybe that's where AMD is trying to, you know, move into more  and finding it very, very difficult to compete with Intel's just grasp on established vendors.  And it requires vendors to make a switch too.  And, you know, some of your top tier vendors,  I mean, like I'm thinking of PC gaming boxes that you can buy from high-end vendors.  They always give you a choice, you know, which chip do you want.  But when it comes down to those ultra-value machines nowadays,  it's typically an Intel-based system.  Interestingly, when you ask for processors from Intel for evaluation,  it's almost impossible to get their low-end parts.  They only want to send you the very best,  which is something they tend to help.  That's how they kind of focus on the review community a little bit  and try to direct them in a certain way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Man, Supreme Court decisions came out this week.  Grokster or MGM versus Grokster.  Grokster gets smacked down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, didn't that center on the fact that they advertised  that they were going to become like the best pirate program ever?  It specifically had the wording in their advertising.  The court ruled that while they could get anything for free or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, basically the Supreme Court said there are a lot of legal and legit,  basically it's like the Betamax decision,  a lot of legal and legitimate uses for services like Grokster.  But that the companies could be held criminally responsible  if they push the idea that you can snag copyrighted material without paying for it.  So what didn't happen is they didn't define what the,  is Grokster inducing copyright infringement?  The court didn't define or set any kind of legal standard for what inducement is  and sent Grokster back to a lower court  to decide whether or not Grokster was trying to, you know, pushing people to violate copyright law.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's pretty interesting. Did you see how Bram Cohen from BitTorrent came under some fire as well?  Because I guess they just recently, just last week, uncovered an old agenda on his website that said,  and I quote, he creates programs to, well the quote actually starts here,  commit digital piracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well what's interesting is he said about that, he's like, you know,  I was young, I was, you know, it was a joke.  I thought the manifestos people were writing were pretty funny, so he wrote his own.  I don't know, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's got to be scary for him that there might be some legal pressure pushed upon him because of this.  He's been claiming all along that BitTorrent was created for legitimate reasons.  And now to see something like this uncovered, I don't know, it's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting, it's like that's the only place anybody's ever seen anything from him  that makes him sound, I don't know, nefarious.  I mean the RAA and MPA would probably like to see it beaten with a stick, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, but you can go ahead and code away, write these incredible programs to help us share files,  as long as you never, ever utter the words, I'm supporting piracy, or in any way do I condone this activity.  As long as you do that, I don't know, it's such a fine line, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's a thin, but it's an important line.  And the idea of if you're telling people like, hey, sign up for our service, not only will we make money,  you'll be able to get a lot of stuff without spending money.  You know what I mean? That's pretty sleazy.  You look at that, it's like a thin legal line where it's okay to make something,  I mean you can kill somebody with a hammer, right, but we don't make hammers illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I found that the oddest part of this whole thing.  It's like as long as you say the right thing, you can pretty much do the same thing another person can do,  but if you cross the line and say, oh yeah, by the way, this type of technology can be used in pirate movies and whatnot,  we're not encouraging it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it makes him seem less squeaky clean than he was, you know?  Right.  I mean, there's a lot of, people get really upset at the ACLU, you know,  they're defending people who say nasty things, but it's like, hey, you know what, First Amendment rights, you know,  the thing about the First Amendment, freedom of speech, means that people who you don't agree with get to speak  and people who create content that you don't want to watch get to create their content.  You know what I mean? It's tricky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the good thing that's coming out of all of this is that, at least in the last couple of years,  it's very noticeable how all of the content owners are finding alternative ways now of getting us what we want.  And I'm even hearing whispers now, you know, we talk about the granddaddy of video being 1080p,  and I'm actually hearing of content producers thinking of broadcasting that format,  be it over the air or through satellite.  And, you know, hopefully they'll finally get the message.  I mean, we have actual, you can go online and buy music now, you can download it cheaply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the amount of music that's being legally downloaded is growing rather quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And video is going to follow the same path, you know, the more it becomes convenient.  I think everywhere really becomes a convenience thing for us is when we have enough bandwidth  where it isn't such a big deal to move that kind of data from one place to another.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right.  Well, we've heard, you know, talks of people like Netflix offering, you know, compatible devices  where you'll plug in an ethernet cable in the back or wireless and instantly be able to,  rather than rent your movies, just have them downloaded directly to your TV, which would be awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, I mean, Cinema Now's been out for a long time, which allows you to essentially download.  I mean, you know, you look at the front page, they've got The Incredibles, Hotel Ronda, Ocean's 12, Sideways Closer.  I mean, it's a little funky. You start downloading and then you wait while more downloads before you start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, there have been some attempts at that too with a set-top box that uses an over-the-air antenna  that pulls in digital content right into the box itself using, you know, broadcast hours, like you receive HDTV over the air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was that used in the blanking interval for carrying that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what? No, it was just downloading a transport stream.  I mean, it's like up to 20 megabit and it would just simply record that information in your hard drive.  It had their own DRM built in, but that was a very – I mean, it would just constantly fill the thing throughout the day.  And then at the end of the day, you could just go through it and, you know, pick and choose what you wanted to see in here.  And you know what? If they can do that over the air, why can't they give it to us in the best quality possible then?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Good question. They may not want to, you know, they may be afraid of letting it loose on the air.  I mean, it's interesting to look at like cinema now is – unless they've changed it, they're still using Microsoft Video.  Right. Same with Movie Link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But those offer good forms of protection, I believe. I mean, there are plenty of protected Windows media files out there  where you can, you know, only view it on this site or you can view it one time with the proper license.  Like, especially – what is it with the Terminator 2 disc?  When you actually go to watch that, it's awful the way it's hacked in there, but it actually goes online and pulls a one-week license for you.  And then during that week, you don't have to have the computer connected again.  But in that time, you can watch it in the highest quality up to whatever resolution you want, you know, 1080p, I think is the maximum.  So if broadband –  That's an interesting way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I always wondered – I always thought like the part of the reason the studios were behind – were so supportive of Movie Link and cinema now  is because they want to, you know, forget about HD, DVD, forget about Blu-ray.  The idea of having a software codec and an online transport system for movies, it just – they can keep changing the encryption  and constantly just updating that to make it harder and harder to actually crack and liberate the content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it was really just a matter of how you're going to move that information, depending on the quality.  If the quality is low enough and the compression is good enough, you can do it over current broadband that people have right now.  But for really good quality, most of us really need about five times what we currently have in terms of broadband speeds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, we also need servers that can feed content that fast.  True.  In other words, never a big giant pipe and nothing to do with it.  That sounded really rude and I'd like to apologize for everyone with dirty imaginations out there.  Just you, man.  I just feel naughty all of a sudden.  It's the long weekend, I'm telling you.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you guys doing for July 4th?  I'm going to Vegas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Going to Vegas?  Visit your folks.  Visit the family.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Nice.  Yeah, get away.  Probably take off either later tonight or tomorrow morning sometime and just hang out, shoot off some fireworks, you know, have fun.  Nice.  If you leave for Vegas from LA any time between 10 and 6, you're going to be driving for nine hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know, that's the problem.  I'm taking it easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm trying to get back on Battlefield 2 if that's what I want to go play.  Have you stopped playing that at all yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Only when it crashes me to the desktop or I cannot find a server that me and a couple of buddies can't join together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or the crappy in-game browser just locks up or let's see what else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to play Battlefield 2.  I'm going to play Battlefield 3.  I'm going to play Battlefield 4.  I'm going to play Battlefield 5.  I'm going to play Battlefield 6.  The in-game browser just locks up or let's see what else.  There's so much that game is so, it needs a patch so badly it's not even funny at this point.  But I'm still playing it.  It is highly addictive and I think it's one of the, it's a fun team game right now.  Lots of variety, lots of strategy.  Pretty damn cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's funny.  I actually just upgraded my system.  I put a new power supply in it to replace the one that I fried a couple weeks ago.  Right.  And I got the Antec.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dude, I'm all about Antec right now.  I swear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I can't believe it's the TruePower 2.  I can't believe how quiet it is because my old...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have a 550 I picked up.  You bought two of those because I ran into all these problems with that last box I built where I literally replaced every component and finally I got to the power supply.  And these two brand new power supplies were just not doing it.  So I went out and got the TruePower 2.  I think it was a 550 watt.  And the system just fired right up as soon as I plugged that in.  I was just like, thank you.  That's it.  I'm done.  I'm finally buying this brand.  That or PowerPC and Cooling, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I was just going to say I'm a PC Power and Cooling guy.  I love their power supplies.  Yeah.  They're just, but they're so expensive.  They're just so pricey.  I'm serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll never spend less than a hundred bucks on a power supply again.  That's just like a kind of like line in the sand at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, see I got like a 470 watt power supply for 70 bucks.  See, that's okay too.  Well, it's funny.  At that range.  For what I'm running, I mean, I've got one hard drive.  I've got one DVD burner.  Although I did just add a ATN 800 XT, which is so much faster than my long suffering GeForce 5200.  Oh yeah.  Oh yeah.  Although I got to admit, the 5200 was playing Battlefield 2, 800 by 600.  It was a little twitchy at 10 by 7.  But I was kind of happy that it was actually playing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Pat, you gotta let me know, man.  Man, I have better video cards than that just laying around the house, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just like the idea that I got for free what Dan Huard is going to be paying off on his credit card till like the year 2030.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  He's still paying on that one video card.  He still hasn't paid it off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, he hasn't paid it off yet.  Oh my God.  Is he going to buy the 7800, the new Nvidia card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think he's going to hold off for a while.  I think he learned his lesson on that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so harsh.  Yeah, it's been amazing because I just rebuilt somebody else's system and they threw a third hard drive into the system.  Basically, I had a choice between, I looked at them like, okay, you can either not boot your DVD-ROM or not boot your Audigy 2 control panel on the front or one of the hard drives because there just wasn't enough juice in the power supply to keep everything running.  Oh, that's frightening.  That's a bad scene.  It was like a 330 watt power supply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just couldn't believe it.  I couldn't believe I had two bad brand new power supplies in a row.  Or not bad, but they just weren't enough for what I was doing.  It seemed incompatible with the motherboard combination I was using, the CPU combination.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you seen the new ATX connectors, the new big ATX connectors with the extra pins on them?  24 pin.  Yeah, the 24 pin.  I actually had to basically shave off the ATX connector.  The extra four?  No, I didn't have to cut those off.  The IDE ports on my motherboard were so close to the ATX connector, I actually basically shaved off the, cracked off the plastic off the port on the motherboard and shaved the plastic off of the cable.  And that was the only way I could actually get both my hard drive and my new power supply to connect in at the same time.  Oh man.  Oh, that's crazy.  Well, I don't think anybody expected when the board I got, I don't think anybody ever expected the extra pins to show up on the power supply.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But at least on the plug itself, those are removable too, so if you do have the old 20 pin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll go back and take a look at it.  I'm pretty sure they don't detach.  If they detach, I'm going to be really bummed out that I was like...  Because I almost did that.  I couldn't figure out what was going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm like, wait a second.  Then I just like, oh, it unclips.  Cool.  The last, the four new pins.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now with the power supply fan in my system doesn't sound like a jet taking off.  I can now hear the hard drive cycling and I can't believe how loud the fan is on my processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the loudest sound in my current gaming box, which is soon to be my old gaming box, is the Northbridge fan.  It's an Intel board.  It's a tiny little 7000 RPM fan that sounds like a little jet.  And I was just like, what is that sound?  And I'm looking through all my fans are running as slow as they can.  And then I look at a clock speed or a fan's rotation speed of that one little fan and it's turning around at 7K.  I was like, okay, that's got to stop.  So it's got the really high pitch...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, it was crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sounds like the vacuum cleaner from hell.  I mean, I wear headphones for the most part when I'm computing.  So it's not such a big deal.  But still, it's not a system I'd like to just leave running daily.  But yeah, I'm hoping for the Battlefield 2 patch.  That's what I want to get back to this weekend.  I got a couple extra days off.  And I got another bachelor party coming up this Friday.  Got to go back to Vegas, baby.  So I'm preparing my body and mind for that.  Actually, we're going to Lake Mead.  Oh no.  Wait a minute. Let's take a step back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How is playing Battlefield 2 preparing your body and mind for Vegas?  Is it the whole simulated combat environment?  Let's see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Game playing in general comes me down.  I'm relaxed, so...  I'll play one jump in Vegas.  I'll antsy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you're going to be antsy about three seconds after you get into Vegas.  Or do you no longer get excited in Vegas, Robert?  Avoid the gaming floor?  Stay away from the alcohol and other distractions?  I try. I try.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's basically as soon as you land there,  well, you walk out into the terminal where all those slot machines are.  But the last time I was in Vegas, it was really cool.  It was the first time in about five or six years that I was there  where I didn't have to work.  So it was like I was there purely on a pleasure event.  And I had actually a pretty good time.  I did some stuff outside of the strip too, which was nice.  Yeah, that's key.  Last time I was there, we found a one-mile-long kart racing track.  That was just awesome. It was like 15 minutes right outside of Vegas.  And we went and did a couple of four or eight-lap sessions.  That was just exhausting.  I mean, you're just going through these corners at crazy G-forces.  They had three classes of cars all the way up to the full 120-mile-an-hour shifters,  if you're that good.  I didn't want to die that day, so I backed off of that one.  But we had a blast doing that.  And then what was the other thing we did?  It was a country club that was skeet shooting, like a trap shoot place.  Really?  And they had 20 holes, quote, unquote, 20 traps set up.  You drive around on a golf cart for like a mile-long course,  and you stop at each one of the stations,  and it's a custom-done, automated skeet shooting session.  They supply you with the guns and the ear protection and the sh—  And there's a shell manufacturing facility right there,  ammunition manufacturing place, so they just had cases of ammo.  We were out in the middle.  It's on the way to Boulder out in Vegas.  That one was about 25 minutes outside of town, but it was beautiful.  You've got to find your way.  We went up in the hills and shot guns and great courses to go shoot trap in.  We had a blast.  That was just highly recommended.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to have to get the URL and send that out for the go-cart.  Oh, definitely.  And one of the things they always do at DEFCON is the shooting range in Vegas  where you can basically rent a submachine gun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Shooting trap is great.  I mean, it's fun blowing away those clay pigeons.  It's fun.  And plus, you're in a beautiful environment, too.  It's really mellow.  There's stuff like guns and ear protection thing.  I've worked enough in Vegas to where the strip is not like a vacation spot  that first comes to mind when I think of places to go.  That's one thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Head out to Red Rocks.  There's a lot of great climbing out there and some good hiking and stuff.  That's nice.  Hey, guys, I got a tech story.  You guys want to talk about tech?  Sure.  No.  It's the Fourth of July.  Yeah, of course.  And Gadget has some interesting pictures of the next,  or actually the first iTunes phone from Motorola,  which is pretty interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So are they actual pics?  I mean, because people have been floating around with pics on that for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, these are actual pics of it working.  They actually show a screenshot of iTunes 4.9 that supports the phone,  and it shows a little phone icon and that it's actually connected.  But I guess originally when I heard about the phone,  I thought that you'd be able to connect to the iTunes Music Store  and actually download via the phone,  but actually it's only with syncing with iTunes that it supports.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So basically your phone basically is yet another iPod.  Well, that's probably version 2 then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And the phone doesn't have a camera on it.  I don't know.  I'm not sold on this one.  It's just like any other phone that can play MP3.  It's like who cares at that point, right?  But it's got the iTunes mobile software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's a secure USB syncing phone that's compatible with iTunes.  Exactly.  Okay.  So hopefully it'd be nice if you could actually browse the iTunes Store for free  and pull stuff in right onto the phone.  That would be cool.  You know, a 5 gig storage on your phone.  I'm just looking for a way to not have to carry a separate iPod player  and a cell phone and the other basics that I carry around with me daily.  You should talk to Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kevin, oh, buys every new multifunction phone on the market.  I do indeed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I love cool phones.  My phone actually right now, it's a Samsung from Verizon,  and it has a 1.2 megapixel digital camera built into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, you got the 8000?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't even know what model it is.  Man, I switch models so often.  It's the, no, actually it's the SCH-A890.  Hmm.  Yeah, from Samsung.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I like it. It's nice.  Oh, you know what?  I'm thinking of the LG as the next step up for mine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man, I just want a big OLED screen, an MP3 player.  Yeah.  Camera, whatever.  Bluetooth support.  Maybe a VoIP ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if I buy into the whole VoIP ready cell phone thing.  It's an interesting idea, but it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just want one more avenue to hack the damn thing.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's funny you mentioned OLED for the screen.  I've had three people ask me this week,  so when am I going to be able to use my cell phone screen outdoors?  I'm like, when they have OLED screens?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or very, very bright backlights.  The problem is a really bright backlight kills off your battery life.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Those transflective screens, you don't see those much in use anymore.  Or am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not on cell phones, I don't think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  What was it, the Fujitsu Notebook?  They had like a day runner or something like that  where the screen, you could literally use it outdoors in direct sunlight.  Yeah.  They tend to have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Robert, tell me what happened to OLED.  Seriously, we started seeing them appear in digital cameras and whatnot.  Now I don't see them anywhere.  What's the deal?  Why aren't they hitting Best Buy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the initial problem was blue.  That had a very short longevity for the colors.  And that has recently been addressed.  And now it's just simply scaling up to size.  And I think, what was it, Samsung last month showed off that 40-inch OLED,  which was the largest I'm aware of to date.  I've personally seen...  I saw their 20-inch one.  I think it was Sharp, actually, that showed it off a couple years back.  And that was pretty fascinating.  But until they get the manufacturing cheap enough  and they can pump them out in sheets big enough to cut up without having...  Oh, actually, it's a printable picture technology, isn't it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean, part of the reason you saw so many...  You saw OLED for a while because it's basically...  It's the first OLED camera and there's like 42,000 press releases around that.  It gets picked up everywhere for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And those were small displays like in the 2-inch, 2.5-inch category.  They are beautiful, though. They look so nice.  It's an emissive where the light is being generated right on the surface.  And that, yeah.  A, they can be very, very thin.  And B, they're brilliant looking.  But it was also the electronic...  A, creating a design that you could do moving imagery on.  That was convincing.  For cell phones, usually you're not looking at full motion video on your cell phone.  I mean, nowadays that's changing a little bit.  But you could get away with degraded quality with high-speed video on a cell phone  more than you could say on something somebody's going to put in their living room and watch TV on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's an interesting thought.  I mean, the idea is solid. It should be.  I mean, the OLEDs, they should be cheaper to manufacture than LEDs.  They should be able to do flexible.  It's going to be lower power consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For small devices, I think you're going to see that be adopted rather quickly.  Or even the Electroluminescent, the EL technologies.  They're getting full color down now to where that's affordable.  And it's already bright.  And I like displays that are made with that too.  For big displays, it's still too expensive.  Any of those technologies are still too expensive.  And you have other technologies like SEDs or flat tube technologies.  What is it? Surface electron emitter, I think it is.  Basically, you're creating a tiny array of small picture tubes.  Each one driven by its own electron emitter.  Those are both competing for this whole new category of 40-inch TVs, roughly, or larger, that are an inch thick.  And in that category, I think you're going to see that in the next couple of years just explode.  Because everyone's poised to do several things.  I mean, LEDs finally mature to the point where they make good big displays.  But they're still expensive at the high end.  Plasma is great, but they can't do the resolution to match what they're doing with LED right now in the same size.  And it scales larger, sure, but it's prohibitively expensive right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kind of a semi-segue into a viewer question.  Jason wants to know, he's going to buy an LCD TV after the holidays.  I would like to stick around a 25-inch with like recommendations.  I know you'll have Robert Heron help with this question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all good.  The last one I think I saw in that range was from NEC.  And in my opinion, they make some of the best glass out there in terms of displays.  It has all the features you want, like tuners and stuff built in.  It really depends what you are planning to use this for.  If it's going to be a natural TV that you're going to have sitting in your bedroom, make sure it works at low light levels.  Be sure to check it if you can by turning down the brightness and contrast a little bit and see if you still like the picture quality.  That's one of the problems I find with LEDs.  Make sure it at least has a dim viewing mode because they can put off so much light that sometimes at night in your bedroom,  you literally find yourself with the lights turned down squinting at your own TV set.  And that could be a bit annoying.  That's one thing.  The other thing too is that it's not a bad time to be looking in that category because those are,  there are some great values and they're from a variety of companies.  And so you said you like the NEC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What's the typical price for an NEC around 25 inch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to say probably around 1100 bucks.  Probably less than that now.  That was probably the list price I'm thinking of.  So you probably get it for seven, eight hundred bucks.  Probably the price you could find like a 35 inch tube TV or 34 inch tube TV in HD format.  So it's not bad.  Make sure it has all the inputs you need to.  That's the big kicker for me.  Some of these displays only come with like one set of component inputs.  If you want to do like a game console and a DVD player and a satellite box or something that offers HD.  You see at that size though, HD is almost a secondary option.  It probably supports HD resolutions, but you're probably not planning on watching a lot of content in HD on a 25 inch TV anyway.  So you want to make sure your standard F content looks good.  And it has good scaling modes too for standard F.  If you want to stretch it out to fill a 16 by 9 frame, make sure the scaling hardware looks good when it does its thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  NEC, who else would you recommend?  Oh, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There are only five panel manufacturers in the world.  Major ones anyway.  So odds are it's going to be based on somebody's.  Who else?  Samsung's.  I don't know.  What does Samsung have in 25 inch?  Sharp.  If Sharp does something in 25 inch, definitely go with them.  Another one of my favorites.  I'm getting finally getting I had to get a replacement for that 40, 45 inch LCD that they sent me.  But I had a little shipping fiasco with that and needed a new one.  So I have that coming in.  I can't wait to get that done.  But who else?  Like I said, Samsung is probably my favorite LCD manufacturer.  LG.  That makes pretty beautiful displays to NEC.  Like I said, name brand companies.  But if you're in the store and something does get your eye, like I said, run through a few of those basic tests.  Really consider what content you're going to be looking at it on and try to mimic that wire standing there looking and comparing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What if people let you like walk in with a DV player so you can start looking at stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, if you have one of those portable DVD players and a DVD you're familiar with, that's definitely one way to do it.  And it's like, look, realize if you plan on flipping channels nowadays, most of the content still formatted for a four by three display.  So either you're going to have pillar bars on the sides or you're going to scale it out.  And that's where you really want to take a look at the scaling hardware and actually look at it and see if the image is acceptable.  Because that varies significantly among the different manufacturers.  That's really one of the big differences between somebody who has a display custom build or not custom build, but just thrown together.  And it's like, OK, who makes the cheapest scaler out there? Put that in.  That's why this TV is so inexpensive. Or another display where you can look at standard definition and it looks pretty damn sharp when it's stretched out and blown up to a bigger display size.  But at 26 inches, that's like again, that's not such a concern.  Right.  And you could probably get away depending on what your tuner is.  There are a lot of PC displays out there like the Dells are selling 26 inch display reasonably.  You can probably get it refurbished with a warranty and things like that.  You could also look at PC displays too that just simply offer the inputs you need a component input or it probably will have a DVI or VGA input at the very least.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I mean DVDs look pretty good when you scale them up on a PC display.  What about how do you get the best NTSC, regular television content on a PC display?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're depending on the tuner.  And that's really where it varies.  It varies. Be honest with you, for over the air reception, I'm still using a Vune HD box that received the...  I thought you were going to have a business.  It had a built in over the air HD tuner.  And it turns out that tuner that was built into that box, it still works, is one of the best tuners I've ever seen it pulling in very weak signals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really? Is that for regular TV or for HD?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was for over the air broadcast digital TV, which includes HD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You still like that card from ATI, the HD card?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I want to see what else people are doing, other brands, but yeah, that's the one I use the most.  With their latest driver updates, I find it pretty stable and easy to install.  Although they have a four part package right now for installing the thing and it requires the original CD.  That gets under my skin a little bit when I'm hunting for a disc, but otherwise it works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm on eBay right now and they got the Vune receivers, brand new receiver with HD antenna for 40 bucks, closes in 30 minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a sensitive receiver, I'm telling you.  It's not a bad deal.  I use the receiver, the over the air receiver that's built into that to compare it to other TVs that have the tuners built in and it's surprisingly different.  I have a couple of problem channels in San Francisco and one receiver, the Vune seems to pull it in crystal clear.  And I've had a lot of other receivers choke on a particular channel that I was test with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The cheap antennas usually still work the best for getting the HDTV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Whatever you need, yeah.  There's no reason to spend more than you have to, so start with a pair of rabbit ears and then move up from there.  And if you have that old school UHF, VHF antenna from Radio Shack strapped up on the roof still, that's ideal because once you get it pointed in the right direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This would be the rooftop UHF antenna, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, like the Christmas tree looking thing where it lays flat.  Yeah, in my jargon for antenna technology, somebody slapped me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a monocypal metaphoric break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bite the wire with your teeth and put your hands out.  Start there.  I wish, I hope broadcasters really embrace the over the air stuff just because the bandwidth is there.  It's almost unlimited to what you can deal with it and you don't have to worry about compression and things like that.  But it's such a small market relatively speaking and you have to physically put something in every place.  It's not like a satellite that you can beam across to a huge swath of land or cable where it's just our signal through our pipes type of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  I'm still thinking of one of my friends who we went through this kind of like he just moved and we moved his DLP, his rear projector.  And he was terrified to move it.  He was going to hire professional movers just to move the television until he lifted it and realized it wasn't nearly as heavy as he thought it was.  But I was laughing with him.  Like the first week he got it, he goes, I'm watching soccer.  I'm like, uh huh.  It looks amazing.  I'm like, uh huh.  I hate soccer.  So why are you watching it?  Because I can see the blades of grass.  And I was just like, oh no.  It's just, I don't know, the over the air content can get kind of scary.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I find myself paying more attention to camera work with HD.  Yeah.  Which cameramen really can really are good at focusing, maintaining a smooth steady image, things like that, because everything becomes highlighted when you have six times the resolution and you know, shaky cam and things like that really start to make you sick on big, big screens.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If somebody's swinging a camera too hard or jerking it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or you realize the person looking through the viewfinder isn't focused on something right.  And it just, you're like, oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Have you got HD yet, Pat?  Did you get yourself an HDTV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nope.  We're actually, we're just moving to the new house and sometime in the next month I think I'm going to buy an HDTV.  It's kind of, I mean, I'm kind of, I'm kind of wary because, you know, I figure anything I buy now I'm going to have for a few years.  And I'm kind of amazed like craigslist.org, the, you know, the online classifieds in San Francisco, I guess they're all over the country now.  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  It's amazing.  Like you remember that, that I did a search for HDTV on that and it's amazing the number of like last year's HDTVs that people are selling already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was a cool search link you sent me.  That was.  Was that using just craigslist engine?  You were able to send me a list of like HDTVs in certain categories that were available currently on craigslist.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And basically just did, you know, just did a basic search and I was amazed at how many of them were being sold, used already.  Which for me is that's kind of like, you know what I mean, some new gadget comes out, it's like Kevin's cell phone.  It's like I can either wait for Kevin to sell me like the cell phone is good or bad or I can keep an eye on craigslist or eBay and if they start showing up used left and right, you know, they're not, you know, they're not hanging really well.  True.  So, but yeah, I'm actually, I'm kind of torn.  Actually Robert's been convincing me to, to, to get a LCD, like a 30 inch LCD.  I was thinking about getting a 35 inch CRT.  I don't want to do it.  I'm not dealing with that weight anymore.  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have a 30 inch CRT and I just can't take it.  I got to get rid of it.  I just don't think my poor TV can take it.  Moving it one more time.  I'm moving to San Francisco and I don't want to lug that thing around, man.  It's freaking a couple hundred pounds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't carry my television all that often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, I like the nice like thin, you know, but I'm going to hold off for a little while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's just like I look at it.  If there was more content, I mean, you know, okay, if I, if I get a decent DVD player, it upscales well or I do a feed off of a media center box with HTT, you know, HDMI output to the back of the monitor.  I can probably get decent upscaling on DVDs because I watch a lot of DVDs.  It's my number one favorite thing to do.  And, you know, unless everything's I just want, you know, I want the movies to look really good.  And I'll be honest with you, it's you know, I've had a 27 inch television for the last couple of years and, you know, it's it's it's kind of interesting.  I'm kind of looking forward to getting something bigger.  But, you know, I'm still to me, 35 inches sounds like a huge screen.  And, you know, to sit in front of a 50 inch television is just a little bit much for me at this point.  Although it's 16 by 9.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's thinner.  You have to make up for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then there's the KEL factor, right?  The higher the resolution, the closer to the television you want to sit, which is kind of scary.  I don't believe any of that.  You don't believe the KEL factor?  Dude, you could lick your television when you're sitting in front of it.  I've seen you.  I don't want to sit that close.  Sitting back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The sound audio is more important to me.  Audio is as important to me as the video.  That's the best part.  I think honestly, you should spend the same on both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm pretty stoked because the place we're moving into, I've actually got basement access to the living room floor so I can run cables for the satellite speakers on the surround sound without having to like put a carpet over them or, you know, run 42 feet around the outside of the room.  So that I'm looking forward to.  Decent surround sound, new couch.  That's convenient.  I don't know.  I'll keep looking because it's going to be another probably six weeks before I buy a television.  So I'm hoping somebody comes, you know, with the great new product between now and then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, but gee, get your audio squared away.  Make sure you get your 5.1 ready to go.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, right now we're basically, until we buy the TV, we're going to be watching DVDs on a 20 inch monitor and it's just not cutting it.  They're smooth.  It's lovely progressive video, but.  That's where the audio kicks in.  No, I hear you.  I'm not going to buy private Ryan and scare the neighbors again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want a projector.  I'm dying to get a little projector.  You know what?  I have some great walls in my new apartment and I'm just dying to take advantage of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Where are you going to mount the projector?  You're going to mount it up?  Because that's like, I've, with the projectors of, oh man, can you hear me like starting to babble at this point?  The projectors are so cheap and they're getting so good in that $1,500 price range.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'd like to get something kind of portable that I'm not going to worry about too much because I would be moving it around depending on what we're doing in the room that day.  But something very portable like that, that I could hook up.  Those are so much fun for movie nights to do.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Totally.  Get a bunch of friends together.  It's a great time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't know, the only thing is like, if you don't have a fairly permanent place, like a shelf on your back wall to mount it, you spend all that time playing with the key stoning and getting the, you know what I mean?  You can't put it on a coffee table because then every time somebody walks by, they walk in front of it or people move it around and you end up with the big, giant, wrong-shaped parallelogram screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but if it's for once in a while, it's just awful fun to be able to whip that thing out and just set it up.  And the problem again you run into is audio.  And hopefully if you have a home theater set up already going, it's not that hard to run the audio from the video source into that.  But that's the one thing I run into.  Usually I'm stuck looking for projectors that have a little bit of speaker built into them.  Yeah.  So at least I can, especially for console gaming.  That's what I love about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's so many good portable speaker systems.  I mean, just get an Altec Lansing or a Eclipse portable system.  You know what I mean?  Just get a desktop speaker system and just take that with you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, I'm using like an old set of PC speakers for my TV right now just because I like the sound of those better.  Nice.  The speakers that are built into it.  I need a new TV badly.  I am in the HDTV market.  You're even worse than me.  I want a 50 inch plasma, damn it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or an OLED.  It's going to be a few years before the OLED.  I don't know.  So you're going to sell your television, Kevin, or are you going to hold off on your TV?  Yeah, I'm going to get rid of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm going to dump it on Craigslist before I move.  So what are you going to get?  It's really, it's an HDTV, but it's like, it's a Samsung, it's a CRT.  I mean, I bought it for like a grand.  So I'll probably just see if I can get, you know, six, seven hundred bucks for it.  That'd be nice.  I don't know.  I'm going to hold off for now.  I really don't watch that much TV to be honest.  Like I'm mostly DVDs and I don't know, occasionally I just mostly watch stuff on my computer.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  We've been looking at, actually, we're actually going to get, I haven't had a cable connection or even rabbit ears connected to my television in like three years.  So we're actually going to get a direct TV, get satellites.  We want to watch Deadwood as it comes out.  Rejoin the television cultural references thing.  So what else is going on?  When's the next episode of System coming out?  Yeah, it's coming out soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We're busy working on it.  The problem is we're doing these big projects that just take a lot of time to build, you know.  It's like it's cool on one hand because, you know, we put out some pretty unique creations that you don't see anywhere else.  But on the other hand, it just takes a long time to actually create these things and build circuits.  And, you know, it's a little harder than we originally thought.  So we're working on some ways to get out more content.  I just got done shooting another pod slash video cast with Alex Albrecht, the old host with me on the G4 Tech TV version of Screen Savers.  Cool.  Damn, it's that cat.  Yeah, he's a cool guy. I love Alex.  And so we're doing a little weekly thing where we cover kind of like, it's more like geek culture type news stories.  And it's called Dig Nation.  And so you can check that out at diggnation.com.  And it's basically we're taking all of the top dig stores from dig.com and kind of repurposing some of them and just talking about them  and putting out a little video each week of us just kind of kicking it.  And it's a lot of fun. It's cool to get back together with him. He's a lot of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nice. Yay.  You guys have a couple more questions?  Go for it.  Do it.  I'm helping our church get an LCD projector set up.  Speaking of something we all covet, and we're all looking for using balings.  Excuse me, looking into using balings for really long audio, video and VGA signals.  Any thoughts, opinions or feedback on balings?  Balings.  Are they balings or blondes?  That's a really good question.  I think it's blond.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Blondes.  Blonde. Like a blond, but without the D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The capital B, lowercase a, l, u and s.  Blondes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well that's actually what we used to have.  It's like brawn, but blond.  I'm guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We use those at Tech TV a lot.  They had the entire, basically every cubicle at Tech TV was wired up so that they could plug,  and they're wired up with Cat 5, Cat 6, so that you could actually have television,  so you could watch what was being edited or shot over at the studio in any cubicle or office.  They worked amazingly. They worked extremely well.  It's not particularly cheap, but they're pretty good.  Sorry about that.  Who's typing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, that was me. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are you chatting with somebody else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. I just went to Wikipedia real quick.  Yeah, that was actually Troy who sent in that last question.  One more question.  Wow. Here's the classic, the definite classic question.  I have an external hard drive, a Sony Viya PC and an iMac G5.  The external hard drive is USB and FireWire ports.  I want to be able to hook it up to both computers at the same time so each can access the drives.  Everybody wants to do that.  That's from Leann in Ajax, Ontario.  I've heard that question like 40 times in the last three or four years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  The easiest way to do that is to get yourself an external hard drive that you can hook into the network,  plug it in via those networkable drives now, and then just set up shares for both computers and you're good to go.  But you won't have the speed.  I can throw in a gigabit if they support gigabit, but yeah.  I know what you're saying.  There's actually a really good one I just saw that I was thinking about buying because we have a lot of,  obviously we have a lot of video that we want to back up and kind of keep off site.  MacStor's new network drive looks pretty interesting.  Have any of you guys had a chance to play with that one, Ian?  No.  It's like the OneTouch, but it's the network version where you just plug it in via...  You mean the one that's been out for like a year and a half?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that was the one I checked out last because it had Firewire USB built in,  it had some cool lighting system built on it, and some good...  I think it was Retrospect software for doing backups and it makes all this stuff.  Retrospect is awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, that's another question.  Is there any decent free backup software?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's a good question.  I always use Retrospect because it does nice incremental backups.  But that comes bundled with the OneTouch drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For backing up your personal data, I'd say buy Retrospect.  Buy something that works.  Don't screw around.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I feel the same way.  Just be done with it.  When a lot of it, I mean it's not like Retrospect, I mean obviously they have very expensive versions,  but a lot of that stuff just comes bundled with these hard drives when you buy them now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean if you don't want to take the time to burn off a folder full of data to some CDs  and scatter them to the wind in safe places, get some software to automate it for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Here's the drive right here.  It's the MacStore Shared Storage Family.  200 and 300 gigabyte versions.  You know, just RJ45 connector.  Boom, you're done.  They have routers though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's like a little NAS.  USB connections, don't they?  Where you can just plug in any USB mass storage device right into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Boom, it becomes network shared.  They're actually supposed to be, I mean the original ones that came out were really good.  I don't see where the bigger capacity ones wouldn't be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What was that?  Is it Zymeta?  What was that one disk that we reviewed a while back?  It made some, yeah.  That sounds familiar.  The NetDisk from Zymeta.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My question is, does it matter then what file system you use on a shared drive between those operating systems?  Are you stuck with like FAT32 or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, the G5 is going to be able to read the Windows formats.  So either that or you could separate, no, because you couldn't access separate partition.  You know what, Kevin's right.  You're both right.  Create network to attach storage or even like just download NAS Lite or something and create.  Something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, a lot of these boxes just have little internal Linux kernels on them.  They run a little Samba, a little sharing between so you can access any device or any share that you want depending on what platform you're on.  So they're nice in that way.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For me, I run into file size issues where multi-gigabyte files.  And as long as the file system supports that, it's cool.  Otherwise, I take measures to break the files up a little bit.  But I hate having to think about that sometimes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Check out Zymeta, X-I-M-E-T-A.com, their NetDisk.  I know, Pat, you reviewed this one a while ago.  Yeah, the one I reviewed.  They've changed them quite a bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it was a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away.  That bears no resemblance to what I reviewed.  Actually, the thing I've been playing around with at home, basically I'm setting up a smooth wall router and then I'm setting up a NAS Lite box, which is serverelements.com.  And they're doing some pretty cool stuff.  It's basically a customized Linux distro to create a file server, to create a little network.  Yeah, I've seen that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's pretty awesome because you get yourself a nice little cheap box.  It doesn't have to be anything expensive.  And then go out and buy yourself whatever size, capacity, hard drives you want.  You're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the thing I would say to avoid is anything that combines storage and a firewall and a mail server and an internal.  I've seen a couple of those out and it's a cool idea.  It's like run everything for your small system off one box.  I hate that.  And all I can think of is one concentrated point of failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Why do they have to bundle everything, man?  It's driving me nuts.  It's like when you go to install the security suites, when you get them pre-bundled with a new machine.  You have like the McAfee or the Norton security suite and it's like email blocker, pop-up blocker, firewall, like all this crap, man.  I just want like antivirus and that's it.  Like don't give me any of your firewall crap.  I don't want any of that other stuff.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  So true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know what?  I don't miss that from new systems.  I can't do the last system I purchased outright short of a notebook.  Even then, one of the first things I'll do with a notebook is blow it out completely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  I got an IBM ThinkPad and the first thing I did was blow it away and do a fresh clean install.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a shame more people aren't comfortable doing that.  It's not their fault either.  It's just something that shouldn't be that complex.  It should be a lot cleaner than it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think it's like as soon as you do that, a lot of people are afraid.  Like I'm not going to get tech support.  They're not going to talk to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  If it generates a phone call, I guarantee the company that built the machine doesn't want that to happen.  So they do everything they can to prevent it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what sucks is that they don't bundle Windows installation CDs with these new systems anymore.  Or if you want that, it costs you significantly more money.  It's funny because the key, like the Windows XP professional key is like stickered on the bottom of the laptop.  So I have a copy of XP Pro here.  I'm like thinking, oh, okay, I'll just throw it in, use that key and I'll be good to go.  So I put it in and it won't let me install.  And there is no disk.  Obviously, you have to pay extra for that.  So I'm like, screw it.  I just put a pirated version of XP on this laptop and if anything ever happens, I have a freaking key.  You know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Devon, of course, does not promote pirating Microsoft products.  No, I'm just saying, man.  Microsoft certainly would not think the Twitcast was promoting such nefarious things.  I'm not pirating, though.  You just said you had a pirated copy of XP.  No, no, no. I own XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I just couldn't use that particular key.  I have a valid license key.  It just wouldn't take it.  So I had to use one that was done from a nice little generator.  I just wanted to check.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Turn it up.  Turn it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, remember, that's another reason to build your own systems because when you're shopping for parts, you pretty much buy any part that goes into a computer and you're eligible for an OEM version of the operating system.  Right.  It's a substantial discount.  I think in the store the other day, I saw XP Pro, disk in hand with a key, is like $135, $125.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm all about the gray market OEM versions.  Oh, for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You buy a hard drive.  You buy a DVD burner.  You buy memory.  Any of that in Tudbos, you do an OEM version of software, legitimately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  People need to tell people to discover computer fairs, man.  If there's a computer fair local, like Closeby, that's the place to go when you're buying parts because, I don't know, man, if you go to Best Buy, you just get robbed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there was a ton of crap at those shows, too.  I mean, there's people selling garbage, but if you know specifically what you're looking for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's people selling garbage at a premium price at those shows, too.  But I mean, you can find this.  You go to your local big box store and you'll find the same thing where it's like, wow, it's a G5200.  You know what blew me away about the computer fair?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the CRTs they had available.  You can get like a 21-inch CRT that looked pretty darn clean for like $70.  And it was just like, wow.  And it's like, as is, no warranties of any kind.  But hey, it's plugged in and running right in front of you.  And it didn't look damaged.  And that's the important thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's where I got my DVD burner for like $15.  Love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, just make sure it's plugged in and running so you can see it.  You go the first day of the fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's the key.  Because then if anything breaks, you can take it back.  Because otherwise, those guys just disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, some of them are pretty good where they'll actually, you know, if they have like a printed receipts and business cards,  they're either really highly evolved scanners that know about Kinkos, or I should say FedEx Kinkos,  or they're, you know, they're legitimate business people.  Because some of them you can just smell like, that's the funniest looking Microsoft logo I've seen.  It's XP. Is this legitimate?  And it's just like, I'm going to the next booth.  That's right.  So yeah, but yeah.  They have good knives there too.  And the S with the S being a dollar sign.  Knives, camping equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Isn't that crazy?  Like you go to a computer fair and there's like swords and stuff with like snakes on them.  It's awesome.  Well, it's all part of looking at all this stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Actually, you know what I really miss?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The whole sort of survivalist bent around the year 2000, like all the computer,  like anywhere you went, you know, before the year 2000, but it's going to kill us all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was so crazy.  I had so many friends in the IT industry that just were so, they had no fun that night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Up 24, 36, 96 hours waiting for things to go wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I pointed and laughed, but I felt their pain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh man.  Here's a question on our way out as we end this week's Twitchcast.  What's the biggest computer failure you've had recently?  I'll start out.  Mine was shoving a piece of metal to stop the fan and the power supply on my desktop machine  because it was too loud, which is why I have a new Antec power supply that I went out and bought,  which is quiet because I short-circuited mine.  You should see the fuse actually, the actual fuse inside the power supply exploded.  I should take a picture of it and post it online.  I've never, I've never seen it.  I see a fuse melt usually, but not usually like, you don't usually see smoky glass and a big giant piece of it missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You ever hear an LED explode when too much current is thrown through it?  Oh, that's awesome.  That's a snap.  What happens?  It's like a little bomb going off.  What does it look like? Is it like brown and pink?  It goes ka-pow! Oh, it's almost vaporized. At least I've never found the fragments.  I've never tried to catch them either.  But just the noise alone though, it's like the ultimate electronic firecracker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That sounds a little scary.  I mean, do fragments blow out of the thing or does it inflate?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I mean, it's resin. So it's just like a little piece of plastic.  Hopefully it burns. I can't tell if it's burning or it just explodes into lots of little pieces or if a chunk actually ends up somewhere.  I've never found the parts or any remains.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So don't plug the 120 volt LED into the 220 or 440 volt socket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just follow the directions and don't overdrive those poor things too far anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, so you're saying you did this by turning up your graphics card too high or what did you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, no, no. An LED itself, like a light. It was like in a flashlight working on an electronic project where it's like, okay, this thing's rated to one watt and we're trying to put like five, seven, eight watts through it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, I'm with you.  And just, nope.  I was trying to figure out how exactly you managed to pump the voltage through the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I could have totally figured a display or something like that.  LEDs as in the light emitting diode itself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  250,000 twit listeners immediately began running in fear from their beloved LCD panels.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My 17 inch flat panel is going to explode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is how rumors start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My hardware woe is just that power supply weirdness I went through.  That just reminds me to always, you know, wind out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And the Battlefield 2 blue screening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then I also want to thank my buddy Jeff for just taking the time to literally take every component out, strip it down to like the bare essentials and put one thing in at a time until we rolled everything out.  And then we realized, hey, you got two crappy powers of bloods in a row.  Fix that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm going to knock on wood on this one because I haven't had anything for a long time, which is good.  No software crashes?  Oh, I mean, that happens every day, man.  Firefox is crapped on me today. I have no idea why.  It's like the first time it's ever done that to me.  Really? Did you have 47 windows open?  I had very few problems with that browser.  Oh, no, no, I have no problems with it.  But for some reason today, it just freaking died on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a damn Battlefield 2.  That's my big bone to pick.  That, you know what?  Google Earth, when they launched the app, at least on my notebook and a couple other computers, as soon as I closed out of it and I wasn't looking around at satellite imagery anymore, it seemed my whole system was slowed down for browser use.  That's weird.  With Firefox.  And until I rebooted my whole system, the snappiness was gone.  Do you have a plus key for that, by the way?  A what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you get a plus key for that, like the paid version?  Oh, no, I haven't checked it out yet.  But it is back up, the free version.  Oh, it is back up.  Yeah.  Because it was down for a while. Okay, cool. I'm going to go on there and I have the free version.  I was on there today.  But I want to pay for the $20 one just so I can play with the GPS connectivity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Everybody I know who's either home shopping or, you know, any more people.  You can send bookmarks basically for the Google map or the Google Earth location and the satellite image you're looking at.  So I have friends who just like bought a house and they sent the link out so you can see like the satellite image from the roof looking at the new house they just bought.  Or we're all talking about going to Cabo in a couple of weeks.  We're all looking at, you know, the coastline down there.  It's just such an intuitive, fun interface.  And if you have broadband, broadband being in big B capital letter, don't even bother if you have a modem.  But it's really one of the neatest apps out there right now for just visualization and map browsing, I think.  Yeah, it is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google Maps is really good too.  Wow, that was a conversation killer. I'm sorry.  No, I didn't hear you cut out what you were saying.  What was that?  I was like Google Maps is really good too. And then all of a sudden there were some others.  I was like, ugh. I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sorry?  The interface is just great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'll use something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I love what people are doing with the little API too.  They're connecting everything, like weather information, like stockings, like you name it.  Like, have you seen this stuff where you can pull up the maps and like pinpoint every little thing? It's great.  That's awesome.  Is there like a page that links those?  Yeah, actually, Wired just came out with an article showing all the Google Map hacks.  So check that out.  And they have just a bunch of different ones you can click on where they tie all different types of information to the map data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, Google Map this.  Alright, I'll put that in the show notes.  Nice.  Map hacks on crack.  Sorry, that's a really good title.  What else?  I think that about does it, gentlemen.  It's 8 o'clock. We got a late start today.  Yeah, sorry about that, guys. I had no idea the traffic was going to be that bad.  And no worries.  Plus, I had to go to the dump.  We got rid of 650 pounds of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yay!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was pretty out of control.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's always an adventure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, the dead washer and dryer went bye bye.  That was very sad. They lasted me like eight years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some caterpillar driver's going to have a fun time running that over and crushing you down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was telling Kevin about that. I'm like throwing stuff off the back of my truck and I hear this, wham!  And I turn around and there's one of those...  For people who've never gone to the dump, essentially, the Sanitation and Recycling Center in San Francisco,  it's a big giant warehouse and they tell you to back your vehicle up.  And where you back your vehicle up, they have like a row of posts.  And on the other side of the post is a couple of really happy people on the biggest caterpillar tractors you've ever seen in door,  smashing things flat with a front loader and sweeping by, picking stuff up and throwing them into dumpsters,  which get hauled out really rapidly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's really done in a warehouse in San Francisco?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well they used to do it outdoors.  It's really funny because somebody who used to work there used to grab all the strange objects de art.  So there's this hillside behind where it was and you see garden gnomes  and somebody's plaster of Paris version of Atlas holding the world on his shoulders and a nine foot long tiger.  So there's this little army of weird stuff up on this hill.  Pretty funny.  Well the wind never stops blowing in San Francisco, so I guess garbage would end up over half the state.  So they moved it all indoors.  So you get your vehicle weighed in and you drive around and they assign you...  They basically look to make sure you're not getting rid of nuclear waste or toxic waste.  And they tell you to back up somewhere.  So you're inside this football field-sized warehouse and you start hocking the stuff off the back of your truck.  And while the giant earth-moving machinery is smashing things flat and sweeping things by you,  they're obviously having a ball.  And I should point out that the stuff is recycled at that point and only the non-recyclable bits are buried.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pushed down to the bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope not.  Barges.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Five miles out, goodbye.  No, that's not funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I hope it's not true, but I suspect it is.  No, I'm pretty sure it's not true.  Okay.  I mean, can you imagine what a nightmare ocean beach would be?  Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's bad enough the people you're running to are just running through the dunes, let alone stuff washing up on shore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, that's my neighborhood you're talking about.  I used to live out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I miss it.  I miss the wackiness.  I miss the wackiness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The world's largest gathering of happy people burning fires on public property.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The beach that hardly anyone uses.  Ah, I shouldn't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, because I'll tell you what, if you get a sunny day...  This time of year, yeah.  That is a packed beach.  You get a lot of hap...  Because nobody gets sun in San Francisco in June or July.  Just remember that, Kevin.  Lay out in the sun as much as you can while you're down in LA.  Ah, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You're not going to see it until September.  I miss the foggy, cloudy weather of San Francisco.  I really do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, East Bay rules, man.  It's 10 degrees warmer.  I get more sun.  Gentlemen, I think...  I think we're done.  I think we're toast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is the part where I get to figure out whether or not, A, I can actually manage  to upload this to the FTP server, and B, if we can get the new feed through AOL up and  running.  So if you hear any whimpering and crying from the Petaluma area, it's me fighting with the  fly.  I'm going to do a...  I'm going to see if I can find the naughty bits.  Naughty!

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We didn't have to record that one, right?  We did this all via Skype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Basically, we either have a really fine podcast sitting on the Morantz recorder at the other  end of this bench, or I screwed up royally, and we're going to do this all again as soon  as I get you guys together.  See you tomorrow.  This flaming mess was brought to you by Patrick Norton.  Please support us.  We're really sorry.  Hopefully, everything works out.
