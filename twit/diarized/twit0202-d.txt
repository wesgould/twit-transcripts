Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey welcome to Tweet202.  I'm John C. Dvorak, substituting for Leo Laporte, who's off in China.  And taking pictures and probably being arrested as we speak, at least that's what he thinks.  And we've got some guests lined up that are, I keep you probably I think entertained for  the next hour and a half or so.  Beginning with Becky Worley.  Hello Becky.  Good afternoon John C. So what are your monikers currently that you're going to plug here for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh it's Plugorama?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I mean I'm introducing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well you know you could check out the blogs at abcnews.com.  I'm filling in for Bill Weir on Monday so check out the Quick Fix.  That's one.  And you know anything else?  Anyone looking to rent a condo on Maui?  Email me.  Wow.  How's that for a straight up plug?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then we have a couple of virgins here for the show insofar as they've never been  on the show before.  Ouch.  Including Natalie Del Conti, the famous now CBS person.  Who is, what's your, what do we want to refer to you as?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well I'm an anchor for CNET TV and I'm a correspondent for the CBS early show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Congratulations by the way.  Thank you very much.  I'm sure you're killing them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh well I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And another virgin is Carlos Rodela.  What's up people?  At carlosrodela.com also one of the, he's actually running the tech network at mevio.com.  What anything else we want to put you down for there buddy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah we do episodic web show content at mevio and then I work with you.  Talking about you.  Well I work with you and so that's fun.  Okay well that's good enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's good enough for me.  So everybody here knows about tech so we can talk about topics until we're blue in the  face and that's what we're going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You have not said channeldivorak.org yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Channeldivorak.com and divorak.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay it was just too weird that everybody else was plugging but I just needed to stop  for a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay so what do we got for news stories?  You know the thing that kind of jumped out at me was this crazy story that Sony Ericsson  had pre-read or somebody slipped it into the public domain that they've got a phone now  that's going to be running Android and along with all the, we now hear 20 new phones coming  out running Android before Christmas.  It could cause a kind of a tidal wave of interest in Android.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah but wouldn't you expect that though?  The pre-read looks like a blackberry storm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah it does.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But Sony Ericsson already makes really great phones.  The only problem is we never see them in the US because they have too high of megapixels  on their cameras and our US carriers just won't accept them.  So we never get to see them but Sony Ericsson phones are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This phone is supposed to have an 8.1 megapixel camera and a flash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah well that may be part of the reason but aren't the phones that they generally have  made until now using Windows Mobile?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think so yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who's the primary carrier for these guys?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well generally I have a couple of these phones, not this one but I just get the unlocked phone  and just throw anybody's card in there and I don't really care who the carrier is.  Is anybody selling Sony Ericsson stuff?  Verizon or AT&T does anybody know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think so.  I think you have to get them unlocked.  None of the carriers subsidize them and a lot of it is because the carriers won't subsidize  the phone with such a high megapixel camera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So does anybody but me think that the Android phone is going to eventually overtake the  iPhone in popularity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Survey says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I actually think maybe.  I played with the HTC Magic recently and I really liked it and I think Android is a great  operating system.  I think that because so many other carriers are going to be open to it besides just you  know mobile OS X then yeah I definitely think that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This seems like an inertia question.  I mean just there's so much momentum going the iPhone's way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you're going to stick with iPhone in this argument?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going to stay there because I just feel like it's also about the content and in terms  of the App Store, in terms of iTunes.  I just feel like for the average Joe the momentum is already pushing so much towards the iPhone  niche subset finds the sort of more boutique phones like the Sony Ericsson a little bit  to have more cache, more geek cache.  I think that the lion's share is going to stick with the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Carlos?  Yeah, Dvorak.  This is a perfect opportunity for me to talk about MetroPCS yet again.  Oh yeah.  But and I'm not sponsored by them yet.  But yeah I mean talk about Joe Schmo.  This phone right here $50 unlimited text data voice and everything like that.  It's $300 but when we're talking about all these fancy expensive phones usually yeah  they're tied into contracts and for me Joe Schmo I want something that I have no contract  and you know it's all in one kind of device.  So again.  What is that phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $50 a month all included is pretty awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah and the phone's of $300 and it's pretty cool.  It looks you know it feels like an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know today iPhone is on my poo poo list because I bought the iPhone.  What list is this?  Your poo poo list.  My crap list.  That's my nice way of saying my poop poo list.  Because I have been chasing Apple all day because this morning I had an appointment  at Apple to go in and get my iPhone subsidy because I pre-ordered iPhone 3GS and then  they came out and changed the subsidy rules and said okay people who were eligible for  upgrade within July August or September can now get the subsidy.  But I had already paid and they charged my credit card the full amount and I can't figure  out how to get that money back to save my life.  I've called AT&T.  They won't help me.  They told me to call Apple.  I called Apple and they said go into the store.  I went into the store and they said to call AT&T.  So I feel like I've been chasing my head.  It's like a Mobius strip and I'm so upset with Apple right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you use do you use an Amex card for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used a Visa just a regular Visa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you know with an Amex card you could just say no I'm not going to pay this and  then they give a dispute comes goes into play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at you David Horowitz.  I guess I think I'm going to have to send the phone back.  I think that this is really a you either play the correspondent card or you go into the  Apple store and cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  See I'm so uncomfortable with you that I try to get really nice at the store and that didn't

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  work.  It didn't work at all.  So I'm so uncomfortable pulling the correspondent card so I just didn't do it at all.  And now I'm just I think I'm just going to send the phone back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just so tired of dealing with Apple.  This is why I don't deal with Apple.  You know what I mean?  I want a phone that I can just pay quick and get done with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you getting paid by these guys by the way?  Yeah yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pull up that hoodie and show us your Metro PCS t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We can also supplement by saying Boost Mobile also $50 a month right?  And some of the other carriers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey you know I use a track phone it's $39 a month but it's not but it's like a prepaid  card.  I mean you don't get unlimited anything.  You pay for the minutes and you just don't use the phone much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well they also have those deals with Verizon and AT&T now where you can pay by the day.  It's like a buck fifty to two bucks a day for a 24 hour period.  So you're not on a contract at all.  So they're getting some of the prices you sure.  Yeah it's not that expensive.  Some of these you know the bigger carriers are getting it that people want that kind  of flexibility.  And you know places like Shrink My Bill Shrink.  My Validas these companies that you upload a PDF of your bill they'll analyze it and  then they'll assess how your usage fits into the best plans and then send you a better  deal that you should be doing within your same carrier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you bring the Sham Wows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Dude an entire bag of them.  All right.  Wait why do you have those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's a pitch man for Sham Wow.  She's going to take over when this guy quits the Sham Wow guy.  Hey camera guy.  Hey camera guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know it's really interesting.  Okay I got to have my slight Billy Mays retrospective just to follow up on last week.  So I did bring you a Billy Mays product which is Mighty Menditt with a picture of Billy  Mays and his throat beard.  Just an homage to last week's show.  Sham Wow is pitched by Vince Offer.  Thank you Colleen who would have been the natural successor to Billy Mays except that  he got arrested a few months ago for allegedly punching a prostitute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah well what choice did he have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So then we get Anthony Sullivan the British guy who co-host the show on Discovery with  Billy Mays called Pitch Men.  Billy Mays untimely passing and now Discovery has ordered a whole new season of Pitch Men.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Without Billy Mays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They had ordered it before his passing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wait is the British guy the guy who does that chopping thing the chopper where you like  hit it a bunch of times and it chops up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is the same guy who does Sham Wow.  That's Vince Offer.  Anthony Sullivan does shuffles which are mops that you wear on your feet and they have these  great pads that are velcroed onto the bottom and you can throw them into the washing machine  after you've mopped the kitchen floor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dvorak you need to do that Amoebio.  Unbelievable.  Dvorak wear those Amoebio I'm serious.  I could just wear them around the house.  Yeah but you can clean our office it's really dirty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I brought a bunch of and I also showed you a before and after of Sham Wow.  I gave you some used those are the used ones and these are the fresh ones.  This is a used Sham Wow?  For you the best.  What is it?  Well they come in different colors but I just wanted to show it does not act like your traditional  Shammy which has the leather like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah Shammy's are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah this is not a Shammy.  No.  This is a rag that costs $20 plus shipping and handling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know we should do a show about the technology behind these things because these are really  amazing products.  My mom used to have the Miracle Thaw and that stuff you could take a frozen chicken a whole  put it on this plate and it would defrost your chicken in like two minutes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah well that was because it was made out of aluminum you have high heat transfer.  If you actually had one of those things made out of copper.  In fact I use a copper pot to do this.  If you take a copper pot and put the chicken you take and flip it over made out of copper  is a real lot faster than aluminum and you put the chicken on top of the bottom of the  pot because it's upside down now.  Thing will be it thaws out in two seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John C. DeBora.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Solid rock to thaw.  Wow.  Well it's not quite two seconds but it's something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is really advanced science that we're talking about.  Crunch pad.  Awesome technology.  Crunch pad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Want to talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Alright crunch pad is a story that shows up in the it was interesting because somebody  called out Michael Arrington on the fact that he released the news about his crunch pad  in this traditional print media.  Some one of the business magazines or business newspapers.  And so apparently Michael Arrington was floating around Southeast Asia and found some manufacturing  company that would make this this crunch pad which is a like a giant iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right it's 12 inches diagonally.  It's a glass touch screen.  It's internet browser only.  Runs on flash.  Atom chips I think.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is what he wants.  He just wants an internet only device that's bigger than a Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He got a call from manufacturers about a year and a couple months ago and he was saying  I you know anyone I'll work with anyone just give us some ideas on what you think this  will be.  And I thought that that was kind of a neat idea but now we're in the age of netbooks  and iPhones and why do I need this when I've got a Kindle a netbook and an iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wants it to replace the Kindle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well yeah the Kindle is still black and white.  I mean you know what I mean.  We still need color.  We still need the ability to do a magazine type experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK but is it going to give me wireless downloading?  Free?  I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't Apple working on something just like this too?  That's the case then it's over.  It's over right?  Yeah.  I mean because Apple if Apple rolls out a netbook or a pad I suspect that it's going  to have these you know all those patents on the multiple hands thing where you can move  things around with two fingers.  Multi-touch.  And some other features that would probably make it a dynamite device.  I'm just guessing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well Apple also put in last week for some new patents including haptic feedback and  the idea here being that it could provide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Haptic meaning it shakes when you move?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah there's sort of a tactile feedback sort of like the Blackberry Storm that would it  could either supplement this tablet idea that it's sort of more than a tablet more than  a netbook justifying cost all about interface or it could be an upgrade to the iPhone in  this respect in terms of you touch the right button and it gives you some sort of a pushback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I get a haptic feedback.  I have an N97 which is the new not yet released in the US as far as I know Nokia which has  got the big screen and it's got a flip open thing and a keyboard full keyboard and the  whole rest of it.  I think the thing's terrible personally.  But when you touch it you have this haptic thing going on.  What's interesting I think that makes it kind of intriguing is they've added even more radios  that not like there's not enough already on these things.  You know you have GPS you got all these different receivers.  This one has an FM radio built into it and an FM transmitter.  And so you can take it you can take and load it up with your you know say a bunch of MP3s  and then you use tune the transmitter to 88.3 or whatever you don't have on your normal  radio and then you put it in your car hit the button turn on your radio and you get  the stereo from the from the from the player.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah that's great Dvorak but are you listening to the radio still?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well old craft that don't have mini jack input.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's all I listen to is I listen to right wing talk radio.  Yeah I know at work.  Well you must have had a field day this weekend with the Palin departure.  I got some good stuff from Palin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh this sounds like a conspiracy theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'll be on the no agenda show be doing it tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey but Dvorak on this home all these these types of touch screen type tablet things.  I mean you just got to look at the company who's going to evolve and look at the evolution  of technology right.  And they're going to be the winners.  I mean just think about you know minority report and that whole thing.  And that's happening on like Fox News now or whatever or those news channels.  I mean look at the people who are pushing that envelope and other ones that are going  to succeed because at the end of the day we have to evolve that you know tablet.  You okay?  Yeah I've had too much pet food.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the Dvorak.  I like the little note in the back.  You watch pardon the interrupt.  What's the one?  It's not pardon the interrupt.  No no it's the one before that.  So around the horn with Tony Reali.  One of the guys always has a sign behind him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it's Dvorak is hilarious.  That says something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's subliminal I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well remember the thing with haptics was we always thought that it was going to be the  porn companies that would develop it to its height because you would have some sort of  a USB device that you would plug in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Teledildonics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right Teledildonics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what it was called and that's what.  What it's still called.  Yes.  No but I don't know that it's ever taken off.  But why would I know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Apple iPhone apps.  I saw something a little bit like this at demo last year that was the same size as the  TechCrunch.  What it figures?  Is that what you said?  Yeah.  Well the thing was with this was I thought that it was such a needed device and it would  be made to replace your PDFs or any of your book readers.  I thought you were talking about Teledildonics.  I got it.  I was like whoa.  Is that on your Pupilist too Natalie?  No.  I don't know anything about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know anything about it.  Never heard of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's never going to come on the show again.  We're harassing her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You see me blushing if you're watching the show live you can see me blushing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not quite.  I mean you might be but you're not getting it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Next.  Can I stay with our slightly adult theme and talk about Apple iPhone apps.  Just sorry more Apple.  But that have been pulled because of inappropriate content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah they have naked people or scantily dressed people and so they decided they don't want  to have anything to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  And these particular apps are sort of like hot or not.  Apps remember you would rate am I hot am I not and then users upload their own photos  so of course you can't control every photo unless it's approved by the app company themselves.  So Apple pulls it because the user generated content is adult and inappropriate.  I get that.  But the thing that seems so just hypocritical about this is Apple has an app on my phone  right now that gives me complete access to inappropriate material.  Yeah this browser Safari.  Yeah I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't get it either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just I just called.  I don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I my comment was that I think they took the scantily clad girls off the iPhone because  they're already having enough trouble with smudges on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Gross John bad.  What what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have something I wanted to ask.  I'm somehow feeling the Dvorak role of like moving the tech along.  Yeah move it along.  Sorry.  How many of you guys downloaded Jackson songs this week off the web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Natalie you're too young right?  Yes I did actually.  No I'm not too young.  Come on.  What'd you get?  No I did.  I realized that the Jackson music that I still own is either on tape or record.  So I had to go and buy iTunes and I just bought the best stuff.  I have actually an interesting story about that because I used to have CDs Jackson CDs  but I was raised a Jehovah's Witness and so when when Michael Jackson disassociated himself  from the Jehovah's Witness faith everyone who is still Jehovah's Witness was told to  throw away all of his CDs.  So my mom made my sister and I throw all of it in the trash.  My sister kept the Remember the Time I think that I don't remember the name of that album.  Anyway so she kept it and she just hid it but we had to throw away all of our CDs so  I only had the tapes and the records that we had from the 80s and that I hid from my  mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the most wholesome reason to like have one license that spans your entire life for  a piece of music.  Yeah I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Pretty crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When did he associate himself with the Jehovah's Witness?  You said he didn't.  He went away from it?  He disassociated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He was raised a Jehovah's Witness just like I was.  His mother I believe still is and he disassociated himself from the faith in the 90s I believe  in the early 90s like around 92 ish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't there some code word Natalie that's something like disassociate or you've been  disassociated or something that that will if you tell any Jehovah's Witnesses that come  to your door they'll never come back again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well you can be disfellowshipped which means they kick you out.  But he disassociated himself which means he was the one who removed himself.  They're two different words.  So if you're disfellowshipped that means they kicked you out.  If you're disassociated you kicked yourself out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay so if you give so the Jehovah's Witness comes to you do we have nothing but good facts  on this show ladies and gentlemen?  Jehovah's Witness come to your door and you say I'm sorry but I've been disfellowshipped  they never come back again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Because they're not allowed to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I heard that too.  You could as soon as you see open the door and Buddhist sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know we got back to tech but how do you get disfellowshipped?  Is there like a set of things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You have to do something that violates the rules and not be repentant for it.  Oh not sorry at all.  I am neither disfellowshipped nor am I disassociated I am just inactive.  Which is a whole third year of we don't need to talk about it let's not talk about it.  It's like everyone's friend for tangening.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah that's it.  Jehovah's Witnesses and Friendster that's about it.  That's a good yeah.  So let's get back to Michael Jackson.  The email is becky at abc.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Carlos did you download Michael Jackson stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No I listened to it on Pandora and then when I went out to you know dance or whatever it  was everywhere I couldn't escape it so.  But yeah he was a big deal when I grew up I had the whole bubble card bubble gum and  stickers and you know the picture with him and the sweater on the wall.  I mean I had the whole deal until he went crazy a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Off the Wall was my first album so I was fascinated by these stats.  Check this so Last FM says at its peak 42,000 people were listening to Michael Jackson at  one time.  Post death Michael sold 422,000 albums in the week.  He was at 10k the last week before he was live so massive explosion and half of those  were downloaded albums.  2.3 million downloaded singles and prior to that no one artist had ever downloaded more  than a million singles in a week.  So the guy's like 500 million in debt.  I'm thinking that he took a substantial chunk out of that this last week and probably as  the hype dies down significant amounts will be ebbed away in his 500 million debt.  Well they think most of it will be covered by the Beatles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He has the Beatles what's it called the publishing rights.  Yeah but it's a name for it.  Somebody will know in the chat room.  Anyway that's probably worth about Sony is going to buy it probably for about 400.  Well they already own half of it.  Yeah they get their first rights for the rest of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Man I mean the whole thing about Google thinking it was the Beatles catalog that Google thought  that it was a malicious attack in terms of all the Michael Jackson traffic it's unreal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well Adam Curry was on MSNBC and we have a clip that will be on no agenda not to plug  that but I will where he apparently since they asked him a dumb question he decided  to go off the deep end and he started ranting about it.  Why aren't they investigating this as a murder?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that was it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They kind of cut him off the show and that was the end of it and they hung up on him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Adam has such great stories about Michael Jackson too about them putting him on a box  when he did tosses to him and stuff.  He has great stories about MTV in the 80s and the 90s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hi Leo Laporte here.  Hello guys.  Hope you're having a good time sitting on my ball drinking my liquor and doing Twitter  without me.  I'm in China right now but I had to just stop by and say hi and thank Audible for supporting  the show and besides if I don't do the commercial then Dvorak has to do something else.  In the commercials you see if John had to do the commercials he wouldn't get to get  up wander around baste his meat that kind of thing.  So this is the portion of the show where John wanders and bastes.  While I tell you how great Audible is we've got a special deal the Audible Platinum deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So anyway, back to tech.  Becky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What am I?  Okay, all right.  What have I got here?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Becky's like my, you're going to be like my Ed McMahon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Becky, what else you got here on the list?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Great, I'm on the death list again.  What do you got on the list there, Becky?  I like this story.  So coming out of an Australian blog, they're saying that Lenovo's making a bigger delete  key and getting rid of the caps lock key on their new notepad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I applaud them because the caps lock key is idiotic.  The delete key doesn't go there, of course.  It goes up in the other right hand corner, but the delete key should be bigger because  people pound it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  They're going to make delete and escape bigger because apparently the average user uses it  something like 700 times per week or something like that.  But I actually do use caps lock all the time to write scripts for broadcasts.  But I don't think there's any other reason to use it unless you're just being a jerk  and instant message.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I agree.  There's no reason for it.  The thing, I mean it used to be useful in certain kinds of programming languages that  required all uppercase and some other things, but they left it on here.  And every once in a while you accidentally tag it.  The next thing you know you're typing in all caps and people are yelling at you for screaming  at them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or your passwords are all jacked up and you don't notice because you're seeing an asterisk  and you're not seeing it.  And so many of us who are keyboarders, we don't touch type so we're looking at the keyboard  anyways.  So my question is what, the keyboard has been underrepresented in terms of innovation.  So what would you change about the keyboard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, I think you'd probably go to the Dvorak keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a keyboard that these guys, what was the name of this company?  Well, it's not Gateway, but it sounded like Gateway.  It was a company in the 80s and they redid the keyboard specifically with the caps lock  key moved and they moved a couple of other things.  And I always can remember that somebody will come up with it.  But anyway, and I still have one of those keyboards and it has a big star, like one  of the keys, so when you do star dot star or anything like that, it just was like Northgate,  that's the name of them.  And they had this really good keyboard and they were selling like hotcakes.  I mean, people would buy the Northgate keyboard and then I don't know what happened.  It just people just Northgate went out of business and nobody decided to keep up with  the, by the way, chat room, you guys are great.  I can be like an idiot here.  Well, I am anyway, but I'm just saying.  So you just hearts Northgate says Miss M.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nice.  I would have definitely the dot com button like you have on the on the iPhone.  That's great.  I get a huge mute button, sort of that not safe for office video comes up and suddenly  you realize it and find it.  I would change print screen to screen grab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the point of print screen?  It doesn't even do anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's why is it such a vestigial appendage?  Can't we get it to just say screen grab?  That's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It'd be a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then go ahead, Natalie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they, you know, they try with those email buttons that are just like a picture  with a little envelope or the back or the browser and no one really uses those.  Those never really took off.  Right.  So those would be a good idea if we can actually get them working with our operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't see why not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Keep the chat room says get rid of insert scroll lock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scroll locks another dog.  I hate that.  So meanwhile, the chat room was going nuts about making us want to talk about Compuserve  dying.  And so this story comes out, by the way.  So I'm reading somebody said, oh, Compuserve Compuserve rest in peace.  Somebody blogged on one of my bloggers.  Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me fire up my mosaic browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I'm going Compuserve was out of business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought they were out of business 10 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I ran down to Radio Shack and I bought internet in a box and I got the Compuserve  membership along with my mosaic browser.  I think it was 150 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Remember those old your address is always something like 71377.6543 something like that.  And by the way, you notice that the funny thing about the Compuserve people don't realize  is that if you look at those numbers that were your Compuserve numbers, there was never  an eight or a nine because they were using an octal computer.  Seriously.  So nothing could go above seven.  What's an octal computer?  Instead of a base 16 like we have hex, it's a base eight.  So it was zero to eight, zero to seven.  We're the only numbers allowable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wikipedia says Compuserve was founded in 1969.  They're that old?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  No.  Well, it wasn't what it was.  It wasn't an information utility in 1969.  It was something else.  Okay.  It became an information utility after I think the source was the first one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's a little sidebar that was again.  Thank you, chat room reminded me of this.  So last time I was on, Leo was talking about how he uses newsgroups to get music downloads  because nobody ever keeps an eye on them.  And what happens this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, thank you, Leo.  All your newsgroup users can thank Leo for pointing this out.  The RIDL loves listening to Leo's show.  Good work, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They've tried trying to clamp down on newsgroup transmission of the old download files, song

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  files.  So anyway, this is I won't get into it then because that's that opens up a huge can of  work for me because the music industry and digital and if we want to go down that road,  let me know.  I'll talk down the road.  Give us what your pet peeve is besides your phone.  My phone's awesome.  It's right here.  Samsung for this.  It's really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Before you say this, I think we should say that it's not necessarily I mean, this sets  a disturbing precedence, but Usenet was just this was lazy, you know, like they didn't  provide evidence when they needed it in the trial.  Like they just didn't defend themselves representative of the whole music industry.  They could have done a much better job.  And that's their bad.  They didn't have to lose this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, just in general, you put this together with that case that we know against the lady  for what was it?  One point nine, two million dollars, a billion dollars or whatever.  Yeah.  It's just them failing to evolve.  And you know, they're an old dinosaur that's dying out.  Instead, they could be looking at new ways to deliver digital media to the fans who want  it.  And on top of that, the things that I'm actually starting a music site at some point in the  end of the year.  Well, just a little side note there.  And but you know, all the things that people want, like the t-shirts and the concert tickets  and all this kind of stuff, the secondary stuff that people love from artists, that's  what they should be focusing on.  And that's what people are.  You know, that's what the artists are making money on anyhow.  So instead of just keeping going over and over this whole like, all right, don't get  the songs, don't get the songs.  Just give away free songs, you know, promote the artists that you really care about and  then sell things in the back end.  I mean, that's the model that it works in other countries.  It works, you know, in other in Spain and other places that are trying it.  So they just they're just totally off the mark.  And I think everybody knows it.  It's just how they move their whole old system over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And we should mention, by the way, is the Usenet.com, not the giant Usenet as a whole,  got sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, Carlos, how do you feel about the ASCAP issue that now they're talking about charging  more for ringtones because they're perceived of as a concert or a public broadcast of the  song?  Unbelievable.  Which, I mean, my favorite part about this is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who comes up with this?  So somebody said...  And how long did it take them to come to this conclusion?  We've only had ringtones that are songs for the last, what, 15 years.  So somebody has taken a...  Oh, I'm sorry.  Shouldn't use bad language.  Language.  Virgin ears.  Poopoo.  Poopoo.  Poopoo.  And they dawned on him.  Holy...  Because their phone rang or somebody's phone rang and they said, wait a minute, isn't that  a Sly and the Family Stone tune?  They should be...  We should be charging a nickel for that.  They said, holy crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right.  So the back story is they're already charging for the ringtone as a distribution of the  song, but now they're wanting to add extra cost...  Performance charges.  Performance charges because it's broadcast publicly.  And so the parallel that's being thrown down is, so do you have to pay extra if you're  going to listen to music in a convertible?  Do you have to...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or on a boombox?  Yeah.  And what's even more insane?  I mean, this is all insanity.  We're talking about crazy talk right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We are, but let's indulge this crazy talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  We could talk for a long time.  But the ringtones themselves are preposterous.  I mean, they're like $3.49 and yet the actual song is 99 cents.  I mean, the model's already broken.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I still can't believe that that model exists.  When ringtones started to become popular, I thought that that was going to be something  that was popular for like two weeks with the teenagers and then gone.  But people still buy the same song that they already own in their library just to ring  on their phone.  I really do not understand it.  I feel like it's a complete generation gap.  You know, I get a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's like using a song for an ad that using a song for an ad should get, should cost more  than just using a song, say in a movie or something, because it brands, it brings the  emotion of the song to the brand.  Well, the same thing is true of a ringtone.  It brings the emotion of a song to you.  When people hear it, they associate that song with you and it becomes sort of like your personal  soundtrack.  And it's, I just, I get that.  That makes sense to me.  I like it, but I get it.  It makes sense.  But it is amazing how much traction it's had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But like, but like, it's a generational thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not us.  Like would you pay $2.99 for a song that you paid 89 cents in Amazon for just so it can  ring out loud when you're in public and people hear that you like bootylicious?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If I had the time, you could just make the thing into a ringtone yourself.  It doesn't take that long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I was going to say.  Yeah.  Not only those programs that can like convert all these songs that you download into a ringtone.  So it's, yeah, it's ridiculous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, there is, but I mean, I live in Manhattan and if someone on a bus or any kind of public  area just starts blaring bootylicious on their phone, I'm going to give them a dirty look.  Like I don't like that.  And I just don't think that people appreciate it anymore.  Like once it was kind of a cool thing.  Like I had the, when I moved to LA, I put the 90210 theme song on my phone because it  was gimmick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Natalie, what's a dirty look from you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I want to see this.  Show me your poopy look.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Ooh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the stink guy.  That is the stink guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what it looks like if you have bootylicious on your phone next to me here in Manhattan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey Natalie, where are you in Manhattan?  I'm from New York actually originally.  Where are you?  Where are you at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think I want to say that on tape.  Oh, right.  But I'll instant message you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have another personal question though.  What would your ringtone be now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now?  I don't know.  Carlos?  See, I'm so against ringtones in general that I just can't come up with that answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a rooster?  What is, you have to have a ring.  Hmm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have some crazy new age thing that is in three dimensions on this Nokia that floats  around the room.  Oh, it's very special.  And then it says the person's name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh.  Yeah, actually that's what I have too.  I was going to say, John, you want to call me real quick?  I can play it.  It has like this lady's voice.  My phone's in the other room or somewhere in the room.  Oh, well.  It has a lady's voice on the phone and it just says, John Dvorak is calling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, celestial.  Very celestial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mine sounds more like somebody with some speech defect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Be like, oh, in the chat room, they're saying keyboard cat.  I think keyboard cat would be a perfect ringtone.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sing it.  Keyboard cat.  Just a melody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No singing on the show.  Don't we have any more news or let's go.  OK, let's get back to tech.  Let's go to tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I have a Bing question.  So Natalie, you want to throw in some Bing stuff from this week in terms of the facts  and figures?  Let's see.  I don't have that.  Just some of the like, I know that there's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The fact that Bing has gained a whole point in percentage.  I don't have the numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the one I think that was most interesting is like the whole.  I'm sorry.  I didn't mean to put you on the.  No, that's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I just don't have the numbers in front of me.  You go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You just did it.  So they gained a percentage point.  Wow.  They pulled from Yahoo and from Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a poo poo Bing.  But isn't it?  Remember, I think me and Dvorak are talking about this.  It's just MSN live search, right?  I mean, it's got.  Clear pictures.  Yeah, it's got Facebook.  It's MSN live search.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't undercut the pretty pictures.  This is my my my Bing theory is that I love the pictures make me feel good.  I'm excited to see what the new picture is going to be.  I am like I went to the new picture today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder if my search will be better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have an emotional relationship with Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I really was thinking about this as I was walking along the street today, which  makes me a loser.  I was thinking, why did Google come in and sweep in over Yahoo?  And it's not because the users understood the algorithm was better for Google.  It's because it was cleaner.  I think that people really understood that it's not clogged up when I search for something  like shoes, that they would get a simple result.  And I think that's what Bing is going after.  And I think they have it right.  I think that's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should bring that up because Yahoo had a very simple interface for years when it  was doing really well.  And it was the same thing.  It was just Yahoo and it had a little box.  It didn't have that front page like they have now with a bunch of news and stuff.  No, but it was a directory.  People perceived it as a directory.  Well, it was also a directory, but even when it was becoming a search engine, normal search  engine, it wasn't that complicated.  Then they got the new, you know, all of a sudden all the experts started to show up,  you know, these professional managers.  And they had to start mucking with that simple interface.  And I will predict right now, this is a little early, that this will happen eventually to  Google.  Somebody's going to come along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it already is happening with my Google.  And then if that becomes your default page, then you have all the same crap that you have  on Yahoo with sports and news and all that stuff that I still can't.  I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the simple thing, you got a box, you type in it, and then you get your list and  now you go on your way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's exactly why I never did that on my Google because I saw my friend use it and  it's just full of stuff.  Jungle.  Yeah, that's not what I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it's interesting because now it's gone full circle that Yahoo, I just don't think  people perceive it as a search engine anymore.  They perceive it as a news outlet.  So get these numbers.  Yahoo News, 4.3 million unique viewers in May.  CNN 3.29.  And their point is they are the number one news source in the world.  They kill ABC, CBS, CNN, BBC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But at the same time, they're portals to those sites.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But they also house that content in their own windows.  So I mean, it's interesting that it's come full circle.  So we're returning to Yahoo as a news source, not perceiving it as a search.  Bing, I wonder if the average population even equates it with Microsoft.  The name is genius.  I think so too.  My other thing about the name is it's a great verb.  I binged it.  I'm not saying I would use it, but it sounds like ping.  And that sounds sort of geeky.  They should have named it Ping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's not a bad idea.  OK, but what's the past tense of being bong?  I bonged it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, jeez, Louise.  I'm not doing it.  I'm not using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know.  You don't like the pictures.  You will.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When Google became a verb, I thought it was a good idea.  It made minor sense.  And I remember when it happened.  Back in the olden days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The picture on Bing today is of some sort of a village in China.  No doubt Leo Laporte's reach extending.  I think he took that picture and he stitched together with his eye.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that might be him right there in the top right corner in the yellow shirt.  I see him.  I definitely see him.  That's Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Mm hmm.  Mm hmm.  By Bing.  By Bing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chandler bong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's Chanandler bong if we're really going to get technical and have friends trivia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right.  So what else we got, Becky?  You are the laziest kid I've ever met.  What else we got on the agenda, Becky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know.  I said something.  I'm working.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Natalie, give us your story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's talk about advertising on the Kindle because Amazon has filed for a patent to put  advertisements in books.  So if you're reading about something like China, then on maybe some little subset of  the Kindle somewhere, you could get an advertisement for Chinese food, which is location aware  because the Kindle has Sprint on it so it will know where you are.  So what do you think about advertising?  I don't like it.  I don't like it.  If I'm reading a book, I don't want the book telling me to go buy stuff unless I'm reading

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  a catalog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the same thing can be said for email.  The same thing can be said for search or reading anything online.  We don't get to choose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you apparently like the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If it brings the price of the Kindle down, I would be okay with it because I still think  the Kindle is too expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The only difference is we're talking about competing with real books.  The book of books is an experience that is being challenged by Kindle.  But the minute you start putting ads in it, I'm taking out the experience.  And that's the reason I was reading a book.  I was reading a book because there was nothing else to distract me.  It was a book and it was a great story or whatever I was reading.  So I despise this idea.  Silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Good for you.  But wouldn't you have an opt-in model where you either buy the content full price or you  get a great discount because it's going to be ad supported and that allows more people  to have access to it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's part of the greed because it should be cheaper anyhow.  Well it is though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the one thing I'll say is everybody disses the Kindle and the prices.  But I mean I just got, this is so embarrassing, the entire Jane Austen collection for 99 cents  on the Kindle.  What?  99 cents for the whole collection.  I went back and got Rudyard Kipling's Kim.  99 cents.  And that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  These are all public domain books.  They should be free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the convenience of having them within seconds, I'll pay 99 cents for them.  I agree with that.  And I don't know if they're in the public domain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So you don't have to convert it or email it to your Kindle account?  I do that too.  Yeah.  Yeah, I'm totally okay with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I agree with Web, whatever is Web 89.  99 cents is too much.  The guy's right.  But wait, I want to ask Carlos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He said that I'm only reading a book because nothing else is available, like books are  just the last resort to entertain.  No, no, no, no, no.  You misunderstood.  For the use of our free time?  I'd buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I meant like if I want to read a book.  It's the last resort.  If I want to read a book, I don't want anything else around.  I don't want the other experiences.  There's lots of things to obviously do and to watch and see.  I just mean if I have a book, I want that to be the only experience that I'm having.  I don't want to be distracted.  You want it to have your undivided attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, totally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, and plus my attention's all over the place.  It's divided.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're noticing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, but that is so true that for those of us who are way multitasking that the discipline  of going back to a book is one of the few things that holds true.  I wonder if the kids nowadays will feel that way.  No, maybe not.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know.  The problem is, yeah, he's right though.  If you're like reading a book, for instance, when I read Memoirs of a Geisha, I was starving  for sushi the whole time.  And so if I was reading that book and they go for sushi and then I'm like, there's an  ad for sushi.  I'm like, yeah, I want that.  And then I put the book down and I'm eating my sushi and then I don't go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the sushi comes to you later on UPS rotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  And then I have food poisoning and then I'm not for this idea now that you put it that  way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, okay, so Becky, what else we got?  Did you read the New York Times article I sent you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know I sent it to you late, but I just wanted to kind of brief it about the new press, the  new PR in Silicon Valley.  So I wanted to throw this out there because there's this article about how with blogs  and with Twittering, with Facebook, that and especially I think with podcasts and influential  sites like and Gadget and CNET and GDGT that PR is a totally different game than it used to  be back in the day of Silicon Valley.  And I just kind of wanted to get your take on what was the PR machine when you first  started in this business and what it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  When I was a kid, it wasn't what it was today.  I remember back when PR wasn't PR, it was PS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Durek loves it when I date him, but come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She hasn't dated me for years.  Spinning the web PR in Silicon Valley, an article by Claire Kane Miller, if that is  indeed her real name.  And it starts off with Brooke, Brooke Hammerling as the lead word in the whole thing.  Brooke, congratulations.  Good work.  So Brooke wrote this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but this was good PR for Brooke.  Yeah, Brooke wrote this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Let me synopsize for you as you sort of roll through it.  But basically what they're saying is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's got her name on the side.  Wait a minute.  Wait, wait, wait.  You got to see this thing.  We'll have a link.  No, we won't.  Whatever.  Brooke Hammerling starts off in the first graph.  Brooke Hammerling, publicist and blah, blah, blah.  Then the second graph, Ms.  Hammerling, she gets her name again in the first word of the...  It's unbelievable.  This is like a typical New York Times piece of crap.  Oh, it goes on.  They call her a doyen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  On the second page, it calls her a doyen of modern day PR.  She's got her name again, man.  Which is like the woman who's the most respected person in her field.  Like it's a full on PR for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We love you, Brooke, but doyen, please.  Yeah, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the point is, is that in the past, PR was about writing a great press release and  really getting it out to the right people.  Now that it's all about relationships and that everybody's friends.  I just think this is funny because John is friends with no one and I'm friends with no one.  I'm friends with Brooke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I think...  So am I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We all know Brooke.  Well, the thing is, we all...  I'm going to move my camera because the sun's going down.  The thing is, we can see right through this though as journalists.  I know Brooke and I'm friends with her and I'm happy to be, but new PR people who come in  and then try and just kind of be your friend in this way in order for you to get them to cover your companies.  We can see through that.  I'm not sure this is really the new way of PR.  Most of the time it just annoys me when you falsify a friendship that's not pre-existing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, Becky, I'll tell you.  I don't think it's changed that much.  I think what's changed is that they don't have, you know, except for Walt and a few one or two others,  they don't have the outlets anymore.  They used to have like a bunch of computer magazines and a whole bunch of people that could rely on to write stuff up  and there were computer columnists and all the newspapers across the entire country and they could do a lot of stuff.  Now they got a few bloggers.  They got Walt.  You know, they got Natalie, you to some extent.  But again, you know, it's not the same as...  Sorry about that.  No, it has me.  It's not the same as having this, you know, where you could send a million press releases out and get action.  Now you have to, you know, you do have to be friends.  If you don't have...  If these people don't know you personally, you're not even going to take their call knowing you.  I mean, you won't take my call.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's so untrue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I'm talking to...  What's her name over here?  And...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, I think what's interesting is that it's become such a layered animal that in the past, like you said, it was very clear.  You had newspapers, you had TV, you had local, you had national and you had magazines.  And now it's like this filtered system where you have to start at these really sort of niche boutique types of websites.  I think it's impossible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the business is shot.  I think the PR business is a mess.  I do too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a wreck.  I noticed, you know, working for a major news outlet, what we put on ABC that's technology related, we get it about 75% right in terms of what we pay attention to.  But we disproportionately pay attention to Google.  We diss Microsoft.  We diss Yahoo because it's not as cool.  We're obsessed with new, but we don't go back and check in when things have been improved, which is second gen, third gen products.  We...  I just feel like it's sort of...  It's like high school all over again and we're only dating the pretty girls and not looking at the substance.  And it bugs me because PR companies don't help.  And I know for myself, I need that help.  You know, I would love to have better help determining getting through all the mess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But are you saying that companies are hiring PR people based on their looks?  And so it's...  I mean, because that does seem to be true.  If you go to any...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's always been true.  I don't think that's what the point is.  Yeah, I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have noticed that trend, but it's more that...  It's not a trend.  It's not a trend.  I'm talking about the products themselves, that we get obsessed with what's sexy and new and at a national level, looking at products.  And we don't dig in and see the meat of the stuff that's really, really effective and the products that are really life changing as opposed to the products that are just really sexy.  And I think PR is part of the problem, but the whole machine seems broken to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think the machine is broken completely.  I'm going to have to look...  I'm looking at this article.  This is the worst article I've ever read.  Because it just rambles.  It doesn't really say anything.  It's just blablabla.  You know, hammering, hammering, hammering.  I mean, good work on her getting herself a bunch of publicity is not going to help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I mean, that's the whole thing is the story is about all of her personal relationships and all the parties she throws and the expensive dinners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't get invited to any of these things.  Hey, what's the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You do too.  You do too.  You're always complaining that you don't, but you do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  Yes.  This is a myth.  You are so full of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is a myth.  I don't.  So, you know, he's not there.  The work is missing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But who?  Natalie, come on.  You go to these parties.  Who's there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, it's the PR people talking to the PR people and the ones in New York.  I'll go and stop and have some free crab cakes or whatever.  And then I'll leave before I can get taken a photo of by Brian Solis, which, you know, I like Brian Solis, but I don't want to be photographed and put on his blog so that it looks like a picture.  And I'm not saying anything bad about Brian and I hope I don't make it on his blog for saying this.  But, you know, like I'll see myself.  It's sort of he's creating this nano story that says that he knows the influencers, but I'm not sure that that really gets his clients covered.  I don't know.  I do know Brian and I do know Brooke and I like them.  But for instance, I had someone pitch me once this ATM technology story and they're like, you know, what's this?  I was like, I don't think you can talk to me that way.  We don't have a preexisting relationship.  So I'm not exactly sure how that translates into ROI.  Drunk in the mission at 4 a.m.?  Yeah.  Don't you think that's an inappropriate pitch for someone who's ever talked to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brain dead pitch.  I don't know how inappropriate is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For one thing, since you live in a country that's so far away from the city, you're not going to be able to get a job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know how inappropriate is.  For one thing, since you live in New York, that's a long way to go to get drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I think this is when I was still in the Bay Area.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Wow.  You step on my joke there.  Come on.  So anyway, okay.  So the point of this little diatribe is what, Becky?  Well, John, I was PR sucks.  No, I just think the machine I just am curious as to it's always been about relationships.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And as someone who's trying to make good decisions, we need as much help as we can getting the newest stuff under our eyes under NDA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should probably have the phone ringing off the hook.  You're on television, right?  Big network television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I am fascinated by what makes it across my email and what doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably a lot of stuff that you must be stunned, this would be my guess.  And I would say the same for you, Natalie, because you're on network television.  This is big audiences.  This is not like 25 people, you know, and their dog.  This is big audiences.  You must be stunned, I'm guessing, by the amount of stuff you don't hear about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That is my truth.  I am shocked when I don't hear about something.  And I don't hear about because it's all going to...  You don't hear probably about most.  It goes to Arrington.  And Gadget and Dismoto and Arrington and Scobel.  And it's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Who are just talking to each other.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  And that being said, I can talk about toothpaste coupons,  and it's the number four search term on Google.  But I haven't heard about something new coming in, and I don't get to put it on TV.  It's crazy how weird this is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I've mentioned this to Leo,  because Leo has this show here that people are out there listening to.  You know, this happens to have a huge impact.  It's got a big following of people.  And he should be getting, you know, pitched on everything.  But I can't use him as a very good example,  because he refuses to answer email and he doesn't take phone calls.  And so I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's one of the things I'm saying,  is that the people who actually reach out and influence the most users' quantity,  we don't play the game.  We don't go to the parties.  I mean, it's just weird.  It just seems like a circle to me.  And when you're not in the circle, it's just weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I 100% agree.  I 100% agree with you.  I think the wrong people are going to these parties,  and communication is not happening with the right people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, if nobody's out there's noticed,  and I also put this on the head of the people that don't advertise much anymore,  the industry is in the toilet.  So all they're doing is going to parties and talking to each other.  And one guy talks to the other guy,  and they have the little circle of bloggers that all read each other's blog,  but it doesn't really get any further.  And the amount of influence is only amongst the insiders,  and it's like a click.  And then the entire industry is in the tank,  and everybody wonders why.  Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John, it's very much like the music industry too,  because I do music as well.  And a lot of these bands, I come from the Northwest,  I just came out from Seattle,  and they all kind of pat each other on the back and go to each other's shows,  but they're not doing anything outside of that state, right?  So it's the same type of mentality.  These guys are just talking with each other,  and again, patting each other on the back,  but they're not communicating, evolving,  and learning how to grow the business in the right directions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. It tends to be incestuous.  Yeah, incestuous.  And just like I said, there's no ROI there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And one of the things that I've always complained about,  especially in this industry,  which is one of the reasons I don't go to conferences for a lot of different reasons,  I go to some.  But generally speaking, I don't,  because you can get as much as you...  So they're over-covered, and you can get the information other ways.  But it's this group think mentality that really gets me the most,  which is that these one guy says something...  I say to...  Guy A talks to Guy B and says,  And then he talks to Guy C and says,  Then B and C talk to each other,  and they both agree,  Yeah, it must be happening because you heard about it and I heard about it,  and I understand what's-his-name's talking about it.  And the next thing you know,  it's in the Wall Street Journal that's happening when people,  the normal people go,  What? This isn't happening.  But Dvorak, I should bring you with me to the conferences,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  because that's why I go to them,  is because I feel like I stand out,  because those people are all doing that kind of incestual thing.  And when I'm there,  I just feel like,  what's that guy?  He doesn't seem to be part of our group.  And I think you can make a lot of headway that way.  I have a funny story about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  When I first started at PC Magazine,  John was like,  Natalie, let's go to the Intel Dual Core press conference.  And so the two of us went,  and he's like,  The food's good here, but don't talk to anyone.  And we sat there and they made a huge deal about Dual Core  and how this is the future of computing,  and you just wait for Quad Core and then Tera computing,  and you just hold on to your horses.  And John goes,  There's going to be a flaw in this chip in two weeks.  Mark my words.  Get some crab cakes and let's go.  Remember?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty much.  I library when you were there,  you were working,  you were typing up your story.  Get your free lunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know I had that little Lenovo that PC Mag,  and I was like,  I got to file a story.  He's like,  No, you don't.  Get your food and let's get out of here.  Don't talk to anyone.  Hey, Dvorak,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that brings me to a good segue.  She was talking about computers.  I just put a link in the IRC.  You heard about the IRC.  You heard about the quantum computer story that I sent over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't heard about it,  but these quantum computer stories,  they're always cropping up.  I know.  Give us the background.  We'll talk about it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay.  There's a couple new developments,  but essentially,  without getting into it too much,  they're coming up with how to store data  and these things called qubits,  which is basically like when you talk about quantum physics,  you talk about probability clouds.  So everything is kind of a probability  when you get down to a small level,  which again is a very long discussion,  but them coming up with these actual qubits  allows them to store data.  And so now computers use data as ones and zeros,  and that's how we see everything displayed.  Well, these qubits can actually hold one and a zero at the same time,  which is ridiculous,  which means they can do computation at almost zero time,  like nanoseconds.  It can do computation of a huge level,  creating potentially like unlimited energy,  black holes and crazy business like that.  But they're not that close yet,  but the fact is that they got these qubits to work  and actually hold information as one and a zero at the same time.  And so it's a big deal.  Okay, next story.  Next story.  Oh, man.  It's really important to the face of the computers, though.  I mean, like how this story goes, goes computers.  Yeah, well, maybe,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  although I'm actually more of the opinion  that we're going to go organic.  What?  That's what I said.  Like a lettuce computer?  And I used to play Qbert all the time.  Qbert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Ethanol, ethanol.  Boing, boing, boing, boing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's called quantum physics computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak ignores the future, says some guy.  I feel the air just rushing from my ear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the last time I bring up quantum computers ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll go talk with quantum computers in the chat.  My head hurts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John, I will just blatantly rush into,  tell me your economic...  Meet computing.  Tell me your economic theory for tech recovery Q4.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, I think it's possible  that we're going to probably see recovery in Q4.  You can read my articles in MarketWatch.  I've long since forgot the details.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I Twittered it, actually.  Yes, you did.  Thank you very much, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Got a lot of attention  because people just think you're the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, well, thank you and ditto.  And I thought that it was really interesting.  No, ditto to you.  And then a few days later, what?  No, you're the best.  You're the best.  You're the best.  John, you say something now to him,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and within seconds, you go, screw you!

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I believe Forrester came out with estimates  the same exactly what you said just two days later,  that Q4 looks to be a turnaround for the tech sector.  I got some email on that end of thinking that,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  well, maybe some guy argued that the budgets are done

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  and you can't do that kind of thing.  Things can't change that rapidly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But most budgets, a lot of corporate budgets,  are really, they're over in Q2.  I mean, they don't end at the end of this year.  They end at other spots.  A lot of them end in the end of the second quarter of this year  and the third.  I mean, everybody's, their calendar years are all every which way.  So I didn't buy that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But is this you being contrarian  because everyone else is so doom and gloom?  No, it's not it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's because I have these theories about cycles  and it seems to me for things to really work out.  And I also think the tech sector leads  the rest of the economy that it has to happen first.  And I'm convinced of that.  And it will be determined by looking at the semiconductors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Can you throw out stochastics in this too?  Because I really get excited when you talk about that.  Stochastics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Once was, I remember when stochastics was the main way people were picking stocks.  That was you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was like that conversation.  It's going to be plastics.  You had this conversation with me.  It's going to be stochastics.  I never said stochastics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You did.  I never used the word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can tell you the bar where you said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you kidding me?  I think you were imagining being there.  Your imaginary friend.  Hey, Dvorak.  I would like a regression analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carlos, what else you got?  Back to the tech story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here you go.  There is one another one in REC chat.  Yeah, I see it.  Just what do you think about that 11.4% share to Firefox, Safari, and Chrome?  Internet Explorer losing.  Yeah, no, you're jacked up on this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think that Internet Explorer is losing a lot of market.  And the version, what is it?  Version 25?  What is the one they're at now?  I don't know what it is.  I mean, the bar version.  Number 18, IE8.  I don't know what it is.  But anyway, the apparently is a piece of crap.  And it looks like, you know, I use on the Macintosh.  I'm using a Mac.  I use Safari.  And it's actually quite good.  And I use the Firefox most of the time now.  And I rarely use IE.  Because it's always so susceptible to viruses and craziness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm just wondering because, you know, whenever we talk about browsers, we always go,  OK, well, just so you know, Internet Explorer is the leading one in the world.  And we have to program for it.  But now it looks like maybe the tightest earning.  I don't know.  Maybe it's finally getting what it deserves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, looking at the global stats thing that was actually run in TechCrunch today,  shows that, you know, IE is about ready to fall beneath Firefox 3.  Firefox, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought Brian Cooley actually made a really interesting point.  This is the first time in years he's been simultaneously using three browsers.  And I think that's much more common.  People are kind of all over the map in terms of it doesn't seem like it has to be an exclusive thing  for a much larger segment of the population.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't use IE hardly ever except when something automatically opens it and I'm stuck.  I mean, I could obviously cut and paste and go to something else, but I figure why not.  And I do use Safari for printing.  I think Safari's got a better algorithm for printing web pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you guys use bookmarks?  No.  I'm like so not a bookmark user.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use lots of bookmarks and I have so many of them that I can't find anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's my point.  Yeah, that's a great point to bring up.  I love bookmarks.  I mean, I have so much stuff that I work on tech and tech stories and stuff like that.  But I still need something that's awesome, some sort of flash even,  like little sphere that has all my bookmarks on it and I can get to them quickly.  Because yeah, I can't find anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But don't you just Google it then?  I mean, isn't it so much faster to Google something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but the problem is you have a bookmark you made from three years ago  on some website that is now so buried in Google you'll never find it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's why you tag it.  I use Delicious for that kind of thing.  I think when Google announced Chrome,  they said something like 75% of the websites we go to on the internet  are things that we've been to before.  And that's why they have that little dashboard when you open a brand new page  in the same way that Opera does.  And with that, what do I need bookmarks for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I use that too, Natalie.  And I've used it since Opera had it a long time ago.  But it's still not done enough.  I mean, I have like folders full of stuff, you know,  whether it be for the game show I do or the tech show I do.  It's just impossible to navigate all of it.  I don't know what to do with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think if you use an RSS reader, then you don't need bookmarks.  And I don't think most people use both.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do they?  I just can't keep my bookmarks organized.  I'm getting what you mean by that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a website I found that I just wanted to go back to once in a while  because it has some information or is a site that I can buy something from.  What has RSS got to do with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I don't bookmark.  I mean, you can RSS things.  What has RSS got to do with it?  I think that's my new ringtone.  That's a ringtone if I ever heard one.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I think Bookmarks is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, if I want to check back on a site that I use often,  which I'll admit is endless.com.  I go there almost every day.  What site is this you go to every day?  I'm being a total girl right now.  Endless is Amazon's shoe page.  Oh, my brother.  It's fantastic.  Sorry about that.  Something like that.  I can RSS it.  For news, I can RSS it.  There's nothing that I need to revisit every day, and I actually need to see the page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I'm not talking about using it for that purpose.  Yeah, that in RSS would make sense.  I'm talking about the you see this page, say, you know, I want to buy this Lamborghini,  and I know that I'll be able to afford it someday,  and I know this dealer's got the best prices there in Florida.  Why wouldn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, you're obscurity, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You trade in obscurity, so you do need to bookmark.  Bookmark it saying five years from now, I hope to go back to this page.  And, you know, and I know I'm not going to be able to Google it because, you know,  there'd probably be under indictment by then, let's say.  But whatever the case is, I want to still have the page available to me,  but I'm not going to RSS it, that's for sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Natalie, I gave you a YouTube video about shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.  Thank you.  Oh, is it Becky?  It's shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you have a lot of shoes, Natalie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So-and-so loves shoes.  What's her name?  Becky loves shoes.  Is it Becky?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's just a funny comedian.  It's really awesome.  Let's get some shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Kelly?  Kelly.  Kelly loves shoes.  Kelly loves shoes.  Oh my God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Chicks and shoes.  You have a lot of shoes, Natalie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  That's the one way in which I'm a total girl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, how many pairs?  Yeah, there we go.  Let's get some shoes.  Shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh.  It's one of my favorite things ever.  Mine too.  This reminds me of my pod show days.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  What is it with chicks and shoes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's the dude equivalent?  There's none.  There is none.  Baseball mitts.  I have none.  Video games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Video games for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe flat screens.  Maybe.  I get that.  Shut up.  Can someone please explain this Pirate Bay story to me?  What is the business model?  Yeah, let's talk about Pirate Bay.  What is the business model?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Napster.  They're exactly like Napster.  I don't know why they didn't learn their lesson.  They're thinking that if you upload a song and then I download that song, then you can  get a portion of that.  I suspect that the RIAA is going to have a problem with this.  At first, I thought they were just buying the name Pirate Bay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The backstory is Pirate Bay has been sold to a Stockholm software developer, internet  gaming type franchiser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He bought the brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  What is this number here?  60 million Krona, $7.8 million.  What?  Yeah, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's going to be Napster all over again.  Napster is not Napster, right?  Napster was something that created a new way of dealing with music.  It's a brand.  It's a brand name.  Yeah, it's just a brand.  Whatever they do with it, it's not Pirate Bay.  It's something else.  It's some sort of business.  I don't have any real faith in it yet.  I want to hear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's so odd.  It really is.  So we're out of stories?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that what you're telling me?  Dvorak, bring it to the table.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What do you got?  Come on.  I got more.  No, I have stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you want to talk about the over heating iPhone?  The over eating iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The over eating iPhone, ladies and gentlemen.  Is that when you go to a foreign country and your bill is like 60 grand?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I hate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that happened to Adam Savage, of course.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was interesting.  What about the...  What about the Napster's guy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he walked away, I think $11,000 bill because he's using his unlimited iPhone in  Canada where it's apparently not unlimited there, but who knew?  And but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Twittered about it and then got AT&T to take the bill back due to his...  See, that's what you need to do.  You need to play the same card that the Mythbuster guy did to get AT&T to fold and hook you up  with the cheaper iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the latest in terms of the Apple iPhone overheating, besides the fact that some guy  got burnt, is now they're blaming it according to at least one story on global warming.  Anybody get to catch this?  It's on the blog, by the way, if you want to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, apparently it will come out with a...  The screen will flash a little warning and say, hey, you're somewhere that's a little  too hot.  The iPhone can't take this.  But I think we should remember that it has a processor that used to live inside a computer.  So I don't know.  Just keep it away from your junk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The old high tech vasectomy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What kind of New York argot are you speaking?  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, Dvorak, I got a story too.  All right.  Close and near to our hearts, Ziff Davis.  Here, I see it.  EGM was a video game magazine.  Yeah, I am a nerd and deal with it.  And so EGM went under, just you probably heard about that.  And it was a Ziff Davis property.  Well, I guess they just gave the rights back to the original owner, Steve Harris.  So this is interesting because everybody loved that magazine.  I read it since I was like 12.  And a lot of people lost their jobs because this magazine closing.  But now, yeah, just interesting.  They're giving it back to the owner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sounds like a good deal.  Yeah, I know.  I don't know how he got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know.  No, we don't want it.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wasn't that the Skype plan?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice.  They were going to buy it back at a discount.  It's just similar.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just interesting because a lot of people lost their jobs over this whole thing.  And now, I'm wondering what he's going to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a story to be told there somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I wonder if people are going to start going back to it now or maybe continue to go to  it with the original guy running it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, from 1UP.com, a lot of people went off and did their own things like Co-op,  which is an awesome show.  So there's not a lot of people left to hire.  So I'm going to go talk to them.  You're going to talk to them?  Yeah, I think so.  I thought you were happy over there doing what you're doing.  Oh, no, I could do all of it at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  GDGT, do you go check it out?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Natalie?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did, but it wasn't open when I looked at it.  I'll have to go back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they looked like they had a massive traffic spike and then they fell off a cliff,  came back.  Veronica Belmont doing their video.  Super cute.  Reviews look good.  You know, I mean, the one thing I noticed is all the things they're touting in terms  of user interactivity, having sort of a library of your own gadgets and your wish list.  That's Yahoo!  Tech.  It's the same thing just in a way cooler package.  It was just really interesting to me to see everything old is new again if it's done with  the cool kids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's basically all it is is personalities.  I mean, it's just another iteration of in gadget.  Gizmodo and now it's the same, you know, and they're all competing with each other.  It's kind of interesting to see how it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there was this great one.  What are I producing this on?  We're basically breaking into the show floor at the LVCC at the Consumer Electronics Show  trying to scoop each other.  And they're just, I mean, the frenzy about the information and being first, it's weird.  I mean, it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the...  See, there's a problem.  I don't like your name.  It's EG.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is it again?  GDGT.  Four letters.  No vowels.  No vowels allowed.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of my producers on Loaded, Randall Bennett, left to do something just like this called  Obsessible.  And because he just didn't have the star power, it was almost exactly like this where you  could compare gadgets and talk with people who had it.  And they also covered tech news, but he just didn't have the star power behind it.  And also, I think this maybe looks a little bit nice.  And also, the name Obsessible is not great.  It doesn't roll off the tongue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The site looks great.  I mean, it was clean.  I'm looking at it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, what do you think?  I don't know.  It's another site.  It almost looks like a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not a blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's with backend software they're using.  It probably is a blog.  So where's Veronica?  I don't see her on here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  She's on the video portion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even see how you linked to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had to dig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  She says, girl, you have to dig.  She should be on the front.  They should put her right on the front, right at the very top.  She's great.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We chicks in tech have to stick together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You should be sticking together on the front page.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We should be front and center all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, seriously, you should.  I mean, just from the marketing perspective.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's, you know what?  Molly and Veronica and Natalie, me, we're going to gang up.  We're going to do our own.  There's a bunch of people you left out of this list, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Our own what?  Just so I know.  Our own one of these.  And we're going to have shoes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Carlos, who are the others?  We have Sumi Das that works for us.  Oh, yeah.  Bring Sumi on.  She's very nice.  Wait.  She works for CNN.  What other women are in tech that we...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we have Neha, who I work with in a show called Red on the Web.  Me and Neha.  Neha's awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's Caroline McCarthy.  Oh, yeah, she's great.  And Maggie Reardon.  Where's she at?  I was talking to someone about this recently.  I was like, yeah, you know, the girl version of tech, I pretty much have a hundred percent  chance of getting asked to be on Twitter.  So there's not that many of us, but there are some formidable names.  You know who's in one of my faves?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's above 50.  What about Mary Jo Foley?  She is not a gadget.  She's a gadget girl, but she is a star.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She knows everything about Microsoft.  Yeah, that Mary Jo's good.  Yeah.  There's a bunch.  There's so many CNN people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's about 50 high-end women that are all doing this stuff.  And they all, by the way, and guys out there, you all know this is true.  Morgan Webb.  They bitterly complain that they're not getting enough attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not true anymore.  What?  I think we get an inordinate amount of attention.  Maggie Reardon.  Love her on CNET.  Don't know who.  I don't know her.  She's good.  She does a lot of consumer stuff.  Isn't that...  Oh, yeah.  No, I've already given her her props.  I actually think we get an inordinate amount of attention.  Yeah, Knox mentioned Amber.  Oh, yeah.  Sarah Palin.  Oh, wait.  Sorry.  Sarah Lane.  Well, see, that's the thing.  It's like you can't play the girl card to its pluses, which is, you know, you get a  lot of free passes as a chick.  So you can...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, but you get a lot of short end of the stick, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree, but I just think you have to walk that line like it's a razor.  And I'll just say it like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You get a lot of flack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You get a lot of flack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You get way more flack than me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know, but I don't get flack for the same reasons.  I get flack for being, you know, opinionated about the Macintosh more than anything.  They don't say you're vapid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They say you're a dick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there you go.  Yeah.  I tend to think you're much more vapid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you take the buzz out loud emails, and sometimes I set them aside and I just realize,  if I say something wrong, it's usually in an email attributed to my gender.  Like she's stupid and she only looks good when she looks at the camera, and that's why  you chose her.  But Tom can say the exact same thing or make an error that's comparable, and never do they  say it's because he looks the way he does or because he's a dude or because he's a guy  or because of his age.  And it's supremely unfair.  Did I just say D-word?  I didn't mean to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what you said.  All word.  All I know is that...  Join me in the mail.  I think it's the only advantage us guys have.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  True.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  True.  Give the women crap about being women.  What are we even talking about?  I don't know.  You're probably still...  I'm lost.  He's still irked about the quantum computing story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an important story.  And I'm going to pound you on it.  Hey, by the way, me and Dwork did a funny little outtake.  We're at McCastello now.  Yeah.  I'll put the link in the somewhere.  I'll show you.  Cannot wait.  Anyways.  So, how are we doing for time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we're about to wrap.  So, you guys got any more...  Wow.  Okay.  What else do we have?  Going to my notes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you want to talk about the biggest Wi-Fi network in Europe is now in Venice?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, is it really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's actually a very interesting idea if you think about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, it's 10,000 kilometers of cable, which is about 6,000 miles for those of us not familiar

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with the metric system.  It blankets the entire city.  It's free for...  It's free for people to go to.  It's free for people to go to.  It's free for people to go to.  It's free for people to go to.  It's free for people to go to.  It's free for people to go to.  It's free for residents, but about $6 per day for tourists.  And it gets between 20 and 100 megs per second and it costs the city $15 million to build.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's all Wi-Fi?  There's no Wi-Max or any other...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All Wi-Fi.  Yeah, no, not Wi-Max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not bad.  Yeah, $7 a day to be a tourist over there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounds okay if you get that kind of speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  By the way, the chat room says John's only credible because he's sexy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, please.  Just want you to know.  Are you sure?  Maybe 30 years ago when I was a kid.  All right, is that it?  We done?  I think we're done.  Well, I have to say it then.  Another twit is in the can.
