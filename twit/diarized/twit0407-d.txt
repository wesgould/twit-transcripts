End time: 692.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Control the way people watch TV so that next time around  By the time TV doesn't matter anymore  It'll be you're used to seeing Microsoft controlling your television watching experience, but I look at that thing and I just think I  Barely I barely watch any TV and when I do it's all through a DVR  So you know it felt like they weren't really out there saying you know they did say specifically even though that sets a hard drive  And it will not be a DVR  No DVR 500 gig hard drive  Yeah, but it could control you know will theoretically control your DVR  But they were they were talking more about program guides  Yeah, and being able to walk up to your your connect and say Xbox turn on the sci-fi channel, but who can you yeah?

Start time: 731.52
End time: 743.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know it's I think when we talk about television at large when we move away from kind of the live sports stuff  Do people really identify with networks like who goes like I want to watch no centrals like no  They want to watch the show that they have already recorded

Start time: 915.56
End time: 951.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And if we eventually get to that point where it is all a card or you know if you're just buying shows one-off or however  That ends up working. I guess you know you could argue that Microsoft has covered their bases right there  They're dealing with the now problem. They are prepared for the future problem right and there's nothing to say they can't add DVR capabilities  That's true. They already have a hard drive in there  They will support external drives through a USB 3 port on the box  So you know you can you can size up if you like  But all the games need to be installed to with the hard drive to run and you know those are gonna come on blu-rays  Those those are not gonna be small downloads. That's an interesting point

Start time: 951.44

Start time: 967.40
End time: 990.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they're completely redoing the way that they credential access to games  You won't be able to put a disk in and play it it has to install to the hard drive  So at that point you have to be logged into an account enter a serial number it basically they're making it more like the PC  Which has been that way for for a very long time but even worse because apparently it'll recognize you right  Yeah, but the camera work recognize your face so it can automatically log you into my Jeff

Start time: 1041.58
End time: 1050.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And how that impacts used games used games now micro Paul throughout on Windows Weekly said that Microsoft confirmed later  That you there will be a mechanism for selling used games

Start time: 1050.82
End time: 1118.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They are not going to eliminate that right, but they're they so that was the the really fun thing about that whole day up at  Microsoft is so they had that event in the morning and then from there all the media there was doing different interviews with different people  You know Phil Harrison Phil Spencer collecting information. Yeah, so at the end of the day you start comparing notes with people or actually about midday  The message has completely gotten lost to where you have some people saying there will be a fee that you have to pay to access  To  Use a used game right other people saying there won't be a fee  Then they eventually put their heads together and said we're not talking about that right now  Already did too late  So you know what is that used fee if the disk is literally just a fast download and the data on it is useless once you've  Separated it from that key it holds no value  You can't go into a GameStop and buy it for you know  Why would you be why would you be able to walk into a GameStop and buy that for any cheaper?  Than they would just sell it to you digitally from the box itself  So I think that's the the worry is that yes  There will be some sort of access fee like the the online pass system that's that's been used in some games over the past  Couple of years, but that fee will just end up being the entire cost of the game major

Transcript:  I think it's a way. I think it catches up and and I think that you know the Xbox brand is huge  I mean you know that they are the the platform to beat more or less  So I think that you know there are a lot of people out there that are  You know like from my perspective like I want a wide variety of games  So I look at that press conference and go like you talked about TV for at the time  Then you mentioned Call of Duty, but at the same time. What are the most popular things sports games Call of Duty?  You know NFL  Partnership for fantasy sports that sort of stuff like they're making this very like

Transcript:  Popular broad device and they'll have the exclusive titles  I mean  I think it's pretty clear now that gaming is almost console game is almost commoditized where there are a few there's a handful of  Exclusive titles on each platform right and then almost everybody else including Call of Duty is on both  Yeah, definitely, so it's not you don't choose it by the exclusive titles as much

Start time: 1738.70
End time: 1780.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean unless you're a Gears of War fanatic one of those things that happens very early in a generation's  Lifecycles those exclusive titles start to matter more and because they need to sell boxes  Microsoft and Sony are a little bit more willing to open up the wallet and try to secure some stuff so but so far  That's mostly been  You know add-on content DLC like download stuff for Call of Duty will date you on Xbox first and then eventually end up on the place  They hardly enough to make you unless you're again a total fanatic, right?  it sounds like we're kind of waiting until e3 for this to be confirmed, but it sounds like the the next game from the  Original developers of Call of Duty that split off to form respawn entertainment that may very well be exclusive to the Xbox one

That's the Sony  Yeah, yeah, the Sony handheld because Sony is just pursuing a lot of smaller developers  You're getting like these kind of artsy games that you wouldn't normally see on console might be one differentiator

Transcript:  I mean they rebuilt their entire developer relations  Approach not too long ago, and it's been working out pretty well for them whereas  I think the you see the situation being flipped whereas going into the PlayStation 3  Sony was very arrogant. They were coming off the PlayStation 2. They were huge. They didn't have you know the Xbox floundered  They didn't have to worry about anything  This time you know Sony took its lumps. They've gone back to the drawing board  They're trying to figure it out and they're being much easier to approach and much easier to work with whereas  You know some of the developers I talked to are saying that Microsoft is in that exact same situation that Sony was where they're very  Arrogant they're like you need to come to us. We're not gonna come to you. Yeah, it's gotta be a Microsoft studio or nothing

Transcript:  No, well they did I have another question about that  How long does it take you to change your muscle memory?  Because I know for really good gamers most of it is you don't look down ever  So so with the touchpad, how much will that I'm just so fascinated by the learning curve

Start time: 1960.90
End time: 2007.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I just don't think a lot of games are gonna use that touchpad  Especially third-party games that have to appear on platforms that don't have that touchpad  So, you know, you'll see a lot of gimmicky stuff get thrown in but it's not that big of a deal over on the PlayStation 3  And Xbox the biggest problem was the triggers on the PlayStation 3 controller were really bad  So is where on the Xbox you would use the back triggers for aiming and shooting on the PlayStation 3  You would use the front triggers because they were just a little bit snappy a little bit easier to use  So when reviewing both platforms of a game that was the only thing you had to switch back and forth on  the sticks were a little looser on ps3 compared to the Xbox but  They seem a little bit closer this time around in terms of tightness  And I don't think it'll be as big of a problem this time out as it maybe it was last time  It was just a goofy thing Xbox looks pretty much like the old Xbox with an Xbox enthusiast now

Start time: 2008.34

I tried them all I tried all the solutions when I came to share file from Citrix  It was so great  I used to have there was one radio station that would just delete all the files as soon as they got them  I said wait a minute other people need these no  I'm gonna delete them they take up too much space not with share file  I have complete control over who can open it how many times they can download it  I get a message when they download it  I can password protect it if I want and and share file is designed for a variety of industries dozens of them the fact  If you go to share file comm you could try it to free don't click the button in the middle  There's a button at the top there a microphone  No, don't click no chat at the top there  See it says radio listeners that little team that one that little green microphone at the top  Click that one and enter the offer code tweet now one of the things you'll show you is  Below the offer code choose your industry and they customize this for a variety of industries  There's a reason for instance for if you're in the medical business you need to adhere to government regulations called HIPAA. It's HIPAA compliant  It's a compliant with regulations in almost every industry. So pick the industry you work in set it up for yourself  You can white label it customize it with your logo  People don't have to join a service or give that give up any information to get your files  They just go to a page with your logo on it. They click to download it couldn't be easier  It is the best way to share files  I do it all the time and I encourage you to try it free for 30 days buy Citrix  So, you know, it's built by business for business easy secure  It integrates into your daily routine. In fact, if you use outlook, they've got an outlook plug-in  That makes it look like email, but it's better share file comm  please click that little tiny microphone at the top of the page there and  use the offer code T W I  T  So enough enough Xbox.

It's more more of an issue for you than it would be for me  Nobody's gonna stalk me  But is that something you think should be considered if we you know, do we keep face identity off of Google Glass because of that?

Start time: 2756.98
End time: 2798.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, um, I guess I worry a little bit about that and I worry more for my children than for myself because I've already chosen  To make my face public but um, yeah  I had a friend on Facebook who put on Google Glass and put himself this week and said  This will change the way I stalk women forever. Oh, don't say that out loud. Yeah  Yeah, it's it's an issue, but you know what? It's just an extension cell phones can already do this  So, you know remember a couple years ago, we're talking about how gyms were banning camera phones in the locker rooms like  We get past it we work through it most people don't most people are benevolent with their technology  I would say I don't even well, can I assert that? I don't know that just flew out of my mouth

Transcript:  But then I'm gonna challenge you here and say that that we're allowing ourselves  We're giving ourselves permission to forget these types of things. I already forgot I were talking about  Remembering phone numbers, we don't really do that anymore  So now we're just gonna allow technology to tell us who is important in our lives straight  Force ourselves to remember people who may or may not be important because when someone says to me like where I'm interacting with someone somewhere  I don't know for a career event or something and someone says hi Natalie  It means something to me because I think they have bothered to remember my name  And when I go out of my way to remember someone else's name, I think that should mean something

Transcript:  Right, you know  I've been thinking about this a lot and my husband Clayton and I were talking or we were reading a lot of research about brain  research and how technology changes our brain fundamentally and I read Nick Carr's book the shallows and his idea of  Neuroplasticity and how technology is gonna literally change what we have the capacity to think how we think it  We're gonna not be able to think deeply and synthesize any longer  We will only be able to be capable of surface level thought and now we'll be incapable of  Thought that's so surface level that we cannot even remember the name of someone  So I think that that's what's so scary to me  But yes, we should see if this technology works and see what it can do for us  But we as humans have agency to decide this is not how we choose to live our lives  We will use it in certain use cases  But to walk around my house here when I have made you dinner and then sit down with your glass and interact with someone else

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm sorry. No, that's rude. But I totally disagree  I think that this notion that somehow we're gonna have shallower thoughts why I live alone now, by the way  To me to me tell technology actually frees me up to have to actually have more thinking about what I'm doing  I no longer have to remember the trivial  It's kind of like a calculator actually allowed me to do mathematics as opposed to long  Enabled me and and I'm not you know what the other thing that's interesting Leo you and I are somewhere around the same vintage  We have a young adult kids vintage is the right word and it's ironic and Natalie the relatively young adult  It's ironic that us old farts are actually we need more help the tech  Well, no, I'm just thinking my kids are actually becoming the anti tech people in this money and the older people are the ones  Everybody's worried about the kids being so plugged in but in fact  I ran into

That's just  Schizophrenic that they can't think in one way or the other and so you know  I read copious amounts of parenting books about how to raise a child that can think and  synthesize and a lot of that has to do with keeping screens away from them until to  Teaching them to take information and be able to connect it with this information, but do it themselves  Not put Google Glass on your toddler and say hey when you see that you can look it up  And you don't even have to remember that person's name.

How do you teach that now?  Well, I don't think that taking away screens from young people actually  reinforces  Or it has anything to do with that I think that  Attention now if you're using Google Glass or your cell phone instead of paying to your kids paying attention your kids  You're absolutely right, but as long as you're attentive to your kids  I don't I'm not worried about your kids  They're gonna be fine because obviously they have parents that actually care about them what we don't want to do is

We don't know and I hate to say it  I hate to experiment, but maybe we should experiment what we what it's also possible is that the wide  Spread availability of facts has changed what thought is about now if we have fact we are better able to synthesize  Yeah, then ever before I mean if you think about it before  Copernicus could make his observations about which revolved around which he had to collect a lot of data  Now the data is just available and it might be possible for him to do that higher level thinking without worrying about collecting data  I used to have to you know

Yeah, we're always worried about that  Check out this article you've probably seen at the touch screen generation by Hannah Hannah Rosen in the Atlantic  Excellent article about she is experimenting with her kids. Oh boy so far. It's turning out  I think okay, but I'm not suggesting that you know we turn our kids into guinea pigs  But I do think that this notion that somehow technology is gonna keep us from interacting with each other  Not true the airplanes are full of people who are traveling to be together  You know Skype hasn't prevented people from wanting to be in the same room  Hey, I drove out here from Palo Alto to be on your show  I could have come in by Skype, but I wanted that human interaction and I don't think the technology has really interrupted that I mean  We're always gonna worry

Yeah, I like Legos. I there's an example of a great kid toy a creative kid toy. Yeah  In fact, in some ways I bemoan the fact that you buy this kit and it's the Death Star because there's no creativity in that  Because you could just you should just build your own Death Star and it'd be really cool if it were active or operational  Yeah, yeah  So kids get on that  Let me do one more commercial we'll wrap it up. How about that? I bet everybody's tired and ready to go home  What do you think if you're in the IT business? You probably know exactly what I'm talking about  It's a job that never ends  But if you have the right tools you can go home and still get the job done  I'm talking about go to assist the ultimate the ultimate package for IT professionals because of course the remote  Package lets you solve problems remotely from an iPad from an iPhone  It also lets you track the problems. You can even see the problems before they occur  I want you to visit go to assist calm and find out more about this great service from Citrix if you'd like to become a managed  Service provider. This is the way to do it  I think everybody in the business knows about remote support. They have unattended support  You can do up to eight sessions at once you can find out what you know  What software is running on the computer and all of that?  They've added two new modules to go to assist that make it a full cloud-based tool set  They've got the service desk which lets you easily manage track and resolve issues  They've got it. It's a really nice service portal that's self-branded  So people can go and report their issues, but the monitoring this is what really turns me on  We put it on our network. It was pretty cool  It goes out and it finds everything on the network not just the hardware  But all the software on the network as well and then you can build these dashboards  They've got pre-configured modules or you can create your own that will alert you when there's a problem  You know this network bandwidth down the server down even things like the toner characters running low  You'll get an instant message or a text or an email you set it up exactly the way you want it  So you can be proactive you can solve the problems before they become big problems  And it makes you a support hero.
