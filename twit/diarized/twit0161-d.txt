This Week in Tech convenes now with an all-star cast.  Starting off with our good friend Jason Kalakannis from Mahalo.  Hello, Jason!

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, thanks for having me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Always good to have you. We love you, Jason.  And this is actually going to be another one of those,  What's Happening to the Economy casts, because Andrew Horowitz is also here.  From the Disciplined Investor podcast, the book, the movie, the audio book.  Hello, Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hello, thank you. And Jason, thank you so much for playing me in the movie, by the way.  I appreciate that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what? Actually, he could play you in the movie.  He has voices of a thousand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jason, can you imitate Dvorak so well?  Give me a little Andrew.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I haven't worked on my Andrew, but catch me again during the Audible ad and I'll do an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He'll break it out. He'll break it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no. If you want to have a good read, you probably want to get to Jack Welch.  And the thing is, it's frustrating because the people...  Everybody just... the government's going to bail it out and then it's the same story over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And the guy who recorded this little ditty, you may recognize it,  The Jeff Smith is now officially a twit.  Hey, Jeff Smith.  Hey, how are you?  It's so good to talk to you.  From his bar in Nashville, Tennessee.  Are you actually in the bar right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I'm actually in my studio, but I do have a Scheinerbach beer in hand.  Okay, that's appropriate.  Just in case we start talking about dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Actually, this is going to be a show kind of about bailouts, about stock markets, about finances.  And you may say, what does that have to do with tech?  I don't know. What does that have anything to do with tech?  Let me ask Jason Calacanis first.  Should we be worried? Is the tech crunch about to happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is going to have an impact.  It's already happened already.  There was a very wide open investment philosophy by VCs for the last couple of years.  Try a lot of things, put a lot of money in young people, less experience,  maybe give a couple million dollars to first time entrepreneurs.  You saw things like Y Combinator give $15,000, $20,000 to a first time entrepreneur.  The reason that happens is because you have rich people who are investing.  They're called limited partners.  And they have a little extra pocket cash.  Then you have angel investors.  The angel investor pool gets bigger as the economy gets better.  People are taking money from their houses and from their real estate transactions  and their stock market gains and saying,  gee, I've got all this extra money. What should I do with it? I should invest it.  Everybody thinks that they're a venture capitalist.  Then you have massive amounts of things getting tried.  That's why people go, who funded Dogster?  No offense to those people.  It's a cool site. I shouldn't use that as an example.  You start to see these weird things.  That's an example of a weird thing that's actually been successful.  Then people go, why does the world need the 15th delicious?  That's exactly what happened in the first bubble.  You have a bubble in terms of the number of people pursuing the same opportunity.  Does this look like 2000 to you?  You have to peel it back a little bit.  It is like that in terms of the number of people pursuing the same opportunity.  There's tons of copycat sites.  Everybody's doing a friend feed now. Everybody's doing a Twitter.  You see all those things.  But the difference is, the last time around, those companies all had $10 million to $50 million.  Some of them had $100 million.  There were hundreds of people working at each of these companies, thousands in some cases.  When it became apparent that these companies couldn't get funded anymore,  there was a lot of fallout.  The difference today is how many people work at friend feed,  or the 15th friend feed knockoff, or the 15th Twitter knockoff.  It may only be five guys with no office space, and five Arianchares.  When they go out of business, they just steal the Arianchares and go back to work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's been really good for the Arianchares secondary market, however.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just like it was last time.  What you're going to see this time is, instead of a lot of people losing their jobs,  you'll see a lot of websites go on life support.  Two people running a website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But you can do that. That's what's different. You didn't have the IPO.  You don't have the investors, the vulture capitalists descending on you.  So you can kind of struggle along for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Cost structure is totally different. You put it on EC2, and you set it and forget it.  You don't have a $50,000 office lease.  You don't have a $25,000 rack space contract for your rack servers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In a way, can't you thank the original bubble for things like EC2?  All that overbuild that happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. That's why all the fibers here.  People can say what they want about the bubble, but the fact is,  if you list the top 20 internet companies in the world on a global basis,  17 of them are American companies.  We overspent. We made a lot of mistakes.  And we took the lion's share of the market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, Andrew Horowitz, the last time you were here, you told me to buy dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, that was really good. We made a lot of money on that, actually.  And I told you to sell oil, remember that?  Yeah, you did.  That was great. Did you do any of those?  No.  Listen, my portfolio is number two on the MSN Strategy Lab.  You're actually up 7% this year.  7%, and actually in the last month we were up 5%.  Last week was a great week. We actually blew out of MasterCard and held Adobe,  even though it's been up and down.  But you stuck with Visa, I hope.  Yes, no. We didn't buy Visa. We shorted MasterCard. Visa was a much better company.  Jeff Smith.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff Smith says, yes, thank you.  Actually, in Nashville, they ran out of gas. What happened there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it sort of slowly happened, and I think maybe because I was listening to some podcasts  just about the doom and gloom of the economy that I kind of was keeping one eye open for this to happen anyways.  But they're blaming it on the pipeline down in the Gulf.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So it wasn't like a rumor, it wasn't a phony run like when Johnny Carson said,  you know, they're running out of toilet paper and everybody ran and bought too much toilet paper.  There really was, there were empty tanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there were. Well, I noticed first the map codes started going out when I saw like, you know, cash only.  Okay, cool, which is fine. I pay with cash.  Or Visa. Don't forget.  Or Visa. Right. They're safe and secure.  I assure you.  I happen to, I typically go to this one Shell station to pick up, you know, the odds and ends.  And I just was ragging on the other gas station up the road and he said, oh yeah, we're out of gas too.  Wow. Whoa. So the next day I actually saw a gas station with gas.  I went ahead and filled up and about two days later it kind of all hit the fan and lines and cops and everything.  And of course now it's coming in.  You know, Monday we should have everything back to normal, I think.  I mean, I got some at Costco today and it was a very pleasurable experience.  They were handing out bottles of water and directing you. God bless Costco.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Jason, should we worry about, I mean, it sounds like we can just hunker down and trickle on until this all blows over.  Will it blow over?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I think that there's a lot of innovation left in America and we have the freest flowing economy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, as John McCain keeps telling me, we've got great fundamentals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, he's right about the fact that our economic system, as flawed as it is, is the most fluid of any in the world.  So when you have a fluid economic system like we do for entrepreneurship where people can basically go crazy,  you have things like people going crazy on Wall Street giving out insane mortgages or the dot-com bubble.  These are like the virus strains of entrepreneurship.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But so is it a necessary consequence of?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It seems to be. I mean, you can't have huge successes like Google, you know, multi-billion dollars of revenue,  you know, many billions of dollars in revenue in just, you know, 10 years as a company.  You can't have that accelerated growth, that mad scientist growth without having a Frankenstein once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, but you know, let me give you the analogy here.  You know, you have a forest that, as everybody knows, needs to burn down and kind of, you know,  flush out all the badness and all the rot and all the problems only to really rebuild itself in a much stronger sense one day.  And that's kind of what's happening. Unfortunately, unfortunately, they're not letting that happen.  They're not going to let that happen. And we are in for a huge mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have managed forests. So you're saying the huge government bailout.  By the way, I actually want to ask you about it. Again, this is not tech, but I want to ask you about this.  This government bailout bill says there is no oversight by the courts, by anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Don't get me started here. I'm going to tell you something. We are about I'm writing an article right now for MSN.  It's going to be called something either King or the Empire of Hank Paulson.  This is going to be the strongest man in the world. Nobody can say no to Hank Paulson. Yep.  And by the way, you know, what's really fascinating, I find it so fascinating.  There's two companies left in the genre of gigantic brokers, if you will.  It's Morgan Stanley. And right now it is Goldman Sachs.  The fascinating thing is right before my very eyes on, I believe it was Thursday, Goldman Sachs went down from about 110 to about 86 within maybe two minutes or so.  And what was really amazing about that was that immediately when that happened, the circuit breakers took over.  Huge amounts of cash went in. RTC announcements were made. And, you know, the funny thing, you know what Hank Paulson's last job was?  He was CEO of Goldman Sachs. Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I find that interesting. So taxpayers bailing out these rich financial firms for acting irresponsibly in a deregulated environment and nobody can say no to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's terrible. Now they started with the short sellers. I have I got to say something. My fingers are bloody how much I'm writing right now.  But there are 799 financial companies that are on the do not short list right now.  You know, I think most people think that you're not allowed to short them.  No, this is a new thing. But what's interesting is, listen to this cow.  We found like 300 or 400 that are in the same genre that are about to be shorted short of quick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But Hank Paulson may come knocking at the door. Excuse me.  Excuse me, Mr Horowitz, you're not allowed to do that. And you can't stop me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In related news, the government's giving $10 billion to Yahoo to shore up their, you know, web search.  Yeah, yeah. Oh, they don't want it. They're just very scared that Yahoo may lose more market share.  Also, they're giving 20 billion to DEC to bring back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, I got my five million for podcasting. Did you get yours?  The original MP3 player is going to be brought back too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Rio is getting $400 million from the government.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'm gathering that you guys, Jeff, you and I will sit on the sidelines on this.  But you guys are both very involved in the markets.  Both of you are disagreeing with the notion that if we don't shore up the financial industry, we're dead meat.  You don't think they have to be doing this bailout?  Andrew, is it necessary?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It is necessary only in the fact that if we want to make sure that, you know, we don't have a terrible collapse right now.  But I have a question. Who said that stocks should only go up?  I know it's embarrassing.  You're saying we should have a collapse.  You're saying we should have a collapse.  I don't want to really have a collapse that hurts everybody terribly, but it's inevitable for what happened.  You cannot leverage and do what they did and what we did and, you know, like drunken sailors, I love Bush, and you can't do that.  And then at the same time, expect that on the back end that you're going to support it.  By the way, here's the thing.  You know, 800 numbers, I find this humorous, 800 numbers.  People say, I want to call you on 800 numbers.  Don't call me on my 800 number.  It costs me money. What do you mean?  It's a free phone.  Yeah, free, man, free.  Somebody pays for it.  Who's going to pay the upwards of a trillion dollars to bail out these companies, which is just an estimate, by the way.  A trillion dollars. Who's going to pay for that?  Jason, you feel the same way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, listen, I don't want to see anybody lose their homes and be out on the streets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So if it comes to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But we're not talking about bailing out homeowners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, part of it is, like, you know, part of it is the theory is, you know, don't let these financial institutions go out so that and buying these, you know, mortgages from them, you know, that's sort of the...  Well, for Freddie Mac, I can understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Freddie Mac, Freddie Mac, I can understand that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, but, you know, the point is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But, Meryl, but, Shearson, Lehman, I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What does this tell the people who behaved properly during this time?  Yes.  There were banks who didn't do the wrong thing.  So the banks who didn't do the wrong thing get nothing.  And the banks that did the wrong thing are now those CEOs and those management teams, you know, sold tons of stock, made tons of money, and they got bailed out.  But what we're going to do is we're going to turn the financial institutions into the airlines, where they just don't...the airlines don't think they can go out of business.  They're like, oh, yeah, we can just run this into the ground, keep taking our money out, and we'll get bailed out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's all about...you know what it is?  It's all about the trophies.  It's all about the trophies.  These days, I don't know how many have kids, but you take a kid and you go to the softball field or the baseball field or the soccer field, everybody gets a trophy, no matter how crappy your kid is at playing, right?  And the problem is that why?  Because they showed effort.  And this is what...I'm not even kidding about this.  The problem with all this is that no one's allowed to lose.  Everybody is supposed to be happy, happy.  And, you know, we have this huge problem.  You know how much...how we screwed the rest of the world?  Because the rest of the world really didn't use credit like we use, but we kind of gave them this little...this pixie dust, which was really a horribly tainted and toxic drug.  And unfortunately, the situation is pretty bad.  And it's so intertwined right now that some people are even saying that we did it all for China because China was holding $500 billion of our treasuries.  And last week, there was a day that it was actually treasuries were so inexpensive, T-bills were so inexpensive that we actually were paying to have the ability to own them.  In other words, the government usually pays, let's say, 2%.  They were less than zero.  They were less than zero because everybody was running for the hills.  And now we're going to be...by the way, today on The Drudgery Report, we're talking about bailing out the international banks.  And we also put a guarantee in for the money markets.  You can't do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We're really screwing with the free market.  And when you do...you know, it's very weird what's happened to the Republican Party.  You know, I don't want to have this dovetail into politics, but it can't not.  You know, it used to be about less government and free markets.  Now it's about more government and regulating markets and bailing out markets.  And this is, you know, the sort of...it's cronyism.  You know, like they're just taking care of their guys.  And there's no other way to say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, as a person who tries to unwrap my brain around this, could you, at this point where we're at now, just back out and not meddle so much?  There'd be a collapse, wouldn't there?  I mean, wouldn't it just suddenly break?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The Great Depression, the run on banks?  What would happen?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, that's what's happening.  We had a run on banks last week.  The money market, the reserve funds money market went under a dollar.  The Putnam funds closed down a $65 or so billion, some large number of billion dollar money market.  There is a run on banks right now.  Right now you go into a Bank of America, ask all the people standing around, what are you doing?  They're going to say, we're coming from Washington Mutual.  We're coming from Octopia.  So, and this, by the way, just to kind of bring this all around to all the tech geeks, which I feel a part of that.  I am one too.  We, you know, how does this affect me?  Well, how it affects you is that the money is going to be drying up on investors, as Jason said, to begin with.  And when you look at some of the things that are going on, look at Apple stock last week.  Apple stock hit $122.  It should be going up.  Why is it going down?  Well, because there's a lot of things.  One of the things has to do with consumers.  Consumers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they're not going to be buying iPods.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've been propping up the consumer for a couple of years now.  You know, these home equity lines, I mean, they were just, my mother got a home equity line.  I said, why did you get it?  She was like, well, it was like, you know, so interest and I, you know, I was going to help you.  I was like, you know, they're just selling people so hard on these things.  And the incentive for all the people doing these incentives on a street level are very powerful.  So when you take all the street level salespeople and tell them, like, all you have to do is close and you get your money,  then they just figure out every possible way to get in the system.  And all the mortgage brokers just all game the system to all hell.  Then it went up to their bosses, who then they game the system as much as they could in terms of, you know,  loosening and loosening the covenants.  I mean, I had people coming to me.  We raised, you know, a decent amount of venture capital from a hollow.  I had people coming to me saying, can I give you a five or ten million dollar loan at no interest, no covenants?  And so what Andrew will tell you about what covenants are, but, you know, essentially they're promises you have to make.  So when you take a loan as a business, like you have leverage, like how much money you make versus how much you spend  and how much money you have in the bank and your EBITDA, all this stuff, they would just like take the money for free at this ridiculous interest rate.  And I'm just sitting there like, why are these guys so aggressively doing this?  And I don't need the money.  So I just kept telling them, like, I have no interest in doing this.  And they just kept coming and coming.  I didn't do it, obviously, but money became essentially free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, as a layman, I was getting really the hard sell when we moved back to Nashville and we were getting a mortgage for a house here.  I mean, they were practically making fun of me for sticking with my guns and getting a 30 year fix as opposed to, oh, look at the rate of this thing.  You got to go, come on, go for it.  And I just, you know, and I could have gotten something cheaper for, you know, but I'm so glad I stuck to my guns.  But it was a rough go. They were really on me.  And then, oh, here's my supervisor. Oh, here's my, here's this thing.  And, you know, it was, wow, it was actually the most stressful house buying I've had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. So is there a upside to this for the tech industry?  What's it going to get? Paint us a picture, Jason, of what the next few years are going to look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. This is if you're an entrepreneur, this is going to be the greatest time to start a company because there'll be less competition and the best companies are built during down markets because that's where you can take market share.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Look at Amazon.com. They came out of the bust beggar better than ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. So, you know, for me, again, when I was starting this company, I raised as much money as I could knowing that this was coming.  And now I'm sitting on a huge pile of cash with four years of runway to build the company out, even if we don't make money.  So it's a great time to build. Weblogs Inc. we built during the down market.  There was no competition. The only people who wanted to pay bloggers were us and Nick Denton.  So that's when Engadget was built. That's when Joystick was built.  So it's an awesome opportunity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The prudent thing to do would be to build value, hunker down, don't expect to make any money.  Keep it going as long as you can.  Absolutely.  And how long? What's the time frame? Four years? Five years? How long am I going to have to have to podcast before I can make money again?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I think that you will build a major audience and it's going to be a tough market for at least 18 months.  So save every penny I make here.  It could be three years of this. It could be two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And the reason is more than just all about the money. It's all about that general complacency sets in when things are good.  It's too easy.  Nobody goes to a doctor when everything feels good. So now I'm seeing record hits.  As a matter of fact, my website is down. We launched a recent podcast today, the weekly podcast.  It's being hit so hard that we can't even get it to come back up again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, you picked a good time to be covering markets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I mean, I've been doing this for 20 something years. This is the worst situation I've ever seen in my life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And who do people go to when there's trouble is the gurus and say, well, what do we do? Where do we put our money?  What do we do with our money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, unfortunately, we have we have we have, you know, some people, I mean, you know, you get Suzy Orman giving out advice, which is Jason, can you do that invitation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Suzy Orman can do that. I bet he can do Jim Kramer.  Listen to me now. You don't have the money for a Mercedes. You have the money for a Honda Accord from 87.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You're only worth 32 million. What do you think you're doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Watch I go to TGI Fridays. Forget about the no boo.  So where Suzy says Suzy says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, we're going to take a break when we come back.  Brad Pitt reading audio books. We're going to talk about Jerry Seinfeld out of work.  Poor guy and a lot more.  But first, I got to tell you about Visa. Our great friends at Visa sponsor this show because they believe they believe in you.  The people and your wisdom and they know when you go shopping now, ever more than ever, you want to take care of your dollars.  You want to pay attention. You want to make sure that every time you go shopping online, it's safe.  It's secure. Visa uses very sophisticated advanced technology for real time fraud monitoring.  They prevent they detect they resolve online fraud should it happen.  And you're not liable. That's the bottom line. Zero liability for unauthorized purchases.  I know maybe you're shopping a little less online, but when you do or off, but when you do and you're pulling out a credit card, just remember Andrew Horowitz is short and the other guy.  You want to make sure you use Visa. That's peace of mind. Safe, secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All right. I get it. I've got to give them some credit for being safe and secure. No problems. They assure it's Visa. Visa. Visa. Visa. Visa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. Sweet sounds at Jeff Smith.  You know, I never asked Visa if we should use it. If we could use that for you have just spontaneously become, you know, you put that on your resume.  Oh, yeah. Right. I wrote Jingles for Visa. Yeah.  And that gave me a better answer right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Dovetail on this discussion about advice. You know, the fact of the matter is that it's interesting because, you know, when you're looking at mainstream media and you're looking what's going on out there and how how homogenize the information is.  I don't know if anybody notices this, but, you know, the cheerleaders out there on some of the stations and all that.  And, you know, I got to tell you, I cannot tell you how many emails we get in.  And because, you know, I'm giving advice. We tell you, OK, this stock is good. This mutual fund is bad.  This is what you need to be looking at. And I cannot tell you how good it feels, frankly.  I mean, and not to kind of get wimpy on you here and then I'll wispy.  But the fact of the matter is that saving people so much money during this, because nobody I mean, really, who's out there telling them, you know, where to go, what to look at, how to investigate their portfolios and and you see Jim Kramer.  Yeah, he's a smart guy. There's no question about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I try to watch the damn thing. I can't. It just drives me nuts. He's like yelling and screaming and banging on things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's definitely a smart guy. I don't know if I would trade alongside him, but that's because I don't have the stomach for it.  But to see NBC just seems like such a cheerleader. And then, oh, yeah, it's just like if that why don't they make that if it's dedicated to finance, why don't they make it intelligent and well thought out and consider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, because I'll tell you why the trend and you look at MSNBC, it all started with Fox News. The trend is to advocacy, not news anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's also all about the title. You know that when I'm writing for MSN or whatever, I've learned you have to make a incredible title to bring people in because link baiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, it is link baiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You spend 50% of your time on link baiting and 50% on the story. That's the problem with mainstream media. They basically looked at what made blogs special.  Yeah, they're gaming.  And they took, you know, they did this sort of backwards reverse engineering said, oh, you have to be an a hole and ruffle people's feathers.  And then they start doing it every story.  Is that why you stopped blogging, Jason?  Absolutely, because people started analyzing and people started crediting me with the creation of the concept of link baiting, which I'd never heard that term before somebody put it on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it's like, I think you, I think you though you have a, I'm not saying it's conscious, but you are very good.  And Dvorak's of exactly the same. Both of you have the same talent for hitting hot buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you have an opinion and you stated, you know, provocatively.  And well, Dvorak and I also, I think, are extremely knowledgeable of the spaces we write about, not to toot our horns, but we know we're talking about.  Absolutely. Nobody would read you.  Yes, nobody would read you if you're pure link baiting.  Credibility plus passion equals, you know, something worth reading now.  And most people are who have credibility or too scared to go with their passion because they're afraid to look stupid or something like that.  Oh, well, that's a big thing.  How many times have you said stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, maybe you're a little bit less caring of it because you're very, you know, you feel good about your opinion and all that.  But I got to tell you something in my business.  So many people don't want to put themselves out there because you can be, you know, it's one thing to say in opinions.  Nothing to say buy this or do that and then be wrong.  But speaking about Dvorak, by the way, we're doing a little conversations he and I that over at Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You did it. How did you do that?  Drink, drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Hold on a second. John, did I do that right, John?  Oh, he's at his son's birthday party, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's why he's not joining us.  We've been doing conversations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  We did one on his site.  And may I suggest that Harry Dent, have you have you listened to Harry Dent at all?  Who is Harry Dent?  It sounds dirty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It sounds like a porn name.  Not Harry. Harry.  Harry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think you just made the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Harry Dent is on my podcast this week.  Andrew has a Harry Dent.  Oh, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Big Harry Dent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And he he he talked about back in the I think in the 90s all about demographic economics and how the aging population is going to cause a huge, huge problem in 2000.  You don't dare say that.  That's provocative.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You don't dare say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, he talked about that.  He has a books out books and books and books.  His next book is called The Great Crash Ahead.  Very encouraging.  That's what Dvorak's been saying, by the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But he didn't think it would come this fast.  He thought it'd be 2010.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  2009, 2010.  But this and this guy is brilliant.  I just you know, if you have a chance to listen, I got to tell you, it's unbelievable.  Aside from the fact that Jason, you were brilliant as well on the show.  Just just really.  Were you guys just on a show together?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, Jason.  We did like an hour.  It was a good conversation.  Oh, man.  So you're just rehashing stuff you've already talked about.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, he was doing an interview with me.  So it's more like a primer.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But I'll tell you something.  It is pretty scary what's going on there.  But let's talk tech.  I'm so sick of talking about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, and I only and I agree.  Absolutely.  100 percent.  First of all, it's the biggest story of the last year.  And it does impact tech in the sense that it impacts what's going to happen the next  four years.  And it impacts all of us.  All of us have to think about, for instance, I have to think about, well, what do I do  with Twitter?  How do I grow it?  So I think that's a good advice, Jason.  Hunker down.  Spend as little as you can.  Build value.  Build audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The number one thing to do, and I'm writing an email about this, is people get very depressed.  And that's the other thing people don't want to talk about is the sort of depression that  comes with entrepreneurship and sort of national depression.  Yeah, we are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I was in Austin over the weekend and it was like everybody was quiet.  It was sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's exactly what happened after 2001.  One with the market and also 9-11 and also the accounting scandals, all those things  hitting at once.  Right.  And so what I've learned from this, and I went through horrible post-traumatic depression  after 9-11.  My brother's a firefighter and a lot of his friends died and I basically couldn't sleep  and basically dragged myself to sleep for a year.  And it was brutal.  And what I learned from that was the best thing to do when you have these really depressing  times is just to focus all your energy on the work you're doing and make something great  and really celebrate the small victories.  And so in your case with what you're doing with your network, every time you can make  the show a little bit better, the product a little better and some innovation, just  focus on product.  Because at the end of the day, if the product gets better, then you get more sales, everything  will improve.  And just stop worrying about the meta issues.  Just turn it off.  Don't look at Google Analytics.  Don't look at the stock market.  Don't look at all that stuff.  Just look at the product.  That's my advice to all the entrepreneurs out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Is this a good time to, I mean, this is kind of a little bit vulture-ish, if you will,  but is it a good time to find those companies that may be going out of business and from  a technology standpoint, they've got to get rid of their computers and their systems?  And how do we go about doing that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you'll just see that on eBay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So when Revision 3 goes, I should probably just go over there and get some of their equipment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that's a great example of a business that wouldn't get funded today and wouldn't  have got funded during the down market, but did get funded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And now they've got the money to keep going, but they should not be spending it at a high  rate.  They burn rate, you've got to bring the burn rate.  Everybody should just...  You've got to bring the burn rate, yep.  Because it grows, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Doesn't it grow faster?  In other words, if your burn rate is high during these kinds of situations, it can go  even out of control even more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just focus on the winners.  That's it.  That's what Nick Denton did by selling off some of his meandering blogs.  Because it's not the cost of the blog so much or the cost of the show that's not working.  It's the opportunity cost that your attention is not going to the winner.  Oh, interesting.  So if you have 20 shows, Leo, and it means the 15th through the 20th maybe are taking  your attention away from number one through five, which could be doing really well.  So you have to double down on the winners.  I should probably do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I should probably do that, but I can't.  They're like my children.  They're my children.  I can't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what?  Sophie's Choice.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's Sophie's Choice.  I love them all.  So actually, there are a couple of things I want to talk to you about, Jason.  We never did talk after you gave up blogging.  I never really asked you about that.  How has that been going?  You said, I'm not going to blog anymore.  I'm going to send out emails.  Is it too late to sign up for those emails?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  People can sign up for a tiny URL slash Jason's List.  I've got to sign up for that right now.  Yeah.  I got like almost 6,000 people in like six weeks signed up for it.  Why though?  Why is that better than blogging?  I'll tell you why.  I had the same 10, 20 people commenting on every blog post.  And most of them were anonymous people who either I had some run in with or fired or  something.  So basically like the 20 freaks and wackos that I basically have collected over the last  15 years of my career are basically following me around the internet and just slamming me  on every blog.  And it gets really tiring.  And I was like, where are all the intelligent people that I know?  And so I started the email list and I get 100, 200, 300 responses to every email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they're not public for one thing.  They're only to you.  They're not public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  And these are from some of the most powerful people in the technology industry.  Write me back a page.  And I'm like, wow, I am personally getting more out of this.  So what I realized was the joy I get out of writing is communicating with an individual  and then getting individual feedback.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a little selfish though, Jason, because you're not those comments are not now going  out to the public.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is, but those people are not willing to put their comments out to the public anyway.  And so what I'm thinking of doing now is, and it's basically collecting the best of  responses and asking people maybe anonymize them or something.  No, no, or just saying, yeah, exactly.  May I print this in a follow up email to my list either anonymously or publicly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Because is this in a way that kind of the, you know, in 1967 with the Summer of Love  1968 it all came crashing down when the reality of what it means came home to us.  Is this in a way that kind of crash where I'm with you and the initial flush is we're  going to communicate.  It's going to be a two way conversation.  You know, you'll write and people will talk back to you and you'll get this great two  way.  And then, you know, a couple of years later, maybe it's not been such a great exchange.  Is that what's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's collapsed on itself, to be honest, because what's happened is the social media  optimizers are now saying you have to basically attack one of the top 20 A-listers.  I'm using air quotes right now.  So the best way to get on, you know, the radar is to go onto TechMeme, flame the top five  people on TechMeme and just, you know, and so.  So everybody's gaming the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's again, it's like link bait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  You know what?  It's just not for a guy like me.  It's not worth it because I don't need any more exposure.  Right.  What I need is deeper relationships with important people or people who will be important or  people who have important ideas, not even to be like an elitist.  I just like people who have really something intelligent to say.  So on a purely mathematical basis, I am getting, I'm having a much better personal experience  doing this than I am with blogging.  And blogging, I was getting a much better experience than when I was writing for magazines.  And so it's just a natural evolution for me.  I sort of look at it as going acoustic.  You know, like I got up to the point at which I was playing stadium concerts and I hated  it at first, at a point because it's a grind and it's not personal.  And now I like playing the cafe.  Jason unplugged.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and it's Jason, it's like you're saying, like if you're hunkering down in this, in  this time, it's also good to get rid of the stuff that's just noise.  And if all that kind of negativity is just noise and you want to focus on your, I mean,  it affects me creatively when I've got a bunch of negative stuff to look at it, rather just  focus on the one or two things that I do good, which is make music.  It's true, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Performers probably had to deal with this long before any of us had to deal with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I deal with it every night because I sing to drunk people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right, let's, let's move on.  Speaking of drunk people, it's unclear what's happened here, but of course we spent the  last couple of episodes talking about the, the man love between Bill Gates and Jerry  Seinfeld and is that man love over?  Is that relationship dead?  I don't know.  I don't know, but it's not clear.  Microsoft is not going to run any more of those for a while anyway.  Their agency has turned to a new kind of ad, the response that everybody was expecting  to Apple's Switch ads.  I'm a PC starts with a guy who looks just like John Hodgman in a corduroy jacket and  khaki pants and hush puppies.  He's kind of rumpled saying I'm a PC and you think you're seeing a Mac ad and all of a  people all over the world, cool hip people who say they're using windows.  Actually, they don't say they're using windows.  They say they're using a PC, but who are these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because what you don't realize is a Mac is actually a personal computer.  Yeah, they're all using Macs.  If you are a Mac, then you are a PC.  I mean, who are these people?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's my question.  First of all, they didn't say windows, did they?  They say PC.  Second of all, is this an admission from Microsoft that the Jerry Seinfeld Bill Gates ads were  a flop?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It may be.  This is brilliant, though.  Listen, you know, help me out here.  Anybody ride bicycles?  You know, you ride a bicycle or watch the bicycle race and you watch those two guys  and you got one guy behind the other guy and he's drafting.  This is exactly what Microsoft did.  They're drafting on the ads.  They drafted because now we know they can't go in and they can't rip Apple a new one,  right?  It's a big guy on the small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It would admit that they're worried about Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Right.  But what they did is they took all the yes saying about yes, I'm a PC, I'm a PC and  all the popularity of this whole thing and drafted and then came and now took a little  bit of a move to the left and flew.  Maybe I'm not saying that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know what, I think, Andrew, that's a very good analysis.  I think that's exactly what they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But what's great about this is when I did radio show way back when, one of the things  they always said was if you want to have some advertisers, always get the owner of  the company to record the advertisement because they want to hear their voice over and over  again and they'll stay on forever.  This whole thing, if you looked into this I am PC and this was an I am PC dot life without  walls dot com, which I think what they're going at, by the way, even with that silly  sneaker commercial or the shoe was all about the fact that a Mac, when you get it, you  can't, yeah, you can't do anything with the Mac.  You know, you can't, you can't, there's no freedom.  But with a PC, you can take it apart.  You can put it back together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Everybody talked about the kind of the semiotics of those first two commercials.  If there was a hidden message there, it was so buried.  I don't think it was it.  It didn't come across.  It's not like America went, you know, like, like somehow subconsciously absorbed the message  of that.  Let me play a little bit of this.  This is I'm a PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hello, I'm a PC and I've been made into a stereotype.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a PC and I'm not what you call hip.  I'm a PC and I wear glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I wear glasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hey, I wear glasses.  I wear jeans and I study jeans and I design jeans and I design green buildings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's a pretty good ad, I have to say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Play that Steve Bomber one.  You see that on the site?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll find that one.  He says, I'm a PC.  I'm a PC.  I'm a PC.  It's very loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  But here's what's beautiful about it.  They have it so that you can record your own I'm a PC and potentially be shown on the  Times Square monitors.  And that's that's drawing people in who want to see themselves and the narcissist out there  and all the other people that want to have their five minutes of fame.  But more so, they also have a live stream of Times Square showing the advertiser.  I think it's a brilliant idea.  I'm not sure it's going to.  Is it going to sell PCs is the question.  Different story.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  By the way, a Mac is a PC.  Is it going to sell windows is really the question.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It doesn't matter.  It doesn't matter.  Yeah.  I mean, I think this is like Coke and Pepsi.  Like, you know, I don't think these things are going to affect adoption of the product  either way.  I don't think you know, I think for the incumbent, it doesn't make a difference for the upstart  Apple.  It does.  But for the incumbent, I don't think it makes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Mike Arrington said an interesting thing.  He first was going to pan the ad, but then he realized it made him feel like the Apple  ads were a little elitist and that maybe he wasn't going to be able to watch those Apple  ads with the same kind of smug satisfaction as he had in the past.  Does that make sense?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because also people said that the PC character was actually more endearing than the hipster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that was obviously intentional.  I think Apple was frankly brilliant when they made the PC sympathetic.  If they had made it a negative, Windows users would have been pissed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But this effectively killed the Apple ad in a way because now every single time the Apple  ad is run, you're thinking about this ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's Mike Arrington's contention.  Not only killed it that way, but killed it because you think, oh, they're snooty elitists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is like Avis.  They started that ad campaign.  So sort of this like kung fu of repositioning and advertising.  We're number two.  We're number two.  We try harder.  And then after a while, Hertz got a little pissed off at that and made it an ad campaign  where they're like, oh yes, people have been talking about the number two thing.  By the way, we're number one and here's why we're number one.  And they were just like total judo flip.  They're kung fu chops.  That's all that's happening here.  But what was the point of this?  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So is there a sufficient draft of this Gates Seinfeld stuff to make it worth $10 million  to Jerry Seinfeld and befuddlement on the part of almost everybody who saw it?  Or is it an example of Microsoft not knowing what the hell it's doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Of course, Microsoft doesn't know what they're doing when it comes to comedy or any type  of content creation.  That's not their strength.  But what the company did do, and I think it's a company that did the Burger King thing,  but they did the Burger King commercials, which are also like, what the frat?  What are the Burger King?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What are the?  Tell me what those are.  That's what that was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was the fake head.  Just basically the disturbing like horror guys.  Like it's the Burger King guy.  Oh yeah, but he's kind of really interesting looking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah.  You can't keep your eyes off of him.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of spooky, right?  But everybody talks about it.  Like what's that about?  And then these are the guys at Think who did subservient chicken, which was that weird  thing.  So they're really masters of creating the WTF.  And the WTF makes you go, gets us talking about it.  You pay attention and they get a lot of press from us.  Well, it is the attention because they spend X amount on the ad campaign.  They rise above the noise and they get X squared, X cubed, which is what I mean, the fact that  we're doing a 15 minute commercial for Windows right now by talking about it, mission accomplished.  So I think that's actually the goal is the WTF.  It's WTF based advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it got me interested after I saw the Seinfeld.  Now what?  What's the next one?  Okay.  Okay.  No, that wasn't good either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Okay.  Next one.  But you know, we got us watching a three and a half a minute commercial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Lauren Feldman actually nailed it.  You know, the guy from 1938 who does the it's really funny.  He he nailed it because he basically said Seinfeld was a show about nothing.  Right.  There are TV commercials about Windows about nothing.  Yeah.  And so they're just taking where Seinfeld left off and continuing it.  It's a commercial about nothing.  Well, we knew that.  It's entertaining.  It's entertaining.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Was that obvious?  Yeah, but it was entertaining.  No, it was obvious.  I mean, that's I can't think of any other reason to use Seinfeld.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, when you got finished with an episode of Seinfeld, it was about going to get soup.  But you know, and it made no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This was about churros and shoes and living with people with a little old lady under their car.  And it was weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was it was oddly compelling, though.  You know, you couldn't help but watch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it was not compelling.  It was not compelling.  It was odd.  Do you think there's some?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You had to watch it at least once, though.  I'm not I admit I didn't watch it 10 times.  It's not like Dick in a Box that I just kept watching it over and over again.  That's a that's a whole different story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They've got a bunch of stuff in the can somewhere that actually did go somewhere.  That's the question now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's been very unclear because initially Microsoft said, no, it's over.  And then the agency said, no, it's not over.  We're just we're doing something else a little bit.  Are there and maybe this is part of the whole strategy.  Maybe they just want us to say, well, where are the other ones and where can we see them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I talked to my some of my friends over at the mothership and they didn't seem to have much insight into.  They don't.  I think this is kept pretty close to the best.  Yeah.  Or, you know, I don't know.  OK, so I'm curious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What do people on the Microsoft campus think about it?  They must have had the same reaction, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What the I don't think many people were thrilled with the Bill Gates commercial.  I mean, everybody was wondering, you know, come out with something just grandiose and fantastic.  And what was that?  I mean, you know, because they've been beaten up.  They feel pretty beaten up over the years.  You know, with this other stuff, I mean, it's it's a bit humiliating at this point.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But maybe maybe they've done the perfect.  It sounds like they've done the perfect judic.  Should you move?  And they've drafted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or it could be the day the clown died.  You know, the so what does this mean to Yahoo?  But that's the Jerry Lewis film where he played a clown taking Nazi.  They played a clown taking Jewish kids to their death and were such an embarrassment.  It's very what you bought every copy of it and nobody can ever see it.  But it's supposed to be the most revolting piece of film ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, and when you're talking about Jerry Lewis's Irv, that that's saying something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. What happens now with Yahoo?  I mean, the icon was on Bloomberg or some television show just a couple of days ago  saying that this is more compelling and makes it even still in play now.  And I mean, Yahoo is in their shares are in the in the dumper and nothing's happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Let's talk about we're going to talk about the Google ad deal with Yahoo.  Mike Harrington actually know it's Eric Schoenfeld on the TechCrunch blog says the Google ad  deal will only make Yahoo stronger if it doesn't kill them first.  We'll talk about that in just a second.  But first, I want to mention our folks, our friends, our good friends at you know what I'm talking about.  Jason Calacanis. Oh, don't say it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Say the word. Say the word.  You're not going to just pull out audible, are you? Audible.com, baby.  Oh, man. I was I was playing poker last night. Yeah.  And I lost a grand. It wasn't pretty. Oh, no.  But luckily, I had spent a little bit of money buying some poker books on Audible.  And so I was listening to Ace on the River, which an advanced poker guide by a guy named Barry Greenstein.  And I've also listened to they have another one there play poker like the pros by Phil Helmuth.  I've read that book's great. Yeah. Yeah.  And you know, I like to listen to it because I don't have time to read all this stuff.  There's a lot of times when I'm not, you know, I'm online for a Starbucks or something.  And, you know, you got that little like partial attention for 15 minutes, 10 minutes.  It's just so much nicer to read it on your eye.  And you have it on your iPhone now. So it's just so simple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, you want to hear Barry's Barry reading it. You want to hear his subtle take on it.  Yeah, absolutely. I mean, that's the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  While you're playing, Jason, you could.  Well, I did that and it was actually surprising.  What I do is I keep it in my pocket. I pause it when I'm in a hand.  And then I, you know, but nobody sees me do that.  And then when I'm out of the hand, I play it because it's too hard to keep two hands in your head.  But then I came upon a really great trick that I do now.  If you are at a poker table in a tournament, I put on my headphones, but I don't actually put any music on.  And everybody thinks and I start bobbing my head like I'm listening to music.  You're not listening. You're not listening.  They don't think I'm listening. And they start talking about me in the hands I'm playing.  So I'm in a tournament. This guy's telling me, this other guy, like, what a donkey I am.  So then I was like, oh, I'm going to do a totally donkey move.  So I basically bet in, you know, at a position with nothing, you know, and I bet it down to the end and I lose like 200 bucks.  I turn over my cards and they're all like, they're just like, what is this guy doing?  And I just continue looking at my Blackberry and bounce with the music.  And then I basically got my kings. I hit my set. Boom. I wiped out two guys, felted them.  Boom. Boom. Beautiful.  A hundred bucks in one hand. Boom. Boom.  And that's all because of Audible.  And that's what Audible is going to do.  Audible is going to, this is the interesting thing. Audible is going to make you money.  You buy these books for 27 bucks. It seems like a lot of money.  You know, you win one hand, you make back 10 times that.  Hey, I'm telling you what, I'm going to give it to you for free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In fact, not only am I going to give you this to you for free, I'm going to give you two books for free.  What?  Yes, audible.com. This is a whole new deal. Audible.com slash twittoo.  The number two. You sign up for the platinum deal. You get two books. Two books. That's the platinum deal.  And you get them, keep them for, yours for free. Even if you decide not to stick around, you're going to stick around.  So that means we got another recommendation. Andrew, do you want to make a recommendation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I, somebody said to me recently, have you, have you ever had a book called the Reminiscence of a Stock Operator?  And this is a, this is a book written back in the twenties. And he said, you know what, before you say anything,  you really should, you know, think about how amazing it is that this guy, everything he said back then is so pertinent to today.  It's like, you know, there was this kind of interesting parallel. So, but it's a great book. It's back in the 20s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's from the 20s? Wow. Here it is. It's by Edwin Lefebvre.  Lefebvre.  Wow. And so you think it's timely even for today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, it's very timely for today because so many of the things, you know, what do they say, that, you know, history repeats itself, of course,  but, you know, more so that everything is cyclical and, you know, I just started reading it and I find it, it's fascinating.  I mean, just an interesting, interesting read. I mean, I think I told you about a few of the other ones I read recently, but this one,  this one's a nice, you know, it kind of brings back some of the, you know, realizing that we're not alone.  It's not, we're not, we are an uncharted territory on one side, but yet at the same time, there are some very tried and true,  you know, things that we can hang our hat on when it comes to investing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  This says it's one of the, one of the all-time great investment books.  Yep.  This is a must read from the 20s, reminiscences of a stock operator by Edwin Lefevre and Ace on the River.  Boy, now this is, there's a certain community to this, a certain, you're talking about stocks and poker, an advanced poker guide.  Two books you can get.  We need a cigar book, we need a cigar book.  We need a cigar book and we're set.  Perfect.  All you got to do is go to audible.com slash twit2, those two could be yours absolutely free.  I think you're getting a sense as you listen to these shows and you hear the wide variety of books on Audible.  I had no idea the reminiscences was on, of a stock operator was on Audible.  I mean, this is a bookstore, a giant bookstore.  You're back in call, you download them, you listen to them on your iPod, your iPhone, you burn CDs, you listen on your computer.  Audible.com slash twit2, we thank them so much.  They're supportive this week in tech.  I just thank them for existing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, forget about the sponsorships.  Just thank that Audible.  Thank God.  People.  Especially in these kind of times, right Jason?  Well, you know, actually there's something to be said about that dovetailing with the economic thing is if you're making any kind of content that helps people save time, save money, or entertains them.  I found those three things are very key.  And you know, you look at twit, there's a lot of stuff that you can actually apply to your life that saves you time and money.  We're essentially the vaudeville of the new Great Depression.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Come here and instead of looking at your portfolios.  I need some dancing girls.  Here we go, it's twit live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  See that's good isn't it Jeff?  Because we're entertaining the poor downtrodden masses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everyone needs a smile I guess, or a smile and a drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Do you notice, by the way, do you notice that in times like this that more people come to the bar and more people want to hear the music?  Except for this weekend when no one could get there because there was no gas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I haven't really noticed too much any difference.  I mean we're pretty fortunate to have really good businesses.  It's our third, me and some partners, we have one in St. Louis and one in Phoenix and one here.  And I did notice actually, it is interesting you say that, when we first opened in St. Louis the first few months were kind of slow because it was a new bar.  St. Louis wasn't really, it was our sort of testing city.  And we opened up in the summer and then September 11th hit and just we were like oh it's over, this is terrible.  And the city, everyone just joined together, firefighters came out every week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You wanted to be with people, you wanted to be, yeah you wanted to commiserate together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I hate to say that it took some kind of tragedy to sort of have our business turn around but suddenly we were very, we were the place to go.  And then it didn't go backwards fortunately.  What's the name of the bar?  The Big Bang.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's kind of inappropriate for September 11th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The first radio ad we did and I'd done it and it started with a big, like a big.  And I remember my boss was like you might want to lose the explosion.  Do you ever listen to audiobooks Jeff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, funny you're talking about saving time.  I was listening to that Tim Ferriss book, Four Hour Work Week.  Of course it took me like three weeks to listen to it because I really, I only, I do so much stuff.  I'm probably a bit like you Leo is that I say yes to so many things and I'm always recording.  I'm learning.  Yeah and I really need to, it would be nice to be more like Merlin Mann I guess but.  I admire him so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's backed off so much stuff and I just really admire that.  Can I tell you a story about Merlin Mann, a true story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah.  I was, I had a moment that I was so overwhelmed, just so overwhelmed with everything.  It was like coming out of, I mean it was trying to take a sip out of a fire hydrant.  I mean things were coming out of everywhere and I said I need help.  I need help.  I find myself being pretty organized.  I called up Merlin who you know I know him through different circles and things.  He was gracious enough to spend some time and it was kind of almost like magical just talking to Merlin.  Kind of cleaned everything up.  I don't know what that exactly was all about.  Yeah he's like a magic plastic guy.  He's our little elf of productivity.  Yeah he is.  He's just a great guy, a tremendous, just very soothing and just helped out and gave me some great pointers and tips and really kudos and thumbs up for Merlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You gave me a great article by the way on audio books in the delicious catalog Andrew that I really appreciate from Slate Magazine that says that with all the attention being paid to Kindles and electronic books, the audio book industry has been huge.  Fifteen percent of all books sold these days are now audio books.  One billion dollars a year.  This is a huge business.  Yep.  It's perfect timing for it.  They talk about sometimes you know you got to be careful about who you get to read them.  Sometimes they're good but sometimes they're not so good.  They have one, the article is called Read Me a Story Brad Pitt.  And I guess he's reading all the, you want to hear him reading in Spanish all the pretty horses.  This is from Slate Magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a young man accused of being a young man he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, very bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I'm rich. I'm a captain. I'm a captain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  He's doing French too because that's really, I tell you that is something romantic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey but Leo, yours were awesome. The one you played.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't know if it was awesome but I had a fun doing it.  I did a little kids book for when I was over at Audible.  How long was that book thing?  Oh, it was like 15 minutes. Took me about half an hour to do it.  I said I want to do two more takes because I just really wanted to work on it.  And I hadn't seen it before.  But it was really fun to do it.  But it's a little, you go in there, it's a little scary, it's a little challenging.  Because you know it's going to live on and you got to do it right.  I had three weeks I was doing my book, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Three weeks.  It's not fun.  And then retakes and redo's and it was, you know, and you get really self-conscious  because they keep telling you what a bad job you're doing.  That's right. You get self-conscious. Exactly.  They're very nice about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But they say could you do it this way?  Do that a little.  Right. Exactly.  I couldn't quite understand that.  Are you lisping? I think you're lisping.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what about those mouth noises that you're making?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the real question is why somebody didn't say, Brad, that's not Spanish.  Well, I don't know what that is you're talking there but that ain't Spanish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Reminds me of that really funny SNL skit with Charlton Heston reading the,  was it Charlton Heston reading the Madonna book?  Oh God. That would be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That would be great. I'd love to hear that.  So let's talk about the Google ad deal.  It is now under your Justice Department scrutiny.  This is the deal with Yahoo.  I don't know, is there something to worry about with the two biggest online ad companies,  the two biggest search companies doing deals with one another?  Is this something to be scared of?  Should I be worried about this, Jason?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should be worried about it if you're worried about one company owning all of the operating system business  on a theoretical level, if you're concerned about monopolies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The theory being that if Yahoo starts to cede some of this business to Google, eventually Google just takes over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, the thing about monopolies that's interesting is it's not illegal to have a monopoly.  That's okay. You can be the greatest pizzeria in your town and have 100% of the pizza market.  That's not the problem. It's on a legal basis.  The problem becomes how do you use it?  And if you do anti-competitive things, if you do things like price fixing,  if you do things like bundling or forcing people to do X if they want to do Y.  If you run Microsoft with the Windows operating system through that, obviously it wasn't kosher.  That's the settlement and also all the issues in Europe, which is a much finer filter than our government.  Since we're in a global economy, we have that as the first strainer in these decisions.  With Google and Yahoo, Yahoo doesn't have to use the ads. They can mix it. They're not locked in.  If they want to use their ad network, Google's ad network has more coverage.  There's more ads in there. If Yahoo doesn't have an advertiser, they can show a Google one.  It's more efficient, in fact. The fear, of course, is Google...  All advertisers put their ads into Google and then Google places them across the entire landscape,  which is starting to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Google says it's because of the auction system, they don't set the prices, so there's no fear of a monopoly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  50% true. They do put in a floor for how much you can pay. They've been raising that.  It used to be a penny. I think it's now five cents. Just the nature of the space,  there is already a floor of 19 cents a click or something, whatever the average click is.  That's sort of disingenuous. Yes, they don't set the price, and yes, the market sets it,  but that doesn't mean that they couldn't do things that would be dangerous.  When you see this power accumulating in Google, that's when people start paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Brad Smith, Microsoft's General Counsel, testified at Congress,  never before in the history of advertising has one company been in a position to control prices  of up to 90% of advertising in a single medium.  He says that the money Yahoo is going to make is going to come out of the pockets of American business,  big and small, who will pay higher prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not really true because they cannot use the service.  Now, they can't get the reach without the service, but...  There are plenty of other advertising venues.  Yes, there are other places they could go. They could buy direct from the websites.  It's not as Orwellian as they're making it out to be. It's certainly not anywhere near...  It's far from a monopoly.  Considering what Microsoft did with Dell and other people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's only 70% of search advertising, which isn't anywhere near the bulk of all online advertising.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the way it's headed, the trajectory is that a large percentage, overwhelming majority,  will go through Google.  What happens is advertisers are going to be lazy, and they're going to say,  I want to dump my ads into Google and then let Google do the distribution for it.  What that means is, they will get to the point at which they have a potentially monopolistic,  antitrust type of situation. You're seeing that already happen.  Google's basically...I think they've done a bad job.  I don't think they're a bad company, but they've done a bad job in terms of projecting themselves to the world.  They launched a browser, they launched a Wikipedia killer, and a Firefox killer.  At the same time, they're trying to do this deal.  It looks like they want to take over the world every single element.  Exactly. The browser was probably a mistake. They should have just kept supporting Firefox.  The NOL was a disaster in my mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We should say that NOL is a competitor to what Mahalo is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing about NOL is, anybody can create any page on Mahalo.  We'll only have one page about Audible, not 100 or something.  It's slightly different, but yeah, sure, it's in the general area of Wikipedia, Mahalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Jason, as this whole thing matures, as the whole advertising world matures,  right now it's easier to have a concentrated place just to put your ads.  I don't necessarily think that the Google ads...those are kind of like throwaways.  Those are the excess. Those are the pay-fors.  The problem I'm having with these...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They're not very foreground, are they? I don't know how effective they are, but I sure don't see them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The thing is, it's kind of like they're there,  because right now it's very difficult to get up to the change of the advertising department for any of these blogs,  especially the smaller ones and websites, and you have to have such a huge amount of downloads.  But I think the advertising world is waking up to it.  The thing that concerns me about all of this is whether or not Chrome is a Firefox killer,  and I'm sure you brought this up some time before,  this is really a concern that we have essentially an advertising company  that now has access directly beyond what they have already in the plug-in with their Google Taskbar,  but they really have the ability to monitor and really look at advertising or consumer shopping habits  to maybe not subliminally, but to put in a really good advertising campaigns  that will unfortunately understand our buying habits.  I don't know how comfortable I am with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They certainly know more about us than anybody, and it does make me a little bit nervous.  That's one of the criticisms of Chrome, is that Google can use it to monitor not only what you're searching for now,  but every site you go to, since the search window is the same as the address bar,  and everything you type in there is sent back to Google, they can actually monitor every site you enter in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Now Leo, did they do the Chrome because they were coming out with the Android, and that would be the browser for it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, no, no. I have to say I believe Google.  Isn't this funny, Jason and Andrew and Jeff, how we give Google a lot more credit than we do, say,  a company like Microsoft or even a company like Apple. We kind of want to believe...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's based on behavior. No, but it's based on behavior.  I mean, Google has been very good about their search results being equitable.  I guess. We want to believe the best out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think it's also partly because we really want to use them,  and the implication that they might be spying on us is scary  because it would mean we couldn't use the best search engine out there.  Same thing with Apple. Yeah, well, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We forgive greatness. Apple makes one of the most locked up product lines in the market,  and you have all these DRM heads complaining about everything,  and they're running around with Apple computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Talk about monopoly. If you buy something on the iTunes Music Store, you have to play it on an iPod.  I mean, they've locked that solid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you make an application, you've got to get approved by them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Oh, and this is a nightmare, by the way. The application process is really getting bad now.  I can think of two applications that Apple says, oh, no, that's our business.  One, a podcatcher, which is a very good program that everybody should have,  and I, as a podcaster, I think would be great on the iPhone.  They've forbidden because, well, it duplicates iTunes functionality.  And then another is a web-based email package that the developer says,  Apple said, no, it duplicates our mail functionality on the phone.  We don't want you to release it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Not to mention cut and paste, but that's a different...  Obviously, that's more difficult than saving the world.  Not to mention cut and paste, exactly.  But, Leo, do you see that news item that's in there about the deceptive advertising?  You've got to look at that, the speed of the three, quote unquote,  you've got to use the quote unquote, with the fingers, 3G compared to really the reality, the ads that show...

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I agree, because I'll tell you what, I'm using 3G, and sometimes it's slower than the edge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But did you see the side-by-side video that I put up there in that ad?  It's great, because what it shows is side-by-side, trying to have the commercial on TV  and actually click the same buttons at the same speed with your 3G iPhone, and it doesn't keep up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's because your mileage may vary, but I think that Apple would say, well, it just depends when you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will say that I love the 3G, because now Pandora works everywhere I go, which is totally cool.  Pandora, by the way, until they hit shut down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In stereo now, if you're on Wi-Fi, which is, I think, a big improvement.  Yeah.  So I want to mention this Chrome thing, and then we'll move on.  But I believe, again, giving Google perhaps undue credit, that Chrome was simply a shot across the bow  to other browser companies saying, look, we want to do web-based applications.  You've got to improve your JavaScript performance. You've got to improve your process handling.  We want you to make your browsers better so that Google Docs work better, that Gmail works better.  I think really that's as much about what Google's about.  And by the way, if you still don't want to use Chrome and you want to use a very fast browser,  use the WebKit.org browser, which has all the speed benefits of Chrome and then some.  They've got a very fast Java interpreter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use WebKit.  It's incredible. It's lightning fast.  What I do now is I use three browsers. I have Safari, WebKit, and Firefox open.  I use Firefox when I need to use the toolbars because it's the slowest.  And I'll use WebKit for most of my stuff.  And then I'll use Safari because I need to have two Gmail instances open and two analytics pages open.  And if you have in the same browser, it causes problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, I'm pretty much the same as you. I don't have the Safari open, but I use both. I love WebKit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Three years ago, I talked to Eric Schmidt and Larry Page at CES.  They had a little backroom thing with 10 journalists and bloggers.  And I said, when is the office, Google Office, coming out?  And they were like, we're not doing that.  And I was like, well, when's the browser coming out and when are you doing an operating system?  And they sort of laughed.  And six months later, they came out with Office, Word, and whatever.  Now they've got the browser.  It's absolutely going to come to pass that they will release an operating system or a wrapped version of an open-source operating system.  And they will give it for free to Dell and other places.  And when you buy a Dell, they will subsidize, because they're already subsidizing Dell's and stuff like that with the search box, right?  And paying people.  So you'll be able to buy a PC for, I'm going to say right now, 50% of the actual cost of the PC with all the stuff in it.  So if you think about one mop tap per child, they could give those away.  If it costs 200 to make it for 100 or if they get down to 100, they could get it to 50.  They could give away computers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And they make money by location based advertising and...  Just advertising in general. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if you look at something like, you know, it's interesting.  Bill Gross created Overture from Idealab.  He had a company called FreePC.com. I don't know if people remember it.  And FreePC will come back to you.  It's inevitable. The price of PCs go down to nothing.  The cloud is where all the applications are.  Every application and operating system is open source based and free.  Then you're just looking at hardware going down to almost nothing.  The tablet, they might come a time when you, you know,  join a bank and get a tablet computer for free, you know, kind of a situation.  Instead of the toaster. Exactly.  They'll be as valuable as toasters.  Where do you buy one anyway? A toaster?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, a toaster I can live with.  They're easy to buy a toaster than it is to buy a computer.  I went to three stores and where do you buy a computer anymore? Online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess it's the only place. Or a Best Buy.  I think Best Buy is probably selling quite a few.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I suggest getting a internet connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Best Buy just bought Napster, didn't they? Or are they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, they want to do a music store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh boy.  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What about the HTC Dream now?  Android, Google's operating phone operating system is going to appear any day now.  On the HTC Dream. There's a lot.  I'm looking at the phone, the pictures of the phone, and it looks pretty darn clunky.  But in a way, this is what you're talking about.  What are you talking about? Because after all, it's a Google operating system on a phone, location-based advertising.  Presumably they'll have a good browser.  Presumably they'll serve you Google ads.  Actually, they're going to charge 200 bucks for this. They probably could give it away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It looks kind of like a demented Zune.  I think it's clunky looking.  It looks like a very bizarre looking Zune with buttons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It looks, you know, almost to me like maybe the Dell Axum.  It looks like something that came out in 1998.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But what's the, I mean, where's the, I mean, how come there's not more concern over this whole thing?  I mean, could it run on anything?  For Google?  Yeah, I mean, it seems like everybody is thinking, ah, it's really not going to happen.  And if it does, it's not a big deal.  And I mean, is this going to be, it doesn't just need more of a WiMAX.  I mean, what's, Google stock is not doing anything exciting because of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Google is basically placing a bunch of bets on their second act.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Ah, waiting to see which one takes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. So, you know, none of these projects will move the needle for Google because their original business, their cash machine, they have this, you know, when you think about businesses, it's helpful to just think about it.  Imagine like a huge hanger, like an airplane hanger with a big machine that's five stories high that's just printing money.  Right. Microsoft had one of those. Google had one. AOL had one with subscription revenue.  And so inside these big companies, you have this huge machine that's out of control and money just comes flying out of it.  And then they try to build other little machines in the hanger next door that eventually could be that big.  And so all of these projects, that's what it is.  Just trying to see if there's another huge money making machine, a second hit they could do.  And most companies never make a second money making machine.  They usually just work that money making machine until it breaks down like AOL's with subscription revenue is breaking down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So they're really doing something very smart.  They're saying not only do we are we looking for a second act, but we're going to cast our net as wide as possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Absolutely. Operating system, you know, browser.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And not only that, encourage our employees, give them 20 percent of their time to work on blue sky stuff, hoping that some of that might produce.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But if any other company did this, if any other major company did this, if you had an advertising company, you know, one of the biggest advertisers, because Google is an advertising company, in my opinion.  I mean, that's what they are. Of course. Of course.  If you have if you have any of these major advertising companies around the country, I mean, whatever one, all of a sudden starting to, you know, put out an you know, an OS or putting out a phone or I mean, people would be crazy.  What is wrong with you? Why are you getting out of your core competency? What are you doing?  I mean, why? You know, but but but for some reason we all tolerate it from Google because we've been Google eyes or something.  You know, it was OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  OK, well, that's because they make awesome products, right, that we use every day and they make a lot of money for shareholders.  Which ones are those? OK, search the ad network search ad network Gmail and you click on the you click on YouTube and YouTube.  I've clicked on ads before. Most people click on ads don't know they're clicking on ads, but that's a whole nother episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know where we make you know where we make I only have Google ads in one place. I've tried them on the front pages.  They don't really make much money. They make you know, the click through rate is almost 70 percent on search.  So when you search for something on our sites, it does a Google search because they do the better search, frankly, than the than the than the client software.  And you get a Google ad on top of it and people click those ads because they don't know that that's an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You go to ask what a ask dot com. If you look at ask dot com, I have a user lab at Mahalo where we like watch people use the Internet.  And we asked them in the user lab, show us what the ads are after they've done stuff on ask dot com.  Like nobody knows their ads because they put them in the lightest shade. And so when people.  Oh, yeah, look at that. It's so and it's so hard to mix the results with ads.  Absolutely. So when you look at it, I just did a search. Everybody go to ask dot com.  Look at iPod. The first couple of things that's comparison shopping. It's unlabeled.  Then you see official store iPod. Right. Those are sponsored. You can see the great text.  If you're on a map, you can't even see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Look at that. You got to kind of move your eyes and see that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. Yeah. One, two, three. I think the first seven or eight links are ads.  Then if you go to the bottom, the last four or five or last five are ads.  And then so what happens is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, but are they making any money?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, yes. And the thing about the brilliance of it is.  Who uses ask for search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Here's the funniest thing. These are Google ads.  And you they have a deal, I guess, to not label them properly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, because you're supposed to say that's a Google ad, right?  Well, they don't have to. They just have to label a sponsor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I think that's why they have a sponsored results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, the sponsor result is in minus three font.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. And you would never know it's an ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And when we show this to people in the lab, they don't know it's an ad.  So but and why does it matter?  Because they're going to Circuit City slash iPod.  They're looking for that anyway. Yeah.  Looking for that anyway.  So when you see a company like Ask spent one hundred million dollars  and you're like, I don't understand the commercials, it's like, well,  everybody who comes to the site is monetized.  I bet you 50, maybe 75 percent of people who come to an Ask page click on an ad.  Huge click through. So what did you say their percentage?  What did you say their percentage of search results?  Ask is three or four percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So that's it sounds like nothing  that makes it like a five billion dollar market cap company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Every share of search is worth a billion dollars.  Unbelievable.  If you can come out of Twit, Leo, it's not this quality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's not the quality, but a lot more money.  Well, that's why you see like, you know, cool with a search engine backed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, whatever happened to that, that was a quick and burn.  You know, being in the search base is a long heart.  Basically, it's a five year project to try to get one percent of market share,  two percent of market share.  But that's a couple of billion.  Exactly. And you see where you go from there.  But you have Hakee, which was doing interesting stuff.  Cool, which is doing interesting stuff.  Power set, which was bought.  You know, I mean, you're talking about hundreds of millions of dollars  are being invested in this because of that one percent promise.  That slice. You just want that slice.  You don't need the pie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We have four point six million people in August.  You know, it's that's actually huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. But you know, that's unique.  Four point six million unique.  Record month in August, four point six million.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So on Mahalo, do you share like, for example, my page on Mahalo,  do you do you share Lincoln?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I hit information on that.  Is that is that kind of stuff available for people?  No, we I'm sort of a privacy advocate,  so we don't record any of the searches or any of that kind of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  As a matter of fact, I'm going to make it part of the marketing campaign.  And I'm going to try to have to talk to lawyers about this,  see if we can move to a system where we don't record IP address activity.  I mean, we do it for when people post comments and stuff like that for spam.  But I'm trying to think about if we can actually maybe set a new precedent  of never recording anything, you know, and make a business out of it.  So we're going to get back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We're going to get back, Andrew, in just a second to your your story  from the Silicon Alley insider on the iPhone 3G.  And the fact that fewer people are using it, AT&T says much like the iPhone 3G,  that fewer people are using it, AT&T says much less bandwidth than we expected  because according to Henry Blodgett, this is so crappy.  What is going on with Apple's 3G iPhone?  We'll talk about that in just a second.  Before we do this show brought to you by GoToMeeting.  Now, you guys all do business meetings.  I'm sure, Jason, you know, you got you're going to get the Tesla.  You probably will want to drive to business meetings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I will drive to some business meetings in that car. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  In that car. Sure. Why not?  There's certainly a time when you think it's going to be a better idea not to drive around.  Save the gas. Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'd like to do it from my office, but that's not possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes, it is. That's the beauty.  GoToMeeting makes online meetings not only easy to do, but really engaging.  If you've if you've ever had a conference call and you're sitting on the conference call  and you just know you could tell when the guy starts playing solitaire or surfing or checking his email  because he just kind of you don't have to hear anything.  Just know he's not there. He's not paying attention.  So you need a way to engage him on these conference calls.  And that's what GoToMeeting does.  GoToMeeting lets them see your computer desktop on their computer screen.  So they're seeing your PowerPoint. They're seeing your presentations.  You can collaborate on documents. You can even do training.  You could even do that that kind of user measurements that you're talking about by saying, OK, you click this page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, tell me what you see. Yeah, we should we could do we could do user labs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You could do a user lab. This is how good this is.  If you've never you know, there are other companies doing this.  And, you know, I want you to try the other ones.  But I want you to also try GoToMeeting because I know we're going to win.  30 days absolutely free. A month of unlimited online meetings.  You show the boss. Do it with some clients.

It changes the way we do business.  30 days free. Go to GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  30 days absolutely free.  And I think you'll agree online meetings are made so much easier, so much effective, more effective with a GoToMeeting.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.  I'm going to actually check real quickly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Go to. You know, Leo, what's interesting, the old days, you know, we used to use the various desktop clients like this.  And it was kind of, you know, it's choppy, right?  You know, you go on and you see 256 at best colors.  But you know, I think I think a lot of people, because I introduced this to a few people and they're amazed.  They're like, well, we stopped using that kind of technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Right. Because we tried remote access. It was awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah. But these days it's it's it's almost like a pass through.  It's unbelievable with a reasonable Internet connection of any sort.  You know, you get this great connection and it's almost like you're, you know, especially when you go to a full screen mode.  It's like right there. I know it's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I did I was working on a speech. Actually, Jason, I thank you, you son of a because.  Yeah, you mean. Yeah, thank you so much, Jason.  So Jason gave a speech a couple of years in a row to the National Association of Broadcasters Radio Show.  Yes. For Jacobs. And I guess you're a little tired of it.  I don't know why, but you said, let my friend Leo do it.  So you sicked him on me. Actually went really well.  I was there. I just got back. I was there in Austin on Friday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a good group of people. I mean, those are really like the guys who are making it happen in radio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, they're the guys I need to talk to, because, of course, I'm trying to syndicate my show.  You know, we're in 61 markets, but I want to get in a hundred sixty one.  And I thanks to you, I was able to talk to some of the biggest executives in broadcasting who, by the way, love the show.  They've never heard of Twitter. They've never heard of netcasts, but they love the radio show.  So I think we're going to be able to get into those markets. Thanks to you, Jason.  But the bottom line was, is we use GoToMeeting to plan the speech.  Because we did I did a talk with them that's called 60 ideas in 60 minutes.  So you get one minute each. And we had we really had to rehearse.  And there was no way we could have done that without meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, you know what? We were doing the TechCrunch 50 conference.  I interviewed 250 companies and I gave them each 10 minutes to do like a, you know, a GoToMeeting.  And some of you, some of. Yeah. And I sat through 250 of these.  It took three. It took almost three weeks.  But, you know, that's why the show was so great and had 50 really great companies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hey, let me ask you about TechCrunch 50. First of all, you've sobered up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We use GoToMeeting. I just want to make sure that people know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  GoToMeeting was the technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it worked flawlessly. So I have actually used the service.  I use the service all through August and I use the other competitors.  I have to say GoToMeeting is the best.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, there's big companies own the other ones.  But GoToMeeting really is they you know why Citrix actually had a lot to do with.  Yeah, they got a lot and a lot of good infrastructure. But anyway, yeah.  Citrix is good. So you've you've you've everything's good now.  We gave you a little hard time last week on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I heard it. I heard it. I was listening to it on the treadmill.  I mean, like you notice Kevin Rose shut up during that discussion.  Yeah, because he's been. He's been caught so many times he can't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's been in ValleyWag more than a few times.  And I admit they're not the bastion. I even said it of credibility.  But you did Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was listen, I don't drink. People know that I'm not like a big drinker.  I mean, I do like a little.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You don't drink or you're not a big drinker. Which is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I like a McCallan 1825 once in a while.  I will give you that and I will take a Monte Cristo number for Havana.  Oh, baby. Yeah. I'm just saying that's how I roll.  But so Mark Cuban comes to the show.  So he's a friend of mine. He's an investor in Mahalo.  He was an investor in WebLogs Inc. I've known him for 10 years.  We're good friends. So I asked him to come to the show last year and last minute he bowels.  So I look like an idiot to my partner on the conference, my guarantee.  He's like, oh, you have no credit. And he's busting my chops about it.  And I was like, listen, he's doing Dancing with the Stars. He can't come.  He's like, oh, he picked Dancing over you and whatever.  So Mark was like, he's a real man.  She's like, I guarantee I'll be there next year. Do not worry.  So he comes. And what's cool about Mark is he stays for the whole show.  So he was a judge for the morning session.  Then he hung out, looked at all the companies in the demo pit.  And then we had a couple. Then there was like semantic.  They had a really cool party and I had to be the emcee.  And they had Jabberwockies, this great dance troupe.  And everybody's like, oh, the show is going so great. Congratulations.  And we're two days in the show. Oh, have a shot. Here's a lemon drop.  And there's lemon drops. It was hot.  And the lemon drops taste like lemonade.  And you start like the sixth or seventh lemon drop.  And they're not as innocent sounding. They're not as innocent as they sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No.  It's a little lemon drop. Just a little lemon, a little drop of lemon.  I'm like, okay, I'm going to drop a lemon.  It was fun. You know that moment when the world just goes, whoof.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we're at the after party at the hotel lobby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it is just like people are going crazy.  And people are having shots.  And Cuban's there. And this person's there.  And Phil Kaplan from Ed Brite. Everybody's there.  And all of a sudden I just, whoof, I had this moment.  I look at my watch and I'm like, oh my God, it's one o'clock.  So I just Twitter like, yo, guys, I am not going to be there in the morning.  See, there's your mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I don't even know what city I'm in, you know.  Twitter, not the best way to disseminate that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I didn't think anybody would read it.  Yeah, of course not.  Except for the 34,000 people following me.  But that just gives you an indication of how lit I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And so whatever, you know, I basically, I got there for, I got there an hour late.  Mike was supposed to host that morning anyway, and it became a funny joke.  And it actually brought more attention to the show and the 50 companies.  So, you know, listen, I like to have a good time.  I don't have a drinking problem. I know people are bringing that up.  I do have a poker problem.  He admits it. He has a Tesla problem.  Yes, I have a conspicuous consumption of car problem.  And I have a poker problem.  So if you'd like to nail me on that, that's fine.  You know, the amount.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I've been around you, Jason. I've never seen you drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The amount of like alcohol I've consumed would add one day to like, you know, the average rock star's life.  You know, literally, that's how much I've had in a lifetime.  So let's all calm down about it.  I'm just glad you're having a good time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And it sounds like TechCrunch 50 went well.  You guys are not going to do it on the same day as demo next year, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, we didn't want to do it the same day as demo this year.  And there was a lot of theatrics about the competition.  But the truth is they moved their event up three weeks and we already had our space.  Oh, interesting.  So we announced after them, but it wasn't like we did it on purpose.  But we didn't move it to, you know, avoid it because we had the space we wanted to use and whatever.  But I emailed Chris Shipley and was like, hey, Chris, congratulations on a great show.  She had a great show. It was a record year for them, too.  There's room for both.  Yeah. And our show was so much better and much better companies.  And we had 2000 people and 5000 people watching the live stream concurrently at the peak.  So, you know, and we had the much better companies because I would say 10 of the 50 companies were demo companies.  They had acceptance letters and they sent us the acceptance letters.  We looked at them and we approved them.  So what entrepreneur is going to pay $20,000 to be in San Diego?  It's free to be in TechCrunch. Yeah.  Free to be a TechCrunch. And we had 2000 people at our event.  I mean, it was huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so, Jason, what happened with I saw something about a disqualification due to Chip and somebody who's gaming the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, so we have this thing. We had over 1000 people applied.  50 people made it to the main stage.  There are 150 companies that are really good, you know, who are the companies after the 50.  So what we do is we invite them to come to the show.  We give them like half price.  We give them instead of a $3,000 ticket, $1,000 ticket, which is essentially our cost.  We give them a free table, internet connection, electricity to set up.  And it's sort of like you just open your laptop on a little cocktail table.  And those are called the demo pick companies. And then to make it even more fun, we give people poker chips and they can go, the attendees, and they go look at the demo companies and they put a poker chip in.  They can they can give one of their poker chips to each company every day.  And so that incentivizes them to go look at the companies. It gets them a lot of traffic.  So the demo pick companies love it. Whoever gets the most chips we put on stage.  And so then one company put a bunch of girls in like ridiculous stripper dresses, like really offensive dresses.  And I don't want to single them out or whatever, but like, you know, like dresses that are so skin tight and ridiculous that they leave nothing to the imagination.  And, you know, that's fine if you're doing a car show. It's not very cool at an internet show.  I mean, there are women in the industry who kind of like have worked hard, you know, whatever.  Anyway, I don't want to get into a whole gender thing.  But so then they go around with signs like give us your chips.  So they're not even demoing the product. They just were collecting chips from, you know, guys that sit at tables and trying to like convince them to give chips.  And then two other companies, I think, were taking all their chips and putting them together, which was against the rules.  It just became gaming, you know, like we're talking about the financial market.  So I just made an executive decision. I just said executive decision.  I made an executive decision. Guess what? It's unethical. My show with Mike, we decided you're out.  And if you don't like it, that's fine. But, you know, you know, that's it.  I think it's a big deal. Yeah, I think it's fair.  And, you know, the company that went up, there was a really great company.  We had like seven Israeli companies out of 50. It was amazing.  But I'm really proud of the show. You know, we had a lot of people who were underfunded or just I do.  You know, the show makes a little bit of money. It takes a month of my time and I do all the rehearsals with the 50 companies.  I do it with each company for a mandatory two rehearsals.  Most of them I do three, four, five rehearsals with, 45 minutes each. I mean, I till I lose my voice.  The reason I do this is because as an outsider, I was an outsider in the industry, as most people know,  and I couldn't get any meetings. I couldn't get on stage.  People didn't even want me at their conferences, frankly, you know, like I was like a pariah because of my attitude, you know, and my sort of vocalness.  And, you know, this show, we've created a platform. It's like Sundance.  You know, anybody who's got a great film can present.  And now we've got all these companies that, you know, can't afford demo or can't afford to pay off another conference to get on stage for six minutes.  And it's it's a real mitzvah, I think, you know, like it's good for the industry.  A mitzvah. Ay, vey, you're such a good, ay, my sheynavel to Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm just saying, but it's a mitzvah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff and I are feeling left out. Do you mind?  Spilkes.  People don't know how I've got Spilkes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm getting Veklem. That's a great episode.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So the winner, the winner was Yammer. Yammer.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was very close. Good. Good guide was second, I think.  And, you know, Yammer is essentially Twitter for organizations.  So you sign up and if you have like, you know, at Mahalo or at, you know, twitlive.tv or at devorek.org as your email address, you can join your network.  And it's a private Twitter network for business.  So we, yes, and it's awesome because people use hashtags.  So instead of asking you, what are you doing right now?  It says, what are you working on?  So everybody at Mahalo checks in two or three times a day what they're working on.  But they use hashtags, you know, the pound symbol you see before a term.  So people are like, oh, you know, I'm working on pound, you know, this or pound that.  So it might be like pound iPhone or pound search or pound this.  And then you click on it and you see everybody who's commenting.  Laconica does that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's really a nice feature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's basically, yeah, it's become.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It became a grassroots thing on Twitter, but it's not supported on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I don't want that chatter out in the public.  So it's private chatter.  The guys built it.  It's so much better than Twitter in terms of how tight it is.  You know, it's like if Twitter was starting now and rebuilt the system from scratch, this is what they would build.  iPhone application, Air, you know, Adobe Air desktop application, iPhone, Blackberry.  And it's just awesome.  And their business model is the best part.  Does it do like a map, a heat map?  That would be kind of cool.  It does a cloud and it does it by seven days.  Today's tags, seven days tags.  I wish Twitter Army were up right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It's crashed right now, but that's exactly what Laconica does.  You can see that at Denica, but that's a really nice feature.  Now you said the business model is interesting.  What is that business model?  Very interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So now if you want to have administrator privileges over your network, you like if you own, you know, Devorek.org, if John wanted to control it.  So everybody at Devorek.org can sign up.  And then if John wanted to control it and, you know, remove members or remove posts or, you know, be able to do other management style features, statistics, whatever, you know, sort of premium services, you pay a dollar per user per month.  So for a company that's got 500 people, it's $6,000 a year.  That's nothing for the value it provides.  And it's all automated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So it's just administrative rights versus the other one is just free for all.  I mean, or.  Twitter is a free for all.  Twitter doesn't have groups.  And by the way, I have now officially 425 followers.  See, 100 more than when you started.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's because I tweeted it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Tell them, everybody, tell them to, the Andrew Horowitz, everybody, tell them to join.  Give me a little push, guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll put it in the, you know what, the secret to my performances on Twitter, on Twit, is that I'm in the IRC right now.  Oh, you watch it all.  Oh, it's great because there's so many, there's people are like, Calacanis, you're talking too long.  And then I shut up.  And then other people are like, Calacanis, talk about this more.  Oh, you know, I'm sorry because I actually went in there and said, stop slamming Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So go ahead, please slam Calacanis.  He's watching.  He wants to know what you think.  I like that. It's cool.  You're, you know, this, it takes a certain kind of person to do this, especially with these two live chats, because there's always, you know, back talk and some of the stuff that you're doing.  And sometimes I warn people, don't even look at the chat.  Some people get it, take it pretty personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, you can't please.  I mean, listen, I mean, half, what's it, it's anonymous comments, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And so, you know, if Jason took it personal, what all the bad things that people said about him, I mean, he would never come out.  Thanks.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I feel so much better now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So Kevin brought up one that I really liked was that little pedometer one.  I thought that was, that's going to be it.  Fitbit.  I love that. Was that, did that come in close?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, that was, we did was we did this year five jury prizes, which were the highest rated by our jury of experts, which included Mark and Dreeson and Marissa Mayer.  And we'll have you, Leo, next year, hopefully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You invited me and I apologize. I just, I couldn't do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Next year, what I want to actually, I have an idea.  We had so many people watching live.  Stream it.  I don't know.  I want you to be the host of the live thing.  So like the Super Bowl or like poker, you would be like, oh, and Yammer had a really good thing.  And what did you think?  And you like, you could be commenting on it.  That'd be great.  Like sports announcer.  Love to do that.  Like Marv Albert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. Yammer all from three.  Oh, yeah.  Catch it doing the slam.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  May I have a bite of your neck, please?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yes.  You should do that, Jason.  I think you'd be very good at it.  Well, I got to host the main event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I need.  Oh, you're busy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fitbit is like a pedometer, but it syncs up to your computer.  I can't wait till that comes out.  That's going to be an awesome product.  It's so tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The form factor is beautiful.  And they're again, business model.  Great.  Like it's like a hundred bucks for this thing.  And then no subscription fee.  So you run around and yeah, awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, Leo, you need to have one of those that can count the bounces on your blue ball.  It would.  Fitbit would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That'd be good.  You keep it on and even keep it on at night.  It tells you if you've tossed and turned all night.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow.  Another great one was Good Guide, which is a goodguide.com.  And they are ranking products.  So if you go to goodguide.com right now, I'm really proud of this company.  I mean, this is there were like two companies, Costcast and costcast.org and Good Guide.  I'm putting them in the IRC chat room right now that we're really doing good things for  the world.  And so you can go see like the top baby care products and they rank it.  In terms of safe, healthy and green.  Exactly.  I love that.  And nobody's done this before.  And, you know, a lot of people argued this should have been the winner.  You know, the process of picking a winner.  And this is Mike and I decide and it's flawed.  You know, it's just tough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you can't have they can't all be winners.  And obviously you had a lot of good quality of stuff.  So yeah, this is really nice.  You know, but I have to say, Jason, I'm glad you're doing TechCrunch 50, but it's got it's  got to be tough.  There is so much background noise now.  There are so many sites.  It's good that there are events like TechCrunch 50, but it's still very hard to rise up above  the noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what, though?  It's it doesn't end at the event because a lot of these companies now have the ability  to say I was a TechCrunch 50 company, which gets them a meeting with any VC.  Literally, any VC will get it take a meeting with a TechCrunch 50 company.  Right.  Gets them a meeting with any journalist.  So just being chosen as the 50 is sufficient.  Just like you were at Sundance.  You know, like if you were at Sundance and nobody reviews your film at Sundance or you  don't get that much coverage for the next year up until when you come out, it's it's  selective.  You're getting coverage.  Yeah, yeah.  Tonshi Dot was incredible.  That this if we had an award for best presentation, Tonshi Dot would have won it.  And if we had an award for most innovative, they would have what they do is you walk around  with your iPhone and you point it and it puts tags on the real world.  So it's almost like that.  So like if you were walking by your studio, it would I could leave an audio tag.  So if I was outside your studio, I could look at it and I could click record and say, oh,  that's Leo's studio.  Notice the bottle of Jack Daniels on his desk.  It must be a rough week.  How do you spell Tonshi Dot?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  How do you say how you spell that?  It's T-O-N-C-H-I-D-O-T.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But actually, I just.  Tagging the world.  This is a Japanese company.  Well, it's Japanese.  That's the problem.  It's Japanese.  And what was great about it is we we got these guys on the phone from Japan and I was just  like, this is incredible.  I mean, it's just it was just unbelievable.  Like it works with the iPhone.  Probably not.  No, it is.  It's made for the iPhone.  You have to watch the video.  You know what's good about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know what's good about this?  There is a lot of noise out there and there is so little guides.  Really, truly, you know, really guides that are helping to differentiate and to put, you  know, kind of put everything in its place so we can see what's happening.  You know, we know that Google has this and we know that they have their labs and Microsoft  has this.  But there's so much, you know, right underneath the big companies, and especially from an  investment standpoint, it's so, you know, aside from looking at the balance sheets and  looking at what they're going to do in the projections, look at the actually what they're  doing.  It's a very difficult task unless you're really right along with the VC, you know, world,  et cetera.  So I think there's a great thing where you can really have the opportunity for for someone  to, you know, as arbitrary as may be and how, you know, we may have, you know, the two of  you being at the top and maybe that isn't the most arbitrary and looking at your taste.  But still, I think it's a very good thing to help out the rest of us to understand what's  out there and what could be breaking out as as the next generation of really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So once you've tagged something, it actually remembers that it's been tagged and they will  they will float up as you look through your camera, as you look through your iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my God, this is amazing.  You are.  Yeah.  You have to watch the video.  We're watching it right now.  No, it's on the it's on the screen.  You have to watch the video of them.  Oh, you're watching it on live.  Yeah.  The the the video they did, the presentation they did was so entertaining that it brought  the house down and they asked them like, are you watching the video right now?  So there you see it like they're talking about.  It's amazing.  How do you spell it?  Well, it's called Tonechi dot T-O-N-C-H-I-D-O-T.  But if you go to TechCrunch 50 and then you click on the companies, you'll see all the  companies listed there and the presentation from the show is there so you can actually  watch the presentation they did at the show.  So if you can't afford to come to the show.  I would have said this is fake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, I would have looked at this and said, oh, that's cool.  But they faked that.  There's no way it could do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The phone knows where you are, right?  And it knows what angle you're holding it.  I know that's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is about the cutest thing.  I don't know.  I don't know how you'd be able to use it.  But boy, is that really is amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Imagine if you just put Wikipedia through it and you geotagged it or you had Flickr photos  and you're pointing it and you see other Flickr photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, those comments, I guess you can record comments, you post opinions.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, this is the thing.  You know, you go through the companies, the thousand companies that applied were really  good.  And you gave Yammer.com the bestest show.  Well, Yammer, see, the thing is we pick what we think is going to be the best business.  Ah, yeah.  You might be right about that.  It's a little bit of a misconception of because there was another company called Swype, which  you have to watch the video for that.  I mean, Swype is by the guy who did T9, the predictive text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love T9.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Use it all the time.  You have to see Swype.  I mean, this is going to blow your mind.  Swype, you have a keypad.  You take a pen and you run it across.  So if you wanted to type Leo, you would just start on L, run over to the E, run over to  the O, pick it up, and it would recognize the path you took across the keyboard.  And you could do it with a pen, like a stylus, or you could do it with your finger and it  works.  And you can do 50 words a minute just running your finger all over it.  There you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You see it there.  So it's gesture based, basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right.  But yeah, you're just running across the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that's Tim O'Reilly.  We need something better.  Better than the iPhone keyboard.  So Tim O'Reilly ran up to say, I want to see that.  I want to use that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Tim was a judge and he came up and I told the judges, like, hey, why don't you try  using it so that you can tell that there's no funny business going on here.  But the thing is about the event and trying to get across to people is this is our view  of the world.  It's flawed in that way, but it's also in some ways going to be brilliant at moments.  Other people can start competing events if ours is flawed in some way.  If somebody wants to do one of the company can't have any funding, they've got to be  totally two people, go start it.  Do that.  Sure.  And if you don't think we picked the right winner, Mike and I put up $25,000 each to  the winner, so they got $50,000.  I'm telling anybody right now who's listening, any company that wants to put up a prize for  the winner, they can put up $5,000 or $10,000 or $100,000, whatever they want to do, and  they can pick their own winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It could be the Tweet winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You could pick the Tweet winner.  I don't open source it.  If you want to create all kinds of things.  Also, all the videos are out and they're all Creative Commons, so you can watch all 50  companies.  If somebody right now wants to take last year's companies, put them on a site, create a voting  form or create a panel of experts and pick another winner and give them a prize, go for  it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  See, what's interesting about this, Leo, I'm looking at the TechCrunch 50 now and on the  Tonshi.  The funding for this whole thing was only $55,000, according to this right above the  video, which is amazing to say that $55,000 total funding and compared to the millions  and billions that would be spent on all sorts of other garbage that's out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I like the idea that what you're really doing is you're just giving people a chance to get  the message out there and be seen.  If they've done something really innovative, give them a chance to reach out to the world.  I think that that's actually an altruistic thing.  I like the idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's why I started it.  It's like this doesn't move the needle for me.  It takes all my time.  250 go to meetings.  It was brutal.  And some of them were horrific.  You know, some of them were horrific.  Really bad.  You're sitting through it. You're like, oh, my God, what do I tell this loser?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Loser. You need a big gong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's kind of like is that kind of like the the what show?  I'm drawing a blank now. The other show with the American Idol.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's the Simon Cowell. You'd be a great Simon Cowell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what we based on. That's what we based it on.  It's got a little American Idol.  It's got a little bit of a show.  But to that last year, we had a thousand people, 40 companies, two days.  This year, we had two thousand people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You'll have 10 next year. This is a great day.  You should make a series. Yeah.  I should be. You know, that's exactly right.  This would be a great reality show.  Yep. It'd be great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, it's interesting you bring that up.  And no comment right now. But well, that's a comment in itself, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Jeff Smith is the Jeff Smith, GEOFF Smith.  He does all of our all of our great music for the Twitch.  Well, not all of it, but he did.  I can't play feeling droopy because, well, why not?  Put all of your stuff on a drobo.  Even though they didn't sponsor this, they're getting a free plug.  Thanks to Jeff Smith.  Yay, drobo. They owe you.  They owe you now big time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yay. I should get one.  I have too much. I have too much music that I'm making now.  I wish I had one on my server before it crashed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, it's so funny because when you lose data,  as I did this week when my my just kind of a horrible confluence of bad karma  and juju lost everything on the servers, we're going to recover bit by bit.  But of course, you know, after I've been doing all these ads for drobo  and carbonite, what do I get?  Eight thousand Twitter saying didn't use drobo.  Huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You forgot to use your carbonite.  Eh?  Fail.  Fail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  All right. I haven't enough pain already.  Don't add to my pain.  Anyway, Jeff is at the Jeff Smith dot com.  You can find all his music there.  Next time we'll have you on a music show, not a money show.  And these guys will shut up and you could talk.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hey, music should be music should lead to money.  Some dream.  Well, no, it's just it's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Dream on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  No, unless unless you get kind of niche, you know, which is, you know,  that's a whole other topic down the road.  But, you know, you get feeling niche.  I mean, you know, we talked about it when I saw you in Vegas about,  you know, where my aspirations to get a big deal and and or was it to kind  of take my time and kick back and hunker down as you will.  And that's kind of why I started Ringtone Feeder, you know, real easy  to get off the ground and very already being really cool to me.  And same thing with the music that I make.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That would have been a good tech crunch 50 ringtone feeder dot com.  Well, we'll come next time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Make original ringtones and then you sell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Now, here's the cool.  Here's the cool thing.  You subscribe to them in an iTunes.  It's a paid RSS feed and you automatically get a new one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How often every month, Jeff, every week, every week, every week you get two new  and it's they're all different ones.  One of them is a silly song that I do.  One of them is, you know, typical  digital.  The cool thing is that we actually open the doors to for suggestions.  So we don't have we don't have a chat room.  We actually just have email suggestions.  So I'm constantly making new things all the time.  They're they're songs.  A really good idea, Jeff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I didn't realize this is this is all yours.  I thought you were making stuff for it, but this is your actual business.  Yeah, this is for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's a guy, a guy, a friend of mine named Klaus Lovegreen  approached me about it because he'd heard my jingles and stuff.  And that's kind of how I got attention with him.  And he's a real good organizer.  And I'm a crazy, brainy, crazy, nonbrainy musician.  So we thought, well, let's let's take ringtones in a totally different way.  It doesn't have to be a clip of a popular song.  It could be. And we actually are working currently with other artists as well.  I mean, it's actually the site ringtone feeder is spawning off to  like my album, the subscription version of my album that I just put out.  So it's everything's based off of this premium RSS subscription.  That's a very interesting concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And do you have to get it?  You don't have to have anything to do with Apple or iTunes to do that.  No, that's a great. It's just an RSS feed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's an RSS feed.  We do a weekly video blog every every week that the new tones come out.  Like I'll do a little video blog and I'll play it in the video.  Hey, this is what I'm doing this week.  Like, it's funny, we talked about the gas this week.  Someone emailed me and said, hey, can you make a ringtone that's like reggae  and that makes me feel good because I'm depressed about the economy?  How about that? You know, so I did that.  That's cool. Some people say, hey, could you get rid of the lousy  telephone noise? And so we've decided to have different versions of the ringtones.  And now actually next week we'll have we're launching another  archive access to everything we've made.  So, I mean, you theoretically get 300 ringtones for, you know, I mean, it's  it's a it's two bucks a month and it's, you know, 20 bucks a year.  I think it's a pretty cool deal.  It's kind of like little pop songs.  It's not really ringtones. I call them like 20 seconds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm a subscriber. I subscribe.  Ringtone feeder dot com, the Jeff Smith dot com.  Andrew Horowitz is the disciplined investor.  And in this case, discipline means short everything in sight. Right, Andrew?

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, except for those 799, 799 companies.  But I can't I mean, you can't short them until October 2nd.  And then who knows what the feeding frenzy is going to be on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You know, if they're going to do that, they can never lift that because then it's crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I don't know. They say they're going to lift it and it's going to be crazy.  Things are things are out of hand as it is.  And it's going to get it's going to get crazier as as we progress.  And especially with Mr.  Paulson, you know, taking over the world, it seems.  But if I can ask anybody if you want to be the part of the the army of 400  for Twitter, I'm going to put out a lot of good stuff this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Giveaway free stuff. That's how Kevin Rose beat me.  What is he giving? Or name your vice presidential candidate.  That's how Barack Obama beat me.  Ah, really? He's beating you. That's not fair.  That's not right. It's not right.  Not right. No, I got to give away a vice president.  Then I'd be on top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The vice president of Twitter.  I mean, you'd have to that would be a tough one.  I think Molly Molly would.  You got to go with Molly.  Molly would.  She's got a shower of power in the debate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  She'd have to put the tongue piercing and the tattoos back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But other than that, I heard that being what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I love Molly Wood.  I heart her big time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have they she have a tattoo?  Have an ink to inks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And what we found out because Will Smith interviewed her and said,  what is a secret about yourself that no one else knows?  And she revealed that not only did she does, you have two tests,  but she used to have a tongue piercing for years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  All right, we're going to finish the show fast.  I got to go do something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  The discipline investor dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And by the way, this week's podcast is awesome with Harry Dent.  It really is. And I got to tell you something.  If you need help, I am here with these markets.  I'll give you the right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  We need help. We need help, Andrew.  His book is The Discipline Investor, Essential Strategies for Success.  Also on audible dot com.  And of course, as usual, Jason Calacanis has absolutely nothing to promote.  But do remember, Jason's Tesla will be arriving any day now.  Are you going to do anything special? An unboxing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe I should have you come down and we could do like a show about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I will do a live tweet from the Tesla unboxing.  Does it come in a box?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know. But, you know, actually, that would be funny  if we did a 24 hour Tesla thing. I'll do that.  That would be nobody's done that.  I think it would get 10,000 people watching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think you're right. 24 hours of Tesla. What would we do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't like it. Take it for a drive and be on quick  and then stream the quick to the live stream. OK.  We could or we could take it to a driving course or we could  you know, start.  But we could actually start taking it apart a little bit, you know, open it up  and have the hackaday guys start looking at stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What are they going to do? They're going to hack it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, yeah. So two hacks.  One is going to be put a solar panel over the entire car.  So it never has to be plugged in if I'm driving less than X miles per day.  Oh, that's good. The second thing I want to do is you wouldn't drive around

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  with the solar panel, though. That would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. The idea is when you park, you take it out  and you just roll it like a blanket over the entire car.  So they make these flexible solar cells now.  I live in Southern California.  So if I just drape it over the whole car, you know, who knows how much  that can do? But people power their laptops that way, right, or something.  So and then we're also thinking about taking one of those little windmills  and putting that up. So like you would raise it like a flag off the back.  And so when it's parked, the wind thing would be charging the batteries.  Who knows if it'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Plus, it helps you find your car when it's parked in a mall,  like with those elderly people, the softballs on top of their antennas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like the TechCrunch 50, sometimes I do things to make a point,  you know, like TechCrunch 50 was to make a point, like you shouldn't charge people  to be on stage. And I'm getting this to make a point.  Like we can we can all get off these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I basically he's kind of a modern day Amish person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you're Amish. I mean, with a car that it's not very expensive, that car, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, no. Let's put it this way.  He's buying two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  He's buying two so that one can charge while the other one he's driving around.  So he'll never be without.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You should be proud that you're not you're not, you know, you're you're  helping the the energy consumption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm driving down the cost of the next one.  That's how that's the spin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you know, and is it is it is it imminent?  Are you going to get it soon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's it's literally going to be in the next two weeks.  I know. And it's orange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It looks gorgeous. You've got the battery already, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, what I got was you have to put in a 220 volt plug  into your house, because if you plug in through a normal plug,  it's like 30, 40 hours to charge.  If you get the 220 volt,  it can either be depending on the amperage you put in your house,  three and a half to seven hours to go to full charge.  Oh, that's I just decide something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I have to go party with you.  I am. I'm kidding.  I'm going to I'm going to I'm going to come out.  I'm just thinking this thing cigars now cigars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  So the house is cigars, poker, Tesla and lemon drops right at my Tesla.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not a car guy, but the poker, the cigars, I am.  And I'm a drop where pool house kind of we were maybe we're  brothers in a different life or something in your dreams.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Any either you guys, even Jeff, I don't even know who this guy is.  But any of you guys come out to Brentwood,  any any of the twit listening audience comes to Brentwood in L.A.  Good. You just come to the pool house.  Party at my house.  Jacuzzi fits 12.  Bring a bathing suit or not, please.  Whatever Los Angeles.  We should actually do you.  Do you play poker, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do. But I'm the fish at the table.  I would be. That's OK.  We like that. We'll help you.  Of course, you like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. I need to have a celebrity internet celebrity poker tournament for channel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  One of my dreams, I always thought and I set up this studio just for this.  I always thought I would have basically a twit poker game  where we talk to play poker and you have a camera for everybody.  You do the thing like they do on World Poker Tour where you show your hold cards.  And it's just the same conversation we're having right now.  But we're smoking cigars and playing poker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And somehow we do it instead of a regular cards.  We don't have iPhones.  And somehow we'd have like a virtual dealer with the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That is so genius.  Wouldn't that be fun?  I think your pool house is the place to do it.  I'll bring the cameras.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I got a studio at Mahalo.  Oh, yeah, you don't need that. You got everything. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes. The only thing you don't have in Mahalo is you don't have an investment segment.  That's what you should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Let me get to 10.  You know, when you get to 10 million uniques, then you can start bolting stuff on.  Right now, I'm just like telling everybody, like, I know we have some early success.  Can everybody please be focused on laser laser focus?  The laser laser.

Transcript:  I should have paid attention.  I don't know what I'm going to do. Too much work.  The problem is there's no limit.  My server's completely collapsed.  So here's the deal.
