And it's except for Ian Thompson, it's all a replacement team.  We were hoping to have Christine Warren here, but she's not feeling well.  But that's okay because of the fires, the smoke.  We're all kind of not feeling well these days.  But they took two to replace her.  Simone De Rochefort is here, her cohort on the Rocket podcast.  It's so good to see you, Simone.  We missed you.  Thank you for having me back on.  Thank you for coming on.  And you said, I won't be on the show unless I have backup in the form of Alex Wilhelm from Tech Crunch.  Hello, Alex.  It's great to see you, Alex, is still living in my house.  The haunting has stopped, I hope.

Transcript:  The haunting has stopped.  But on the air quality front, Simone and I, being East Coasters, have been sitting relatively pretty.  But I have to say, it made me miss the Bay Area more than I think it should.  When everyone was suffering a lot, I wish I'd been there to suffer with us.  I just felt like I missed it.

Start time: 216.84

End time: 240.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Come on.  I really miss snow.  This is one of the worst things about living in the Bay Area.  Yes, snow is three hours drive away.  But just waking up in the morning and the lawn's covered with this virgin thing of snow,  and you go out and make little angels in it, I miss that a lot.  That's Terry.  The smoke, however, hell with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, no.  I've been keeping it because I was going to do a final week of costumes for the news team.  And I was going to do that last week, but then Monica convinced,  my wife convinced me to leave it until Halloween week, which actually seems more out.  But I'm looking, I'm so looking forward to getting rid of this thing because  I've never had a mustache before and I will never have one again.

Now imagine that with on your facial hair, it feels like you just got this gooey,  horrible prickly mass on your upper lip.  Oh my God.  And it's just, it's going.  I'm just, I'm going to be so happy to be clean shaven again.

Transcript:  Well, I did like a month of when we started in lockdown, I did like a month of dress up for the  crew just to keep morale going. And so I've got the, I've been growing this and the hair has been  uncut for six months so I can do a really good borat.  Oh my God.

Transcript:  I have to say, I wasn't that into the original borat film.  This looks interesting as well, but it's kind of a one trick pony in a way.  On the other hand, there were classic moments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I really want to say that I'm sufficiently mature as do not appreciate humor of this level,  but at the same time, I'm also a 12. And so I have a suspicion that I'm going to watch this  and not be proud of myself at any moment while going through Borat 2. But I mean,  just looking at this preview, I mean, I'm in.  It's so silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That wasn't for Borat. He's been doing that.  Oh, right.  Yeah. This is Sacha Baron Cohen, who has a really interesting sense of humor and goes,  boldly goes, where no liberal has gone before in order to expose the corruption, the venality,  and just the stupidity in some cases of the white supremacist movement. And that is something.

Transcript:  Well, if you ever see his LAG stuff, I wasn't a massive fan, but the drugs episode where he's  with a member of the Metropolitan Police. He goes, so this is class A drugs. This is the  best stuff, right? No, no, that's the legal classification.

Start time: 438.18
End time: 464.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The LAG interviews with the bishop, they had a Catholic priest on one time and he didn't know  what he was getting into. And it's just one of the most awkward bits of television I've ever seen,  but also one of the absolutely funniest things I've ever watched. I had one eye closed while  I was watching it, trying to just see a little bit. Brutal, but such a good ability to stay  in character and really bring out a moment in the kind of live recording. It's not like they  get multiple takes of a lot of that stuff. Yes, that's right. You got to get it right

Start time: 464.22
End time: 519.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  the first time. Actually, that brings us to a story because, and this would have been normally  in the bottom of the pile, but I actually think it's kind of a big deal. The decision to postpone  the James Bond movie until next spring at the earliest means that movie theaters, which have  just been hanging on, hoping they could make a little bit of money with James Bond, are now  thinking it's over. In fact, two of the biggest movie chains in the US and the UK are kind of  Regal and Cineworld are apparently planning to close all theaters in the US and the UK  next week. The question is, how long can AMC hold out? I wonder if this bore out.  There was initial hope. Remember when Trolls World Tour came out? I don't, but I hear that when

Start time: 522.24
End time: 527.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you had kids. That's how I marked time, actually, days of Trolls World Tour.

Start time: 528.40
End time: 552.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was one of the first movies that came out during COVID, during quarantine. They streamed  it and 20 bucks a pop and it did pretty well. I think Hollywood said, thank God we can charge 20  bucks, kind of make some of our money back through streaming. Then that was it. It was completely  flatlined. Notice you don't see those $20 rentals very often anymore. There are very few first run

Start time: 552.88
End time: 560.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  movies available to stream. It's terrible. It's really bad. Sorry, the movie companies

Start time: 562.68
End time: 605.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have been doing this for a while. Surely there was a thing a couple of years ago where you could  pay an exorbitant amount of money and provided you had the right kit. Only a handful of people  would do that. Yeah, but I mean, this seems cinemas are currently, I mean, I hate it because our local  cinema is really good and it's struggling, but cinemas are dead, basically. You can't socially  distance in a cinema and expect that to be an economical business. So surely it's in Hollywood's  interest to set up some kind of system where you can do these sort of things. I think they're just  so worried about IP protection that they're going to let the whole thing burn rather than actually  go for a sensible solution. I think that might be it. Disney's charging $30 to watch Moonland on Disney Plus.

Start time: 605.56
End time: 623.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't imagine anybody paying that. Okay, so Leo, I said that on Twitter and I was absolutely  destroyed by parents of young kids who said, look, we were going to go see it in the theaters anyways.  It was going to be $100 plus a babysitter. That's 30 bucks. And I was like, all right, parents,  all right, all right. They're like throwing tomatoes at me. It was brutal. They're saying that,

Start time: 624.30
End time: 653.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but it has not propped up the movie industry. Now remember Tenet, which was a very hotly anticipated  film. I couldn't wait to see Christopher Nolan's newest. It was an IMAX movie. It did all right  globally. $300 million worldwide did terribly in the US. And in fact, in this past week,  it was beaten by the re-release of Hocus Pocus. My goodness, that's embarrassing.

Start time: 654.42
End time: 681.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That rocks. I think all the movies that we're talking about here, like Mulan and Tenet, these  are like hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollar movies. I feel like those are the ones  that could draw in the most eyes on streaming, but also are the ones that are going to struggle  the most to make back their money because they were so freaking expensive to make. Rightfully so,  because people need to get paid. But it's just, it's such a tricky situation. They really didn't

Start time: 681.32
End time: 695.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  want to release Tenet on streaming because it was shot for IMAX. They really thought maybe the time  has come to release a movie in the theaters. People will go back to the theaters. And they were,  I guess they were wrong. It was the guinea pig, right? Yeah, it was the guinea pig. Like it was

Start time: 695.74
End time: 705.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the one that was out there. Like, let's try it, see how it works. And it did not work. And in the US,  I don't know. I don't know when I could imagine going back to a theater myself.

Start time: 706.68
End time: 709.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I don't care how good a movie is. I'm not going to risk my life to see it.

Start time: 710.82
End time: 734.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No film is worth that. But here's my hope. I really hope this brings back more like  $75 million movies that might work in streaming. I feel like we had this, like,  everything had to be an enormous blockbuster. All film budgets were like $200, $300 million.  Everything had to have this enormous marketing campaign, television ads, Chevy tie-ins,  terrible music. And it became this enormous production because everyone was betting on  these kind of Avengers style hits or Avengers scale hits. Bring back smaller movies.

Start time: 735.14
End time: 752.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's kind of what Disney did. They had this movie. It only cost $25 million to make.  27 years ago, starred Bette Midler, Sarah Jessica Parker and Kathy Najimy as witches.  They said, well, let's re-release this poorly reviewed 27 year old horror movie.

Start time: 755.04
End time: 758.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And? It's a classic.  It was in 2570 theaters. It earned $1.9 million.

Start time: 765.94
End time: 802.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh man. But you see, there is a school of thought.  There is a school of thought this could lead to a real resurgence in the British film industry  because we've always kind of focused on making cheap crappy movies. Yeah.  I was about to say economical and very well-produced movies.  Prestige movies.  Lots of backgrounds and soft cushions and some nice English accents and the rest of it. But  why spend $100 million on a movie when you can do a pretty good movie for three to five mil  and make your money back on the streaming side of it? I'd love these sort of smaller things.

Start time: 803.12
End time: 828.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the thing is streaming services like Netflix are doing that. I think the bigger studios  might have the problem unless they're like a Disney who has their own streaming platform.  That's where the audiences are. Netflix can release like a thousand cheap movies and people  will watch them because they already have Netflix. But unless you have a deal with a streamer,  then you don't have a way to distribute that movie except to do the $30 rental and that kind of thing.

Start time: 829.52
End time: 848.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm kind of torn. Apple TV, for example, seems to be throwing an awful lot of money at  doing these trying to become the next Netflix and throwing all these shows. I've got to say,  the space one looks quite interesting. But an awful lot of this stuff just looks like,  okay, what were the B scripts that we couldn't quite sell to anyone else? Right. Get that out

Start time: 848.46
End time: 870.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  there. Did you watch, being a British fellow and a fan, I presume, of The Beautiful Game?  Have you watched Ted Lasso? I haven't, no. The premise is it's an American football coach,  college football coach who is very successful, comes to England to manage a Premier League

Start time: 870.28
End time: 894.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  football club and hilarity ensues. Yeah. I mean, I love Jason as an actor, but it's just  two very different games. You've got the American side, which is basically running,  kicking, throwing, throwing ball. But that's the Joke Ian, of course it's different games.  I know, but I'm sorry. It's a completely different mindset. There's funny moments where he says,

Start time: 895.06
End time: 941.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  okay, so they're going out in the field. It's a pitch. You call the field a pitch? Yeah,  it's called a pitch. Okay. There's all these cultural moments, which actually aren't that  funny, but there's a lot of it's, believe it or not, a fairly sweet movie, but, but Apple has a  problem because almost everybody who's watching Apple TV plus at this point got it for free when  they got an iPhone a year ago. Yes. You don't renew that by the way. I bought an Apple TV a few months  ago. You don't get another year. That year is going to run out for most of us. November 1st,  at which point Apple is going to be faced with a PR problem because I have to think most of the  people who got that free year and I'm including myself are not going to renew. It's just, you've  seen it all. There's nothing new on there. That's a problem. I didn't even have enough.

Start time: 941.80
End time: 960.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that was really bad timing for them because they had their shows, not very many shows,  and then the pandemic and now no one can shoot shows. They can't produce. Yeah. Hopefully  they're saying that succession might start shooting again in New York this fall and then  I will physically stand on every bridge at once and keep people out of this city.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Simone and I are right. Succession is actually one of the best TV shows ever done as was the wire.  But you do have to watch the first several episodes of succession before you really understand  how horrible this family is. And a lot of the pleasure of watching succession is going,  Oh my God, they're so horrible. Right? So I agree. The worst family dynamics that are fascinating.

I thought we'd start with something  fun and light because honestly, what else we got but TV to watch. I'm so true. There's some good  stuff. I don't know how I guess they produce stuff at last year that just never got released,  but there's there's new stuff coming out. That's quite good all the time.

Transcript:  I mean, the big problem is in the UK is so proper because, you know, they're having so proper as  having to deal with COVID. Britain's longest running soap opera is a radio show on Radio 4  called The Archers, which has been going since I think 1947. But they didn't even, you know,  they didn't cover COVID for like the first three months of lockdown and then they had to go on  pause. And when the archers goes on pause, Britain loses its mind, you know, because it's audio only.

Start time: 1167.61

End time: 1191.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you'd think but everyone had to get organized, but also they had to build COVID  into the storyline without panicking people and the archers is, it's the nearest you're going to  get to a cult in the UK. You know, if you go into the archers addicts forums on Facebook,  my goodness, it's just right down the rabbit hole. There are people here who've been listening

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  since birth. Any inconsistency, it's very sad, but we've killed all of our  really like days of our lives and the classics. But I am very happy to say soap operas are  taping again in New York City, Simone, you can run over and you'll be very interested in how  they're doing this. When they have to do a love scene, they can do socially distance for most of  it, you wear a mask so you're on camera, they separate, but there are times as you know,  and soap operas when you have to make out with somebody, what they do is they do a quick cut  and the purse, the actor's significant other comes in. They make out with that person only  showing the back of their head or whatever. I am, I kid you not, this is the article from  Fortune how soap operas are filming love scenes and it's bizarre. The bold and the beautiful

Start time: 1246.48
End time: 1256.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  There's always been a certain amount of smoke and mirrors in that though. One of my favorite  stories was from Game of Thrones with who's the tall Hawaiian guy? Oh, Jason Momoa. Yeah. Yeah.  When he was filming his scene with Emily Clark, which is basically a rape scene because it's  Game of Thrones, but in order to diffuse the tension, he wore an enormous pink fluffy  knee protector. I read about that. And just to try and raise a smile, but the idea of making out  with your significant other on screen, it's a very good point. Do they get sag benefits? It's just like.

Transcript:  Well, let's see. When Bowdoin's Flo Fulton is kidnapped and chained to a radiator,  its co-star Darren Brooks as Wyatt Spencer comes to the rescue. It really called for a big embrace  and a kiss. So once she was freed, we stopped tape. Katrina, the actress's husband came in and they  finished the scene.

Apple, the other shoe has not dropped. We know  Apple has an iPhone up its sleeve. But when? We could talk about that. Google's announcement,  Google says it's going to give a billion dollars to the publishers. We'll talk a little bit about  that. And Twitter, by the way, just a little word of warning. You cannot tweet that you hope the  president dies from COVID because it turns out, who knew this, that all this time Twitter has  prohibited posts calling for people's harm or death, which must come as quite a shock to your  co-host Brianna Wu on Rocket and to the squad members and a few other people. I've even gotten  death threats on Twitter. I had no idea that was illegal. So I haven't threatened anybody back  though. I'm glad to say. We will come back. TikTok also has had a reprieve, which is a good thing  for Fleetwood Mac. Did you, I'll tell you why. I'll tell you why. There's a lot more to come.  Now, Simone, you may want to cover your shell like ears for this next commercial.  As, as many of us know, just look at that mustache. We've been in quarantine for some time,  which means we probably haven't been grooming as much as we should. It's time to manscape.  Okay. You can all just go away right now. You can all just go away right now. No, I think  manscaping is great. This is the manscaped, I'm holding up for those of you listening,  the manscaped pure performance package, which is a great subscription package.  They have something new though. I'm going to mention the performance package because it comes  with the Lawn Mower 3.0 trimmer, which is honest. What are you laughing at? Which is honest. Have I  never done these ads for you before, Ian? Is this the first time you've heard this?

Transcript:  So no, go for it. You took the words for Simone. She didn't know. We didn't want her. I didn't need  to know this about Ian. I'm glad you're all just taking care of this. Yes. You know what? I'm sure  you feel the same way, Simone. You don't want to come out looking like a come out of quarantine,  looking like a Sasquatch. Even if you're alone in your quarantine, have some self-respect.  You know, so they've just come out with a new thing, which I'm... Well, let me finish showing  you this. This is the Lawn Mower 3.0. Beautiful ceramic blades, which means they wear well.  They're extra sharp and they vibrate 7,000 RPM, which means you can barely hear it.  And the faster it moves, the more accurate and the less pull, the less nicking. It's got this great  light. So if you're going into the deep forest, you can really see where you're going. I love this.  Plus it has a USB charger. So it's got a little stand, which I have on my sink, just at the ready.  At any time I need it, I could just whip out the Lawn Mower 3.0. This is awesome. We don't have it  yet. So I want to talk about something new, but I can't show you. You'll have to go to manscaped.com  to see it. This is the new Weed Whacker. See, there it is on the on the  dais there. It's right underneath the trimmer. The Weed Whacker Ear and Nose Hair Trimmer.  Now let me tell you something. As a man of a certain age, when you get past 50, hair starts  coming out of the most surprising places. You really don't want a hairy ear or a hairy nose.  The Weed Whacker Waterproof 9000 RPM 360 degree rotary dual blade system. I've tried the cheaper  versions of this. There's nothing like this. This works so well. It has a proprietary skin safe  technology, which helps prevent nicks and snags and tugs. You don't want to stick anything in  your nose. It's going to snag or tug. Trust me. And guys, can we just tell you something? And I'm  sure Simone in her in her heart of hearts agrees 79% of partners polled admitted long nose hair  major turn off and don't get me started on ear hair. This is the best tool for the job. Then  there's the Lawn Mower 3.0 Trimmer. There's of course a whole variety of potions and lotions  like the Crop Preserver and the Crop Reviver. When you get the performance package, you get two free  gifts, Manscaped boxers and a lovely travel bag. You'll also receive a replaceable blade every  three months to keep your weed whacking and lawn mowing time clean and enjoyable. It's very important.  So thank you Manscaped for making our orifices a little bit less hairy. 20% off plus free shipping  right now at manscaped.com slash twit. Manscaped.com slash twit. Yes, 20% off and free shipping.

These are the command and  control planes for a nuclear war that go up. It's called looking glass that go up in case  the strategic air command is destroyed in a preemptive attack. They have these flying command  and control that can launch nuclear weapons from submarines, atomic missiles. And they went up half  an hour before it was learned the president had tested positive. And there's a good reason for  that. It is very destabilizing, very risky when the president of the United States is at a  commission.

Well, I mean, I did a speaking tour with another guy who's been covering this. I don't know if you  know, there's hundreds of millions of dollars worth of $2 bills in a bunker ready for nuclear  war because after nuclear war, money is going to become essentially worthless because there's going  to be so much of it lying around. So they shrink wrapped about 500 million in $2 bills and put them  in a bunker because nobody uses those. And those will become the currency after the apocalypse.

Transcript:  You know who would buy those? Steve Wozniak. He is seriously, he loves $2 bills. He would buy them  apparently, I didn't know this, you can get them from the mint uncut. So he'd buy them in big  sheets like of $102 bills. And then he'd cut them up and bind them into a pad, like four bills,  like a pad of paper, four bills per sheet. And then he would, and this is very Woz,  he would go into stores, they'd say, oh, that'll be $8. And he'd go, okay. And he'd tear off a pad  and he cut out the $2 bills. And he'd say here, and he hoped, he hoped they would freak out and  think they were counterfeit. Because nobody knows there's even a $2 bill. And the fact that he was  cutting them with scissors off of a pad, it kind of implies that maybe this is something he bought  Woolworths. He just loved that stuff. That's was so much.

Where'd I, I've lost the, but this is,  this is like N 98. So if I wear this and then I wear a face shield or I put on my safety glasses  and wear my mask. And then the problem with grocery stores is if they let too many people in,  you can't really socially distance. So I'm very careful. I don't go down an aisle until there's  someone there and they run down and grab it and then come out. I'm a very, I'm paranoid because  I'm old and I'm, you know, I'm in a high risk group. Was that mask like helpful for you with  the smoke in California? Yes, I just got it, but it absolutely is. And before I've been making my  own masks, which is really fun. I like to sew it turns out who knew. I know. And I, you know,  I make pretty masks that are probably not very effective, but I wear them. And then, then I got  a mask fitter, which goes around your face to hold it in. And that works even better. And this is kind  of the next, the next step. But if I'm going to go out to like a store, I want to take every  precaution. I don't want to, I'm very nervous. For sure. Yeah. I don't want to get this thing.

They were  building basically obsolescent parts into a laptop, selling it cheap. And this apparently is something  which is quite common. And I've been trying to do some digging into this, but it seems that an awful  lot of the electronics devices that we're dealing with on these kinds of sales days are specifically  designed for the sales days to keep profit margins up.

Transcript:  Tell me more. We talked last week about Sidewalk. We've been talking about it all week. This is the  network Amazon announced a while ago, but finally kind of rolled out at their event last week.  This is the mesh network Amazon wants to create in all. It's really a ring product, I guess,  which is also Amazon. The idea is a low band, it's called LoRa network that is, can go two to five  miles with the transmitters, but everybody who has a ring device or an Amazon echo can be a hub  and continue to spread that out around the neighborhood. Ultimately putting a mesh over  the entire neighborhood that can be used for geo locating. They've their first product that  asked was a mailbox sensor, but they said you'll never lose your dog again because you will know  exactly where your dog is in the mesh at all times. I imagine Amazon also intends to put this in their  delivery trucks, maybe even it's probably too expensive to put in packages because you need a  transmitter, but this could be hugely valuable for Amazon's logistics as well. If you don't trust  Amazon, how do you feel about the idea of an Amazon kind of wiring with, you don't have to do anything.  It's not up to you wiring your neighborhood. Okay. So whenever I'm with my in-laws, I go around to the

Why don't  you get shot a thousand more times? It's the same thing. It's not. I can try to have a more secure,  safe, personal digital environment and not put cameras and microphones all over my house attached  to companies with spotty track records about privacy. At least my phone, this is an iPhone 11  something. I don't know. Someone could tell me what it is. It's got two cameras, not three. I  don't think it's with bad ones. But Apple actually has a reasonable history with privacy because  they're not an advertising company. Amazon and Google are huge advertising companies. I don't

I love Touch ID so  much. And then I did get it. And I was like, okay, well I'll turn it off when I go through airports.  I'll be really careful. And lo and behold, I don't do that anymore. I'm very complacent with Face ID.  And I think similarly, the more that we allow tech companies to encroach on our privacy, the more we'll  just be like, oh, well nothing bad has happened yet. I guess it must be okay. And that's how you get it.

I kind of do  because there's no reason for them to save it. They stored in the secure enclave. There is a  hash that sent that is not reversible. It's not used. Can't be used to identify you. But Amazon  says to make sure it's safe, we encrypt the data and upload it to our servers. So they're making a  virtue out of doing exactly the opposite of what Apple does. I mean, there's the rub.

Apparently, if a library buys a physical book, I presume they  pay the normal price and they can lend it out as long as that book doesn't fall into pieces.  But with digital books, the publishers charge them a hefty fee. The average is $40  and then severely limit how many times they can lend it. Sometimes it's only 26 times or 52 times.  Sometimes it says for two years. It's not as economical for a library to buy these ebooks.

Transcript:  Civ 1 was basic, Civ 2 was, it pretty much covers a thing.  Civ 3 was terrible, Civ 4 a bit better, Civ 5 I've heard better.  But it was just the pure empire building game.  If you're looking to spend 10 hours on a computer game,  building up a world civilization, heading out 12th century, it was a great game.  But I'm sure someone is better on me than this, but it was the same problem when they rebooted Elite,  where you've got to spend such a long time learning to play the game.  And I would say also, stream, stop telling people how long you spent playing this game,  because when I look at that, it's just like, I spent way too long playing this,  I need to get out and have a life.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by ZipRecruiter.  If you're hiring, God bless you.  We need more people offering more jobs and there is no better way to do it.  Look, this is a good time to be hiring.  The best people are looking for work and you can spread the word that you're hiring  better with ZipRecruiter than anywhere else.  Post immediately to 100 plus job boards with one posting to ZipRecruiter.  And one of the amazing things that happens, it happened to us,  we use ZipRecruiter all the time, is you will start getting candidates almost immediately  because what they do is they look at your listing,  they scan through the resumes they've got on file and then they invite people with the  right qualifications to apply to your job.  Let me tell you, that really works.  ZipRecruiter is so effective.  Four out of five employers who post on ZipRecruiter get a quality candidate within the first day.  Last time we were looking for a bookkeeper, we posted on ZipRecruiter at breakfast.  Lisa was worried because she thought she was going to have to do the bookkeeping  and she just was dreading it.  Plus hiring is hard, right?  You got to look at a lot of resumes.  She posted it at breakfast by lunchtime.  In fact, within an hour she goes, oh, here's a good candidate.  Oh my God, here's another one.  We had three or four really qualified candidates by lunchtime.  That is an amazing thing.  We're not alone.  ZipRecruiter talks about Monica Starks, maybe you saw this in the ad.  She was hiring for a key role at her construction company, GS Group.  There were so many candidates out there, but she couldn't find the right person.  So she switched.  And I think if you're using some other service,  switching to ZipRecruiter is a really good idea because they make hiring so easy.  Monica found a guy, Lamont Jenkins, almost immediately.  If she said ZipRecruiter sent Lamont's profile to her five minutes after she posted her job  because he was such a perfect match for the role.  And she agreed, hired him.  And it's working out great.  ZipRecruiter makes the entire process efficient and effective.  You don't get calls to your phone.  You don't get emails.  It all goes into ZipRecruiter's interface.  They reformat the resumes so you can scan them quickly.  You can write screening questions, multiple choice or true, false, even essay questions  to filter out candidates that just don't fit.  And then ZipRecruiter ranks them, rates them, and you can hire the right person fast.  There's nothing better.  See for yourself.  You could try ZipRecruiter for free right now.  If you go to ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  That's ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  ZipRecruiter is the smartest way to hire.  You can take it from me.  We've been doing it for years.  That's ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  ZipRecruiter.  Oh, now I lost track of all the things we were going to talk about.  All right.  Did anybody watch the Google announcement on Wednesday?  Anybody?

Transcript:  When I first saw the tech specs of the new phones, I was kind of like,  oh, they're going back to the Nexus idea where you do cheap, clean hardware,  which gets proper updates and gets you an unskinned version of Android.  But the choices they made were bizarre.  You downgrade the central processor.  You keep the camera as it is.  Yeah, you add some cute software functions, but it was kind of like,  what was the point?  You're just doing this for the sake of it?

Start time: 4448.72
End time: 4535.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It really feels like I'm going to make a guess that this was the last phone in the pipeline.  They're so done with the whole thing.  They're just going to push it out and they'll never do another phone again.  It just feels like that.  They also really muddied the water.  For instance, they announced the 4A to a very good reception.  I think that's an excellent phone.  That was the successor of the Pixel 4 a couple of months ago.  Everybody loves it.  But then this week, they announced the 4A 5G,  which is not even related to the 4A.  It really looks like a 5A because it has 5A features, not 4A features.  The 5A, they didn't even normally they do a 5 and a 5 XL.  They didn't do an XL.  They do one model.  It's mid-range-y.  It's still 700 bucks, but it's kind of a mid-range in every other respect.  It's got a big battery, but only 128 gigs storage.  There's no other skews, 8 gigs of RAM.  One thing that I think is good, it's a metal back.  Hallelujah.  I'm so, you know, these glass backs are so fragile.  It still does wireless charging, which I had thought,  oh, you can't do it with metal.  That's why everybody makes these glass-backed phones.  That's encouraging.  The camera is probably identical to the old one, pretty much.

Start time: 4536.32
End time: 4554.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's got better software, but it's still the same hardware.  I'm a 3A user.  I've been using Google phones since the original Nexus.  There is nothing in there which would make you want to upgrade.  Yeah, the hold feature, but that's a software feature.  That will come to the rest of the phone sooner or later.  Yeah, that was the only big thing.

Start time: 4555.14
End time: 4563.44

Start time: 4597.26
End time: 4612.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No. I guess that's my point.  They weren't able to say, here's a phone you're going to want in any respect.  It's 5G, but who cares?  Every phone is 5G.  It's a phone.  It was kind of like that.  They spent very little time on it.

Transcript:  One of the key things that keeps me buying these phones  is that you get your security updates first.  I wouldn't be comfortable buying a Samsung Android phone  because you're reliant on Samsung to get the security fixes out there.  I'll carry on buying from Google directly from that.  But this was just, even the Chromecast unit was painfully bad.  And I don't know what it is about Google, but they love beige for some reason.  That's not a good look.  They have, it's pastel.

Start time: 4648.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They do have like a mint green one and a pink one.  They put them on a plate of French macaron cookies, which it does look like.  And then they said it's like a bowl of candy.  So it was very confusing.  I bought one that day and I got it the next day, by the way.  And it's great. It's fine.  It's another Chromecast.  Remember when they first released Google TV, it was called Google TV.  It came with a keyboard.  Remember that?  Oh, yeah.  Oh, I hated that thing.  It had problems.  And then they had so many problems.  They said, okay, well, it's Android TV.  They're all new, different.  And it's been Android TV.  Now they're back to Google TV.  It's, you know what?  It's only 49 bucks.  And in fact, if you subscribe to YouTube TV, I think for six months, it's free.  So they're basically, they're basically giving it away.  Has a remote, which the Chromecast hasn't had ever.  Leo.  Yes.

Start time: 4710.16
End time: 4729.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I feel like Google is a company that had some really great ideas  and has been since making all of them worse.  Is that a fair thing?  Search used to be amazingly good.  And then they put all the ads on top now and like disguise them as results.  And out of the other crap and crufts, you can't find your results.  They made phones for a while and that was cool.  And Android was cool for a while.  And now it's just super insecure.  And I feel like everything they've done has just gotten worse.

Transcript:  That is the $20 billion question.  Because, yeah, I mean, they were really honestly,  the Nexus series was a really good series of phones.  It was.  I loved them.  Search used to be great.  My father-in-law bought a smartphone because he saw me doing voice search on Android and saying,  where is the nearest pub in Buxton?  And he was just like, this is amazing.  I need to get this.  But there is nothing like that anymore.  I mean, Google seems to have given up on the plot.  And I don't understand why.

Transcript:  I wouldn't like to comment on someone's mental state.  He might just be like that.  Under the current circumstances, no one's operating 100%.  OK, fair.  And particularly when it comes to public things.  But it was just snooze worthy.  I mean, it was it reminded me of the old Onion article  after Steve Jobs died and Tim Cook did his first keynote.  And it was like Tim Cook comes on, says, here's a phone.  It does some great things.  Great.  OK, next.  And it was a very it was a very feeling like that.  And there was no enthusiasm.  There was no hardware to really get you enthusiastic.  The software was cute.  But you know, there's nothing world changing there.  So why?  I saw no reason to get excited.

Start time: 4875.76
End time: 4949.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, you see, I mean, well, no, you see, I was at the Pixel one and two launches.  Then we we pissed off Google and they stopped inviting us.  But, you know, with the original, you know, there was actually a feeling of excitement.  Then they went on to Apple's modus operandi and had people in the back cheerleading.  So whenever somebody said something, there was always some people going,  oh, yeah, yeah, having multiple orgasms throughout.  But I mean, honestly, they were good events because they allowed you to get hands on with a kit.  And one thing Google does, which which I respect, which Apple doesn't do,  Apple farms these out to useful idiots who will always say what they want to say.  Google actually put it out there and let you get your hands on it.  And that's why you pissed them off.  Well, yeah, but I mean, at the same time, they were honest about it.  So I kind of respect it.  But at the same time, this this was just really underwhelming.  I couldn't work out why they made such a big deal about it because  they were putting out flawed hardware, a few cute software tips, but it just really wasn't  that infusing.

Start time: 4949.62
End time: 4978.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was nothing there to get you fired up.  It was very googly in the sense that, for instance, even though they're going to call  this Chromecast Google TV, Android TV still exists.  You may remember that when they released Stadia,  what if you bought the early adopter kit, it came with a Chromecast Ultra,  so you could play their gaming service on your big screen TV with a Chromecast,  except this new Chromecast doesn't work with Stadia.  It's like that was that that was absolutely bizarre.

Start time: 4978.74
End time: 4992.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Stadia is, you know, this is where they can make some really big bucks in the future.  They released hardware which doesn't support it.  I mean, I'm curious.  I mean, what what what everyone else thinks, because that seemed suicide.  It's just strange.

Start time: 4993.42
End time: 5011.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's nonsensical that I have no good answer for that.  But if they were if they're really trying to make Stadia a thing, which it already  is kind of not like make that a thing and not releasing it or not having  Chromecast be compatible with it is just nonsensical.  I don't understand.  I can only speculate.

Start time: 5012.12
End time: 5041.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But, you know, one of the things that's always been said about Google is  because they want to keep their startup energy.  They have every division is somewhat autonomous.  And so maybe it's that the new Chromecast division wasn't talking to the Stadia division  or they didn't they didn't they just didn't pay attention to anything else the company's doing.  But I have to say, and I love Google and I am not like unlike you guys, I'm not an anti-Google person.  I really.

But I, you know, Google's starting to live up to its reputation as a company that has no attention span that just kind of random walks its way into the future that cancels things willy nilly.  It's if I if you're interested in investing your time and energy into a Google product, you always have to say, well, I wonder if it's worth it because will it be around next year?  This is a problem, I think, for Google, Microsoft and Mixer.

At a price much lower than, you know, anything except the lowest cost Fire's TV sticker.  Isn't the Roku?  They have a $50 Roku.  Yeah, but it doesn't do 4K HDR.

And I couldn't get HBO to work on it because I think just like Roku, they hadn't made a deal.  Maybe Google loosened the things up with this new Chromecast because it does support HBO Max.  And then I went over my shield and it's supporting it now.  So that's good news.  Yeah, they must have made a deal.  Anyway, yeah, somebody in the chat was saying you could say Sacre Bleu.

Transcript:  By the way, Sonos is suing Google.  They started this process in January.  They're suing them for another five more patents because they say,  hey, we invented this party mode, this multi-speaker audio, and you're copying us, I guess.  I'd be interested to watch that.  That was the thing that made Sonos, right?  They were the only ones who could do this.  And now everybody can do it.  And if that's a question of like leveraging Sonos's patents without paying them,  then I don't blame Sonos because it's frankly,  nobody's going to have to buy another Sonos speaker again.  Why would you?

Start time: 5322.76

Transcript:  Well, now I replaced all my home networking.  I took everything out and put enterprise grade ubiquity in there and they support cameras.  And it would record locally.  And I could put a little hard drive in the router and it would record locally instead  of sending it to the cloud.  So maybe I'll do that.  I don't know.  It seems like a lot of trouble.  They even have a doorbell and again, all that stuff.  Our show today brought to you by Mint Mobile.  Where's my iPhone SE?  I am such a fan of Mint Mobile.  And perhaps you've seen Ryan Reynolds talking up the Mint Mobile.  It's pretty cool when you got Deadpool doing your ads.  That's all I can say.  Mint Mobile is the MVNO.  MVNOs like Mint Mobile, they resell the expensive cell carriers plans for a lot less.  They're reselling T-Mobile.  So if T-Mobile works well in your neck of the woods, Mint Mobile will work exactly the same.  But a lot less?  Yes.  I mean, I cut my T-Mobile bill by two thirds by going to Mint Mobile.  They just introduced their unlimited data plan.  So this is unlimited nationwide talk and text,  high speed data on the nation's largest 5G network,  unlimited 30 bucks a month.  30 bucks a month.  The whole thing.  Add an iPhone, that's another 15 bucks.  For 45 bucks, for half what I'm paying T-Mobile, I get a phone and unlimited.  It's amazing.  Now, I actually went for the 12 gigabyte a month plan.  That's 25 bucks a month.  But next, when that, you know, I bought a year ahead of time,  when that runs out, I'm going unlimited.  That's just awesome.  What's awful is the price I pay for Verizon,  because my wife and family on Verizon, AT&T,  because my second family is on AT&T,  and T-Mobile because I'm on T-Mobile.  And my mom's on Sprint.  So pretty much I pay so much through the nose to all these guys.  I'm moving them all to Mint Mobile.  Consider yourself warm.  30 bucks a month.  Mint Mobile doesn't have the stores.  So by going online only, eliminating the traditional cost of retail,  they can save a lot.  You can bring your own phone.  They will send the SIM to your door.  They don't charge you for the SIM.  Keep your same phone number, all your contacts,  or buy a phone from them.  And you'll see the iPhone SE is a great price.  I think it's a great phone too.  I think it's a great choice.  If you're looking for a plan for family members,  Mint Mobile's awesome.  And if you're not 100% satisfied, of course,  Mint Mobile has you covered with their seven-day money-back guarantee.  Time to break up with big wireless.  Those guys, they don't love you back.  Mint Mobile, the little green fox, he loves you.  Switch to Mint Mobile's premium unlimited data plan for 30 bucks a month.  And they'll send you the plan for free.  Or you can get a phone from them.  Go to mintmobile.com slash twit.  This is the best deal in mobile.  It's amazing.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  Cut your unlimited wireless bill to $30 a month.  I don't know why you'd go with anybody else.  Mintmobile.com slash twit.  And it's minty fresh.  And tasty.  Tasty.  So what do you make of Facebook's announced plan?  I have a feeling.  My thinking is we got an election November 3rd.  There'll be a transition period January 20th.  There's a chance.  At this point, a pretty good chance.  We'll have a new administration.  Maybe administration that won't be as easy on antitrust regulations and FCC  that might not be as amenable.  And maybe even a Congress that's a little less worried about things.  And I feel like you're going to see companies go,  if we're going to do this, it's now or never.  So Facebook, which has been under a modicum of inspection by Congress,  but mostly by Democrats, they seem to,  the Republicans in the presidency, pretty happy with Facebook.  They've decided to make one account for everything.  Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook.  They're going to basically merge or interoperate the apps.  There'll be a single log in.  I feel like this is the kind of thing that might have raised some scrutiny in the past.  I feel like they're doing it now.  And Alex, you follow finance.  They're doing it now because they figure it's now or never.  Does that seem sensible?

Start time: 5657.42
End time: 5694.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's defensive because if the accounts were all separated,  your Instagram account was different than your WhatsApp account,  which is different than your Facebook account.  Congress could say, look, just cleave here.  You can keep two pieces.  But now Facebook can say, guys, gosh, we'd love to.  What a great idea.  You had two bad notes, all one account.  You can't just cut off one piece.  It's like cutting off your arm.  It's part of your body.  So now they're going to be better armored against a  questing democratic administration and maybe a democratic Senate.  And it's a smart move by Facebook if you believe in their model and Zuckerberg's leadership.  If you're critical of those things, it's not particularly good news.

Transcript:  Remember that it was about a year ago,  Zuck posted that blog post where he said, we're going to make Facebook private.  We're going to encrypt all the messages.  This would also be a step forward in that direction, right?  And maybe for that reason, a good thing.  Yes.

Start time: 5712.12
End time: 5746.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think generally speaking, I'm in favor of any companies move to more  encrypted communications in a more private system.  I think the issues that we've seen with Facebook's move in that direction is that now it's pretty hard  to moderate private groups.  That's where we see a lot of coronavirus misinformation, voting misinformation, and so forth.  And so there's always a minus to every plus.  But I mean, in general, Leo, I'm in favor of those things.  I think it's the right way for them to go.  But of course, they're balancing that with an advertising platform that is dependent on  knowing lots about you both on and off site.  So Facebook is never going to be really private.  They're going to do a patina of privacy on top of an ad machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You can't forget if you use any one of their apps now, you're in the ecosystem.  And so it doesn't really matter, right?  One account means when you see a Facebook like button on a web page,  even if you don't use Facebook, you only use Instagram.  You're in it, baby.  Go ahead.

Start time: 5761.80
End time: 5789.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And what they're talking about, like being able to cross post from Instagram to Facebook  to WhatsApp simultaneously, that seems to me like a way that misinformation could spread even  faster theoretically.  But I guess it means they'll get me back on Messenger.  So are you on Facebook?  I am on Facebook.  I deleted the Messenger app, but I'm also on WhatsApp and Instagram.  So you're you don't delete anything.

Transcript:  Okay.  A little bunny rabbit.  But when you look on your phone, if you download the Facebook app and the Messenger app,  that's a gig of data that you've just stuck onto your phone.  And I don't trust it.  I don't have an Instagram account.  I don't use WhatsApp.  I don't.  You know, it's just why the hell give them that information?  I will quite happily use Facebook on the browser.  Yeah.  I can't answer messages within an hour or so.  I have to wait till I get home and get my desktop machine opened.  But why the hell give them the data?  They've shown themselves to be absolutely unreliable with dealing with it.  So just deny it to them.  Yes.

But I mean, honestly, when it comes to this stuff, if you look at there's a very good Twitter feed,  which looks at the top 10 articles shared on Facebook, and it's horrifying.  Oh, it's scary.  I agree.  Pretty much seven or eight out of 10 of the top Facebook articles for the day are Ben Shapiro,  Open News Network, Fox News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But no, I think with Shapiro, it's got to have been tough growing up as the smartest kid in  your high school and being that short.  And he's got a massive chip on the shoulder.  And I get it.  He plays the giddy-goat argument.  He will throw out 10 statements, eight of which are wrong, two of which are right.  And if you try and take him up on that, then it's a very common debating technique.  But I find him terribly hard work.

Transcript:  Here's from the Facebook top 10 Twitter account for October 2nd, the top performing link posts.  When they say top performing, they mean the got the most engagement,  the most retweeting kind of thing.  This is in the last 24 hours.  Fox News, the Duck Commander.  You know who he is, right?  He's still going.  I can't believe he's around.  The guy with the big beard.  Yeah.  WAFB Channel 9, Robert Reich.  So that's left, that's leftist.  My Modern Met, Robert Reich again.  I don't know how he got on there twice.  Fox News again.  I don't know how he got twice.  Dan Bongino, Bonino, Boninho, Mark Levin and Tasty.  That seems pretty ecumenical.

Start time: 6048.22
End time: 6079.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Robert Reich getting too in there about coronavirus does not undercut the fact that  usually that list is like two Ben Shapiro links, a Reverend Franklin Graham link,  three Fox News links, something from OANN.  It's usually builds.  And I think the point here is that Facebook is garbage, but you can't now just avoid it  because if you have an Instagram account, if you have a WhatsApp account, you're now part of the  broader empire.  And so back in the day, I think it would have been much more easy to kind of like opt into a  little bit of Zuck, you know, just a little bit.  A soup song of Zuck, if you will, or whatever.

But as far as we can tell it, and I'll take a shot at summarizing this, um, Oracle's  going to buy a chunk of a kind of globalized entity that will withhold tick tock.  A tick tock's code will become available for Oracle to look through.  Uh, Oracle will host tick tock stealing a Google customer away because Trump likes Oracle  because he's also evil and he doesn't like, uh, Google's it's relatively neutral and,  uh, nothing will change effectively other than, you know, a Trump, a sycophant Larry  Ellison will get some free money.

So one of the things that I've learned about tick tock, some of my friends send me because  they're cool and I'm not, is that you'll often be sent a tick tock from someone who  about which people already know.  There's kind of an end joke or a meta theme to it.  And so this guy, if I'm having my tick tock or script has a library of stuff that he's  done.  So we're seeing millions of followers, millions of followers probably.

Number 39 is in the top 40 and Rolling Stones charts of streaming songs.  Suddenly people everywhere downloading.  I'm just imagining myself a bunch of 12 year olds who'd never heard this song in their  life going, Oh, I like the baseline.  Playing it on Spotify.  This is the power of tick tock.  I mean, okay, Farrah, first off Fleetwood Mac to some damn good tunes and suddenly you  know, it's a great song.

You know, this is the ultimate Formula One track and my wife would nearly die.  I mean, I'm not going to lie.  I was driving on that, but it's fascinating how this has worked out because it seemed as  though tick tock was being banned for completely arbitrary reasons.  And then you're like, well, Zuckerberg's close to Trump.  Maybe he wants to get rid of the competition because basically they bought Instagram, they  bought WhatsApp.  This is they're taking the Cisco route of buying the competition.  They're buying the competition.  This is they're taking the Cisco route of buying the competition or subverting them  in some ways.  Tick tock isn't taking any more data than Facebook is.  But the difference is it's our data rather than Chinese data.  And the Oracle deal doesn't seem to do anything.  That's all.  Of course not.  Oracle is.

I think it would be completely reasonable for European countries to look at our American  owned social media and be like, huh, now, wait a minute.  These platforms actually like Facebook actually was shown to be used by meddling foreign agents  in our last election.  Maybe we should do something about those and someone should do something about those.  But it does contribute to the complete splintering of the main way that we communicate now, which  scares me a lot.

Like, for example, people said that Tick Tock, because its algorithm was in China, can be  used to influence voters in America.  True.  Now, was it happening?  I don't think so.  But like it could happen.  One thing we should do is turn that lens around to stuff from home.  We don't know how the news feed works.  We probably should.  There probably should be more clarity around how these major social algorithms work so  we can better understand how we're being manipulated as a strong word, but influenced,  say, by these major companies.

People like this, therefore we should promote this.  But if you think back to OK, I'm being an old fart here.  But I mean, when I grew up in the UK in the 1970s, we had three television channels,  about eight national newspapers and about four radio channels.  And now I do what you know, and compared to 100 years ago where you just had a few  newspapers and that was it.  The amount of information that people are having to deal with right now is really,  really disturbing.  When you look at psychologically how people deal with this, they just basically turn it  off and you go with tribal bases.  So we're facing a very interesting sort of crux point of civilization in terms of how  we deal with information overload.  And we haven't had to deal with this before.  It's going to be very interesting and possibly very horrifying in terms of how we deal with  it.

Our show today brought to you by Barracuda.  Every time I do these ads, I want to I want that heart  didn't end in the end in the end in Barracuda.  Actually, Barracuda is really well known as the provider of cloud enabled  enterprise grade security solutions for every part of your network.  Email data applications and of course, the network itself.  Now, I want to tell you a little bit about Barracuda's total email protection  because we know 91 percent of all cyber attacks start with an email.  I don't know if you read that great article.  I think it was in the Atlantic about the Norsk Hydro Ransomware exploit.  This happened last year. Wasn't that well written?  This is one of the biggest aluminum makers in the world.  How did this entire company get shut down and cost them 60 million dollars?  They got shut down because of an email.  An Italian customer sent an email to a Norsk Hydro employee  with an innocent attachment, except it was intercepted  and a malicious attachment was substituted.  And that's all it took for the bad guys to take down that entire company.  Sixty million dollars in losses.  Now, put yourself in that position.  You've got employees working remotely, dozens, hundreds, maybe even thousands.  Each of one of them is getting tons of email every day.  And all it takes is one click on the wrong email and spearfishing  ransomware attack, count takeover, conversation, hijacking.  It could cost you money, it could cost you customers, it costs your reputation.  You've got to protect yourself against email threats.  And that's what Barracuda is an expert.  They've noticed, by the way, since this all started, a spike of 667  percent in covid related spearfishing attacks.  That's a huge jump.  They impersonate the World Health Organization or worse, maybe they  impersonate your HR manager or the boss.  And they and they purport to have emails with important information.  Open this PDF up.  We want to protect you.  Here's our policy.  And you open it and the whole thing is shot.  You need the protection.  Barracuda total email protection can offer.  It includes all in one email security backup and archiving.  That may be a legal requirement, depending on your business.  AI based protection.  And you want an AI based because the threats are constantly shifting  from spearfishing account takeover business email compromise.  You needs protection that's as nimble and changes as rapidly as the bad guys are.  It gives you an automated incident response that is really important.  It gives you options to very quickly and efficiently address the attacks.  We know the faster you react, the less damage there will be.  And they even offer security awareness training for your workforce,  because after all, aren't your employees the first line of defense?  You need this.  Now, I'm going to tell you there's a very easy way to see what threats are lying  in your Outlook mailbox today.  Barracuda is offering you a secure free email threat scan of your Office 365 account.  I don't care how big your business is.  They'll do the whole thing.  It's free.  Barracuda.com slash twit.

Treasury, speaking of ransomware,  Treasury Department is now warning people this is an advisory  from the Office of Foreign Assets Control.  If you pay ransomware.  To cyber actors.  You will be violating OFAC regulations and you could be prosecuted.  So not only are you hit by ransomware, your company's down.  But if you dare to pay the ransom, which is of course, everybody agrees a bad idea,  but we know it happens often.  Yeah.  You could go to jail.  What?

Transcript:  I don't know.  I mean, this whole thing really worried me because, OK, first off,  I mean, the Treasury statement was an advisory.  They said it wasn't done by the rule of law, but that day is coming.  But I mean, at the end of the day, we shouldn't be paying criminals to get our data back.  You should be investing instead in proper data backups and restore facilities  so that you can say to these people, get lost.  We can have this back up in 24 hours.  It has been done before.  It can be done again.  Put the initial investment in there and you can tell the criminals to go swivel.

Transcript:  You know, it's getting harder.  And I'll tell you why.  And I know it's harder because companies like North Kyro, who should be prepared  for such a thing, in fact, they had a plan,  still were unable to stop it and fix it.  And here's a couple of reasons.  First of all, these these ransomware guys are getting very sophisticated  and they're now targeted attacks.  This isn't an email that's sent to a million people across the country  looking for 100 Bitcoin.  These are they're going after your company.  So they're very sophisticated spearfishing attacks.  The other thing is they don't trigger the ransomware right away.  And I think this is one of the reasons it's a big threat.  What we're seeing is they will wander around your network for months,  sussing out all your, for instance, backup strategies, all your offline backups,  infecting whichever of those they can infect and doing something.  And this is the new thing, exfiltrating data.  So Canon, this happened to Canon, remember Canon got encrypted,  lost a lot of data.  They didn't pay the ransomware.  So the second arm of this attack was to release information  about Canon customers to the public net.  So it's blackmail on two fronts.  You ever want to see your data again, pay us.  Oh, and by the way, we have your we have all of the information  about your customers.  And if you don't pay us, we're going to release that.  So it's a lot. I. It's hard.  I don't I I'm terrified. I'm terrified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to say the bigger the one that really scared me most was the MERSK hit,  you know, second largest container carrying organization  in the world.  They were down to paper after getting hit by a ransomware attack.  You know, this was a serious economic hit.  And we can't just keep paying these people off.  We need to build systems which can, you know, bounce them off  like a rent off a screen door.  You know, I mean, it's just a question of getting the infrastructure in there  and the backup systems in there.  And I get they're getting smarter.  They are going to go in and try and, you know, deal with all this stuff.  We've dealt with this with viruses.  You dealt with this in other areas.  This has to be dealt with because otherwise we're just paying criminals.

Transcript:  Well, worse than that, people are dying.  So a German hospital reported that after a ransom attack,  a patient died because of lack of care.  This week, the Universal Health Services was attacked.  This is one of the largest health care operations in the world.  They care for three point five million patients every year.  Four hundred facilities in the US and the UK.  They were down just as the same thing.  They were down to using paper.  Their X-ray machines were offline.  They couldn't use them. Oh, my God.  They had to. And this is this.  This is the sad part of it.  They had to redirect ambulances to other hospitals.  They reported that four patients died because of that redirection.  So this is now costing lives.  This is now very, very serious.  I completely agree with you, Ian.  I just think it's almost impossible to stop.

Start time: 7593.18
End time: 7606.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I completely agree with Ian, but I also think it  becomes an arm race, just like it is with any other hack  where they're going to keep getting better.  White hats are going to keep building stronger systems,  but they're going to kind of move in tandem.

Transcript:  Well, I could say I'm sorry.  This is the way that the criminals operate.  There's a thing in the UK where if somebody had a disabled handrail  installed outside their flat, they get robbed because people knew they were disabled.  Criminals have, you know, they're scum this way.  And I'm sorry, you need to fight them direct.  And what worries me about the ransomware thing is in insurance companies  are encouraging companies to pay off the ransomware  because it's a cheaper solution than actually rebuilding from scratch.  So you're encouraging crime by the insurance industry.  So I think honestly, it's time for me to say  if you are legally liable, if you don't have the ability to recover from this stuff,  because this is just going to grow and grow and grow.  Otherwise, we need to cut this off right now.

Start time: 7674.98

Transcript:  I think make it harder for the criminals to get in, but also stiffer civil penalties.  Like when the Equifax hack happened, I thought the company should be put out of business.  They irrigated themselves the right to collect all of my information,  which I didn't really like, to be clear.  And then they lost it all in a very embarrassing manner.  And they were given a slap on the wrist.  No, that should that should be a shut down offense.  And I think if we had that level of civil  penalty in place for companies that are bad at cybersecurity,  yet demand the right to have lots of our data, then we would see real reform.  Then we would see more money going into cybersecurity, more into offense and defense.  But we just don't see it because they know that if they get hacked,  what are the people going to do about it?  You know, maybe those customers.  It's not the end of the world.

Start time: 7722.32
End time: 7745.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's damn right.  Equifax actually made a profit out of that hack because they put third party  security checking services, which they happen to own,  you know, as part of the deal, their share price went up after they did a deal  with with with the DOJ.  There is no penalty on this.  So you should really penalize companies for bad security.  But it ain't happening at the moment.

Transcript:  I don't want to get political.  But meanwhile, H1B visas  have been basically cut off by the White House.  New restrictive rules greatly reduce the number of foreign workers.  This was opposed by Apple, Microsoft, Facebook, Intel, PayPal and Twitter,  among dozens of others, because these tech giants often bring in  highly trained security personnel and others.  These are the highest skilled, in many cases, tech workers.  So in a way, you're saying, and by the way, let's not let any of those people  from foreign countries come in and help us with this problem.  There is a a workforce grant program.  They're going to give up to 30 grants to train U.S.  citizens for middle to high skilled H1B occupations, which is a great idea.  One hundred fifty million dollars is going to be allocated to this.  It's going to be years before they can replace these these workers that we're losing.  And it's honestly an anti it's an anti-immigrant thing.  These H1B visas have been around for a long time.  They're not taking jobs.  And you know what? If you think they are, then great.  Give these grants, get these people, get Americans trained to take the jobs.  But don't yet cut off the H1B visa,  because it may be that that's exactly the wrong thing to do at this time.

Transcript:  I mean, I've got to say I was with Trump on the H1B thing.  And this is not as a thing, I would say, in pretty much any other area of policy.  But if you look at the H1B applications from 2010  to about 2015, 80 percent of those weren't for the really high,  high class computer technicians.  They were for basic admin skills.  And they were being used by outsourcing firms to basically get people in.  And that and that that was fundamentally wrong.  But at the current situation, we've got to, you know, no one is wanting.  They've had to redo the H1B auction  a second time because no one wants to come to America.  It's over. Yeah.

Start time: 7871.46

Start time: 7876.80
End time: 7903.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the problem is tech firms use this to keep salaries low.  Because if you've got an H1B worker who knows if you fire him,  he's got to get him and his family out of the country in 30 days.  That's a very big incentive to abuse workers.  Now, I'm all for getting the best talent into the US using the H1B system,  but it was abused for many years.  This isn't a solution, though.

Start time: 7904.32
End time: 7931.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No. Yeah, I have friends that are on H1B visas who are in the upper  echelon tech jobs working for a big four American tech companies,  paying loads of American taxes and not suffering from what you're accurately  describing. So if we could find a way to cleave off the abuse, I'd be in favor of it.  But fundamentally, I'm going to be more opposed to anti-immigrant policies  that I'm going to be worried about wage issues instead of tech.  Yeah, can I pick a poison?  I suppose there's no perfect way out of it.  I don't think, Ian. Oh, that's fair enough.

Transcript:  If you're in Ireland, you should know that the bread that Subway uses  to make their sandwich actually. Oh, God, this was terrible.  It's not legally defined as bread.  I think this is pretty funny.  The Irish court said there's too much sugar in it.

Start time: 7951.50
End time: 7965.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

You're right.  I mean, there is a bread in our local supermarket.  There's a bread that advertises only one gram of sugar per slice.  Seriously, first slice.  Yeah. Now, I make my own bread.  I put at maximum a teaspoon of honey in there.  But the amount of sugar in American bread is horrifying.  I buy diabetics slice low simply to avoid it and make my own.

Thank you so much.  We do this week in tech are technically it's a news roundtable this week.  I don't know what it was.  We do it every Sunday around two thirty Pacific, five thirty Eastern, twenty  one thirty UTC. You can watch or listen live.  Now, if you're in the UK, if you go to twit dot tv slash live,  there's video feeds and audio feeds.  But I do want a little programming that if you're in the UK,  there are two audio feeds, there's tune in and Spreaker tune in after an adverse  court ruling will no longer play United States podcasts in the UK.  They're terrified of Sony and Warner Music.  So it will say that we are.  Yes, we are blocked on tune in UK, which is nuts, because that's bold.  I didn't even play Fleetwood Max Dreams.  So, you know, but anyway, that's the way it is.  But you so anywhere in the world, except the UK, you can listen on tune in.  Spreaker does work in the case you use the Spreaker channel.  I apologize. Also, if you watch us on Roku, as you might already know,  we're certainly getting a lot of email.  Roku will change their API. Brocar app.  You can't watch Twitter on Roku through the twit, the old twit app.  There are other ways.  There's probably the best is the YouTube app.  But we are looking at there is apparently Roku has another way to do  if you have RSS feed, which obviously we do.  There's another way to do it.  We wouldn't get the live stuff, but you'd at least get the shows  and you could watch the video.  We are working on that.  Meanwhile, come to our website, Twitter TV to download shows, audio or video  or subscribe in your favorite podcast client, because all podcast clients can get it.  And that way you'll have it for Monday morning and your early morning fry up.  There's nothing.  Food of the gods.  Nothing like sausage with your morning twit.  Thank you, everybody. We'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the can.  I got to go to Popeyes. I can't take it anymore.  You guys are driving me insane.
