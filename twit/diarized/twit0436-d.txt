Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They could.  They could repeat.  That would be the second in the history of NCAA football to do that.  The original being Appalachian State.  They did it three years in a row.  And do you have an Appalachian State?  I have tons of Appalachian States here.  I see.  I went to the University of California and they're such.  The worst football team and athletic director should be fired and the coach should be too.  They lost.  They won nothing.  And so I had to find these obscure teams that win.  To wear their shirt.  You don't want to wear a Cal shirt.  No, you look like an idiot.

Start time: 203.54
End time: 220.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it stuns me that the lead university within this system can't win.  Is UCLA?  No, no.  They're second rate.  That's cool.  All the money should go to Cal Berkeley.  And they apparently would refuse to pay.  I don't want to get into it.  Why did I even bring it up?

Start time: 220.66
End time: 241.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why?  Why?  Anyway, Mike will be taking over Tech News today starting at the beginning of the year.  And we're so glad to have you aboard.  You brought your family, your son, who just is about to get married.  That's very exciting.  His fiancee, who's about to pass out.  Your son told me that he made a deal when he proposed that he would get to wear Google  Glass during the ceremony.  Yes.

Start time: 242.70
End time: 245.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, she's a keeper, that one.  Boy.

Start time: 246.60
End time: 320.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I guess.  We'll see.  Actually, it's a good idea because family and friends who couldn't be at the event,  they can see it from the groom's point of view.  I think we should get her.  We should get her some glass so that her side could see it from her point of view.  That's right.  Yeah.  No, she's not that good of a sport.  That was pretty unequivocal.  No.  Yeah.  Not going to happen.  Did you see the robot that Google just bought, the eighth company that Google has bought  this year, they're in a buying spree for Andy Rubin, who is now we've found running the  new robotics division of Google.  If you weren't scared of Google before, you will be scared now.  This is a company called Boston Dynamics, which is a spinoff from MIT.  We've seen robots so creepy.  Which is this big dog or cheetah?  Oh, sorry.  It's Wildcat.  Fastest robot in the world.  This runs faster than Usain Bolt.  It's gas driven, which kind of, they've been doing these for the Department of Defense  under contract.  I like all the smoke coming off this piece of crap.  I'm terrified.  No, no, no.  I'm scared.  This is scary.  Okay.  First of all, it's going to go that way and then it's going to build up some speed and  come back the other way.  Are these autonomous?  Are they remote controlled?  Does it even matter?

Start time: 321.78
End time: 339.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The company Boston Dynamics specializes in replicating animal and human locomotion.  So they don't do the intelligence part.  You notice it doesn't have a head.  They actually did come up with a head for the big dog, which can actually pick up a  cinder block and throw it at you.  17 feet.

Start time: 340.80
End time: 341.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's terrifying.

Start time: 341.80
End time: 350.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But they're simulating animal locomotion.  What's brilliant about these robots is you can go up and knock them over and they'll  rebalance themselves.  They're really phenomenal.

Start time: 351.56
End time: 364.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's my question.  Are you simulating animal locomotion because it's really more efficient or just because  it's terrifying?  I mean, wouldn't a tank tread be more efficient?  It looks like it's actually going backwards.

Start time: 365.06
End time: 365.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it's weird.

Start time: 366.42
End time: 369.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I mean, everybody has a different view about what they do about it.

Start time: 370.96
End time: 371.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But see, it survived.

Start time: 371.96
End time: 438.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The Pentagon is thinking of a pack mule and the obvious response to that is, how about  a mule?  Right.  You can get a mule in Afghanistan for 10 bucks.  But it's fascinating technology.  What does Google want with this?  Well, Google is in the algorithm business primarily.  And we're getting to a point at which we're going to have robots and all kinds of things.  Google is probably going to be very good at the part of robotics that's missing here.  This is the locomotion.  What Google can be very good at is the application.  So the most immediate and Google-y kind of application would be a disaster relief.  A big earthquake somewhere, there's rubble everywhere, the roads are toast.  And for some reason you can't fly in, you can actually send supplies in with some of  these robots.  Robots that climb walls and do all kinds of crazy stuff like that.  But Google is the kind of company where they can just invest billions and billions of dollars  in things just because it could end up being something cool someday.

Start time: 438.66
End time: 449.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is Big Dog and they're showing, that's not Big Dog.  What is that?  I think that's the, you can't touch this, that's the hammer robot, I think that is.

Start time: 450.08
End time: 456.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's what we'll be seeing on the streets.  Right.  I don't know why they think...  Hello, citizen.  Is he taking a dump there?

Start time: 456.86
End time: 458.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What is the deal?  He's looking around in his squat.

Start time: 459.22
End time: 460.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's a pile of batteries on the floor there.

Transcript:  The interesting thing about this...  Are you Sarah Connor?  Come with me if you want to live.  Wait a minute.  It's jumping jacks.

Start time: 470.34
End time: 491.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Now Google has said actually that they're going to honor the existing Pentagon contracts,  but they're not going to start any new contracts.  So they're now a defense contractor.  They are for the contracts that already exist, but they're going to get out of it as soon  as they can, which is really interesting for the Pentagon, because the Pentagon I think  was counting on these guys to provide robotic mules and stuff like that.  So now the Pentagon has to find out...

Start time: 491.84
End time: 495.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It seems like a mule mule would be just so much of a better choice than this.

Start time: 497.76
End time: 501.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The thing is that it's software and it's robotics, which means that this is...

Start time: 501.96
End time: 504.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the interesting thing is the intelligence involved and so forth.

Start time: 504.76
End time: 512.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And this is version 1.0.  I mean, apply Moore's Law to this and go forward into the future 15 years and it's going to  be probably something very amazing.

Start time: 513.70
End time: 517.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is Moore's Law really only applies to semiconductors and throwing it on everything

Start time: 517.58
End time: 525.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  else is questionable.  That's true, but we know that it's been advancing at an incredible clip and it will continue  to do it.

Start time: 525.72
End time: 530.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  By the way...  Software advances roughly the same, don't you think?  Not at all.  At the various loss speeds, no?

Start time: 530.90
End time: 539.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's why the machine, everything has come to a grinding halt.  That's where the hardware is.  We're having to use pads like Mike does, because software has dropped dead as far as I can  tell.

Start time: 540.48
End time: 556.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But if you look at this technology, this kind of thing would have been perfectly impossible  10 years ago.  It's just advancing so quickly.  And by the way, the Google self-driving car itself is a robot.  That's what it is.  It's a robot that uses off-the-shelf parts, namely a car, to get around.

Start time: 557.40
End time: 566.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could see why they're using animal locomotion.  This thing is able to handle ice.  This actually is kind of interesting.  It's pretty impressive.  They kicked it over and...  Look at this.  This looks just like a...

Start time: 566.94
End time: 570.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This needs to be in a movie.  Oh, it is in a movie.  Yeah, what am I saying?

Start time: 571.00
End time: 574.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  It kind of looks like two guys with their legs sticking out the bottom.  It really looks human.

Start time: 574.92
End time: 577.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It looks like two guys trying to carry something.  Yeah.

Start time: 578.40
End time: 580.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  John, I hope we're dead before this takes off.

Start time: 581.00
End time: 582.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If we're not dead, it'll kill us.

Start time: 584.01
End time: 584.28
Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Wow.

Start time: 584.93
End time: 602.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fascinating.  Andy Rubin, if you're going to put somebody in charge of something, I imagine...  He's a guy who spent his whole life doing robotics.  In fact, Android, the operating system which he helmed, was really a sideline for him.  It wasn't something he wanted to be...  I'm sure he wanted to be doing it, but it wasn't his dream job.

Start time: 602.40
End time: 605.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  And the name Android suggests his passion.

Start time: 607.85
End time: 611.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Unfortunately, though, the Google barges are on hiatus.

Start time: 613.75
End time: 615.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happened?  This story I missed.

Start time: 618.23
End time: 639.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, government happened.  The Coast Guard and the agency in charge of the Bay, San Francisco Bay Conservation and  Commission has said, whoa, what are you doing?  You can't just build a scary giant barge and put it...  One of the rules of the Bay Commission is that you can't do something on the Bay that

Start time: 639.76
End time: 644.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you could reasonably do on the land.  I get it.  I get it.  I get it.  They didn't pay off the right people.

Start time: 644.80
End time: 690.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's exactly right.  Essentially, what happened was they pointed out that they wanted to float the thing over  to San Francisco, the San Francisco side, and have people on board.  In fact, Google internally calls it apparently the San Francisco Studio.  That's their internal name for this thing.  And somebody said, you can't come into the harbor in San Francisco.  You don't have a permit.  And then somebody said, do you have a permit to be on Treasure Island?  And so I think there's a permitting...  They're just doing this stuff.  And so CNET apparently has been watching this thing constantly and said that there's been  no workers, no nothing going on with this thing.  It's been going on since October.  So it looks like it's on hiatus.  It was a stupid idea to begin with.

Start time: 691.02
End time: 722.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I disagree with that.  I think it was a really interesting idea.  They had the opportunity to do what Apple stores do, but only temporarily because there's  nothing like...  Apple has to keep these stores open all year round.  This would be like one of those special Christmas stores.  It's a pop-up store.  It's a pop-up store.  It's a novelty.  People would have flocked into this thing though.  I would have wanted to go inside.  And they would have probably done a business of selling those little crappy tablets and  some of the junk that they have.

Start time: 723.96
End time: 727.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is there enough money selling crappy tablets to justify...

Start time: 727.48
End time: 729.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ask Apple.  Whatever the case.

Start time: 729.90
End time: 733.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you down on tablets all of a sudden?  Something you hate tablets?

Start time: 733.84
End time: 737.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I will just for this show.  For purposes of this show are you...

Start time: 738.86
End time: 744.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So ladies and gentlemen, for purposes of this show, Mr. Dvorak will be down on tablets for  the remainder of the episode.

Start time: 745.30
End time: 746.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But anyway, I think it would have been great.

Start time: 747.32
End time: 771.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The difference is that, for the Apple comparison, is that Apple sells massively expensive, profitable  things in huge numbers.  That's right.  Google does not try to make money on it.  This is a soft, warm and fuzzy thing where they just want people to have a general feeling  about it.  And it's got to be expensive to build a barge and maintain it.  You have to hire a skipper.  It's even more expensive now, I can tell you.  Now that they have to pay the permits.

Start time: 772.84
End time: 809.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It has sales.  Even though it has a sale, it has fake sales on it.  Well, they were going to have a sale after Christmas anyway.  It's a weird thing.  You know what's a weird thing?  Google is a weird thing.  When a company is so successful that they can just spend money on moonshots and on just,  hey, we think it might be interesting to see what it's like.  I mean, they've got the drone delivery system.  I've already been looking at that, much like Jeff Bezos.  What a fake that is.  You don't believe that he's going to...  Well, you should have read my column.  I had a column on this.  Was that on a new domain.net?  It was on PCMag, I believe.

Start time: 810.36
End time: 819.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I said this was a sucker.  Yeah.  Charlie Rose got sucker.  Oh my God.  Charlie Rose is like very gullible.

Start time: 820.08
End time: 835.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know who didn't get sucker?  Charlie Rose.  You know why?  Did they get what they wanted out of it?  Great numbers?  Everybody.  It's a win-win for everybody except the saps who bought into this.  I don't think Charlie Rose is a sap.  I think he knew exactly what was happening.  In fact, they even teased it at the beginning of the 60 Minutes.

Start time: 836.72
End time: 861.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You won't believe what Jeff Bezos is planning.  If you want some guy who's just going to fall all over himself, yeah, you got the right  guy.  But you'd think he could ask one smart question.  One tough question like, what about the FAA?  What about it killing dogs?  What about people shooting them out of the sky?  There's a million things.  How's it going to land on my porch, which is kind of hard to find?  I think we now understand why Google has purchased Big Dog.

Start time: 861.76
End time: 867.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's to take on the Amazon drones.  Get ready.  We're going to have drone battles in the streets.

Start time: 867.88
End time: 870.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's actually...  You can jump up and down like a whippet.

Start time: 870.28
End time: 923.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They actually are competitors in terms of...  So right now we look at drones as remote control toy flying helicopters.  That's essentially what they are.  They're remote control.  There's a little intelligence.  Even the consumer ones have a little intelligence.  For example, if you just let go of the controls, they hover in space.  But go forward five years and they're just robots that have a different form of locomotion.  And in fact, drones have a superior form of locomotion to a certain extent.  It's much more efficient to go flying through the air than it is to navigate...  Don't have to worry about ice.  Or lots of things.  And so, yeah, there are going to be all kinds of forms of robots that...  Of locomotion for robots.  And drones are going to be great.  There's a lot of research being done, for example, that allow them to fly safely indoors.  So the dog issue and being shot out of the sky, who knows, maybe they have little missiles  that shoot back or something like that.

Start time: 924.29
End time: 931.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, great!  But now I have an escalation.  They're purely defensive, these missiles.

Start time: 931.72
End time: 934.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  That's right.  If there's collateral damage, well, you know...

Transcript:  The CEO of eBay, which does, by the way, a service called eBay Now, delivery of goods  in an hour.  You have to buy it from a local store.  And a personal eBay shopper delivers it.  The CEO on Bloomberg TV, John Donahue, said, we're not focusing on long-term fantasies.  We're focusing on things we can do today.  Talking about the Amazon drones.

Start time: 956.88
End time: 962.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think that's a reasonable point of view.  I mean, you know, it's definitely a fantasy within five years.

Start time: 962.44
End time: 981.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you feel like, though, that is, in the tech industry, famous last words.  Oh, no, yeah.  This stuff is never...  Bitcoin's never going to go anywhere.  You know, this stuff is never going to go anywhere.  I think that's always famous last words.  That Facebook thing said the CEO of MySpace.  That Facebook thing, yeah, it's not going to ever go anywhere.

Start time: 981.68
End time: 1018.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But let's do a thought experiment.  So Amazon is in the massive shipping...  Have you ever seen the inside of an Amazon fulfillment center?  They are moving so many boxes, it's mind blowing.  So let's say, for example, in a single city...  Most of them are my house.  Let's imagine San Francisco and a single day, and, you know, they're still delivered by trucks.  But let's say Amazon's going to ship some percentage of their goods via drones.  10,000, 20,000, 50,000 drones in the sky at the same time flying around San Francisco.  This is not going to happen in five years.  Just from a legal point of view, there's no way this is going to happen.  So...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bezos said we expect FAA approval in 2015, but I think that's just a small amount of the regulatory approval.  They don't even have full of crap.

Start time: 1026.52
End time: 1029.56

It's that great software that lets you meet with clients and colleagues all over the world.  Anytime, this time of year, it's especially valuable.  People are away for the holidays.  They can't get to the office because of the weather, the big snowstorm in back east.  And everybody's getting the flu and the cold.  You know, it doesn't mean business stops.  It just means you meet with GoToMeeting from Citrix.  It's how we have our meetings.  Even if you're just going to do a conference call, we always set up a GoToMeeting because  if you want to share screens, you can.  You just press a button.  And if you want to see each other face to face, you can with their HD faces.  Crystal clear video.  All you got to do is turn on that webcam and your meeting is now a group video conference.  I know a lot of groups that keep GoToMeeting running all day.  It's how they work together.  It's how they collaborate.  You can start or attend a GoToMeeting from any Mac, any PC, smartphone or tablet.  You can even present from an iPad.  So it's that good.  We love GoToMeeting.  We use it.  And we invite you to try it.  Visit GoToMeeting.com and you'll host a GoToMeeting in seconds from your computer or mobile device.  You don't need a credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So I like the idea of doing this, but you're right.  We saw it with P-Pod, which was Safeway's service.  I think that's still around.  Webvan went out of business.  It's hard to do, I think, economically.  I think the economics of it are difficult.  But I guess what they do is they say the 299s are profit.

Start time: 1496.28
End time: 1509.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right?  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, part of the issue that Amazon is facing  is that they actually sell less in terms of revenue  than Costco and any of these other stores,  partly because when you buy from Amazon, you get a box.

Start time: 1509.60
End time: 1511.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wait a minute, say that again.  They make less revenue?

Start time: 1511.96
End time: 1518.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah.  They sell fewer products or less revenue than the targets.  Per order.  No, in general.  In general.

Start time: 1518.28
End time: 1519.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's light margins.

Start time: 1519.82
End time: 1531.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, and a big reason is when you go to Costco,  you're leaving with a car full of stuff.  $500 worth of toilet paper that I don't need.  Exactly.  When you buy something from Amazon,  it's going to be a little box.  It's one thing or a couple of things.

Start time: 1532.26
End time: 1534.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And so they're not that's not economical for them.

Start time: 1534.70
End time: 1552.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Exactly.  So they're trying to come up with ways  to make it economical for you to order a Costco-sized load  of junk or food or whatever it is you're going to get.  And they're experimenting with all kinds of ways to do that.  They say that they have 500,000 items available  through this project.

Start time: 1553.70
End time: 1577.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the problem with Subscribe and Save, which I do use.  That's a service that Amazon's had for some time  that no one knows about it.  They don't even put it on the front page.  And you get like 5% or 10% off because you're ordering it  on a regular basis.  But it's really kind of embarrassing  to have a box that is really the size you could put a pony in,  and it's just filled with toilet paper.  It's kind of a mean, kind of embarrassing.

Start time: 1577.98
End time: 1589.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got a box the other day from Amazon  that had a little bitty thing inside a giant box.  Every time.  What a waste.  I think they're running out.  They have too many big boxes.  And so they put little things in them and ship it off.

Start time: 1589.54
End time: 1592.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You got a micro SD card, and it came in this gigantic.  It really makes me mad.

Start time: 1593.00
End time: 1600.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like not always.  Sometimes the box is the right size for the product.  But every once in a while, you get this huge box.  You think they're just clearing out the stock of huge boxes?

Start time: 1600.92
End time: 1616.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Here's the other part that makes it more economical, though.  In addition to delivering things, they'll also pick things up.  So if you want to return something to Amazon, they'll pick it up.  That means that Amazon can sort of collectivize their ship.  They're already out there in the truck.  Yeah, if you return something to Amazon,  they have to pay for the shipping, right?

Start time: 1617.08
End time: 1618.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So drop it off at the truck.

Start time: 1619.20
End time: 1637.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, this is interesting, John, because they're about to,  apparently, according to USA Today, launch Amazon Pantry.  If you're an Amazon Prime member, you can buy packaged goods  in a set-size box with a maximum weight limit.  So you're paying for the box?  Pantry is...  I don't understand.

Start time: 1637.96
End time: 1656.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So this is another part of the strategy  to compete with the Costco's of the world.  They're trying to...  This is paper goods, canned goods.  Right.  They want to have a maximum limit.  So it's the same price, no matter how much up to the limit.  So they're trying to incentivize you to maximize  the number of things you buy, right?  Because the shipping's the same.

Start time: 1656.62
End time: 1660.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like the post office, when you buy that prepaid box,  you tend to stuff it full of stuff.

Start time: 1660.80
End time: 1672.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You stuff it full of everything. Here's some rocks, whatever.  By the way, this hasn't been announced yet.  This is from...  This is a leak.  Yeah, exactly.  But it's supposedly going to...  All anonymous sources are going to launch next year.

Start time: 1672.86
End time: 1680.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  2,000 items, not a giant selection.  But wait a minute, I don't get it.  Am I paying a flat rate for the box,  or do I pay for the goods in the box?

Start time: 1680.56
End time: 1713.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You pay for the goods in the box,  but the shipping part of it is the same.  And yet another problem that Amazon has compared with Costco  in these places is you're not going to buy paper towels  and stuff like that from Amazon.  It's not. It's prohibitive.  But this invites you to get everyday frivolous items  in addition to the other things you're ordering,  because they make it economically viable for the consumer.  So they're really just trying to...  They're trying to get everybody to quadruple  the number of things they buy from Amazon.  Right.  This is a big market.

Start time: 1714.02
End time: 1724.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  $850 billion a year market, according to USA Today.  The packaged goods market.  Yeah.  But if I'm an Amazon Prime member,  I'm already getting free shipping,  so there's no incentive for me to take advantage of this.

Start time: 1724.46
End time: 1734.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, I believe this, according to these sources,  it's only going to be for Amazon Prime.  So in addition to everything else,  it's an incentive to join Amazon Prime  for people who want this service.

Start time: 1734.68
End time: 1738.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I don't pay shipping on a two-day.  So this is something faster? Same day?

Start time: 1739.04
End time: 1752.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the details on this are sketchy.  It's probably unlikely that Amazon has even finalized  those kinds of details.  There's a whole lot we don't know about this.  All we know is that anonymous sources are claiming  that this is all happening.

Start time: 1753.56

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I go to the store and buy canned goods.  You're mocked. It's not like you were mocking.  Well, why would anyone ship...  This is like Petco, pets.com.  They were shipping dog food.

Start time: 1765.28
End time: 1769.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah, well, I think this is dumb.

Start time: 1772.88

Transcript:  Get out of the house once in a while, people.  I don't want to.  And go to Costco?  Yeah.  I mean, Costco...  It's a nice walk.  It's better than playing golf in a cart.  In the olden days, when I was a golfer,  we used to walk the course.

Start time: 1791.06
End time: 1794.64

Start time: 1794.78
End time: 1801.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 1801.66
End time: 1826.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Costco, actually, is a brilliant marketing strategy  because you have lost leader items.  People think they're getting a deal,  and you can't go in there and not come out  spending hundreds of dollars.  Well, that's usually a couple hundred.  You buy a TV, you buy more toilet paper  than you'll ever use.  You buy a giant bag of peanut butter-filled pretzels.  Do we still have that giant bag?  Because those were good.  And you end up having more stuff than you could ever want.  You go into there to buy a toothbrush,

Start time: 1826.96
End time: 1831.20

Sorry?  So if he meets you, if he meets you,  he will remember, I think it's a salesman trick.  He'll remember you by your shoes.

Transcript:  You know, it's the usual, I have regrets,  but I don't like to look backward.  I have to go forward.  Don't forget, I tripled Microsoft's profits in my tenure.  I introduced things like the Xbox.  They had her, it was interesting,  had her interview Robbie Bach,  who's no longer at Microsoft,  before she talked to,  and Microsoft council,  what's his name, Fred,  before she talked to Balmer.  Yeah.  And then afterwards, she talked to Sacha Nadella,  who is one of the people rumored to be a candidate for CEO.  And I just, it feels like it was very orchestrated.  Francis X. Shaw, the Microsoft PR guys in the room  during this interview.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let me find it here.  Always remember the shoes.  Shoes, yeah.  Don't forget the shoes.  He talks about increasing profits  and all that kind of stuff.  I don't think he really wants to go there,  because if you look at the valuation of the company  from the point he took over,  he took over I think a month after they shattered  the record for evaluation of a company,  and since then it's now a fraction of what it used to be.  So I don't think he's,  from a purely financial point of view,  I don't think he's been successful.  He's probably been the least successful CEO in history.  Really?  That's harsh.  In part.  That is very harsh.  I don't buy it.  Given the competition.  If you look at what Google and Apple have accomplished  over the last few years,  where this huge company,  and instead of peaking and then dying,  they get huger and huger.  They just keep, there's a juggernaut,  and they've been able to reinvent themselves several times.  Microsoft has conspicuously been unable to do that.  They haven't reinvented themselves,  and they've missed everything.  And nowadays- Is that Balmer's fault?  Well, he's the CEO.  Why isn't it his fault?

They want to do a clean sweep and really give them all-  Yeah, good luck.  Give the new guy a chance.  I don't know who they're going to hire, to be honest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's pretty obvious,  even reading between the lines of what Gates said  when Balmer announced his retirement,  it's pretty obvious that every time the long knives  came out for Balmer, Steve said,  "'No, no, he's my guy, we're going to keep him.'"

They should have changed that,  but they didn't, is the point.  And it just killed it.  They were probably locked in on some contract.  I'm sure it had to do with the screw.  Stupid companies, yeah.

If the CEO doesn't see the playing field,  nobody else can.  The team may need to see it too.  Why with the football analogies?  Why?  It's ludicrous.  10 years from now, will devices look the same  as they look today or quite different?  He apparently didn't know the answer to that.  Talent, this is number two.  Number two.

Fred Vogelstein's new book Dog Fight,  about the war between Apple and Google.  These are all on audible.  But sometimes you know you gotta take a break.  You want a little relaxation.  Maybe you wanna listen to a little fiction.  The new John Grisham.  Is that what you're listening to Lisa Sycamore-Roe?  I think so.  You got the new John Grisham?  Wow, that's good.  I like that.  And it's read in kind of this southern style.  The thing I love about audible is the readers.  They get the best actors who bring these books to life.  It's like a movie in your mind.  Michael Beck.

I say read, but really I've listened to them on audible.com.  The Path to Power, The Means of Ascent,  Master of the Senate.

Start time: 2839.32
End time: 2874.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's the real problem, it's really way over covered.  I don't think we need to go.  What we're gonna do, we've decided is,  there's gotta be a cutoff.  There's like a certain number of products  that are worth covering, 10, 20, 30, 50.  It's fewer than 100.  So we're just gonna pick the top whatever,  50 things that you wanna see, and maybe 10.  It'll be TVs of course,  but there's so many Apple accessories,  who cares what iPhone, iPad covers and stuff.  So we're gonna pick the top whatever,  X number of products and just show you those  and say, that's it, nothing else mattered.  That's anything below this line, who cares?  Doesn't that make sense?

They don't make the other tech journals there.  Yeah.  No, they don't, that's the irony.  There's the thousands of these tech journals  and they all go to the same two booths.  It's ridiculous.

They got massive coverage on ABC, NBC, CBS, USA,  they did every tech blog.  We gave him 10 minutes on a vibrating fork.  You're right, it's arbitrary, it's stupid.

Let's talk about this weird rumor that Nokia,  it wasn't surprising that before the acquisition,  Nokia at least threatened to make an Android phone.  In fact, I wish they would.  I think if we get the Lumia 1020 or the 1520 on Android,  I'd hop on it, great hardware.  It's not that there's anything wrong with Windows phone,  it's just that I want to use Android.

So having said that, it's an interesting project.  I personally think Microsoft would be very wise  to allow an Android phone built by the Nokia thing.  Why not?  They make five bucks an Android handset.  Exactly, exactly.  And they should be making Microsoft products  that support Android.  I mean, they did it for Apple for years and years.  I mean, why not?

In fact, Mary Jo and Paul have both confirmed  the next version of Windows,  which is code named Threshold,  will bring back the start menu.  That in effect, Microsoft's saying-  The real start menu is the fake start menu  that they have now.  The real, so they tried it with Windows 8.1.  They brought the start button, which is a fake-  Yeah, it's just the button.  It doesn't do anything.  So apparently, and many sources are confirming this,  and it may happen sooner than the next edition of Windows.  They might even do it in an update soon.  They're gonna put the menu back.

Much, yeah, it's off the corners and so on.  They're also sort of pushing the hardware into it.  They've had these touch pads that sort of are tablet-like.  Who, Apple?  Apple, they have the little, what do they call it?  The trackpad here.  Yeah, and so they actually reversed one of the gestures  to make it more phone-like so that when you scroll up,  it goes up and all that kind of stuff.  I hate that.  Yeah, it's, they're trying to,  everybody is trying to bring the world  from the WIMP user interface, Windows icons, menus,  and pointing devices, to the post PC touch,  multi-touch interface, and it's very, very difficult to do  because everybody's sort of brains have been programmed,  well, people over the age of 30,  our brains have been programmed to use WIMP,  mice and all that kind of stuff.  And so how do you make that transition  without going out of business?  This is what Microsoft is struggling with,  and they did a half-hearted effort  with the whole Metro UI.

Transcript:  if I were not a tech journalist,  I would not be on Facebook.  And increasingly, I find Facebook extremely,  annoying because they're manipulating the feed.  The newest thing Facebook is doing,  and this happened after the Twitter IPO,  I think Facebook said we want to start being a news source.  Facebook lives in, I think Mark Zuckerberg's personality  is looking over at the other guy saying,  no, I wanna do that.  Because everything that's happened with Facebook  is him saying, no, I wanna be more like Twitter.  No, I wanna be more like Google.  It's almost as if they can't figure out  what to do on their own.  So their newest thing is,  let's make the feed more newsworthy.  So the newsfeed is not stuff,  it's not everything your friends post.  Right?  Yep.  It's stuff your friends post  that the algorithm deems newsworthy,  and the rest is just tossed.

Start time: 3704.82
End time: 3753.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They have a confusing strategy.  I mean, Google's approach is to really try,  really hard to understand everything about you  and serve up a combination of a very custom stream of news  and also a thing that is supposed to be like the best stuff.  Facebook seems to be going at this  in a very generic kind of way.  They don't seem to have the mastery  over their algorithms that Google does.  And so they're trying to say, okay,  we wanna tamper down the frivolous buzzfeed type stuff  and turn up the important stories.  And I'm not sure that that's  what Facebook people really wanna do.  We wanna see what our friends and family are up to.  Exactly, exactly.  If you look at what's actually shared on Facebook,  it's a lot of fun stuff.  People wanna, on Facebook, people don't wanna have-  Upworthy.  Big, important things.  They want fun and sort of relax a little bit.

Start time: 3762.86
End time: 3791.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and not more of this.  Right, and it's like, this is,  I think that it's part of,  it's similar to sort of Bezos buying the Washington Post.  These are technology companies  that are just doing these things  and they wanna be more important.  They wanna be a social force for good.  And I think that's the thing, actually.  They have these long-form,  so-called long-form journalist places.  They're trying to bolster the things.  I think they, to a certain extent,  feel guilty about the trivialization of culture.  And it's getting so out of hand.  Oh, please.

And so if you look at all the things  Zuckerben has been doing,  he's got the lobbying effort and all that kind of stuff.  So Mark Zuckerberg is,  this is a guy who only kills his own,  he only eats stuff he kills and all this kind of stuff.  He's still doing that, by the way.  He ate a guy the other day.

And you have to tell me which is which.  The way this poet talks about manhood  has me questioning exactly what it is  or that moment when an actor won't retreat.  Wow, they both suck.  How about this one?  I thought it was a menace to equality  but then I saw this troubling vlog.  That's gotta be machine created.  It's machine created.  And what's funny is that the Upworthy generator,  which is Upworthygenerator.com,  always has a tearful woman as the video thumbnail.  Watch a forgotten LGBT activist become an inspiration  with one question.  Who wouldn't Facebook this, right?  Although I have to say, these are equally Facebook worthy.  That's what really gets me.  And of course, a big share on Facebook button  at the top and bottom.  I used to see a lot of these in my feed  but ever since we talked about this,  I do find that you're right.

They added, first they added video, non, by the way,  autoplay video, both Facebook and Instagram  do the one thing that everybody agrees  you should not do on the web which is autoplay video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah well it's a Hawaiian shirt.  You can't have a Hawaiian shirt  without a hula girl shirt involved.  So now Instagram, so they added that.  Now Instagram has added Instagram direct  and already I saw somebody in my feed  who didn't realize that when he posted a picture  hitting on a girl and then did it to another girl,  another girl, every single person he sent that picture to  could see who else he sent the picture to.

Start time: 4028.28

Transcript:  Apparently according to Instagram,  half of all the people who use Instagram  use it every single day.  That's 75 and a half million.  That's a lot of people.

Start time: 4058.10
End time: 4074.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think this whole Instagram direct thing  is a reaction to a certain extent to Twitter  essentially getting into the Instagram business.  Now the pictures are just showing up in the feed  and Twitter's really pushing the sharing of pictures  above all.

Start time: 4074.52
End time: 4084.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You do realize, I can see how many other girls  you've sent this picture.  By the way, show the picture because he's a sensitive guy.  Yeah, right.  Can you get the whole picture?  I guess you can't.  Mike, that was from your feed.

Start time: 4085.56

Start time: 4094.40
End time: 4098.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And not the first attempt because they rewrote poke  to be a Snapchat clone.

Start time: 4098.20
End time: 4120.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Exactly, it does not self-destruct.  The messages don't self-destruct  and that's the whole point of Snapchat  is that it's ephemeral or whatever.  I think it is a lot like Google+, Pinterest and Path.  It's like Path in the sense that you can only send it  to 15 people.  Path you can send to 150 people,  but the point is that it's absolutely limited  in the number of people who are gonna see this thing  and it's private.

Start time: 4120.92
End time: 4135.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So it's- Your wife and all your girlfriends.  Yeah, exactly.  The risk is that it's gonna make Instagram,  it's just more and more crap on top of it.  And I think that the reason that Twitter succeeded,  or Instagram succeeded, it was simple.  It did one thing, it did it well.

Start time: 4135.48
End time: 4177.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right, they both started as just,  you post something and it's public  and anybody who wants to see it can follow you  and anybody who gets it can share it  and that was a simple model that-  Everybody understood.  Everybody understood.  Now I think that there's a desire,  what's happening is that the kids,  teenagers and young people,  they don't want to be famous.  They don't want to be public.  They want private little circles  and so everybody's worried about the future  of social networks and they see these people going off.  That's one of the reasons that a lot,  you have all these tiny little social networks popping up  and Tumblr too.  This is where the young people are going  so that their parents won't find them essentially.  Having them burn on Facebook.  And this is what Facebook learned.

Start time: 4178.14
End time: 4189.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that's how Facebook started, right?  It was private.  It's hard to monetize.  Ultimately Facebook wants to get your stuff public  and isn't that going to be the same problem  with all these other sites?  How do you monetize Snapchat?

Start time: 4190.20
End time: 4197.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Exactly.  It's very difficult to do.  The whole public model is a great model  because you get people building huge audiences.

Start time: 4199.92
End time: 4201.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So you're saying that this is a response to Twitter?

Start time: 4202.44
End time: 4226.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it is because Twitter got it.  It's the Chicago way, Leo.  Twitter started acting like Instagram  and Instagram is now part of Facebook of course.  So this is a Facebook versus Twitter conflict  for the future of social networking  and they're all going after the teens and the 20-somethings  who really just, they really need to send  to tiny little groups privately.

Start time: 4226.52
End time: 4247.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But we're on the topic.  Let's talk about the blocking thing  that you wanted to bring up.  Twitter changed the rules of blocking.  My approach to Twitter is I block people left and right.  Me too.  I don't go on Twitter to get into arguments,  debates or whatever.  Or listen to bull crap.  I go there for a number of specific purposes  and if somebody wants to,  if they look at me cross-eyed, they're blocked.  I don't care.

Start time: 4249.76
End time: 4256.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, in the past that meant they couldn't read your stuff.  You wouldn't see their stuff  but they couldn't see your stuff.  Unless they logged out.

Start time: 4256.94
End time: 4265.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you could log,  I think you could always log into somebody's specific account  as an anonymous slash your name.  Exactly.  But you have to go out of your way to do that.

Start time: 4265.84
End time: 4280.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The problem is that Twitter,  the conversations are kind of distributed on Twitter.  It's a structural issue.  So if I post something and somebody sees it  and they want to give me a hard time,  they can do that and the blocking feature  just has me with my head in the sand  and my fingers in my.

Start time: 4280.76
End time: 4285.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  In other words, they're talking about you  but you don't know.  Exactly.  Yeah, I don't care.  I don't care either.

Start time: 4285.32
End time: 4295.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  If you look at something like Google+,  where if I block somebody on Google+,  they can't comment on,  the conversations on Google+, are happening on my stream.  They're not happening out there.

Start time: 4295.88
End time: 4301.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's the difference between Google+, and Twitter.  That's right.  You own your stream on Twitter,  you don't have a stream per se.

Start time: 4301.54
End time: 4321.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So for people who are super sensitive about being harassed  or being publicly humiliated or being abused or whatever,  Twitter is probably not a good choice.  You're in public.  Yeah, you're in public.  And you can either close it to everybody  except for those to whom you give explicit permission.  That does exist and that does work to some extent.

Start time: 4321.72
End time: 4334.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And isn't that what Twitter's trying to eliminate?  This is that same thing of making everybody be public  because it's easier to monetize.  They don't want people to have  private Twitter accounts, right?  I would imagine not.  I would imagine not.  That would be the way to get rid of harassers,  though, just go private.

Start time: 4334.88
End time: 4353.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I'm a huge fan of blocking.  Blocking is the greatest thing ever  because people can hijack conversations.  People can, you know, and it's really,  people feel weird about blocking people, right?  Because you think, well, I shouldn't do that.  It's really not nice.  It has to be an extreme case.  I do it because it's not nice.  But allowing somebody.  This is my way of flipping somebody off

Start time: 4353.64
End time: 4354.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  and I bet for you too.

Start time: 4354.84
End time: 4365.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But allowing somebody to wreck conversations  is not nice to the other people in the conversation.  So you really have to, you know,  it's like the old Star Trek thing.  You really want to benefit the larger group  rather than the individual person.

Start time: 4365.80
End time: 4366.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So they did the right thing.

Start time: 4367.48
End time: 4390.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I think it is, I think they did do the right thing.  They basically went from, you know,  the new policy, which they'd now canceled,  simply made it super convenient  for people to harass other people.  It threw the balance of power over to the harassers.  And now they're back to the original policy,  which makes it somewhat inconvenient to harass somebody.  It's still not a perfect system,  but it's better than the one that they temporarily had.

Start time: 4390.90
End time: 4400.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that really has to do with the fact  that people don't understand to this day  that Twitter is a public place.  Yeah, yeah.  And the only way for it not to be  is for you to have a private account.

Start time: 4401.72
End time: 4403.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4422.98
End time: 4448.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But what happens is somebody will start a Twitter account  and they have 20 people following them  and they'll post things and they have the same conversations  with the same tiny group of people.  And then all of a sudden somebody retweets it  and then somebody else retweets it.  Next thing you know, they have a million things  and they're on CNN or whatever.  And it's like they realize, oh my gosh.  It's very public.  Yeah, it's very public.  It's potentially public.  Most people have privacy through anonymity  until they don't.

Transcript:  PizzaBox in our chat room says,  well, you gotta understand,  advertisers are really indistinguishable for harassers  and we're gonna make it easier for advertisers.

Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.  If you're at the post office this week,  you know it's gonna be a zoo.  Everybody who normally doesn't go to the post office,  you're gonna be getting your mail in packages,  buying stamps.  And if you do mailing for a living,  it's very important that you have a way to get the job done  without getting over to the post office  and fighting for parking and fighting for a place in line.  That's why I want you to get a Stamps.com account,  especially right now.  If you sell on Amazon or eBay or Etsy or PayPal,  if you do mailers, if you send invoices out,  it's the easiest way to do it.  Stamps.com lets you buy and print official US postage  without leaving your desk.  From your computer with your printer,  you can print the postage.  You can print stamps, you can print them right on,  sticky labels.  I actually come in here, get stamps printed  whenever I need stamps.  But you can also print right on the envelope.  If you got QuickBooks or you got an address book at work,  it'll take all the addresses to,  it's kind of like mail merge, right out of the address book.  You're taking the company's resource,

Doesn't matter what size it is, they will pick it up.  There's even a button on stamps.com that says,  hey mailman, come to me.  This is so much better than a postage.

Unless you got a crush on that cute postal worker,  that's different.  Where's this?  You told me, and I did not know this,  that every post office is like a franchise.  Yeah, pretty much.  There can be good ones and bad ones.

They're trying to screw the unions.  I mean, the whole post office,  oh, the post office is terrible.  The post office is going out of business is nonsense.  Post office is great.  They wanna kill the post office,  so everybody has to go through Federal Express  and UPS pay twice as much, 10 times as much.  And then also, by the way, the laws about postal fraud  and all the rest of it are out the window.  And now they can open your mail and who cares?

Start time: 4711.04
End time: 4740.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  The thing about post offices that's great  is that they're one of the few aspects in our society  where they are obligated to serve everybody.  Right.  Very democratic.  And we already talked about Amazon,  and so I don't mean to bring that back up again,  but I think that Amazon's long-term strategy  is to cut FedEx and UPS out of the business,  do all the sweet spot deliveries themselves  for the really high volume deliveries,  and then let the post office do all the people out in there.

Whatever the case is, all I know is the Saturday thing  wasn't killed like everyone wanted to do  because of the rural guys moaning and groaning  in front of Congress. Rightly so, yes.  It's in the Constitution.  And so now the Sunday thing is like,  it's like going in the opposite.  And they'll make more money.  Let's hope so.

There's only 1%.  Yeah, that's what they say.  Yeah, that's what they say.  We don't know.  We will never know.

For many of us, read Marissa Meyer's apology.  She uses a Tumblr for her blog.  Yeah.  Even before they bought Tumblr, she used it.  Yahoo mail is- She likes Tumblr.  Yeah, she likes it.  Is a lifeline to our friends, family members, and customers.  This week, we experienced a major outage  that not only interrupted that connection  but caused many of you a massive inconvenience.  I saw articles on all the tech blogs,  how to move your mail off Yahoo mail,  how to start using Google mail instead of Yahoo mail.  A lot of people were upset.  But I guess if you have hundreds of millions of users,  1% is not-  That's a lot of people.  That's gonna- You're gonna hear about it.  Marissa Meyer noted that a confusing  scheduled maintenance error-  Which had some users-  The error message- Oh, I see, was confusing.  It said we're under scheduled maintenance,  which was wrong.  More lies.  Yeah.  But where really, and I've heard from a lot of people,  as hit people, is small businesses that use Yahoo Business.  A lot of them are very upset.  This is a big time for them.  And a lot of them lost business.  A lot of Yahoo Business sites were down.  It really was a bigger mess, I think,  than they're copping to.  On Wednesday, we interviewed the director,  executive director of the Webbies.  Shlain?  No, no, Tiffany's not there anymore.  What'd she do?  She's doing a documentary or something like that.  She's going to- She's going to Hollywood.  Yeah.  But what I was fun, because I went back to the year,  was it the year 2000 Webby Awards?  The year 2000.  In the year 2000.  Actually, it was 1999.  And I think it was 99.  And the Webbies were, it was for technical achievement.  In 19, what was it?  Because it was, it was, was it 99?  Well, whatever.  Get to the point.  I want to show this video.  Oh.  Because it was, Google won it.  Remember, in the early part days of Google,  you were at Tech TV asking people,  what's the search engine you use?

The greatest thing that ever happened to Yahoo,  or she's, or not.  But I think a year from now-  Jury's still out, right?  Yeah, nobody will care a year from now,  as long as they don't have additional problems,  as long as it doesn't become a trend, so.

Transcript:  According to Business Insider,  you know what I want, says Marissa Meyer, to buy Imgur.  This is the image storage site that's used heavily on Reddit,  and I'm not sure what, why Yahoo would want Imgur.  I didn't realize it, Imgur was started in 2009.  It's pretty new.  You're kidding.  Yeah. I didn't know that.  It feels like it's been around forever.  Right.  It was started by Alan Schaff,  who was a student at the time  at University of Ohio at Athens.  He made the site as a gift to Reddit  because he was annoyed at how hard to use  the web photo sharing sites were.  So what do you think, a billion dollar payday for the kid?

Transcript:  Let's try.  No, maybe not.  AT&T CEO Randall Stevenson,  remember he's the guy who said,  the biggest mistake I ever made  was unlimited data on the iPhone.  Now he says,  we're not going to be able to subsidize these phones anymore.

Start time: 5277.94

End time: 5285.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5285.72
End time: 5328.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  They make so much more money on subsidized phones.  People have no idea how much they're paying  for that new iPhone, a new Android phone.  They think it's 99 bucks.  Right, exactly.  And the remainder of that, they're not, it's not-  It's a monthly fee, baby.  Folks, when you subsidize something,  that means you take money from someplace over here  and you give it to people over there.  That's what a subsidy is.  What AT&T does-  It sounds like communism.  They take money from you  and then they give you back less of what they took from you.  That's what they're calling a subsidy.  It's not a subsidy and this whole thing  that they can barely afford it  feels to me like a publicity stunt  to make people feel like it's a good deal.  It sounds like they're really intending to do the opposite.  By the way,  Yes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll give you a different one.  Okay.  This is the only way I can do honest reviews.  I don't know.  No, this is it.  You gotta get it from me.  This is the reasoning that CEO of AT&T gave.  He says, smartphone penetration is at 75%.  Soon we'll be almost all the way in,  reaching 90% penetration.  That means we don't have to be as aggressive  in the device subsidies.  He says, when you're growing the business,  you're aggressive,  because you're trying to get people on the network.  But as you approach 90% penetration,  there's a dirty joke in here somewhere.  You move into maintenance mode.  I could think of five.  That means,  that means more device upgrades,  and the model has to change.  You can't afford to subsidize devices like that anymore.  I can't imagine people spending 600 bucks on a phone.  No, I think those things are over.  As soon as he turns off the subsidies,  nobody's gonna buy a phone.

Start time: 5444.10
End time: 5449.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the prices are coming down so drastically  they don't need to do this anymore.  I think it would be a good phone, 200 bucks max.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The Moto X you can get now on Republic Wireless,  off contract, 179 bucks.  Yeah, there you go.  That's the price.  Is that the G or the X?  That's the X.  The G's even cheaper.  Yeah, I don't know.

Start time: 5462.50
End time: 5530.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  All right, so you don't think this is greed on his part?  I think they're casting about for a model  that's gonna take them into a future  where lots of people are buying off contract phones.  And the whole subsidy thing  is a way to hide the actual costs.  Who knows what the value is.  It works.  It has worked.  It's for consumers.  Absolutely has.  And so somebody did the breakdown  and it's pretty stunning if you think about it.  So let's say you get an iPhone and you get it subsidized  and let's say they subsidize 400 bucks on that iPhone.  So divide the 24 months of your contract by the $400  and that's what you're paying each month.  So as soon as you've paid it off, right,  and you don't get a new phone,  if you don't get a new phone,  you're still paying that money for that iPhone  month after month after month.  Three years.  Right, as soon as it's paid off for the two year contract,  they don't reduce the price  by the amount that they were charging.  That's the profit.  It's a golden goose for them.  I just don't believe that it's like a big financial burden  for AT&T to subsidize phones.  You're right, this bull crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It might be though what he's saying is,  but you know what, people don't keep it after,  the minute the two years is up, they buy another phone.  They buy another phone.

End time: 5568.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They wanna keep you.  So here's another thing AT&T's doing.  Would you pay, okay, here's a question for both you guys.  If you could get gigabit internet service, gigabit.  I can go for that.  $70 a month, but here's the catch.  You have to participate in AT&T internet preferences.  That means AT&T may use your web browsing information,  like the search terms you enter and the web pages you visit,  to provide you with relevant offers  and ads tailored to your interests.

Start time: 5568.82
End time: 5573.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or would these ads show up?  Would they just show up, contact all over my screen?

Start time: 5574.24
End time: 5629.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so.  This Nebu ad, well, maybe it's not Nebu ad.  Remember Forman Nebu ad, which were very controversial  and finally had to stop doing business in the US.  Okay, so this is from GigaOM, Stacy Higginbottom writing.  Stacy says, we use various methods.  He or she asked AT&T, how does this work?  AT&T's response, we use various methods  to collect web browsing information,  currently reviewing the methods we may use  for internet preferences program.  Whichever method is used will not collect information  from secure or otherwise encrypted sites,  like banking, thank you, very nice of you AT&T,  or when a credit card's used,  and we won't sell your personal information  to anyone for any reason.  AT&T does not plan to overlay ads  on top of a site's existing ads.  It will instead use its targeting abilities  to deliver better ads.  In other words, they provide that information  to ad networks.

Start time: 5629.90
End time: 5648.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  There's no such thing.  So back to your question, if all that was true,  if they kept their word, I would be entirely in favor.  You would do it?  Yeah, absolutely.  70 bucks?  The headline says spy on your searches,  but in fact, what they're doing  is they're just giving you more relevant advertising.  I'm doing what Google's doing already with my genome.

Start time: 5648.16
End time: 5650.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5651.85
End time: 5656.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

I think AT&T is already selling your location information  to whoever comes along. To the government, to the feds.  Well, they'd probably give it to them for free.

Transcript:  I do.  Okay, okay, so you would not take this deal.  Here's what I would do.  I would take the deal, but I'd find some hacker buddy of mine  and we'd jerry-rig the thing,  so they'd get phony search stuff,  and I wouldn't get ads at all.  They'd be shunted off to somewhere and say,  oh yeah, he saw that ad, sure he did.  And if phony clicks...  So you'd steal from them?  I wouldn't be stealing.  Yes, it would.

The National Library of Norway is digitizing  every book in its collection,  processing the text to make it searchable,  and then saying it's online.  I guess this is also happening in the UK and Finland.

Transcript:  You know what is actually kind of interesting?  England did this.  They let Microsoft scan, what was it?  Was it a British magazine collection  or newspaper collection?  And they have now posted all of the scans.  Microsoft gave it back to them after they scanned it.

Start time: 6246.98
End time: 6265.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, why did this happen?  Because Microsoft gave up on the scan.  They gave up and said, just take the crap.  They not only gave up, and they gave all the stuff  through in the public domain, literally.  Gave a bunch of it to archive.org.  They just gave it away.  And then they abandoned all the scanners.  So if the library had a scanner, they gave it to them.  What kind of thinking is this?

Start time: 6266.04
End time: 6291.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think they were trying to compete with Google  and then they realized.  So the British library had millions of images.  All of them are now on Flickr.  And what they're trying to do,  this is on what they call Flickr's, Flickr.com.  Flickr.com slash British library.  And they want to crowd source what this stuff is.  I mean, this is amazing stuff.  This is taken from page 111  of Through Massai Land, third edition.

Transcript:  There should be a lot more of this kind of thing going on.  Nobody does this stuff better than Google,  and this is what freaks out a lot of countries.  So Microsoft got out of it, right?  Exactly.  I mean, everybody should know  that when you encounter the recapture thing,  what they're doing is you're working for Google for free.

Start time: 6400.40
End time: 6426.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a problem.  I agree with that, but I disagree that Google's doing.  Microsoft had a much better product.  You could do universal searches on all the books.  If for that two year period where this product was out there  and Microsoft was scanning books,  if I was a grad student, I would have totally kicked ass  because I could look through the entire collection  that they had scanned for specific quotes  from all these different products at the same time.  It was astonishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was on the committee to digitize the assets  of Yale University some years ago,  and they actually had used Microsoft to digitize a lot of it.  And the rules, I think, were a little bit more stringent  with Microsoft than they were with Google.  Microsoft wanted to own it for a while, not forever,  and they would eventually give it back  as they have done here with the British Library.  But I think Yale decided to go with Microsoft.  Well, Cal Berkeley did too.  Yeah, probably a lot of universities.  And then the initiative ended.  But you're saying they got the hardware, probably.

Start time: 6465.52
End time: 6477.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they did.  But when they took the thing,  they eliminated that search engine.  That's the thing that made the thing so powerful.  So they give all this stuff to archive.org.  There's no search engine now.  It's just a dump.  It's just a dump.

Start time: 6477.20
End time: 6484.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You'd have to go through all this stuff.  So that's what's going on at this Flickr site.  And what they're hoping is that they can crowd source  at least some of this information.

Start time: 6484.68
End time: 6505.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  But see, this is something Google would be really good at  because Google is developing algorithms  to identify what is in pictures.  I don't know that they've been able to turn it on  woodblock prints or whatever,  but you can see where that technology is going.  It's just a matter of time before machine intelligence  will be able to identify what's going on in the picture,  what the error is with the clothes.

Start time: 6505.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My takeaway from this is that the sense of humor  has really changed.  Many of these are cartoons.  Oh, no, it's hilarious.  Look at these old.  This is from Gleenings, how I once went down the middle.  I don't, this is funny, apparently.  Right, it's hilarious.  Culture, it's like what?  I'm sure that there's a lot of cultural background.  It changes rapidly.  Isn't that fascinating though?  When I was a kid, I subscribed to Punch Magazine  because I, and I didn't get any of it.  I just thought it was interesting,  something that was apparently humorous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it is a little cross reference  because I could click here  to see all the illustrations in this book,  click here to browse other illustrations  published in books in the same year.  But they're hoping people will tag them.  No one's gonna help tag anything.

Start time: 6595.88
End time: 6601.76

Transcript:  Yeah, no kidding.  This is a boon for Tim O'Reilly.  All public domain.  I don't see an X resolution, Y resolution,  one in one, that can't be right.  So the X if data is incorrect obviously.  It'd be nice to know.  There must be a way to download the original, but I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have been to some of these press conferences  and I talked to them about it and they said,  no, autonomous vehicles suck.  They do.  It's the network car that you want.  And then I talked to their,  they have a consultant that's actually  at the University of California.  And I talked to him for, I did an interview with him  and he said, no, autonomous vehicles,  50 years from now they're never gonna work.  And I've always thought there was something.  The thing is that-  They can't take a chance on that thinking.

Start time: 6713.38
End time: 6735.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Exactly.  And it's not binary anyway.  It's not like there's a fully manual car  versus an autonomous car.  Cars are already semi-automatic, semi self-driving.  My car does a lot of stuff.  It does a lot of stuff and they're just gonna keep  adding those features and every time they add more features,  they get safer.  And so that just greases the wheels.  And the insurance industry, in fact,

Start time: 6735.32
End time: 6759.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  this is being done in conjunction with  the University of Michigan and State Farm.  The insurance agency, it's only my time  if insurance companies say,  hey, we'll give you 50% off your insurance  if you drive a vehicle with these autonomous features.  Or maybe not.  No, maybe it's- And what I learned the other day,  maybe you told me that in order for the Google Autonomous Car  to drive a road, it has to first be scanned with LiDAR.  They can't just drive down any arbitrary road.  They have to prepare and create a map

Start time: 6759.74
End time: 6787.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  and then have to load that into the car.  Years ago, I think it was like 10 years ago,  my son Kevin over there and I  went to the DARPA Grand Challenge.  Remember that? That's fun, yeah.  And it was the first one. Those are autonomous vehicles.  It was the first one.  And I don't think any car made the whole track.  And these were cars that were trying to navigate  these little dirt roads.  And it was hilarious.  They had a motorcycle that fell over.  There was one that went upside down.  Some never made it off the starting line.  And nowadays, the Google Car has gone all these miles  without a crash and all that kind of stuff.
