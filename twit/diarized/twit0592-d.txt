So clearly Bob Dylan's too cool for school and it's not going to go right.  That's why he didn't go. But here's the question.  Eight hundred thousand dollars. Do you give the lecture?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's where should we kick off this show today?  Is it was there a big story this week?  I think the funniest story is Samsung saying in a few days on December 19th,  they're going to send an update to note sevens that will basically turn them into bricks.  You won't be able to use a note seven unless it's plugged in.  They're effectively rendering it useless.  But the funny part is when Verizon said, yeah, we're not going to do that upgrade.  First of all, how many note sevens are still out there?

Start time: 369.62
End time: 391.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  They say the 93 percent have been turned in.  So this is in the United States.  And so I think that in the US, they sold about two million.  So whatever, 93 percent of two million.  And 40,000, that's a lot.  I guess it totally it's I mean, it's it's not nontrivial.  I don't know how many of those are on the rise.  The network, I think, is probably a better question.

Start time: 395.51
End time: 402.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I have to say, I haven't seen a lot of reports of Galaxy Notes bursting into flame.  So maybe these are the ones that are OK.

Start time: 404.04
End time: 427.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I mean, I don't think you can say that.  I mean, I think that clearly Samsung doesn't believe it.  Right. Well, it neither does the Consumer Safety Product Commission,  and neither do any of the other agencies around the world.  So they definitely want everybody to turn them in.  And that's why they want to issue this update.  I think it's interesting that Verizon won't do it.  And they claim that it's because of the holiday season.  Let me read the quote. Yeah, sure.

Start time: 427.96
End time: 460.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because, yeah, that's what they're that's what they're saying.  And I think that's funny because they call it a software upgrade.  I not an upgrade.  We will not push, says Verizon, a software upgrade that will eliminate the ability  for the Note 7 to work as a mobile device in the heart of the holiday travel season.  We do not want to make it impossible to contact family,  first responders or medical professionals in an emergency situation.  That's reasonable.  Although Samsung said we would prefer that people's houses  don't burn down during the holiday season, too.

Start time: 461.38
End time: 543.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, in the Federal Aviation Administration has said we would prefer  we're actually going to insist that these not be taken on airplanes.  So holiday travel season, unless you're on an airplane, in which case  every major airline will tell you before you get on board,  you're not allowed to have it.  And if you do have it, you need to put it in a special,  you know, flammable proof bag that has to be in your line of sight at all times.  And, you know, and then then dispose of it.  So I don't know.  John Gruber had kind of an interesting aside on this.  He said, you know, why didn't Verizon push for them to do this sooner?  I, you know, I think that's probably fair.  They definitely they pushed out some similar bricking updates in other countries.  I think I don't think it's OK that Verizon is doing this, to be honest.  I think that whatever whatever opinion you have over a company  taking this course of action to brick a phone.  And I certainly understand the point of view, which is to say,  I bought this device.  I'm the one who takes the risk when it does become a safety issue.  I understand making the decision to to brick the phone.  But although I get the broader concerns with what I bought, I didn't really buy.  But I don't really like a carrier stepping in and taking the unilateral position  of usurping what the company wanted, because if they're doing it in this case,  they're they're basically Verizon is basically claiming that that for their  on their network, they're more important.

Transcript:  They may not want to get sued by somebody who's  a heart attack and couldn't call 911 because their phone won't work.

Start time: 551.44
End time: 555.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, but I mean, they've given them many, many opportunities to return the phone.

Start time: 555.90
End time: 568.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They've taken both of them.  His parents still were using note sevens until like last week.  And they finally stopped because they said, you can't make a call.  You can't do anything every time you do anything on the phone.  There's a pop up saying, please turn this phone in. Please. Right.

Start time: 568.26
End time: 656.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, you know, I mean, I mean, I think part of it comes down to  has Verizon done a good enough job of getting people in themselves?  I mean, I know that in Australia, Samsung, New Zealand and some Australia,  you know, we're we're issuing we're sending out updates very, very quickly.  And we're getting all the carriers on board to constantly send notifications.  So part of me wonders is, is was Verizon not really doing  enough to get people to turn their phones in and making it as easy as possible  to turn your phone in?  I know that early on with the first recall, not the second complete recall,  it was a nightmare for customers to even exchange their phone.  And so you could understand why people wouldn't want to go through the hassle.  But at this point, I mean, it's not just a safety concern.  It's a safety concern.  So I kind of don't like the idea of a carrier saying in any situation,  we're going to unilaterally refuse to allow,  you know, we're going to we're going to be the gatekeepers to decide  what can and can't be issued to your phone, because if they could do it  in this instance, we also see them do this in instances of software  updates that need to be issued.  You know, like Apple's the only company and Google through, you know,  well, I guess through the pixel, but, you know, historically through the Nexus line,  who could kind of bypass the carriers and you see certain phones  that are sold like those like the blue phones that had malware on them.  And carriers, you know, they'll issue out an update,  and then the carriers will let the updates through.  And so I just I don't like a carrier ever stepping in and saying,  we're not going to issue an update  to this phone for whatever reason, I don't like the precedent that sets.

Start time: 656.90
End time: 796.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But this is what Verizon has always done.  This has been their their modus operandi on on every phone.  It's one reason why I stopped.  Verizon is the only US carrier that I can use, because here in my office,  it's the only one where I get a decent signal.  And they would not issue updates for the Windows phone that I owned.  I mean, six or nine months after Microsoft had released it,  they were still refusing to to issue a major update  that that the phone desperately needed.  And I finally just threw up my hands.  They've done that with with Android phones as well.  Yeah, for not a good reason, for no good reason,  for for no good reason whatsoever.  To go back to something that you said, Leo, I wanted to  I wanted to pile on a little bit there.  You know, you said maybe maybe these are the safe phones that are out there.  I read an interesting analysis of the problem with the Note 7 the other day.  There was a group of of material analysts  that had done some micro photography of the phone,  and they had basically determined that Samsung in their desire  to make a phone that was as thin as possible,  had basically not left any expansion room for the battery in the case.  And all batteries expand.  You know, it's only it's only a micron or two or three.  But you have to leave some expansion room.  And so what that means, if their analysis was correct,  is that this was eventually going to happen to every phone.  All of them. Yeah.  And that the first phones that that they discovered this flaw in  were just they were they were the canaries in the coal mine.  But, you know, this was going to happen, you know, more and more often.  And probably increasingly, you know, as you hit the one year mark.  And, you know, you really started feeling the heat on these battery packs.  So, you know, just a just a terrible, you know, I  I just can't imagine that Samsung's brand is going to remain.  You know, he's not going to suffer major damage from this event.

Start time: 796.62

Transcript:  Is Samsung ever say why they haven't they haven't figured it out from the last?  They don't know.

Start time: 804.56
End time: 837.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, there was the whole thing early on where they like  spent some time researching it, and yeah, they didn't give us.  I figured it out.  Oh, I wonder if this is going to be a warning sign to all manufacturers  where, you know, maybe we should stop making phones as thin as possible.  And maybe we should look at other things, because when you take that  together with something like fast charging, which Samsung has also been pushing,  thanks to their chips and I think some Qualcomm chips do that, too.  You know, that that's that's a lot of that's a lot of power  happening very quickly in a very in a really tight environment.  And that could be a problem.

Start time: 838.60
End time: 869.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The last thing I'm looking at, this is a tech Times from September.  Samsung says, at least in the Chinese phones,  could remember at first, they said, oh, well, you don't have to worry  about the phones in China because they use a different battery.  And then there were fires.  And they said, well, that was from external heating.  Not the battery.  This is but I think it confirms kind of add your supposition  that it's just there's no room for expansion.  Right. And the bad everything that warms up gets bigger.  And not right.

Start time: 870.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever goes up must explode.  Well, anyway, one hundred thirty three thousand to one hundred  forty thousand people still have note sevens December 19th,  unless you're on Verizon, which case you're good.  Just keep using it. Why not?  Now, you guys, when you flew out from Milwaukee, did they tell you  that the airline say don't if they announced no note sevens?  They did say it because I talked to somebody yesterday, said  when we flew out, they didn't say anything.  So some airlines have thrown up their hands.

Start time: 908.62
End time: 947.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was on at least a half a dozen flights last week.  We did a nice vacation and there were there were at least six flights  involved and on every single one.  There were extended safety  advisories about the note seven.  And, you know, and they they didn't say anything about putting it in a bag.  Or anything. What they said is, you know, if you have one,  you have to alert the cabin crew and, you know, you can't turn it on.  And it must be, you know, it must be out where we can see it at all times.  But, you know, and but every single one had a full speech  that they gave on it.

Start time: 948.78
End time: 962.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And as you say, this has got to be bad for the brand all around.  Can't imagine now we're hearing rumors that I don't think it's a rumor.  I think I'm sure it's true.  Samsung will announce the S8 in March at Mobile World Congress.  Right, Devendra?

Start time: 963.46
End time: 980.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I assume so.  They normally do it.  I mean, they've they've had like several of they've had separate events, too.  Right. So that's the thing.  Mobile World Congress hasn't been the sort of big phone  announcement event for a very long time.  But I don't know, maybe they'll need some of that partner help this year.

Start time: 981.78

Transcript:  I think they have to kill the note name.  I think it has to be done.  Yeah, I think you I think you have a product that is exactly the same  as the note in every single way, but it has the pin.  It has the pin. It has everything.  Huge success. But you can't call it a note.  I mean, sure. I mean, when they first the note, the original note,

Start time: 1001.12
End time: 1008.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  everybody laughed at me when I got it.  And then by three years or four years later, everybody had a five inch,  six inch phone. Everybody. Sure.

Start time: 1010.84
End time: 1016.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they also got smaller, too.  So it wasn't the screen size.  This was the actual physical form factor.

Start time: 1016.24
End time: 1029.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Screens got bigger and bigger, but the bezels got short, smaller.  And so the phone got smaller.  In fact, that was one of the things that was great about the Note 7 is  it was smaller than an iPhone 7.  Feels great with a bigger screen, the five point seven inch screen, a bigger screen.

Start time: 1029.68
End time: 1038.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I noticed that too about the Pixel XL.  It just feels really good in your hand, especially compared to like the iPhone  six plus or the seven plus.  Like those things way too big for me.

Start time: 1040.83
End time: 1058.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I feel bad for Samsung.  I think Samsung's doing everything they can.  I just it's so ironic that Verizon is going not so fast.  And think of the liability if one of these phones,  the Verizon phones does have a fire cause of problem.  It does seem like interesting about this.  Yeah, they're putting themselves in the line of fire.

Start time: 1058.56
End time: 1061.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It sounds like this may be partially like a lawyer decision, too.

Start time: 1061.44
End time: 1082.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like maybe they did the math and like we're figuring the circumstances  of somebody who's going to be fired.  It's like they're figuring the circumstances of somebody not having access  to their phones versus it is a small chance of a fire, but it's you know,  it's still a chance of a fire.  So I don't know.  I feel like I can't say too much before the Verizon sniper is getting me.  So because technically I work for Verizon.  Right. Wait a minute.

Start time: 1083.58

For instance, a big tech summit on Wednesday.  President-elect Trump is bringing in the big guns.  Larry Page, CEO of Alphabet, Tim Cook, CEO of Apple, Facebook CEO Sheryl Sandberg.  Zuck is not going.  We'll be attending the tech summit, perhaps even, according to Rico, Jeff Bezos of Amazon.  Although Bezos, one of the people Mr.  Trump doesn't like too much because he owns the Washington Post.  Satya Nadella will be there from Microsoft.  Chuck Robbins from Cisco.  Of course, Jeannie will be the Jeannie Rometti of IBM.  She already has stepped up to volunteer to help in any way with any databases  that the president would like to create of any kind.  Brian Krasnich of Intel and.  Safra Katz, who was apparently the CEO of Oracle, although you don't hear a lot.  She's the co-CEO, co-CEO, because that other guy probably is Mark Hurd.

In common, he tweeted based on the invitees named here at Peers Public  US tech companies with a market cap greater than 100 billion were invited.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think that what some people were saying in Rico's report  and Kara Swisher's reporting, and this is true, is that they they went for Obama  and they went, you know, for past presidents.  So even if you disagree, you go, you know, the president elect asks, you go.  And so even though a lot of these CEOs have publicly supported  positions and people that are completely opposite Trump,  you know, you're invited, you go.  And even though, you know, Trump has had, you know, battles  and has threatened boycotts for companies like Apple.  Yeah, you you show up.

Well, the New York Times was on the record, but the one that was off the record  where all the anchors went. Yeah.  And the executives, he told Jeff Zucker how terrible CNN was.  And you people were biased against me.  So you do kind of wonder, like, is he going to, you know, is this  going to be another one of these meetings where it starts out with Trump  airing the airing of the grievances?  You know, how dare you?

You almost expect cameras outside and then, you know, Tim Cook going,  well, I hope he likes me.  I don't want to be kicked off the island.  And I mean, it just almost feels like that a little bit like somebody  somebody 10 will enter, but only nine will come out kind of a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ouch. We'll see. I don't know.  There is there is, however, a a fairly well  established dynamic in the way that that Trump operates.  You know, multiple people have commented on this, which is that  his decisions tend to be heavily influenced by  the last person that he talked to.  So you want to get his ear. You want to get in.  So you want to be in the room and you want to make sure that if you have a thing  that you want to have, have it in the room where it happens.  Yeah. That you say that.

Transcript:  So that's the other tech story  having to do with the election and the president elect.  By the way, the CIA and the FBI seem to disagree on this,  but the CIA has apparently said that it believes Russia was trying to help  Donald Trump win the White House.  And their evidence for this is that they now are concluded.  And the intelligence community seems to mostly agree  that the Russian government hacked both the Democratic  National Committee and the Republican National Committee,  but only released the emails of the Democratic National Committee.  The president has now asked for a full investigation  and a report before he leaves office on January 19th.  Don't know what to say.  I mean, it's you know, it's it's clear that there's hacking  on both sides. We hack them. They hack us. Right.  What would it mean if foreign government attempted to  influence American elections?  And what do you do about that if they do?

Start time: 1674.94
End time: 1694.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, I see a lot of people like smarmily pointing out,  oh, the American government's done this forever in other countries.  And we deserve this.  We certainly have thrown elections in the past.  The CIA, in fact, has thrown elections in the past.  But I think we can separate that issue with this one, which is that,  oh, my God, the country is on fire.  And yeah, we get we get to do something about it.

Start time: 1712.16
End time: 1731.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Like, that's the thing. A lot of people have been asking.  So, OK, the CIA says Russia has basically pushed our election.  And Trump, like what we know, like he has had close ties to Putin.  He spent a lot of time defending Putin.  So where do we go from here?  We don't have the mechanisms to do anything really.  There's no precedent. It's disturbing. Yeah.

At a time and place of our time, we won't tell you what we're going to do,  but it will match the impact you had on us.  That seemed to be kind of almost a hollow threat, but it was clearly a threat.  I mean, don't mess with our elections.  Hacking is going to this will be 2017 is going to be very interesting year for hacking.

Start time: 1796.48
End time: 1815.86

This is this is as far as I know, 100 percent accurate.  So power grid and pump gas transportation.  It is ironic, isn't it, that the agency that we  created to.  And has actively overthrown other governments for years  is now calling foul on the Russian government.  And the and the course of Trump team  denies has known it didn't happen.

Start time: 1900.42
End time: 1976.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, they didn't just they didn't just deny it.  The the press release that they should be three sentence press release.  Each one of those three sentences was, in fact, not true.  So it was three sentences, three lies.  But more importantly, it  normally we have institutions in this country.  And you may disagree with the work of the institutions,  but the intelligence community is composed of professionals.  And and what Trump and his people are basically saying  is that they disagree with all of the output  from the intelligence community from community.  And now his people were saying today, well, we're just going to put our own people in.  And and that, to me, is actually the more frightening thing.  It takes a long time to to build up  both the defensive, especially the defensive capabilities  for for this kind of thing.  And if the new guy comes in here and,  you know, upsets the game board, just just, you know, throws it up in the air.  That has the potential for very, very serious consequences.

End time: 2063.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think anybody who looks at this, if you see that 17  agencies in the U.S. intelligence community basically agree  that there was some kind of activity by the Russian government,  even if you disagree on the scope of that and the impact of that.  It's not time to move on. It's time to investigate it.  And any and even if you benefit, it benefited from it in a normal election.  After a normal election result, the winning candidate would say,  I agree completely with this. We should have a full investigation.  I don't think the winner writes the history.

Start time: 2063.42
End time: 2066.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Right. So I think that this goes away in January 20th.

Start time: 2066.70
End time: 2101.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They would control the investigation. And so they would go then.  Oh, I see. Of course, we're going of course, we're going to set up  an investigation because that's what you do.  And then you have a rubber stamp of an investigation.  And you can just, you know, bury it.  And you and you let it go on and nobody comes up.  But by saying by saying  vehemently as Trump has done, this is not true.  How does he know that? Right.  How does he know this is not this is not true when, you know,  thousands of analysts, you know, have been working on this well with.  And we should point out it isn't unanimous.

Start time: 2102.68
End time: 2118.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A senior US official said there were minor.  This is according to the Post.  There are minor disagreements among intelligence officials  about the CIA's assessment, in part become because some questions remain unanswered.  Sure. Sure.  They, for instance, don't know if the Kremlin directed  this. Yeah.

Start time: 2120.32
End time: 2138.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But but when the guy but when the guy says this is not true  and he's only participating in even one out of six intelligence  briefing, who is telling him that this is not true?  The same people who told him that there were three million  illegal aliens who voted in the election.

Start time: 2138.80
End time: 2158.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The question is, is it not true because it's not true  or because you don't want it to be true?  But this probably explains why Obama said, let's  well, let's have an investigation now.  And you're going to have to report to me  in the next few weeks because I'm going to be out of here on January 19th.  And so are many of you, probably.

Start time: 2158.20
End time: 2161.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Start time: 2161.96
End time: 2189.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So, OK, so let's ask the next two questions.  First of all.  What do you do if they come back and say, yeah, no, it's true.  I mean, I don't know what they're going to do that's different.  They've already said it's true.  What are you going to do? How do you what's the what's a response to that?  Can you can't fix it?  As you say, Devendra, we're in a situation where we have no.  This is uncharted precedent.  No. What is the response?  You can't do the election over.

Start time: 2190.10
End time: 2195.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you could. There's this is something that we got.  The founding fathers do not anticipate.

Start time: 2196.74
End time: 2203.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, either it's all up to the electors or I don't know, like  I could see some sort of other electors vote.

Start time: 2203.24
End time: 2233.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The electors vote in five days or whatever.  It's the 19th.  I mean, so I don't think that.  And I also think, you know, a number of states have said  and have laws, probably unconstitutional laws, but laws  that say the electors will be prosecuted if they are faithless,  if they don't vote, as been as they've been told to.  So I wouldn't anticipate any reaction from the electoral college.  It's too soon and it's illegal in some cases.  And I'm sure there's probably debate, internal debate over all this.

Start time: 2233.74
End time: 2308.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In most cases, in most cases, the electors were chosen  because they were they were a slate that supported the candidate.  And so they're they're among the most enthusiastic supporters there.  So the likelihood that you're going to get enough of them  to to to to flip and vote their conscience on an issue like this is  is is unrealistic.  So, no, we're in, you know, we're basically it's a it's a.  So I'd say two things.  Number one, it's a genuine constitutional crisis, because, as you say, the,  you know, the founders didn't know about Twitter.  They didn't know about fake news.  They knew about fake news, but they didn't know about Facebook fake news.  And, you know, they didn't they didn't know that.  The other thing, though, that's a that's a that I think is  the more likely outcome of all this is that the incoming administration  is about to discover the power of entrenched bureaucracies.  Which are capable of acting independently.  You know, when you when you have hundreds of thousands of people  within an organization, you you know, you can bring in a few new people at the top.  But I don't want to replace them wholesale.

Start time: 2308.80
End time: 2440.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't want to conflate.  So a lot of people in the chair are saying it's over Trump won.  I don't want to conflate a political debate over who won or who should have won  with the appropriate conversation we should have about  if we're being hacked by a foreign nation, what do we do about it?  That's the right the technical conversation.  So let's I I would hope we would still have this debate  no matter who won the election.  It's not a matter of, oh, we don't like the result.  Let's figure out a way to overturn it.  It is not that it is.  What do we do if a foreign nation has the capability of  doing this? How do we respond?  Now, the the capability, first of all, is not traditional hacking  in the sense that they may be hacked the voting machines.  It's a case of them.  Prop of propaganda, frankly, of of them hacking both the DNC and RNC,  looking for information from both and then selectively using WikiLeaks,  releasing the information that was in favor of one candidate against another.  That's kind of an indirect way of influencing the election.  Although there is a larger concern  that maybe they got something from the RNC  that they can use against the RNC. Right.  And blackmail them.  I mean, I don't I don't know.  So so there is it.  There is a there's a national security  issue at stake here that goes well beyond who won the election,  who didn't win the election.  So I don't I don't want this to be people to miss.  It would be a mistake for us to act as if and people from people  to misinterpret it as if we're saying, oh, well, Hillary should have won.  It's not that it's really a question of, well, are I mean, what's going on?  If if if Russian government actors and the way they do this, by the way,  is not this is part of the debate inside the intelligence services,  as I understand it, is not whether the Kremlin did it or not,  because they use they use third parties, they use Guccifer 2.0  so that they can have plausible deniability.  But really, whether if if any nation tries to influence us.  How do we defend against it? Right.

Start time: 2440.92
End time: 2451.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And this is this is tough, too, because even if we do a redo vote,  you know, in that miraculous event, the damage has already been done.  You know, like the well, that's exactly what you don't want to do.

Transcript:  So let me ask you, I mean, those of you say, oh, you're sore losers.  Is this not a legitimate conversation?  No matter what happened in the election?  Precisely. Is this not a legitimate conversation?  Should we not be concerned about foreign governments hacking?  Are you saying, oh, it didn't happen?  Or are you saying, oh, you just sore losers.  We won. Get over it.  Which is, by the way, those are the two sentences that came from the Trump

Start time: 2505.82
End time: 2560.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  campaign is. And the reality is, is that if this had happened,  if let's say that the situation was reversed and Hillary Clinton won  and we got the same report, let's pretend that happened.  Let's pretend that happened.  We would be having this exact. I would hope so.  I know that we would.  And if anything, it would be the fervor would be 10 times,  10 times harder where we would actually probably be having more of a substantive  conversation about what this means for the future rather than the very same.  People are saying the sore loser talk would be leading the opposition  to do as thorough as an investigation as possible and talking about as you  as you've all been saying, like the broader implications of a different  state interfering with our election.  That's a very, very serious issue.  Regardless, like take the politics out of it.  That right there is something that's that's problematic and it's troubling  and is something that should be definitely investigated.  And I don't know what we can do about it, but certainly I would say we can't.

Start time: 2561.62

Transcript:  Yeah, we can't stop it. Exactly.  It's pretty clear that we can't stop anybody from.  We have we have.  We were basically helpless in the face of governmental hackers,  just by the way, as they are in the face of our hackers. Right.  Is that not the case?  Pretty much. Pretty much.  It seems software is imperfect.  Let's see if we can let's see if we can do this in a logical  a software is imperfect.  Agreed. We stipulate that. Sure.  Imperfect software will always have some form of exploitable  security flaw.  Can we stipulate that? Sure.  A state actor determined enough with enough resources,  resources, including their own intelligence, but also the ability  to spend millions of dollars with on other hacking teams and security companies  buying exploits.  That's really where I think a lot of this comes from.  If you have millions of dollars to spend, you can gain these exploits.  And there.  I mean, this is the question we ask at Security Now all the time.  Is it possible to fully secure anything?  Now, obviously, Sony Pictures Entertainment was not secure,  but they but we were able to point fingers at an IT team that basically  said, oh, security, but that's not worth the money.  We don't care.  Actually, it wasn't the IT team.  It was the management said, we don't care.

Sheldon Adelson, a very wealthy man, right,  runs the back end casino operations in for many casinos in Vegas.  Macau is where he made all of his money.  Lots of money, presumably virtually unlimited resources.  And Iranian hackers were able to hack  the sands back end, which ran the casino operations in many of the casinos  in Vegas and steal from it.  Now, if you can hack a guy who has unlimited funds  and a very strong motivation to secure the back end of the casino operations.  I saw Ocean's Eleven.  This is stuff that you don't hack if they can't do it.

Transcript:  It becomes an it becomes an emotional response and a distraction.  Historically, large nations have had spies.  It's been just what gentlemen did for for hundreds of years.  You use spies to get information so that you could make better decisions,  so that you could know what your enemy was thinking,  what your friends were thinking, even.  It's one thing to get information and use that information to make decisions.  It's another thing to get information and use that information  to influence the course of business or the course of government.  So I would take the example.  Imagine that that the Russians had hacked, say, ExxonMobil  and that they had then used the information to compromise contracts  with ExxonMobil, making it easier for a Russian company  to win a lucrative, multibillion dollar contract.  What would the American response be in that case?  I think I hope we would be outraged at the fact that a foreign nation  was interfering with what we like to think of as the free market.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sure, there's things that can be done, but they're  they're they're the same kinds of things that have been done to spies  behind the scenes for years, and you don't read about them  until typically 30 or 40 years later.  You know, after the the, you know, the classification  on it expires and most of the people involved in it are dead.  And and the handful, you know, who are who are left can can talk about it.  But this is this is just this is exactly the same.  This is just a different dimension for the same kind of activities  that have been going on as long as people have been running governments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a very good point.  We've actually seen, I think, a lot of recent spy movies.  That's kind of been the plot, right?  It's like getting the information out there, making it public.  And and they just assume all hell will break loose.  And that's kind of what's happening, too.

Transcript:  Well, I'm going to I'm going to end the conversation  because everyone says you're talking politics.  We're we're absolutely not.  But this is part of the reason why this conversation  isn't going to go much farther.  And that is because people have decided that that's politics.  And it's not it's about la la la.  It's yeah, I'm not hearing you because you're talking.  It's not it's about whether a foreign nation or frankly, us, whether  it's cyber warfare.  And I really I think that we need to think about that.  And if you if you who listen to this show don't think about it,  I guarantee you nobody else is going to think about it.

Transcript:  Well, the other thing to say, the other thing to say to those people is, look,  the people who are making that argument that this is all politics.  They say, look, the fact that the actors on the other end  of this operation have managed to wrap this up in politics  so that we can't respond to it in a traditional and rational way  is part of the problem, a very large part of the problem.  And somebody has to step up.  And it's going to take people from multiple sides  to be able to say we need to be in a non-political approach to this.  But there are there are national security implications involved  and a hell of a lot of technology, which is why we're talking about it here.

Transcript:  I you know, it's moving right along.  There is a really interesting conversation and we won't have it today.  But there is a really interesting conversation  about whether we have entered a new era.  A couple of things have have  created this situation, but a post fact era  where partly caused by the Internet's ability  to create a filter bubble around whatever you want to believe.  Combined with just kind of an onslaught of information  that is very difficult to vet.  So essentially every piece of information, true or not, has equal weight.  The lack of this is an interesting thing.  You know, when I was growing up,  there was kind of a national consciousness  because we all watch the same TV shows at the same time  because you couldn't tape them.  And so when people come into work and talk about what Johnny Carson said  last night or you would have all been watching the Beatles at Sullivan's.  There was this kind of interesting situation  where the national conversation was kind of we were all talking about the same things.  Now, I don't know if that's a good thing or not.  I think you can make a strong case that wasn't such a good thing  because who was controlling that conversation?  But now we're having a thousand different conversations  and you basically decide which bubble you want to be in  and you join that bubble and you don't hear anything else.  And I do think that we are kind of entering this post fact era.  And I don't know what that looks like.  In the future, I mean.  You know, you hear terms like moral relativism.  Well, when now we have factual relativism.

But what is real reality?

Transcript:  I think we're at a point where like  I think librarians and people who study that sort of thing,  that sort of like media training, because I remember back in high school and college,  like that was kind of where you started learning about, you know, good sources,  you know, how to find a good source for your reports and everything.  And I wonder if we need to have that at a national level,  maybe taught alongside civics, which is also not taught that much anymore  in high school. But yeah, there's so much stuff going on.  Information is moving so quickly and we kind of have to teach people  to be aware of that and figure things out.

Transcript:  You know, it's not that propaganda is any there's anything new about propaganda.  Right. Right. Fake news is not new.  You know, but that fake news goes back to hundreds and hundreds of years.  But what's different is the power and ability to spread this information,  the ability that people have to choose an isolated, you know, to put them.  I put the filter bubble for years because I said, well, come on.  You know, ultimately, the Internet gives you so much information.  Some of some variety of information is going to leak through.  You always have at least the opportunity.  And in many cases, regardless of your choice, you're going to get other points of view.  Now I'm starting to think maybe there maybe that's not true.  Maybe we really we we live in the world we want to believe in and live in.  The reality we choose.  Isn't that what all of this technology is kind of pointing us to is  choose your own reality?

The better the better for the bubble, the better, the better for the bubble.  And I think and there were several people who criticize this graphic,  you know, saying there's actually a fair amount of purple.  There's a lot of purple all the way to the to the left.  But the the really interesting thing there is that bright red thing.  And and this aligns with the thing that we heard from the these kids  in Macedonia who were making, you know, thirty thousand dollars a month  building fake news sites.  They said we were building, you know, this is this is who we were.  This is who we were targeting.

This is it's not just look, it's going to be all of us at some point.  This is this is where we're this is where Twitter and Facebook  and everybody are pointing us.  Isn't it? I mean, I think it depends on a lot of things.  It's self feeding.  And that's the thing, if you've ever played, if you've ever played  Conway's life or whatever, or Osmo, this looks like Osmo, it is self feeding.  It gets bigger and bigger.

I think I can guarantee it, modified it  so that even though I was following all of those, Facebook watched my tendencies.  Which stories do you read?  And not not in an attempt to to propagandize me at all,  but an attempt to to maximize my spent my time spent viewing  gave me more of what I liked.  So even if you try,  you get you get funneled in  based on what you read.  This is a problem for journalists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The thing is, like we there have definitely been some valid complaints  against how the social algorithms are like leading us and when it comes to news.  But these sites were never meant to be like news readers, right?  They're not like Google Reader used to be or an RSS reader.  It's not just pure data.

Start time: 3455.94
End time: 3486.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So I think that's giving them a little bit more of a break than they deserve,  because it became very quickly, very early on, as soon as they started accepting.  I mean, Twitter, especially.  And I think Facebook, as soon as they had the news feed  and started allowing other links into it, I think that you have to start  considering, you know, and once you start making algorithmic changes  based on what people will see and what they'll like and you start personalizing  things, I think that those companies, they can't just say they're tech companies,  you know, they they're they because they are media companies.  Well, I'm not saying it's not a media company.  I know you're not. Yeah.

Start time: 3487.48
End time: 3496.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Transcript:  Because it frankly, more to the point, the media industry,  I think all of us included have we rely on Facebook for a.  That's where your links come from.  It's where your links come from. It's where people find you.  And so it's easy to say we should stop relying on Facebook for news.  But the reality is it's a big part of Facebook's business.  And it's a big and Facebook is a big part of the news business.

Start time: 3522.68
End time: 3551.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's really an interesting and it's a very open ended conversation  because I don't think there's any answers or certainly no easy answers  to any of this.  And I do think we're entering a different era.  And I do think that Twitter and Facebook have a lot to be responsible for.  I really do. Maybe less so Twitter, because Twitter  inevitably is a little more diverse.  It's it's Facebook that really so actively cultivates the feed.

Start time: 3551.84
End time: 3600.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, the Twitter, I would say, you choose who you follow.  Yeah, you know, so Twitter, in some ways, it's more diverse.  But in a lot of ways, you explicitly choose who you follow.  So they don't although they do it now in the mobile app.  You know, they they have historically not done what Facebook does,  which is personalize the feed and kind of determine what you should see.  They haven't made those sorts of judgments, although, again,  they are doing the mobile app.  But instead, it's become much more self selected.  So, you know, depending on who you follow, that's what you see.  So in some ways, you know, they haven't had to answer  as many of the questions that Facebook has, because, you know, Facebook,  so many people share so many different things.  And you can if you like one thing, it can.  Yeah, I don't know.  I guess I just see it. They're slightly different. But yeah.

Start time: 3632.82
End time: 3689.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, and and and  I think we have also the conflict that started out in the early days of the Internet  of the Web anyway, with which is better, an algorithmic,  completely mechanical presentation of information or a curated  presentation of information like the old Yahoo lists and the original  Moz feeds, you know, things that were where you had experts do those.  And that was fine when the you know, when the Web was four thousand pages, it's,  you know, it's literally impossible now.  But the reality is that Facebook has become a huge newspaper  that publishes a new edition every 20 microseconds.  And there have to be human editors involved in that process,  even if they're just backstopping the algorithms to avoid things, things going wrong.

And I think what we also mean,  I think you thought that might be self-correcting, but it also turns out  that there is a financial incentive to create fake news, which I don't think  a lot of people saw coming.  I know I certainly didn't that you would that there would be as much of a financial  incentive. Yeah, we did.

Start time: 3770.28
End time: 3789.59

You can make it go viral.

OK, one of the things that we've learned, though, in in all these years  is that any tool that you put out there  is going to be abused by completely amoral actors.  Right. As quickly as possible.  So that's how we got viruses.  That's how we got that's how we got ransomware.  That's how we got advertising scams.  And so it was completely predictable.  If you look at the evolution of who used the technology out there,  the only difference between journalists like, you know, those of us  on these screens here and these fake news guys,  is that we have a, you know, a professional code and morals where  where we actually have a line that we draw where we say, OK, I can't do that.  I can do this.  And, gee, I want this to be a really sexy headline.  And I know maybe it's slightly misleading.  Just old fashioned. That's just old fashioned.

Somebody, you know, did a screenshot of that.  Zuckerberg's article with two fake news ads next to it.  I mean, it was just like you can't get any more perfect than that.  And and there ultimately, when you get down to it,  all of this technology has is being monetized in ways that if you take  if you take the morality out of it and you take the the the controls,  quality controls out of it, you end up where we are now.

Transcript:  We want to talk about my mattress.  Hey, at least I sleep well at night.  Thanks to Casper.  That's important.  Get a good night's sleep on your Casper mattress.  There are some amazing things the internet has brought us.  And this is a great thing.  There are some amazing things the internet has brought us.  And this is an example of you don't have to go to a mattress store  and lie on a mattress in broad daylight with a salesperson staring at you  going, get your shoes off my mattress, let alone rolling around,  maybe bringing your honey and doing a little smooching.  You don't get to test a mattress at the mattress store.  As a result, you get it home and well, good luck.  With Casper, you're testing your mattress at home for a hundred days.  You get a great deal on a mattress that's obsessively engineered  in the United States for outrageous comfort.  It's really, it comes in a very compact box.  You open it up, smells beautiful.  It breathes.  You sleep cool at night.  It's comfortable.  And you will love it.  It is literally changing the way people shop for mattresses.  Look, they got a dog mattress.  It's so cute.  I want you to go to casper.com and check out these amazing Casper mattresses.  If you decide you want to get one, I'm going to get you 50 bucks off the mattress.  You can get, it starts with $500 for a queen all the way up to a cow king size.  50 bucks off when you use the offer code TWIT.  You got to go to casper.com slash twit.  It is a trial.  So if I had a, even in a hundred nights, you say, yeah, they will come and they will get it.  You don't have to fit it back in the box.  I promise they will come.  They will get it.  They will take it away and return it, refund you every penny.  The design story behind the Casper is fascinating.  They spent a lot of time, did a great many prototypes, 108 prototypes, a hundred plus formulations.  They were looking for firmness, airflow, density, transition temperature, rebound speed and odor.  I swear to God, these things are important.  And I have to tell you, they got it right.  But you don't have to take my word for it.  You can try it.  And if it's not perfect for you, you got plenty of time to return it.  Designing the perfect mattress, casper.com.  You should spend a long time just slash twit.  There's the co-founder lying on the mattress.  That's how that's the testing right there.  Casper.com slash twit.  Use the offer code twit for $50 off terms and conditions apply.  You will love Casper mattress.  We're talking tech.  Hey, the latest thing and I wasn't joking is the ear pods, the air pods, Apple's air pods.  Remember that was it?  I don't know if it was real or fake.  I have a pair. I have a pair.  Yeah, everybody has a pair.  The journalists have the pre-production pair.  Yes, we do.  But they're not in the stores.  And I think this is a big deal since Apple took the headphone checkout.  You got to think they want to get these air pods out into the market.  But does anybody know where they are and why?

Start time: 4407.92
End time: 4455.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  The closest report, so there's a Wall Street Journal story that basically says that they were having it.  It kind of completes a few things.  It kind of makes some suppositions about the fact there might have been some manufacturing problems,  which John Gruber's sources kind of confirms that they've had a hard time kind of mass producing them.  And then the journal goes on to kind of suppose they might have had some issues getting the two pieces to independently talk to one another.  Because how air pods work versus a lot of other fully wireless earbuds is that each bud has an individual wireless signal to your phone  rather than how a lot of them work.  Not all of them.  Some of them do what Apple is doing as well.  But how a lot of them work is that you pair one is paired to your phone and the other is paired to the other bud.  And so that can lead to some lagging.

Start time: 4456.49
End time: 4457.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you noticed that on yours?

Start time: 4457.76
End time: 4495.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, my air pods, they're fine.  But what I found with other purely wireless headphones is that they can't have a lag issue because one of them is paired to like the left ear is paired to the right ear and the right ear is paired to the phone.  And in the case of air pods, they're both paired to the phone.  So they both have an independent signal coming.  And so the journal story kind of intimates and says that it's possible that they could have had a problem with some of the radio stuff and the Bluetooth stack.  I guess that's possible.  The pre-production ones, which they gave to journalists, which are obviously not the ones that have been mass produced, have been fine.  I mean, I haven't.

Start time: 4496.06

Transcript:  Nobody I know, Renee Richie, nobody I know you has had a problem with them.

Start time: 4502.48
End time: 4531.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So what John Gruber's sources have told him is that it's because it's been more of a mass production issue, which could make some sense.  You know, I think that this is this is a different type of product for them and they might have run into some production problems, regardless of whatever the reason is.  It certainly is not great that something.  Three months.  Three months and that was touted that was supposed to be out in late October and was then delayed.  You're not going to have it out in time for Christmas.

Start time: 4531.80
End time: 4535.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's a bigger deal, right?  Because this is a perfect stocking stuffer, even at one hundred fifty bucks.

Start time: 4536.16
End time: 4585.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Oh, it's a perfect stocking stuffer.  And for a lot of people, they want them.  And so, yeah, I mean, you know, Gruber's sources say manufacturing problems at scale.  It doesn't matter what the reason is.  The reality is we're not going to get them in time for Christmas or borrowing some sort of miracle.  They're not going to be done in the next two weeks.  And and, you know, the I think that Apple had introduced them obviously right as kind of a way, I think, to lessen the sting of getting rid of the headphone jack.  In all honesty, I think that most people who have an iPhone seven haven't really had that much.  I know I haven't had a problem.  It's one of those things that the included adapter worked well.  And I actually got a pair of new Bluetooth headphones recently that have the W10 chip.  Oh, really? Yeah, I got that.

Start time: 4586.02
End time: 4587.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 4597.20
End time: 4610.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So let me ask you this, and I don't know if you noticed it, but in my opinion, Bluetooth headphones do not sound as good as wired headphones.  There's a compression that just doesn't that it's the music isn't as open.  It doesn't it doesn't feel as good.  It's fine for voice.

Start time: 4611.41
End time: 4612.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I think that it depends on the pair of headphones.

Start time: 4613.12
End time: 4636.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think that there are certainly four hundred dollar pair of Sennheiser Bluetooth headphones because I said, well, maybe you're right.  Maybe it's just because I'm buying cheap Bluetooth headphones and I bought a lot of them, including Beats.  And so I said, well, let's get the top of the line.  The most expensive ones I could find were the Sennheiser's.  Everybody raves about the same exact thing.  It's there's some sort of it's not.  And that makes sense because you got you don't have a lot of bandwidth.  You got to compress it a little bit.

Start time: 4636.98
End time: 4646.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So it depends on the source to write because if you connect those to a MacBook for some reason, OS X has aptX support for Bluetooth.  But IOS.  Oh, so listen.

Start time: 4650.96
End time: 4655.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a little better. Yeah, it makes it's less compression and higher quality all around.  OK, I'll try that.  I'll do it on my.

Start time: 4657.16
End time: 4670.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  What I find sometimes like I would say this, I would say that a four hundred dollar pair of wired headphones are certainly going to sound better than a four hundred pair of Bluetooth headphones.  But a decent pair of Bluetooth headphones will probably sound everybody's good as you know, like a decent pair.

Profit.  So there's I think there's two there's two motives.  I think you know what's really sad.  I think you're going to see other companies do the same thing now because they're slaves

So it comes with these earphones that look just like ear pods like they look identical to your pods.  But it has a USB-C jack instead.  And you know the rumor is that the S8 is going to not have a headphone jack after Samsung made hey about.  Oh, yeah, our phone has the headphone jack.  But the S8 is reportedly not going to have it either.  So I mean, yeah, I think you're right.  I mean, people just follow the.  Wow.  They just follow Apple.  Follow the leader.

It's really going to depend on third party to support.  And unfortunately, that comes kind of like like comes out like horse touch.

Transcript:  I kind of think it doesn't ever become useful because it's just you know, we're all taught to touch type to not look at the keyboard.  Right.  That's what Miss Krasinski told me in ninth grade.  Do not look at the keyboard.  And so I'm looking at the screen and there's nothing and I'm not looking down at the keyboard.

Transcript:  Nobody's taught to type anymore.  I think people just kind of get what they like.  I know a lot of people, young people who don't type properly.  They're still doing two fingers, too.  So it's it's kind of tough.  But I guess my bigger issue is that they spent so much time on that touch bar and not unlike actual functional things that professional users may want in a MacBook Pro.  That's where it's getting kind of worrisome, like just having USB-C ports, which love that you can't even connect, you know, the iPhone.  By the way, those sorts of things are ridiculous.

Transcript:  It's cheap. It's 250 bucks.  It's very cheap.  And so here's the thing.  I did a battle between that and the OnePlus 3T.  And the OnePlus 3T is because their specs are almost identical.  And the OnePlus 3T is a better phone.  But it also can cost, you know, in some cases, one hundred and fifty dollars more.  Is one hundred and fifty dollars better?  No, I think that the the the S3 Pro or the S Pro 3 is a it's a very nice phone.  I don't love some of the excuse me, the L Pro 3.  I'm sorry. I'm wrong.  They have an S3 Pro or something that's even cheaper.  But the L Pro 3 can sell for, you know, like three dollars.  Yeah, but it is often available for three hundred because they have this like little rewards program.  And so for a three hundred dollar phone, I think it's very good.  There's some software things I don't love about it.  And that's I think that like I would definitely install a different launcher on it for one day.

And, you know, that's impressive.  So I think that for a few hundred bucks less.  Yeah, exactly.  I mean, I think that for a lot of people, like you get the pixel, you know,  because you want to be part of, you know, get the pure Google experience and all of that.  But I certainly wouldn't think that it would be worth spending more than twice as much.

And that's and that's why so many of these Chinese companies are starting to really impinge  on the market that Samsung and LG and HTC have historically had with phones that instead of being six hundred fifty seven hundred fifty bucks,  they're selling for three hundred two ninety nine to three ninety nine.  Where from a functional hardware point of view, they're they're almost identical.

I mean, this is this is the problem with Android.  You know, Google made that deal with basically letting the carriers worldwide have control over this stuff.  And so they can't they don't have any control.  And the OEMs that matter, too, so they don't have any ability to push stuff out.

This is the one and only defense against ransomware, against human error,  against acts of God. It's cloud backup.  If you go to carbonite.com, you get it for Mac or PC.  You can get it for home or office. They've got a lot of different plans.  They even have a plan where you get a physical hardware device.  So you have a local backup and then it backs up to the cloud.  That's of course for businesses. They got server backup and more.  But in every case, you can try it for free and you don't have to give them a credit card.  So it's one of the it's a real free trial, not one that's going to trick you into getting your renewing or whatever.  Go to carbonite.com and give it a shot. Automatic backup.  You don't have to think about it. You pay once a year or even once every two or three years if you want.  And then you're just done. It's backing up whenever you're online.  You can get to your stuff anytime. It's always a nice feeling.  I don't like backup solutions where you can't tell.

You can do it on your on your devices.  It's got all the features you're looking for for business as well as for home.  Very affordable. The home plan. Fifty nine dollars a year for everything on a computer.  That's less than five bucks a month.  They have backed up half a trillion files now.  More importantly, they've restored. I can't remember what the number was.  It was like five billion files restored.  That's five billion files that would be lost forever if people weren't using backup.  A million and a half homes and small businesses trust carbonite.  And all I'm asking is that you try it free. Go to carbonite.com.  Do use the offer code TWIT when you do it. You'll get two free months when you buy.  Carbonite. You got to back it up to get it back to it right.  With carbonite.  PewDiePie. What's going on?

According to Forbes, and this is again, I guess because nobody's talking, PewDiePie made $15 million last year on his channel.  That's before subtracting management fees, taxes. It does include, I think, subsidiary income, right? Not just directly from YouTube videos.

Start time: 5636.48
End time: 5650.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Is you have to have that scale. You have to have that level of commitment for it to work.  And that's why it doesn't work for most people.  But I think when you have that many subscribers and any video you put up is going to get, you know, minimum of a million or a couple of million views, then you're in a different category.

They are the real celebrities.  And then it goes into the other things.  I think they're full on fandoms for some of these YouTubers. Full on.  And that's incredible.  That's incredible.  So I think that there's a certain disconnect for those of us on this panel where we don't spend all of our time watching all of our content on YouTube.  We still use traditional media stuff.

And so many of them, if you really like, as much as they talk about how much they love and they, oh, I just need to do the YouTube thing.  As soon as you give them the opportunity to be on a more established platform, they jump. They will go.  And you know what I mean? Like Miranda Sings is a perfect example.  You know, she got the opportunity to do a Netflix show and who would say no to that?  But it just, to me, there's a certain amount of, I have to kind of laugh because I'm like, oh, you keep talking about how this is the future and regular media is dead.  But any of them, if they had the opportunity to do more established media, to be on regular, on either broadcast or cable or do a movie or, you know, be on Netflix or whatever, they would take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For us, there's no point in merging them. They're both successful. We just want to make sure that both sides benefit from each other.  So that's why we brought the apps, you know, Google Play from Android over to Chrome OS.  And then, for instance, the update mechanism from Chrome OS to new guy.

Transcript:  Thanks, Leo. Here's a look at just a few of the stories that we'll be watching in the week ahead.  It's a little quiet because we're getting close to the holidays. But here's what we got on Monday, December 12th.  Microsoft will begin to allow Oculus Rift owners to stream their Xbox one games into the VR headset by way of the Xbox one streaming to Oculus Rift app.  Nice app name there, Microsoft. Also, if you're one of those eagerly awaiting a big update to Pokemon Go, prepare for an infusion of new Pokemon on the 12th.  Fans have been hoping for the inclusion of Generation 2 Pokemon. We'll see what they get.  I say they because I stopped playing months ago. But in games I might actually play a heck of a lot of news.  Nintendo is set to release Super Mario Run to the iOS app store on Thursday, December 15th for $9.99.  Expensive for a mobile game, but those who've played it mostly say it proudly carries the Nintendo level of quality throughout.  That was a lot of gaming news. Anyways, there's other technology news.  Megan Moroney and I will be covering all of this and a whole lot more all week on tech news today, each and every weekday at 4 p.m. Pacific.  That's a look at the week ahead. Back to you, Leo.

Transcript:  Thank you, Jason. Don't forget tech news today. Your daily dose of tech news Monday through Friday, 4 p.m. Pacific, 7 p.m.  Eastern Time, 2400 UTC on Twitter. TV.  Our show today brought you by Wealthfront. Look, if you're PewDiePie and you're making $15 million a year, you got to sock some of that away for your old age, like when you turn 30.  Then what are you going to do? Wealthfront is about saving long term investments, not saving a savings account or buying a CD, but really investing your money.  So there'll be something for retirement, for college, for buying that first house.  You could, of course, put it in a stock market, get a stockbroker and get a wealth advisor and have that person.  First of all, I always ask the question, well, if you're sitting in this strip mall with a little sign out front saying wealth advisor and you tell me how to invest, why are you still here if you're so smart?  What are you doing here? And by the way, those guys charge you one, two, or even 3% of what you have under investment every year.  That means you have to make 3% more to break even? Not going to happen. Wealthfront is a part of a kind of a revolution.  They call them sometimes robot investors. It's a computer doing the work, but a computer that's been trained by some of the smartest minds in the business.  People like Burton Malkiel, who wrote the Random Walk Down Wall Street, and Charles D. Ellis, the investors guy.  These guys, the people on the board at Wealthfront have the most incredible backgrounds.  And so you're getting the benefit of their knowledge.  And it's built into something that checks your portfolio, not every week or month or year or even every hour, every minute, constantly, constantly in reinvesting, doing things, very sophisticated things like tax loss harvesting that maximize your returns, minimize your tax bill.  And you're going to see the benefit. And all of this comes not for one, two, or 3% of what they manage, but one quarter of 1% a year.  And there are never any commissions or hidden fees. They're not investing on their account. They're helping because it's a computer. It's helping you.  Wealthfront's portfolios are based on modern portfolio theory designed to adjust according to your risk tolerance while staying diversified and tax efficient.  This is the stuff you need.  You can, by the way, they have 529 college savings plans, like Roth IRA for college.  They have 401k rollovers. You can rollover your 401k. They have Roth IRAs. They have traditional IRAs, trust accounts, joint accounts, individual accounts, long-term investment.  This is not day trading. This is for money you're going to put aside for that rainy day.  They're making $3 billion now almost in client assets, and they grow all the time. They're really good. This is the way to do it.  And I'm not even telling you to invest. I'm saying just go to Wealthfront.com slash twit.  You can go through the question and answer process, the few questions that they ask. Get a free investment portfolio designed based on those questions for you, what they would start you with.  You'll see the customized allocation they recommend for your time frame, your risk tolerance, all of that.  And you can get started if you decide. That looks pretty good. You can put as little as $500 in. That's how you start. That's all.  But I have to tell you, your first $15,000 is free of charge, not a quarter of 1%, but free forever.  But you've got to go to Wealthfront.com slash twit.  This is a really great solution. This is the hottest. I just read an article in the Wall Street Journal that says people like Schwab, they're terrified by this company.  It changes the whole equation. It puts the power in your hands. Wealthfront.com slash twit.  Talking about putting the power in your hands, Amazon's got a new grocery store where there's no clerks.  How many people are going to lose their jobs for this? You go in, you walk in the store, you scan a barcode on your phone, pick up what you want and walk out.  That's it. They've got the sensors they have in Vegas and the mini bars, but they also have cameras.  So somebody can't just pick up a bottle of cherries and put them in your bag. You get charged. This is wild.  Now there's one already in operation in Seattle near Amazon's headquarters, but I think more to come. What do you think?

Start time: 6588.36
End time: 6622.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You've got to bag yourself, but I think that's like a bodega, like a stop and grab.  Honestly, this would be great because there are plenty of times when I go into a Duane Reader or a CBS or something and I just want to diet coke.  I don't want to have to and then you have to wait in this long line. You walk in and you walk out.  Yeah, that would be great. To your point, obviously, I don't love the implications of what this means for the service industry.  I don't like to think that people will be out of jobs, but I personally, selfishly would really like to just be able to walk into a bodega and walk out without having to wait in line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, those things have gotten better, but the self scans have definitely been the next step towards a situation where you could just go in and walk out.  I mean, losing cashier jobs is one thing. I forget who had the stat, but it's like one of the most prolific jobs in America right now.

Transcript:  This is a huge thing in New Mexico as well. People who come and visit here, my wife and I talk about this all the time, but people who come and visit here, you can tell that when the tourists are in town because they show up at the grocery store.  And the person who's in front of them in line is talking to the checker. How you doing? How's Maria? How's Joseph doing?  And they have this conversation and they're going, can you speed it up? And it's like, no. The whole point of this is these are people who live in a community and they know each other.  And there is a human interaction going on here. One of the things about Amazon Go that bothers me is two things. Number one is it's just more stuff to track us with.

Start time: 6730.90
End time: 6738.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, everything is... Don't you think they already do that though? Come on. See, I was going to say I'm not bothered by the tracking because if you have a loyalty card, they already know everything.

Start time: 6739.20
End time: 6741.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I bet Ed didn't and I've never bought a loyalty card.

Start time: 6743.73
End time: 6750.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, none of the stores that we go to use loyalty cards anymore. They don't even have them.  So you don't get those.

Start time: 6750.80
End time: 6761.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The thing I hate about loyalty cards, if you go to a Lucky or Safeway here, they charge you like 20% more because you don't have a loyalty card. I don't see it as like the loyalty card is giving you a discount. I see you getting penalized.

Start time: 6763.42
End time: 6812.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They are basically paying you to allow yourself to be tracked.  You know, so that's one thing that bothers me. But the other thing that it goes back to the conversation we were having an hour ago, which is every form of technology like this eventually winds up being abused by people who don't have scruples or morals.  And I just I wonder if they've thought through the implications of this.  Well, that's why they're doing it in Seattle first because everybody's nice in Seattle.  Well, yeah, but Amazon is good at this kind of thing, you know, and they'll do a few of these things.  But if it if it heads out, you know, you get the you get the companies that aren't so good at it.  And I don't know where it I don't know where it goes. But there's there's just opportunities for this to go bad.

Transcript:  Three million jobs, according to Roland zero zero in our chat room are three million checkers in the U.S.  That's a lot of jobs. You add that to the people who drive, which is one point four percent of the job market, they're going to be losing their job.  I mean, I just and all this does is create just absolute disruption. And yet I think it's inevitable.  I think technology doesn't stop because it's going to cost jobs, doesn't it?

Start time: 6841.44
End time: 6884.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, it doesn't. Yeah, automation is it isn't moving jobs offshore.  That's that's that's caused the loss of jobs in this country.  Ninety percent of the jobs that are lost have been lost to automation.  In some cases, the automation is offshore. In most cases, it's it's right here.  But, you know, that's that was the case in the 19th century and the 20th century.  And it will be in the 21st century as well. Automation takes takes people's jobs.  And we we should be thinking about what the next step is for the people whose jobs go away, because they if they don't have education and skills to step into something that replaces it, then we're creating economic chaos.

Start time: 6885.66
End time: 6920.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and the jobs we're talking about being a truck driver, for instance, is one of the highest paid things you can do without a college degree.  Cashier is a is a is a classic entry level occupation.  But those go first. By the way, this is the Bureau of Labor Statistics.  Lovely picture of a cashier checking out the flowers.  And it's just a communal experience. Never going to have never not going to be like that anymore.  You just kind of go and take what you want. But those are the jobs that go first.  But I don't think it's the end of the line by any means. I think more and more are the jobs.  Look, you guys, you're writers. Your your livelihood is threatened.  We're already seeing automated sports writing.

Start time: 6920.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't want to write that. Right.

Start time: 6933.78
End time: 6984.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me like extrapolate from that information. You could repeat the press release or whatever.  So that sort of thing is fine.  I do think we need to have a more ethical consideration of like where these jobs are going, you know, because a lot of people in the country are worried about jobs going offshore or immigrants coming in and taking your jobs.  It turns out it's really progress. It's really automation that's going to be doing that.  Like Ed has been saying. So what do we do about that?  We have to be aware of it and can have to know either as a society, we need to do something better.  Some people have talked about this being like a good reason to have.  Maybe we should think harder about the the minimum, you know, what do you call it?  The minimum income or something like them? Yeah.  Secured income for everybody.  Never happened. Guaranteed income will probably never happen.  But I think that sounds like a good idea, especially if all this stuff is getting automated.

Start time: 6985.66
End time: 7010.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There is some controversy over guaranteed minimum income as well, though, because what tends to happen is you give people a cash payment, but you eliminate every one of their, you know, health care.  Food stamps, head start, you eliminate all the other programs because that's how you fund it.  And that nothing could possibly go wrong.  It gives somebody a thousand dollars a week and say, spend it any way you want.

Start time: 7011.60
End time: 7017.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Hopefully an automation rich society could afford to do that.  You know, if we're saving so much money by automating our work.

Start time: 7020.35
End time: 7029.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Except that's not what would happen, because instead the companies, the automation rich companies are the ones who make money and those executives and the people at top.  We're already seeing the consequences of income inequality and it's only going to get worse.

Start time: 7032.84

Transcript:  Tax the automators.  Steve Kovacs is going to be on the show next week, I think, but he wrote this week in Business Insider, wearables are dead.  Poor Pebble.  Pebble is dead.  They've been basically, it's sad because Pebble, at one point somebody was offering $740 million, right?

Start time: 7058.78
End time: 7065.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's the rumor.  I don't know how that, if that deal was real, that's accurate.  I don't know how.

End time: 7066.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They turned it down.

Start time: 7067.42
End time: 7092.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, because I don't know how a board would let you turn that down.  Even if you think, even if like you wanted to say independent, I don't understand how your board of investors would be willing to say, yeah, we're going to turn this down.  So there's something fishy about that to me.  There's something about that that just doesn't seem right because if you genuinely had an offer like that on the table, I don't see how you ever in any circumstance would be like, yeah, well, we're going to keep going.

Start time: 7092.90
End time: 7099.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Especially for a company like Pebble, which has not exactly been on fire ever.  No.  They've had hype.  No, never.

End time: 7119.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you think about it though, remember, the story was it was from Citizen, the Japanese, almost 100-year-old Japanese watchmaker.  If you're, you know, last year you're wondering where your future is as a watchmaker, you might say, well, we got to get in on this wearable thing.  I would agree.

Start time: 7119.90
End time: 7134.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would agree that Citizen might look into it, but I'm saying is I don't understand how anybody at Pebble on their board or any investors would ever turn it down.  Yeah, which is what the reporting, some of the reporting says is that Pebble was the one who said no.  And that's the part that to me just doesn't jive with reality.  It wasn't the end.

Start time: 7135.82
End time: 7139.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Then Intel made an offer for 70 million.  That seems more realistic.

Start time: 7140.00
End time: 7172.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That seems more realistic.  And I actually could understand turning that down, even though it was double what they reportedly pay for the assets, just because 70 million might not have been enough to cover debts and might not have been a big enough return for the investors.  So I think they'd raised about 35 million.  They might, it might not have been enough of a return into your thinking.  Well, if we can have one more hit, if we can make this work financially, if this next product can bring us back into the market, then we shouldn't sell for 70 million.  I could see turning that down.  That one, I'm with you, Devender, like that seems realistic.  740 million.  That just.

Start time: 7174.03
End time: 7184.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they're not getting anywhere near any of that.  Fitbit's buying Pebble.  We don't know for how much, according to the information around 40 million.  Yeah.  And that's barely covers their debt.

Start time: 7184.76
End time: 7195.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't even think it did.  I mean, I think that, you know, they, they bought the assets, they bought the software assets and some of the, some of the employees and I guess the patents.

Start time: 7197.09
End time: 7213.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So is Steve Kovac, I mean, that's, that's one bit of evidence.  The other bit is that Motorola has said we're not going to make another Android Wear watch.  Google's delayed Android Wear 3.0 till next year.  Yeah.  Apple Watch sales.  Nobody's making money except maybe Apple and Fitbit.

Start time: 7213.76
End time: 7238.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm sure that app.  Yeah, exactly.  One Fitbit stock is, has been in the tank this year for a lot of reasons.  They haven't, you know, sold as many units as they projected to sell.  So it's not even just, you know, smartwatches.  It's fitness trackers too.  And then there's, you know, the Apple Watch.  Obviously there's an IDC report that came out a couple, it came out a couple months ago and then the identical report came out last week.  You know, that says that Apple Watch sales were down.

Start time: 7238.82
End time: 7245.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but then Tim Cook comes out and says, Oh no, it's the best sales we've ever had.  We broke all records.  You didn't give any numbers.

Start time: 7245.76
End time: 7247.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, yeah, you know what?

Start time: 7248.00
End time: 7319.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And when they don't have any numbers, that's when you know that there isn't a really good story to tell.  I looked at the, I looked at that quote too.  It was a very interesting, very lawyerly quote.  It was about sales during the holiday week.  Sales during the holiday week, blah, blah, blah.  And you know what?  So then I went back to my newsfeed where I said, you know, where I had Black Friday deals coming in on a newsfeed.  And guess what?  Best Buy and Target, among others, had huge discounts on existing Apple Watch stock.  So I think this was, I think they, and probably those were subsidized by Apple, moved this stuff out of the way to make room for the current generation product.  But they had, it sounds like they had warehouses full of this stuff.  And they were able to give incentives on this stuff of $100, $150 off of the regular sales price for these things.  And you're going to shift a lot of merchandise at that point.  You're not going to get traditional Apple margins at all.

Start time: 7319.88
End time: 7347.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Tim Cook's quote for Reuters.  Sales growth is off the charts.  That is, by the way, a meaningless statement.  In fact, during the first week of holiday shopping, our sell through, this important sell through of Apple Watch was greater than any week in the product's history.  Any week.  And as expected, we're on track for the best quarter ever for Apple Watch.  But you're right.  It could just be because they drastically cut Series 1's prices.

Start time: 7347.80
End time: 7436.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they cut Series 1 prices and there were some deals on Series 2s.  And you also have to think that the average selling price on Apple Watch with Series 2 has gone down because they're not selling.  They're really hyping up the sport model.  They don't even call it the sport anymore versus the ceramic, which they're selling for a lot more money.  So like they, you know, they're not even really emphasizing that the stainless steel anymore.  So, yeah, I think that who knows what the sales are.  They're probably making more money than anybody else in the smartwatch space.  But I think that anybody who's trying to make the argument like the Apple Watch has been this huge bonafide hit.  I mean, I'm somebody who's been wearing an Apple Watch every day for 18 months.  And that's just not true.  You know, I get used out of it, I guess.  But I like mine.  But if it's not, it didn't change my life.  And certainly this is the one time of year.  It was this way last year too.  But this is the one time of year where my friends are like, should I buy an Apple Watch?  Which one should I get?  And I think it's because it's a decent holiday item to buy.  It's on fitness trackers are the same way.  You know, people start to get excited about the new year.  You start to think it's an easier buy.  Well, I think it's two hundred seventy dollar Apple Watch.  I think, you know, it is and it's not.  I mean, if you're also buying it, you know, kind of with the fashion thing involved.  I mean, I think that there are plenty of people who say I might be able to, you know, have a hundred fifty dollar for this or what I can see people making the leap from from a faster device in the original Apple Watch sport.

Start time: 7436.80
End time: 7442.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. So that's that's a good deal.  It's better than every.  This is a very coastal, this is a very coastal elite point of view.

Start time: 7442.98
End time: 7535.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, I have to say to 270, 270 dollars is is a lot of money.  That's for most people that, you know, they're going to spend that on a phone, maybe.  Every five years.  You know, yeah, I think especially when you get a time X for 20 bucks and that and there and there is the problem.  The Apple Watch and the Android Wear things, too.  I bought an Android Wear watch six months ago just to and I think it was on some sort of, you know, Amazon deal of the day kind of thing.  So I said, I'll check this out and tried it for two weeks and said, you know, this is just not compelling.  It's it wasn't compelling.  I said it. I sent it back and, you know, and got my money back.  And I said and it was one of the better ones that I, you know, that I had bought.  But so I think that's the problem with the category is that it is always going to be an add on for, you know, for a phone.  And so you and so you've you've already got a small percentage of the of the market out there.  And then, you know, so whatever percentage of the phone market you've got now, you can get some small percentage of that as an add on for it.  That's that's a good business.  That's a fine business model for Apple because Apple can do that the same way they can do with the air pods.  They can make money on on add on products.  Nobody else has the volume to make money with add on products.  Nobody.

Transcript:  You know, I'm getting my son for Christmas.  I'm getting him in a Harry shave kit.  Let's take a break.  I got the weirdest story of the week coming up in a second.  Harry's for guys who want a great shave experience for a fraction of the price.  This is the time of year where you go to Harry's and you can find some great gifts.  It was started by two best friends, Jeff and Andy.  They said, why are we being charged so much for razor blades of the drugs or they lock them up so you won't steal them?  Why is that?  So they started Harry's and they did the right thing.  They got investors and they took all the money the investors gave them and they bought the razor blade factory in Germany, one of two factories that makes the best razor blades in the world.  They bought it.  So now you're buying factory direct.  Your razor blades cost half as much as drugstore blades and they're great.  And the Harry's kits are even better.  All the kits come with a razor handle.  And you get to choose, you know, depending on which kit you get shaving and even get it engraved if you want shaving cream.  You get three blades, you know, and and these are three cartridges.  These are all five blade cartridges with the flex hinge, the precision trimmer for the sideburns, which I really like.  The Winston set includes an engravable chrome handle.  Like I said, you can choose from the foam, which is kind of the traditional.  I actually like the cream.  And then you sign up for the, you know, replenishment and every month you get the blade you need, the cream you need.  You never have to use a blade longer than you should.  You always have a nice, great, clean shave.  What a great holiday gift.  Go to Harry's dot com.  You could save five bucks right now for the guy on your Christmas list with the offer code twit five twit in the number five.  But if you want to get it for the holidays, ground shipping ends December 16th.  So you only have a few more days.  Go right now to Harry's dot com.  And don't forget that offer code twit five for five bucks off.  I hope Henry's not watching.  See, I didn't get his engraved, but I figured the H on there, he'd think it was Henry.  Right.  Use the old noggin there.  If you have somebody with an H in his name, buy it.  You got to Harry's dot com.  The number the offer code rather twit and the number five.  The weird story of the week.  Outside the Trump Tower, 30 demonstrators gather to make John McAfee the nation's cybersecurity czar.  Oh, my God.  No, I think it was organized by anonymous and probably they did it for the lulz.
