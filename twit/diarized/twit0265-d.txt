It's a very special This Week in Tech.  Because joining me are like one, two, three, four, five, and perhaps six later on in the show.  Of the original Tweet host.  The only one missing at this point is Kevin Rose.  I'll start from my left, Mr. Roger Chang.  Hello.  Who is still a very welcome part of the family.  He does East Meets West with Tom Merritt every Sunday right after Tweet.  Are you going to do it after this show?  Yes.  Tom, will you stop by?  I hope so.  I think everybody on this show worked at Tech TV too.  Yes.  And now you all work at Revision 3.  Except for you.  And John.  And John.  John, do you do a show at Revision 3?  I do contract work.  Seems unlikely.  Seems unlikely.  The future is murky.  That other voice we're hearing, of course, the great, the inimitable, Mr. Patrick Norton.  From the screensavers in Techzilla.com.  Good to see you, Patrick.  Good to be here.  This all started because I sent out an email by accident that was a response to an email from Tweet 14.  And you all answered.  Which would have been what, five years ago?  Yeah, it was like five years ago.  Wait a minute.  It's a 2005 email.

So, John, I will defer to you, but story number one, Go Daddy goes on the auction block, according to the Wall Street Journal on Friday.  Go Daddy, not my favorite domain name registrar in the world, apparently, according to the Wall Street Journal makes about, what was it they said?  $700-800 million?  A year! How do you make $700-800 million a year selling nine lots of customers?

Start time: 530.26
End time: 542.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Do you remember the dark days of Network Solutions and getting charged a bazillion dollars every year for your URL?  Go Daddy comes in, they take advantage of it.  I guess it's all profit.  Unprecedented low prices.

Start time: 594.72
End time: 625.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. So, I'm kind of stunned. They say that Go Daddy could fetch more than a billion dollars.  A billion.  Frank Quatrone's group Catalyst Partners is overseeing the sale. They're the ones who got so much money for 3par from Hewlett-Packard in that bidding war.  Who was it? Hewlett-Packard was bidding against, was it Oracle for 3par? I can't remember.  Dell.  Dell, that's right. It went up and up and up.  The last domain firm that was sold, I think, was Register.com, 130 million.

Start time: 627.34
End time: 636.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't understand why they're not doing an initial public offering instead of this.  Like none of these, like Register.com Network Solutions, none of those are publicly traded.

Start time: 636.74
End time: 645.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, Sarpane's Oxley, that's the reason.  Oh, really?  What is Sox?  No, I'm sorry.  It's the most onerous law ever put in place.  Explain what it is.

Start time: 645.76
End time: 649.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That was the Jeopardy! answer. What are Sox? What is Sox?

Start time: 651.64
End time: 657.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the most onerous initiative ever enacted by Congress.  It was a response to the Enron scandal.

Start time: 686.44
End time: 690.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute though. Isn't Facebook saying we're going to go public in 2011?

Start time: 690.80
End time: 700.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, Facebook, Facebook, Zuckerberg has said that Facebook isn't going public anytime soon.  Really?  I do really think, I mean, explain to me why Sarpane's Oxley is crushing.

Start time: 703.43
End time: 707.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because if you don't go public, you don't have to adhere to these accounting rules. Is that right, John?

Start time: 707.72
End time: 724.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, that's not what it is. The real reason is because just for compliance alone,  it's been estimated that 4% of your profits are gone from compliance to comply with this law.  So only the largest companies can actually afford to stay public.

Start time: 724.98
End time: 738.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  This is why markets should be unregulated because Americans can protect themselves and the market.  I mean, is this basically a classic like unregulate everything and if you're stupid enough to work for a company that forces you to buy the company stock?

Start time: 738.82
End time: 778.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no. You're missing the whole point. This came out after MCI and the scammers and everything.  Worldcon, Worldcon.  They put this in play and if you really look at it carefully, it doesn't do anything about it.  MCI would have still gone down the same path and Madoff would still be in business.  It doesn't do anything but put a big burden on, and if you talk to a venture capitalist about this,  any company making less than $400 million a year cannot afford to be a public company because of Sarbanes-Oxley.  Look it up. Check it out. Nobody thinks it's a good thing. It's got nothing to do with deregulation.  It was thrown in by the Bush administration to sink the country.

Start time: 780.82
End time: 785.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Okay, there we go. And actually, I think there has been a move to kind of soften Sarbanes-Oxley.

Start time: 785.72
End time: 786.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Soften, eradicate it.

Start time: 787.96
End time: 815.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, but I have to say there have been IPOs. There have been some IPOs this year and I don't know.  I think Facebook is headed towards an IPO for one reason only.  I'm sure they don't like the regulations that they're going to have to put up with and there's a lot of them a public company has to put up with.  But there's one reason to do that and that's because what is the value nowadays, the way you get engineering talent is with options.  And the best way to have options is to have a market, a public market.  That's the thing, right?  Can you pay them well enough?

Start time: 815.94
End time: 825.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, that's the question, right?  The Microsoft lesson is at some point you can't drag stock options in front of people because you can't keep driving the price of stock up enough.

Start time: 826.53
End time: 915.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Exactly. I'm going to tell you that's what's wrong with the tech industry right now.  I've just got a proposal. I'll let you guys tell me where I'm wrong here.  But I think this is exactly why, for instance, Google had to launch this silly Google Instant this week, this new form of search, right?  Because the stock market rewards companies that grow only if they grow at 25% a year.  They have to grow at an insane, at least in the tech sector, they have to grow at an insane rate.  Microsoft stopped growing at that rate. Its stock has been flat for years, which means they can no longer attract the best talent because they don't have stock options that are going to inflate every year.  So everybody went to Google's. Google does an IPO, right?  Google stock goes up and up and up.  And now Google's flat because no one can grow at 25% a year and Google's losing people to Facebook.  And that's why Facebook ultimately has to do an IPO because they are attracting all the talent.  In fact, Google just lost another big, big name to Facebook. It's happening all the time.  In fact, yesterday, did you see this?  Yesterday, a kid writes, a Stanford kid writes something he calls YouTube Instant.  It's the same kind of search for YouTube that Google's doing.  Chad Hurley at Google slash YouTube, the CEO of YouTube, tweets him saying, nice stuff.  You need a job. The kid says, ready to leave school.  Well, for the kid says, Feros says, is that a serious offer?  And Chad says, are you ready to leave school?  DM me.  Presumably, Google's offering this kid a job. Why?  Not because YouTube Instant is so great, because you've got to get these guys before they figure out the whole stock option thing and go to Facebook.

Start time: 915.88
End time: 931.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Or you create an environment where you have a bunch of smart people and intelligent management decisions.  Doesn't work. Isn't Google like that?  So one guy leaves Google, therefore Google is screwed?  Oh, hundreds have left Google. Google's got a major brain drain to Facebook.

Start time: 932.42
End time: 943.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Everybody has major, people get bored. Programmers are like ADD half the time.  John, help me out here. Isn't that really what's going on?  Is it if they can't offer valuable stock options, they can't keep these kids who just want money?

Start time: 945.54
End time: 965.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I actually I'm in agreement with you in theory.  And from 10 years ago, I would say, yeah, yeah, yeah, absolutely.  But that's that that deal is that trains left as far as I'm concerned.  I think guys now are just looking for any job that has some security.  But we're also talking about the millennials who are talking about the best.

Start time: 965.86
End time: 974.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, you're right. When it's talking about everybody.  But I'm talking about the best and the brightest, the whatever it is, the hundred great engineers graduating each year from Stanford and MIT and Cal Poly.

Start time: 974.90
End time: 978.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you know, if Sharp Ains Oxy was gone, we would have all these little companies.

Start time: 984.08
End time: 1004.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, I have a bunch of friends who went to school.  One of them just sold his company just sold for 20 million dollars to Motorola.  Another one is a pretty amazing security service.  Well, I mean, they got out of school like five, seven years ago now.  But a lot of the guys getting out of school today and women, for that matter, are basically coming up with the right idea, getting together a crew of people they trust and starting their own company.

Start time: 1005.72
End time: 1017.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, no, no, this is a good time to be entrepreneurial as opposed to going to work for a big corporation.  So maybe that's the problem. It's always a good time.  But was there not a flow of the best minds from Microsoft to Google and now from Google to Facebook?

Start time: 1017.84
End time: 1033.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is that not happening? You know, maybe they were just looking for that environment that they encountered the first time around.  Oh, they want somewhere cool and exciting and growing.  I mean, there is a certain amount of energy and vitality when you get to when you're given essentially the keys.

Start time: 1034.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm at a new small place where I'm going to do this. You know what else is? It's free agency, too.  How much will you pay? How much will you pay me?  You know, John, look, we've lost John. We've lost you.  Wait a minute. Well, there's like darning socks.

Start time: 1050.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing. I'm listening to this bull crap.

Start time: 1058.70
End time: 1077.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So to go back to the original question, John, is what so they're going to take the big check from a from a holding company at GoDaddy instead of going for an IPO.  And that's entirely due to Sorbain's Oxley or because it's easier or is because it's faster, easier, simpler.  And they might make more money.

Transcript:  Yeah, I'm a billion. In fact, some are saying a billion. That's the starting point. They're going to get one point four.  I mean, if it's a multiple of eight hundred thousand eight hundred million, you know, I've always thought Bob Parsons was a good guy.

And then they did a beach landing where they had the Ford Fiesta land on the beach as if they're storming the beach.  It was pretty one of the most amazing Top Gear spots I've ever seen with featuring the Fiesta.  And I was almost certain they sponsored it, but I think they were just decided to make that make the spot that entertaining.

First of all, the the expose with the former Farmville employee who said basically Zynga steals any game they can.  The goal is don't worry about originality. Just worry about hooking our users.  They've been sued before if they were sued over Mafia Wars. Farmville is the one that everybody's playing, not only on Facebook, but now they have it on.  I think the it's an app for iOS. So there's this secret thing Gawker revealed this Ryan Tate writing for Gawker called the premium platinum purchase program for Zynga.  Normally in Farmville, you can only buy about two hundred dollars worth of whatever those points are called to allow you to build the pony barn and stuff like that.  They're spending real money for digital goods, but they have a special platinum purchase program which allows you of minimum purchase of five hundred dollars.  You have to use wire transfer. You can't use a credit card. You get extra points. If you for a friend, you get more points.  And there are apparently and nobody's talking about this people spending thousands of dollars a month on little pony points, obsessive gaming junkies, many of them underaged or low income.  New York Times discovered an unemployed disabled guy was spending 16 hours a day on Yo-Ville, another one of the Zynga properties.  And according to this disillusioned ex-employee, Mark Pinkus, the CEO, has a predatory attitude towards gamers, has told his programmers that pumping up profits is more important than the actual play.  And that our motto is unofficially do evil.

Tom Merritt talked about it on Tech News Today, US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit,  which is, you know, a pretty activist.  This is the Northern California Court of Appeals, and traditionally kind of liberal activist.  They ruled on a long-standing case involving used software on eBay.  The issue is, of course, these shrink-wrap agreements that say you don't own the program.  You just buy the right to use it, which means, of course, you can't resell it.

Start time: 1868.92
End time: 1908.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, okay, part of the back story on this, a guy buys some used copies of, I want to say, AutoCAD.  AutoCAD it was, yes.  The AutoCAD copies were sold. Part of the agreement...  He bought the serial numbers. He bought the media.  But the people he bought them from, part of their agreement with Autodesk was that the copies would be destroyed.  They would not be resold.  I don't know if that was on a shrink-wrap, Yula, or if that was on an official corporate...  You know what I mean? Like an actual negotiated contract.  The guy goes to sell them on eBay. Autodesk files a complaint.  eBay kills the auction. He throws them up on eBay again.  eBay, instead of killing the auction, basically shuts down his account.  And then he goes and fires up the lawsuit.

Start time: 1911.22
End time: 1991.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Actually, this guy was on the verge of being banned from eBay.  So he sued Autodesk, asking Autodesk...  Actually, asking the courts to say, I have the right to sell this AutoCAD software.  Federal court, in fact, in 2008 said, yeah, you do have the right to sell.  Autodesk appealed, and now the Ninth Circuit ruling on that said, no.  In fact, that's a legal license. In fact, they said, we don't even have a choice.  We have to rule this way. We don't want to rule this way,  because we know it's going to kill the aftermarket for resale.  The judges said there's a test.  We hold today that a software user is a licensee rather than an owner of a copy,  where the copyright owner, in this case Autodesk, one, specifies that the user's granted a license,  two, significantly restricts the user's ability to transfer the software,  and three, imposes notable use restrictions.  AutoCAD did all that. In fact, you couldn't even transfer the discs out of the Western hemisphere,  according to the license agreement.  So apparently, I didn't know this, but Amazon's MP3 music store also says that you don't own this.  The music that you buy on the MP3 store, Amazon says you will not redistribute, transmit, assign, sell, broadcast, rent, share, lend, modify, adapt, edit, license, or otherwise use digital content.

Right.  As soon as you walk into Barnes & Noble or something, you're going to walk in, you're going to see the book. It's going to be shrink-wrapped.  There's going to be a EULA inside that says you have to send them $100 if you read page one.  You know what I mean? It sounds really ridiculous, but it's a really interesting idea that all of a sudden...  Because software companies, they print ridiculous terms in licensing, and they have forever.

Start time: 2162.72
End time: 2169.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because First Amendment rights, you can sign away, but not the right not to be a slave.  It's just a more heinous thing.  It doesn't make any sense at all. You should be able to sign away your personal freedoms, too.

Start time: 2170.10
End time: 2176.64

Transcript:  You're signing away your First Amendment rights if you sign an NDA.  You're signing an NDA to get insider access to information.  The Patriot Act, that's an act of scumbaggery.  That's an act of undermining some of the fundamental foundation of the American government.  That's bad.

Start time: 2244.72
End time: 2258.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, Patrick, I'm not talking about that kind of NDA.  I'm talking about you go to work for a company and the first thing you do is you sign away your First Amendment rights.  You can never talk about what you've done in that company.  It's got nothing to do with access.  You mean while you're there or after you get...

Start time: 2258.72
End time: 2264.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I'm sorry. I thought you were talking about being a journalist.  I've never had to sign a corporate NDA.  You never worked for a big company.

Start time: 2264.94
End time: 2299.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's a good point.  It's coming up right now.  Mark Hurd was fired at HP for juggling the books because he had a contractor that was kind of cute.  He wanted to pay for her and he charged it off against his expenses.  Larry Ellison at the time said,  that is the worst, stupidest decision I've ever heard of.  Then puts his money where his mouth is,  hires Mark Hurd to be one of three presidents of Oracle.  Now HP is suing saying Mark Hurd can't go because he knows stuff.  Isn't this the same thing, John?  Mark Hurd is a slave to HP.  He can't take a job.

Start time: 2300.80
End time: 2330.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't want him and he can't go anywhere else.  The curious thing is in California that all those non-compete,  all those things have already been thrown out by the Supreme Court of the state.  They don't hold water and everybody knows it.  They're unenforcing it.  The fact of the matter is people are still signing away their First Amendment rights elsewhere  in the other states that they uphold.  I mean the whole thing is a disaster and I don't understand why the courts keep putting up with this crap.  There should be no such thing as a non-disclosure agreement.  Wait, wait, wait.

Start time: 2331.72
End time: 2340.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just clarify what you're referring to when you say a non-disclosure agreement.  Are you saying while that person's working there they can...  I mean...

Start time: 2340.72
End time: 2356.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You're talking about like stopping whistleblowers,  stopping people from talking about it.  Basically you're saying like when you said NDA,  I automatically assume like I get assigned an NDA to see...  Exactly.  ...employment contracts.  Right.  you're not allowed to ever talk about what goes on inside the company.  Right.

Start time: 2357.72
End time: 2372.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you can be held responsible for that without even signing an NDA.  I mean there's laws on the books called misappropriation,  which is basically the theft of knowledge  and using it fraudulently against someone such as an employer.  That's fine.  That's different.

Start time: 2374.23
End time: 2389.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't mind that.  In fact, with the NDA, the journalists sign,  I don't see why anyone signs when they're crazy.  I have been presented with NDAs in my entire career  and all I say is I don't want an NDA.  Give me an...  I'll do an embargo, a gentleman's agreement.  I won't say anything, but I'm not signing something.  And they always agree.

Start time: 2389.72
End time: 2403.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with you on the gentleman's agreement embargo  because you're not going to be able to get those tips anyway unless you do that.  So I think that's the way to do it.  Other than like putting yourself up to be sued for something,  what are they going to...  I mean you don't even see very many of these lawsuits against NDA holders,  at least that I know of.

Start time: 2403.76
End time: 2428.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Let's take a different direction on this.  John, somebody's fresh out of college, they're 22, they want a job,  they accept a job, HR pulls out a 40-pound pile of paperwork.  Part of it's like an NDA that says you will never talk about Weasel Corp  for the rest of your life no matter what happens,  even if we're killing puppies and small children in the back room  instead of building software.  So basically you're telling the kid to walk away from the job  or to try to negotiate with the HR team?

Start time: 2429.16
End time: 2458.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm saying the kid can...  You know, if the kid has to sign that thing to get the job, that's one thing.  But if it ever comes down to it, I don't want to see the court saying,  hey, this is legit, it's not.  It's just a scare tactic, yeah, sure.  You can get some dumb kid to sign anything and that's fine.  And you can buffalo him into thinking he can't talk, that's good too.  That's just kind of fooling a dummy.  But the fact of the matter is if these things are held as legal documents by the courts,  then the courts should be ashamed of themselves.  That's what I'm complaining about.  You buy a game now from Electronic Arts.

Start time: 2459.10
End time: 2463.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It says you don't own the game, you're licensing the game.  I mean, at what point does that product...

Start time: 2464.02
End time: 2471.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, moving back to the original discussion.  Thank you, Roger.  At what point does the product just...  I mean, do they treat it as a product or do they treat it as a service?

Start time: 2471.76
End time: 2488.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I think this is where it gets muddy because it's software, right?  Yeah.  So technically there's not even a physical, necessarily a physical copy of it.  It's bits. You're buying an idea.  I mean, one pop...  Or leasing or renting an idea or the right to interact with an idea.

Start time: 2488.72
End time: 2497.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, at least in PC gaming, I mean, the trend is because...  Steam.  Yeah, Steam.  You essentially tie the account to the product that they purchased.

Start time: 2497.72
End time: 2502.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This solves it because Steam, you don't have to worry about piracy,  you don't have to worry about resale, nothing.  Steam is what everybody likes.

Start time: 2502.80
End time: 2506.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But if you get kicked off of Steam, you lose all the content you purchased.  Absolutely.

Start time: 2508.00
End time: 2514.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So, I mean, at some point, has it just become just a plain service?

Start time: 2514.72
End time: 2539.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So the truth is, in the short term,  the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals has upheld shrink wrap.  But in the long term, it doesn't matter because look at where movies are going,  look where music even is going.  And of course gaming is going, is basically this kind of account-based rental,  the Zune marketplace.  Look at what the new Apple TV is.  I don't know if you ever own a TV show.  You rent it.  You buy a temporary right to stream it.

Start time: 2540.00
End time: 2543.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Yeah, well, you just can't purchase through the Apple TV.

Start time: 2543.74
End time: 2563.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you can right now, but I think in the long run,  they don't want you to own it.  And there's pressure from the movie companies, the TV companies.  They love the idea of a Roku box or an Apple TV that doesn't store content,  just gives you a temporary right because they can revoke that right,  and they don't have to worry about resale,  they don't have to worry about lending,  they don't have to worry about libraries.  That's where we're going, right?  Technology is going to support that.

Start time: 2564.33
End time: 2573.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you know, if software goes that way,  then they should bring down the price because, you know,  if they're charging you 300 bucks, I mean, for something that...  Oh, Yoshi, go ahead.

Start time: 2573.86
End time: 2595.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Oh, I was going to say exactly about the pricing because, you know,  if you can't sell your software or buy used software,  it's going to promote people to pirate it because if I say,  can't buy a CS5, but, oh, I'll buy a used copy from CS4 or someone that upgraded,  but no, I can't, you know,  what's going to make that person be less likely to pirate  than not letting them be able to buy a used copy for a cheaper price.

Start time: 2596.02
End time: 2617.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  One of the things that's interesting is one of the areas that's had some success lately  is startups for around college textbooks.  Yes.  And actually, the rental model on college textbooks,  people are like, it's stupid,  but basically a lot of people in venture capital companies apparently said  this is the dumbest idea ever,  and the guy who started this company to rent textbooks is making hand...  This is a good example.  ...money hand over fist.

Start time: 2617.72
End time: 2631.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because there's a very brisk resale market in textbooks because they cost 100 bucks plus.  Sure.  If you could charge half as much and not have that resale market,  these companies would love that, wouldn't they?  And students would love it. Who wouldn't love it?  Right.  So that's a win...

Start time: 2631.94
End time: 2634.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  You could even make the rental digital.

Start time: 2634.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Well, this all comes down to if you, you know,  are you giving up a little freedom for a little convenience?  Is the problem...

Start time: 2653.78
End time: 2660.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the crux.  I mean, if you want more convenience, you have to give up something in return.  It's convenient for a reason, right?

Start time: 2662.18
End time: 2697.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I would submit that the problem is that we're in the middle of a transition  from physical goods to virtual goods.  And that this is where this judgment is a problem  because that AutoCAD software was really perceived by the plaintiff  as a physical good that he could resell,  perceived by the creator as a virtual good that was...  You just really rented the right.  And the court upheld the shrink wrap.  Maybe this isn't going to be a problem because in the long run,  you're not going to buy a physical good.  You're buying bits or renting bits, I should say.  And isn't that better for everybody all along?  Because you don't really...  No, it's not better for everybody.

Transcript:  Seymour Rubenstein is the guy who kind of got this whole ball rolling  when he came up with the shrink wrap license agreement idea  back in the 80s when he was doing WordStar.  Actually, before that, there was some Merge Perch program.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  WordStar. I miss that.  And I had many a talk with this guy.  And he says this is the way to go.  And he was talking about how books and everything can be licensed.  You wouldn't own anything ever.  And it would just mean more money for these guys  because there wouldn't be a secondary market.  There wouldn't be a gray market, which people love to hate  if they want to screw the public.  This is all about screwing the public.  Don't let me be able to hand a book to you that I just read.  Screw it. You have to buy a new copy.  That whole model sucks as far as I'm concerned.  That's because you're an old fart.

Start time: 2766.74
End time: 2773.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 2775.72
End time: 2791.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, I don't think that's good.  There's a reason I buy CDs. There's a reason I buy Blu-rays.  A, I want a physical copy of the media.  And B, I want the best possible quality of the data.  And you know what?  A lot of the online distribution of media sucks.  A lot of the 720p.  Physical media is going to be a boutique industry

Transcript:  I think that what you'll eventually see is you'll see a parallel market  where creators and the end users will directly interface  instead of working through a publisher,  a middleman company that does...  I mean, if you think about it,  if you go to a band and they say,  hey, you know what?  We just made these CDs in our garage.  We'll sell it to you for like 10 bucks.  You get all our music and stuff.  Instead of going through a reprise record.  Why is it okay in textbooks,

Start time: 2828.78
End time: 2843.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  but not okay in Ernest Hemingway?  Is it because textbooks have less...  Well, I mean, we just endorse the notion  that you don't own a textbook  and there's no resale right as being good for everybody.  No, no, no.

Start time: 2844.02
End time: 2868.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I said it was a successful business model.  Oh, you don't like the idea.  Look, I remember textbooks weren't 100 bucks when I was in college.  I was in college forever ago.  I was also a lit major,  so half the stuff I was buying was paperback books.  Novels, yeah.  I know people who have had to...  In the last couple, three years,  we've had to lay out like six, seven hundred bucks  upfront a semester for their books for like three or four classes.  My textbooks are like 90 bucks.

Start time: 2869.18
End time: 2874.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And you don't really want a textbook after you've completed the class.  It loses its value immediately,  whereas Ernest Hemingway might have value down the line.

End time: 2881.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 2882.29
End time: 2883.54

Start time: 2883.72
End time: 2891.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Textbooks, it kind of makes sense.  You pay half price upfront.  You give them the book back at the end of the semester.  They rent it again.  Right.  Okay, so you're not allowed to run the highlighter in the edges.

Start time: 2892.36
End time: 2896.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, you can if you just have a Kindle that allows you to do that.  Right.

Start time: 2896.90
End time: 2899.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 2899.92
End time: 2901.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But that's why I guess ultimately digital is the solution.

Start time: 2902.02
End time: 2937.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, this is idealism, this idea,  because many of the textbooks get updated yearly  just to prevent this sort of thing.  Right.  For a long time, the used textbook market was very vibrant in most colleges.  Oh, it still is.  Like University of California.  No, you go to University of California with those used textbook places.  They're all gone.  Oh, interesting.  Because now the professors are in bed with these publishers,  and they have to sign new books.  They have to be the newest version because there's something changed on page 50.  A correction.  The whole thing is part of the giant scam.  We're just having our money stolen from us.  Again with a scam.  It's a scam.  It's just a ripoff.  The public needs to stand up to this crap.

Start time: 2940.23
End time: 2990.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  If you're going to have books that cost as much as they do,  it would be in my best interest.  I think for the students' best interest is not to saddle them  with all that initial expense right off the bat  when they're getting started in school  and just be able to provide that digitally in such a way where,  you know, make it as affordable as possible  or to the point where it shouldn't even be a cost to the student.  It's like if they sign up for a course, here's the digital download.  Just go to town with it and use it as you see fit.  There you go. Socialism.  Kind of, but for software though, we've been dealing with this,  at least on the gaming side of things, for PCs for a long time now.  You could not open, as soon as you took the shrink wrap off the outside of the box,  you effectively owned it.  You couldn't return it for almost no reason, short of physical defect.  Fortunately, sometimes you actually get a piece of software so bad  that you had to actually, you could declare it a defective piece of software  and then return it.  But even today, it's still the same way.  For the most part.

Transcript:  What gets me about that, I don't even, you know, that model,  that train also has left the station.  We're stuck with this model.  But what gets me is the fact that they can put in those ULAs liability considerations.  So in other words, if you're using this software in a hospital  and somebody dies because the software is crap  or it doesn't work as advertised,  it doesn't do what it's supposed to do,  and people actually die from the software,  you can't do anything about it.  That's ridiculous.  I agree.

Are you going to that as a paid speaker?  No, you know what I found out?  We've worked this out since.  But I sent a note to Loic, who throws this.  He's the guy at Seismic, and I said, okay, I'm ready to go.  Do I buy the ticket and get reimbursed? Do you buy it?  And he says, no, we'll give you a small stipend.  I said, well, wait a minute, that's not even going to cover the ticket.  I can't go.  I'm not going to pay to speak.  So we worked it out.  But no, I am not a paid speaker there.

So I'm going to get Kevin and a bunch of other people.  We'll do it all in French. It'll be so much fun.  Mike Harrington is going to be there, but I don't know if he'll consent to be on camera with me anymore.  I think I finally cheesed him off.  Beyond repair.  This episode brought to you by our friends at audible.com.  You know, audible, that's the great place where you get audio books to listen to.  But when I was doing the screensavers and I had that two hour commute every day to and from Petaluma to San Francisco, audible just saved my life.  I don't I don't think I could have survived without those great books.  And I'm still listening to audible books.  The other day I was looking, they have a new audible app for iPhone and Android.  I was looking at it's cool because the app gives you all the books you've ever that you own that you've ever listened to.  They do it kind of. This is a nice thing.  They do have copy protection.  You can't sell or rent or anything, but you at least have access to that book in the library forever.  So you can always go back and and and re listen to a book.  So I think this is kind of a nice compromise.  I admit I'm not crazy about DRM.  The publishers don't give them an option.  I saw that you have Patrick Norton, the new William Gibson novel there in your hot little hands.  Zero History.  It's delightful.  You could read it like Patrick's doing in the dead tree fashion or I'll own this dead tree for ever.  So I so I can listen anytime I want.  You could listen to Roberts and Dean, who's one of their best narrators.  In fact, let me play a little bit of Zero History.  This is the brand new.  Just came out three days ago.

Did you find him sleeping on your bed?  No, no, no, no.  Then I started Ustream and when I started the Ustream after I was talking about it,  I wasn't caching it.  So someone was screen recording because the Ustream wasn't set to cache it.  So that picked up when it was a guy who I yanked out of my bathroom and he fell over  on the bed on the way out.  So everyone thought that I found a Goldilocks sleeping in my bed or something.  He was not a Goldilocks.

End time: 4382.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So Google Scribe, if you look closely years to realize that.  Yeah, yeah, you spit it out and then you try it.  Yeah, no, he's absolutely that's the way to write.  So this is Google Scribe.  It'll work.  You can actually put a bookmark lit in your browser and any text field.  It'll work.  It suggests it uses the same technology as Google Instance.  It suggests the next phrase as you start typing.  So I typed we didn't star and then look, number three, start the fire.  I just press three and it finishes my sentence.  This is now the problem is, of course, you're going to get cliches because the suggestions  are what people type the most.  Right.  So give me a phrase.

Apple TV proves the real winner right now in the battle for the living room is  Netflix because everybody is Netflix. You gotta have Netflix. You know,  Blu ray players are doing Netflix devices, you know, appliances are doing Netflix,  set top boxes.

Start time: 5512.52
End time: 5515.56

Start time: 5515.60
End time: 5552.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  isn't it? It's a la carte, but we need, you know, somebody,  somebody with enough money and clout and time to make a la carte effective.  The only thing that you don't see about Google versus Google is big enough.  Google is big enough that they're starting a music service ostensibly to  complete with I compete with iTunes. It's supposed to be out by the end of this  year. They're hiring the managers at this point or like the, the,  the person responsible. But yeah, the idea that you, the,  they built the Google TV box.  The idea is that it's going to sit in between your cable box,  your direct TV box, or it's going to be your dish network box and your TV.  Well, that's why, that's why I only seven at this point.

Start time: 5552.20
End time: 5558.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

End time: 5620.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is a mistake. All Apple has to do is put the platform out there.  It's about platforms. You prov, and this is what Microsoft learned.  You provide the platform and you let people write to the platform.  Apple gets 30% of every subscription of everything.  So if you say here's the platform HBO, you want to make a Trueblood app. Fine.  Hulu you want to do Hulu plus. Fine. You want to MLB,  you want to do a baseball app. Fine. You get 30% cause that's how it works.  And they don't have to make a deal with anybody.

Transcript:  Samsung had a whole application developers day about two weeks ago in San  Francisco. That was,  that was phenomenally eye opening in terms of what they really want to do in  terms of essentially there is a store now with your TV,  just like you have with your, your smartphone. Here's why it doesn't,

Start time: 5657.22
End time: 5671.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  here's why they, the here's their pitfall is if you,  if there's a Sony way of doing it and a Samsung way of doing it and a Vizio way  of doing that's not going to work. Right.  That's why Google has to step in or Apple or somebody has stepped in and said,  here's the platform right to this platform. It'll work on all the TVs.

Start time: 5672.32
End time: 5705.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's not going to be one. And there's not going to be one. I mean,  right now you've got Comcast competing with direct TV competing with whoever  else. And you're going to have,  you're going to have your set top boxes competing with your Rokus and your  Boxys and your Apple TVs and your Google TVs.  And there's going to be at least a couple of players and hopefully there's a  compatibility or some kind of a standard so that, you know,  you can make universal binaries of your darn stuff to work other places.  That's why Netflix is available through the PS three through the Wii through the  Roku through Boxy through all of that. And same with, you know,  you want Twitter to be available on all that stuff.  And we want revision three to be available.

Start time: 5705.60
End time: 5714.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well that's why we're excited about it. Isn't it? Because it puts us out of  parody and you've got different models also for us.  We want to be available for free everywhere. People like Twitter,

Start time: 5714.32
End time: 5723.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  revision three, but then you've got, you know,  people like HBO who can also get in the same game and have apps available at  different places, but you'll have to subscribe for it, which people will do.  So why isn't this happening?

Start time: 5724.04
End time: 5729.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_10

Start time: 5729.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It doesn't have to be the box. It has to be the platform.  Okay.

Start time: 5732.28
End time: 5742.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  So what I'm saying is nobody's also figured out the platform that everyone  will write to because Samsung and Sony and LG and, you know,  umpteen other companies, they they're all in competition with each other.

End time: 5771.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  You could see something though,  like Android or some open platform becoming the basis for all of these  devices though. And that helps alleviate the whole,  the whole issue of having different platforms to develop for if you're the  content owner or you just, you want to make one of these apps and it's like,  Oh, I got to choose between whether I developed for a Sony TV or Samsung,  box or a Roku box or what have you.

Start time: 5771.84
End time: 5776.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

You're actually going to see a couple of TVs that will offer a Blu-ray recorder  built into the TV itself that you can just drop the disc into.  And that gives you a chunk of storage,  or you'll be able to hook up your own external hard drives to these TVs as  well.
