You'd think you'd be doing this maybe but I never would have thought some guy named Elon Musk would have been trying to buy  a thing called Twitter

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like pre PayPal and his first Leo his first startup was zip to zip  Founded X then X there's there's a book that just came out a couple months ago  That is all about the PayPal story not even the PayPal mafia, but like just the story of PayPal  because it you think Twitter's  Situation was crazy, you know people were there were boardroom coups there were all sorts of shenanigans going on

Transcript:  Here is the article from 1999 in salon. It's still online. Elon Musk is poised to become Silicon Valley's next big thing  Oh, they had no idea did they what put him in the driver's seat?  Driver's seat get it pre Tesla. Yeah, it's pre Tesla.

There's no way although. Hey at least  Salon was and Mark  Gimmian or gimmeen who wrote this was savvy enough to know

Start time: 599.12
End time: 702.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He was right now Elon is doing I don't know why I think honestly  I'm not curious what you guys think this sounds like a classic pump-and-dump scam to me  So, you know the timeline we've been talking about it for a couple of weeks Elon secretly over the first three months of the year  Buying up bits of Twitter  Finally coming out and saying I have a controlling interest by the way weeks after he was supposed to violation number one  He hid the fact that he was buying it up even after he crossed the 5% threshold  There is already a shareholder lawsuit over that because since he didn't announce it  He could continue to buy it up at lower prices when he finally does announce it  He has nine point two percent about three billion dollar investment in Twitter stock price goes up  27% on the announcement now that would have been a good time to sell make a cool billion, but no  No, he gets offered a board seat  We don't know if he turned it down. This was last week  Did he turn it down did they decide not to give him the board seat my thinking was at the time?  This is this is Twitter saying be on the board. Then you can only have 15%  We're safe. You can't do a hostile takeover if you're on the board. I think Elon said yeah, thanks, but no  Thanks after all sorts of ridiculous tweets, which he has since deleted including proposing that they renamed Twitter titter  That's funny Elon  Then  Announces this week  43 billion dollars. I want the whole thing an unsolicited bid ie hostile takeover  But what's interesting I think he thought at that time offering $54 a share which is about six bucks more than it was going  For that he probably thought oh, this will boost it up a little more and then I can sell it all see  That's my theory. What do you think Harry? I

Start time: 703.62
End time: 743.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mean, it's Elon Musk so it's hard to know  It's  It's interesting so many people are so confident  They know what he's thinking or know what Twitter would be like I don't if he took charge  Yeah, some people think it would it would be fantastic for him to take over some think it would be the end of democracy  I don't think it'd be that bad. I'm Twitter's that important. He said that yeah, maybe not the end of democracy, but destructive to democracy  I think it's just really hard to say I mean  my instinct which might or might not be right is that he is just sort of yanking their chain and  It's fun to make we know that at least that  There was this brief moment where they said he's gonna be on the board and that's wonderful. He leads with his heart  We're gonna do great things together

Start time: 744.44
End time: 756.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that collapsed and he was supposed to do an AMA with the Twitter staff that was  Some at least concerned about his ownership and then that got cancelled  Now they had an AMA with the Twitter staff explaining what they're gonna do about it

Start time: 756.92
End time: 762.14

Start time: 766.92
End time: 864.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, so  Here in New York, I'm friendly with with finance and Wall Street World folks and they've been taking it not very seriously until  The rumors that various private equity folks were gonna get together to help them with this bid  But they're still extremely skeptical of it for the simple of the deal actually happening because one thing we haven't talked about is  You know billionaires  Have most of their money sort of tied up in the stock that makes them billionaires  So he would have to sell a huge  I think it's like a fifth of his Tesla stock if he wanted to do if he wanted to buy it all himself  And that's not gonna help Tesla number two  if he were to  If he were to get say a private equity firm to you know, go cowboy with him and like let's do this  They're they're gonna want him to transform the business  They're not gonna want to do necessarily what he seems to want to do which is  mess with all of Twitter's  Operations and rules and and and you know, he's talking about free speech and all these things  So the reason that the people on Wall Street that I've talked to remain skeptical for the most part is that  They don't think that anybody with enough money or reputable enough will sign off on this  Because they won't believe that Elon will make it a better business  Like he might make Twitter into the Twitter  He wants it to be but they're gonna want him to four or five X Twitter and I don't know that no one could do that  I don't know that anyone can do that and I especially think that no one believes that Elon right would do that

Start time: 864.26
End time: 882.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, and we know that if you look at the stock market because if you offer  Six bucks above the current going rate of a stock that would normally increase the value of the stock  The fact that the stock market didn't do anything tells you that as a whole the stock market said yeah  He's not gonna pull this off, right?  That's so that's a that's the real thing

Start time: 883.78
End time: 888.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The real thing that the finance people told me is that this puts Twitter in play again. That's the bigger issue

Start time: 889.36
End time: 898.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the bigger issue. Yeah, Twitter's been in play before Bill Gross tried to buy it some years ago. I remember  For I just don't think I think it'd be hard to consider buying it. Yeah

Start time: 900.60
End time: 927.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think it'd just be hard to move the needle like I think that's that's the issue of its value  You know, I think Twitter and all of these social networks are kind of they're a little long in the tooth  They were they were really cool ideas when they started but that's 15 years ago  There's a lot of technical debt a lot of you know  established mentalities  So I think that and they're big hard to move hard to turn that that's what they have art  You know  It's a big ship now  And so I think that it would be very difficult to make a dramatic change in the financial future of Twitter

Start time: 929.06
End time: 954.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is what it is even Elon and a TED talk to the TED interview with Chris Anderson this week said  I don't know if I can do this  And then of course he puts Twitter in play now  They're thinking maybe Oracle Larry Ellison and others might step in and try to acquire another hostile takeover  And of course the Twitter the Twitter board has adopted a what they call a poison pill strategy  I'll let you describe that Brian

Start time: 955.88
End time: 983.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Essentially you make it really really expensive  To continue the buyout, but let me give you one more conspiracy theory that I've heard because it's sort of lines up with  The tick-tock of how this has happened  Elon is still technically  Remember when he did the 420 thing there's all sorts of things with the SEC  Yeah, he got fined 20 million dollars what Tesla got fined 20 million dollars with the SEC wide open like so it's not resolved yet

Start time: 983.82
End time: 998.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, he's now saying I'm not gonna adhere to the agreement  It was wrong I'm gonna try to get that overturned  Cuz by the way one of the things he agreed to is have a lawyer vet every one of his tweets  Which he obviously has not been doing so this is this is the this is the theory

Start time: 999.20
End time: 1045.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That really what he wants to do is get out from under the thumb of this of the lawyers of the SEC  He wants to be able to say whatever he wants at once and not have to worry about there being any repercussions  So okay, I'll become Twitter's biggest shareholder and then maybe no one can tell me what I can and can't tweet  Okay, I'll go on the board if I'm a board member  No one can tell me what I can and can't tweet and every step of the way he's found out  Oh, no, but you're the SEC's SEC still gonna come for you  Oh, no, the lawyers in fact if you're on the board the lawyers are gonna be worse  So I don't know that this is an Occam's razor theory  But it does sort of make it line up with the timeline of how this has happened  He just wants the freedom and again that gets into what I'm saying about he doesn't necessarily want to make it a better business  He just wants the freedom

Start time: 1046.48
End time: 1051.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And you know like Matt Levine says the thing that's keeping him from the freedom is not Twitter. It's SEC

Start time: 1052.88
End time: 1059.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, which would I think would have a different I don't know what the rules are specifically  But I believe that SEC would have less leverage if it was a private company privately held. Oh

Start time: 1061.64
End time: 1117.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, because I guarantee you not because he's making tweets about a publicly held company  So it doesn't matter what the platform is that you announce  Felaciously that you're gonna buy this stock by this, you know  Take this company private for four hundred twenty bucks  If you announce it in public and then make money on it  That is that is pump and dump and that is illegal and the SEC find him by the way somebody did the math  If Elon Musk's net worth is 270 billion dollars  That's the estimate according to Forbes and the median net worth for an American is a hundred ten thousand dollars  that 20 million find to Elon is equivalent of  Small fry a McDonald's to the rest of us in other words. I don't even think he cares  He's much more concerned. I think you're right Brian about being told what to say  I think he wants the lawyers off his back. Yeah, just get out of my  Levine go what you what did Matt Levine say and then go ahead

Start time: 1117.34
End time: 1136.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is overarching theory is that you're the richest person in the world you play a game  That's your favorite game to play and so you want the rules to be you want the game to run the way that you want to  And you you wake up one day and you realize hey, I'm the richest man in the world  So why don't I just buy the game and change the rules to suit me and because you're the richest man in the world

Start time: 1136.12
End time: 1149.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's way too much work. You still got SpaceX and Tesla and other things the boring company  You got flame throwers to sell who ain't got you don't have time for Twitter. I think this is totally Elon  Just typical trolling right go ahead Alex

Start time: 1150.12
End time: 1188.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It might be but I think that he may actually think that Twitter's broken like I think that you know  Maybe it's it's connected to the fact that what does he care? Oh  Because he you know Twitter is influential like it's an influential  platform and he may decide he may have a bigger picture of this of  This is really a broken system that needs to be you know  It needs to be fixed and he thinks he might be able to be the one that fixes it and he's particularly aware of it  Because of what he's been told what he can and can't do  But I don't know if it's it's as simple as he wants to say what he wants to say and and closer to you know  I'm being affected by this but a lot of other people are being affected by it and it needs to be  Adjusted and I can do that

Start time: 1189.90
End time: 1201.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Still arrogant it's still arrogant, but it's that what it's there. He's a libertarian. He thinks more free speech is better  I have no reason to think that isn't a sincere aspect of why he's interested in it. I

Start time: 1203.22
End time: 1213.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Feel like Twitter has an over  blown  Importance in society though partly because there's so many journalists on it and everything that gets said on Twitter gets amplified by these journalists

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz it's a it's a quick way to get you know, you see like coming through  Yeah, you know, it's the I mean to me the two the two biggest ones for that actually is  Twitter and tech meme right, you know, you know the things like flashing through the system and you're constantly I mean  I yeah  I know of a CEO that just keeps tech being open on one screen. It's legit. That's so that's a that's a news source. It's

Start time: 1256.56
End time: 1269.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Tech meme used to be based on it used to be algorithmic right Brian and then and now it is you have editors  But it didn't used to be based on tweets. It was well, it was it launched before Twitter. Okay

Start time: 1270.72
End time: 1314.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But there was some algorithm  Yeah, I don't know how much Gabe wants me to tell you but yeah  It was essentially an algorithm that then Gabe spent all day with his sort of finger on the on the dials  Yeah, and so essentially what happens now is there's 24-7  I'm on the tech meme slack right now and there's there's editors. There's an editor working in India right now  24-7 there are people monitoring the the algorithm and then  Adjusting and writing the headlines and things like that  so a lot of what they do now is they take the  Sort of lead from the algorithm and then decide how and in which ways to sort of craft it onto the page  Which we do include and things like that clearly

Start time: 1314.70
End time: 1337.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean if you go to tech meme and by the way, we all use this  I certainly use it if you go to tech meme, you'll see  References to people writing an article, but then you'll see a lot of tweets. I mean clearly Twitter  Tech meme is to some degree much  Like what was it what was I used to use all the time that was all tweets all the time that they bought and the buying

Start time: 1339.12
End time: 1348.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the algorithm gives the signal of what is important and what has landed at the top and  Then they decide how and whether it's whether it's worth covering or not

Start time: 1349.08
End time: 1369.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, cuz you don't want you know, but the Kardashians living at the top there  You've really got to make sure that it's it sticks to the Hughes to the tech  topics  Nevertheless, I think it's safe to say well, I don't know is it I mean when Trump was tweeting  It was a bully pulpit for a guy who

Start time: 1370.30
End time: 1420.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Theoretically has the bully pulpit if you get it if you get enough followers. I mean it does have an impact  Like so it's I mean you definitely have you know, it definitely has an impact  I I don't I you know, I have a meager number of followers, but like every once in a while  I'll do something with Justine and Justine twits something out and you realize she lives in an entirely different world than I do  Like you know, it's like, yeah  It's like suddenly there's just this huge focus of things that all happen  So if you have a lot of followers  You know, it's it's it's a it has a big impact. It moves a lot of people it sells a lot of products  It you know moves, you know people think about things because you're out in front of them  It's and it's a it's a different world because it used to be all controlled by people who it was three networks  They told us what to what was happening and then the cable networks spread it out and social networks spread it out somewhere  Yeah, so it's it's you know, it's just that it's a it's a progression from it's closer to being a town square than it is

Start time: 1422.58
End time: 1434.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To being a town square than anything else and people keep thinking  They can create their own Twitter like thing and it basically never works  Which is why Donald Trump even has his own Twitter clone, which is not

You know the fire and and I think that the fire if we start looking at the fire  I think we would probably go back to Lee Atwater  so so the thing is is that there was an assumption in the 80s in the late 80s that  You know or he came across this idea that that Karl Rove picked up speed on later in the 90s  Which is that you don't have to pay attention to the center you do the social core the social  Social politics gets the core the base  Well, it's not get the either side get the core and energized and get the opposition not to show up  Yeah  And that's all you have to do to win  And he proved that he could do that Karl Rove proved that he could do that and both sides employ it now  Is that you get the core to show up and there's an incredible amount of energy spent on that

I did some I did a tweet and I have no idea why it had it got so many  It was running for months. It was getting huge numbers of read, you know of stuff some bot like latched onto it  I looked at it was like an innocuous tweet, but it fulfilled some model of  Disinformation that was and I deleted it. I was like, I don't know why I don't know why this is being used  But I don't want to be used and I just took it out, you know, but but it was  Because I kept on watching it was just one tweet and it was again very very like I don't like ABC TV or something  I don't like this show.

Let's say he brings in a whole new regime and how things are done  is there something that he could do that would kill Twitter for you and  and and because I've been asking people like, you know  Twitter has been famous for not iterating on its product, but I feel like they know that  It's so delicate that they don't want to do it  So if he comes in there and stomps around and changes a whole bunch of stuff  Would it be certain people like the people that you love following leaving like what would be the thing for any of you?

Transcript:  Yep  Let's see we could talk about Ukraine. Of course. That's the eternal story if you watch cable news  But there is a tech story the you may remember back in 2015 and not this concern me. I remember this  the  Ukraine grid went down for a number of hours under attack we thought from  nation state actors probably Russia  That that at that time  That was a malware used by they found out Sam worm in 2016 which is the  One of the names for the GR use the Russian military intelligence hacking group. I think it's fancy bear cozy bear  They have all the all the cute little name sandworm  They were using in destroyer  Well, this is the problem when you reuse malware eSent Microsoft say they stopped an attack  This week on the Ukraine grid  Discovering a new variant of the same old worm that they used back in 2016  the  Ukraine governmental computer emergency response team so the attack  Went after several infrastructure elements including high voltage electrical substations  computers at the facility network equipment and server equipment running Linux  two waves of attack the initial compromise had happened back in February and  Then they triggered it Friday April 8th. They triggered it in the evening  But he said and Microsoft saw it and stopped it  So the good news is  We have talked a lot about cyber warfare being one of the consequences of the Ukraine war  invasion and  Even that the u.s. Might be victims of this but the problem of course is you can't use these tools more than once and  You you know you kind of have to save your powder  I guess until the time is right and I've been wondering why haven't we seen more attacks?  Why haven't we seen more attacks? Well, here's one reason

Transcript:  Maybe we won't  You know the hard part with when you do any kind of attack you got to make sure that it's going to be  Effective because you're showing something like this is what you can see here, right?  They showed it you know back a couple years ago  And then when they try to do it again, it's hard to do it again  And that's why you want to keep your powder dry in this area  So so unless they feel like they're really going to be able to succeed and Russia has not proven that they can see it succeed  At many things yeah, so I think that you know using  You know just firing off an attack  They have to really feel like they can they're going to achieve the result or it's not worth using up  Whatever secret that they figured out exactly

They drop munitions on these tanks  Yeah, and so and again the other problem is is that when you start if you're getting good at drones you start building like actually  Capable ones you've got a lot of electronics in there  And the drone is going to get shot down right and you don't want to give it up  You know you don't you know like the United States doesn't want to have their drone  You know they'll send people in to go get those you know because they don't they have a bunch of stuff in them that they  Don't want to they don't want other people to copy you know because drones are very very it's a very destructive technology  There's a I worked at an a life  An a life company in the early 90s that you know could it could learn like it had an or it was a you know  Computing organism that could learn and we ended up putting a little game  But it was but the military wanted to spend a lot of money on it and the owners the founders wouldn't sell it to them  But what they were talking about was firing missiles firing many many many small missiles and as you shoot them down  They're figuring out how to get around you like you know  So you just you just shoot you just fire lots of them you have to shoot them down  They're big enough, and then the missiles just keep getting bigger as the as they start to learn  You know what your defenses are and that was 30 years ago  like so so so it's so the the thing is is that there's a  Capability of using these drones and if you have a lot of them even if they're small that you can't ignore them and as you  Shoot at them you are telling you you're you're giving away your position and so  We were seeing a little bit of that here  But we you know definitely that was pretty used pretty heavily in Afghanistan.

We'd probably  Do the same thing the other thing you have the the other thing is is the China Russia?  We spend a lot of time trying not to shoot the nukes there's a rumor that of course Russia has the dead switch  You know like so if you shut everything down it just starts firing right you know so right

It's a pretty big battery  It might might get you make get you through the night  Let's see what else muting your mic. This is an interesting story. We won't know the real story  until this  Report comes out University of Washington  Sorry University of Wisconsin Madison  Tested quote many popular apps to see if the video conferencing apps continue to capture audio  When you press the mute button and apparently many of them  Do we won't know which until the 2022 privacy enhancing technologies?  Symposium that's when the paper will be published this June  but the  report says  All of the apps they tested occasionally gather raw audio data  One popular app I'm gonna I'm pretty sure it's zoom  I'm just gonna say because zooms had this problem before  Continued to gather data to the audio to its server at the same rate regardless of whether the microphone is muted or not now  It's your zoom expert  This does not surprise me that mute button on zoom is  Mostly just saying don't send my audio to everybody in the conference  Yeah, I will say that you know it makes me feel like I'm not going to be able to do it

Start time: 3417.90
End time: 3470.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It may inadvertently do that. I can tell I will say that zoom worries about I mean, especially after what happened in 2020  Security is really important to them. You know so I think that if they see something like that. It's probably a you know a  Very very big serious thing for them to get rid of you know. I don't know if it's it's a very popular  There are we don't know a bunch of very popular ones that are less technologically advanced than zoom  So if you look at web x and go to meeting and meet and teams and you know  To be honest with you  I'd be more likely to think it was teams than than zoom because I mean zoom has got a laser folk teams is very complicated  It's just connected to a lot of things  zoom is focused on one one thing and  The security now in zoom if you turn all the dials up. It's pretty secure. You know like it's and so  You can inadvertently open it all the time though. That's the problem is that it's you know I have a physical mute right here

Start time: 3471.39

Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, it's it  Yeah, I think that I think that it's it's we see a lot of people in office hours  Of course is all in zoom and so we have a lot of people inadvertently muting themselves around me  So one of the most popular things in any zoom meeting is we can't hear you you know yeah muted and so so the you know  So it's and so inadvertently turning it on and off is a pretty common thing  I think that they're not I think that and I think that most of these companies  I mean, it's it definitely could be a problem  I think most of these companies are  They consider holding on to that information without telling you to be a hot potato  You know like that's not something that they that they really want because they know it'll you know it's it's a lot of kryptonite there  So the other thing you'll notice if you if you've seen pictures sometimes of  Some business leaders you'll notice that they have a headphone jack a little thing that pops in their headphone jack  That tells it at the headphone, but there's no mic to it, and they have their their  Usually their webcam taped off almost all of us do that have worked in this it's my minds off  You know I have a I have another camera and mine's I my webcams all get taped and then I get and then  And even like if you look at Apple if you do anything  That asks for permission of that webcam like to talk to it like webcam settings or whatever  You have to restart your computer to use it like it's just Apple just immediately turns it off  So so I think that there's there's a lot of sensitivity to it  But but even then you again you have a  Business leaders and world leaders that will put things into it make it to fool the hardware to not  Take anything in I have a little physical  This is a Lenovo has a little physical switch that I can see those are nice mechanically going over the camera

Yeah  particularly if this is something that  the people doing the selling can do to us and we have no ability to  Do I do the same thing to see how they're feeling and if we might be able to cut a deal or whatever?  Yeah, I think that  Particularly if it's being done without us knowing specifically that this is being done rather than just we're being recorded  It just sounds terrible. There's a zoom one sounds slightly less bad because it's not real time  They're taking video afterwards and an aggregate analyzing it  Which I also don't like but it's not quite as terrifying it integrates into Salesforce gonna have to have new Salesforce  Settings I think about something like buying a car where you know all along  Forever when people have been trying to sell you a car they're trying to read you and trying to figure out well

I'm I'm looking at other things  And I didn't think about it until I did that and I realized they do that in person, too  I mean like if I'm at a seminar  Slide up too long I'll start doing other things  But it was it was really interesting that data was super valuable and we do that we did that all through the odds you know with  Ads you know print ads websites the design of websites  We would look at you get 200 random samples in there you have random people and it turns out they  The lower brain does a lot of things really fast you could put an ad in a certain place in a page and no one  Would even see it and so you know that you just learn where you know if there's certain colors and certain things  The brain the eyes are gonna go where they're you know they're gonna go a certain way and very few people will vary from that  And and so but so that was used in web design ad design video ad design. You know it's there's a lot of  You know eye tracking is a is a real thing and that not as a certain person because it turns out you don't need to  The eye tracking is pretty  You know certain designs and colors and objects will take the lower brain and just have a look at things  You know and so you just got to figure out what that is

Transcript:  So if you don't get something good Brian, oh, I'm sorry and then I'll stop because I keep cutting you off. It's good Alex  I apologize. Sorry. If you just zoom it's fine. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, if you read that whole piece it is  It sort of is making the same argument that we've heard people put into Apple's mouth about how they believe  That there's a line in there that second wants this to be his iPhone moment that they really do believe by the end of the decade  That they can be selling hundreds of millions of these a year or whatever. So, you know, obviously metas  Is  overarching motivation for this is to get out from under the thumb of Google and Apple  But it is interesting what I found fascinating about the piece is it laying out the timeline where you know  They'll have a really high-end one at the beginning 2024 is what they're claiming and then  Iteration iteration iteration and it's not till 2028 and into the next decade that they're feeling like, okay now this will be mass adoption  So if you're meta if you're a meta investor and they're spending ten billion dollars a year on this already now  You're look at all the time and money and effort you you better hope that they're right at the end of the decade that this  Is the next big thing it's bold

It's pretty bold to say yeah  We're gonna abandon this successful business and  Put all our money on the you know  Our chips on something that is unproven that no one has really shown there's even a market for let alone a

Transcript:  Successful business behind the verge piece is great. And I actually yesterday wrote a piece  spinning out of what Alex Heath did specifically about this idea that this is met out wanting to create a  iPhone moment a next big thing a there have hardly been any iPhone moments other than the iPhone  Yeah in tech history. Yeah be it this really speaks to something deep I think in Mark Zuckerberg  Which is not just me psychoanalyzing him. It's also based on the fact that in 2015  I did a big story on what was then Facebook and he told me that like one of his few  disappointments was that  Facebook never got to have its own mobile operating system  operating system  so it always Facebook phone Facebook always sat as a layer on top of yeah the iPhone or  an Android phone and

Transcript:  The problems with it not controlling an operating system  Really came to for last year when Apple rolled out the  application tracking transparency  Which lets the user say yes, it's okay for this app to track me or no  They're not allowed to track me and then  you know  Meta says it's gonna lose billions and billions of dollars this year because  Apple has made it extremely easy for users 10 billion this year  So  back in 2015 his concerns were  extremely reasonable from his standpoint and and the downside of not controlling your own platform is still playing out for them and  There's a pretty decent chance that if AR does become something big  It will become a battle between whatever Apple comes up with and whatever meta comes up with and if you were Mark Zuckerberg  Wouldn't you be deeply concerned by the possibility that that Apple will have the iPhone moment?  Of AR and he might be stuck in the same situation  He he has been all these years of having to do things the way Apple wants him to do them

Transcript:  I it's extremely bold. He you know, obviously he's a smart fella  he knows about the innovators dilemma and  Normally a company like meta would rest on its laurels and try to kind of dribble out something that might be your next thing  But still continue to support the current thing. He sounds like he's saying I'm gonna cut through that and I am gonna take a massive gamble  I'm going all in on AR even though it's gonna take me years 10 billion a year

Transcript:  It's a really hard problem. It's also a really hard problem  I mean, I I think that that  Zuckerberg's  History with this is proud is related to reading ready player one  And well remember though, he bought Oculus Rift for a lot of money, but I'm saying he read ready player one  I think he saw I I think that he has  He may have seen a future that Facebook could really be part of you know  Like that that it's an all-encompassing experience a different world  And then bought Oculus because it's the closest thing to what was going on and you know, it's it's a  It's a really hard problem to a lot of it has to do with there's a bunch of problems  I worked and in full disclosure. I mean I I did a lot of the initial  360 video stuff for Facebook. So I'm thought about this a lot and  the  The thing is is that the 360 video I mean that's when we were doing, you know that that OZO that I brought to your  House yeah to your office  That's what I was doing  We were doing a lot of the early stuff in that area and the hard part the first really hard part is is  Resolution resolution and frame rate so you have to get that resolution and takes an enormous amount of data to do that  Well, you know, so we were playing with 4k 30, but you really need to get to 8k 120 to really have it  Do what it needs to do and that would require a lot of chip like an m1 chip just to do that  you know, and so  so anyway, so it's it's a  That on your head to do that on your head and probably it'd be very hard

Transcript:  I did a story recently too that said and I'm breaking my promise not to interrupt you that  Okay, even if you saw it's a better show if we all interrupt each other trust if you  Even if you solve the hardware and the the compute stuff  You know on the user  I did a story maybe was a couple months ago that said  Someone was pointing out that we don't have the infrastructure  To beam all of the stuff that is required to do sort of like a really immersive a really convincing metaverse  Because even if you solve all of the local hardware and compute problems  We don't have it's it's it's so far beyond what 5g or 8g or anything could do that  That even if you solve this problem by the end of the decade, you might not have the infrastructure in place to make it real

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, kind of I mean so if you're doing video  Absolutely if you're doing so if you're if you're taking it  I want to do with servers off-site or whatever because you really are like if you're doing 8k 120 per eye  You're talking hundreds of megabits per second that need to be delivered to you  But but the geometry if you send the geometry to it that doesn't you know  You can send very high resolution geometry for an entire world and maybe that takes a little bit of time  But then once they're what you need is GPU and CPU power to render it  So if you're rendering it remotely, you're absolutely right  If you're rendering it locally, it doesn't it can be a lot of geometry that it has to manage  But it might be 30 40  Maybe 100 million polygons or something like that and you can you can work inside of that and then what you do is we take  Level what we call level of detail LODs  And so basically things off in the distance don't have very much geometry  Things in close to you have a lot of geometry and better textures and all those other things and so that you can kind of  wander around in them the bigger problem than all of the technical problems is the difference between what people feel what they think they're  They're experiencing and what they feel that they're experiencing  So there's like a frontal lobe lower brain problem  Which is that if they feel like they're in something that is that is real and then their lower brain says I'm not getting what I  Need the Delta between those two is depression, you know, and that's what  Yeah, you know, so so basically people get there they're they're they're basically filling  There they're saying VR makes you sad  Well, the social media makes you sad  So so the thing is you think you're you think you're in a community, but you're not and so what happens is  It's a good point  Yeah  Because you're filled you keep on going to Twitter and Facebook looking for this is where my friends are going to be and you keep  On pulling it all in but there's no fulfillment  It's kind of like, you know  The easiest way to kill ants is to feed him a Splenda  You just put sugar out and you slowly cut it with Splenda and they can't tell the difference and they just start to death  and so the  Yeah, go ahead

Transcript:  One more thing though  Like okay, we're talking about like all of this money spent and and Leo said this is a bull bet  It is a bull bet and maybe it's something that they have to do because maybe social media is a thing that's on the downturn  But aside from will the technology work out? Will it be adapted? Will the infrastructure be there?  There's one more big thing is will people want it from Mark Zuckerberg like that to me  No, that's a huge biggest risk. Yeah, but what choice does Mark have? I mean if he's he does Mark Zuckerberg

End time: 4999.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He is Mark Zuckerberg. So he can't really you know, I mean, I think actually this may be you  Alex Heath makes a very good argument for this being the boldest bet we've ever seen in technology  Apple with all of its investment in AR and they're all in on it is still selling the iPhone  That's still their main business. This is this is really a I think unprecedented  Willingness to take a giant risk and I have to praise Zuckerberg for that. And yeah, he's stuck with himself  There's nothing he could do about it. He's got to be  People will get over that if it's a good I'll tell you what if it's a good enough technology if  It's really good people will get over that. Don't you think Oculus is an interesting case study because

Start time: 5019.62
End time: 5028.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that the other issue is just content is hard to make like it. There's not that many compelling  Things to do I have a quest of course and and I just thought that much to play and then the other big problem  For the quest this is a really interesting problem is the quest doesn't have a diopter  You can't change the focus on it right and the same the old Samsung gears did a lot of us that would use the quest  Wear glasses look so so the problem is is that you have to either ruin your glasses or you have to get the  Special things for them to you know the the lenses for them to work and then someone else has to pop out other lenses the ability  Not I stopped using it like my kids use it  I just was like I'm tired of dealing with this and so  So the so I barely use the quest and but I think that there's there's a huge crossover of of geeks and glasses  So I think that they that's something they're kind of running up against it'll be interesting to see how people handle because I know  That I use that I would always prefer to use the gear because I could take my glasses off throw it on and just scroll  A little wheel until everything was in focus  Yeah, not comfortably you know and if you have nice glasses  It'll destroy them like it just destroys their glasses slowly your glasses slowly  You have to put the lenses in or you have to destroy it have a glass basically cheap glasses  You buy out of you know some online thing that you wear this is one of

Transcript:  Apples doing an incremental thing which is very interesting right everything Apple does is building towards it looks like building towards this kind of a future  I guess you could kind of say with the acquisition of oculus  With the release of the Facebook Ray-Ban glasses with the release of the quest apples  I mean Mike is slowly moving in that direction  But not doesn't feel like the same kind of incrementalism as Apple Apple has a different approach to this  They're not bet in the farm on this the Ray-Ban's apparently it did not sell as well as  I mean the marketplace has said again and again. We don't want this I think well what Alex said about content is

You know like it was like okay once you beat it you it's kind of like okay now  What do I do?  But because you go out and play other games, and they just weren't as good and so and they commission that I mean oculus commissioned  That from from epic or whatever and so so it was a great. It was basically first-person shooter with robots and  Really really really well made game

They don't have good audio  So they're looking at these hazy faces and their brain is doing there's all this cognitive load of the brain sitting there trying to figure  Out what it's looking at and what it's hearing because people have bad audio and bad video we're on office hours  We stay on for hours  It doesn't bother us at all because everybody's got a good mic and a good camera  So the thing is is that go ahead

Do they have ten years your stuff?  I mean, I still really feel like it if  If this kind of AR and the metaverse really is real in the 2030s and we're sitting around talking about it  It's there's a very high chance the companies what we'll be talking about are not met at or Apple or even any company that exists  Right now  Historically, it's been pretty rare for the tech industry to work that way  Apple has been like one of the few really big exceptions that they've been able to ride more than one wave  There's not would not be a lot of precedent  If if meta can go from social networking in its historic form the kind of stuff we're talking about now

It's not putting it's not going all in  It's like one chip off the pile  You know to do this and so I think that they can continue to work on a lot of different business models because they've got  A lot of revenue coming in and I don't think that's gonna go anywhere  It's the social media is a pretty I mean Facebook's a pretty sticky thing  And even with some of the search stuff not working and costing them some money  It is when you do Facebook advertising it is like looking into this both Facebook and Google  It's like looking into the Sun. I mean it is there is so much when you  Meetings when you were meetings with folks  They're like so what's your multiplier and multiplier is how much how many dollars do you bring in versus the dollar you put into the Facebook?  It's usually like, you know, three four six. Yeah, we used to say ROI now. It's multiplier which give you some but it's a multiple  It's not 30%  So if you if you if you understand how to you know  And that's why all those that's why all those tracking bits are important because it shows the effectiveness the ad and you know  It's not trying to track you to do things and showing how how can the ad do?

You're right. It's not gonna  I guess it's not make or break for Metta  Feels like it  Feels like they're willing to kind of ignore their core business to some extent to me.

Transcript:  You must have eight sleep as a sponsor too  Also Harry mccracken the  Technologizer Alex Lindsay from office hours dot global. Do you have a eight sleep cover by any chance Brian? I do not  Oh, I'm gonna get you to get one. Let me tell you yes, Kevin Rose told me about this on a twit some time ago  Amy Webb was on that twitch. She got one then she said this is the greatest sleep. We finally got one a few months ago. I  Love this now for a long time. We had  Electric blanket to keep us warm at night and then we got electric instead of got electric mattress pad  Warmth coming up, but the problem is that's a one-way trip to sweaty sleep  The eight sleep is  Amazing. It not only gets warmer. It gets cooler  The eights we have the eight sleep pod pro cover  It can go down to 55 degrees or as hot as 110 degrees  I can't wait to a hot summer night because it's gonna be air conditioning in my bed  But it's amazing and if you know if you think a little bit and I've read some  Evolutionary scientists who've said if you think about how we sleep they know that we sleep better when it's cool not hot when it's cool  But what you really want is to get in bed  It's nice and toasty and then it gets cooled off in the middle of the night  You get the deepest sleep then and then to wake up you warm yourself up again  And that's exactly what my eight sleep pod pro cover does. I'm gonna do something a little risky here  I'm gonna open up my eight sleep app  Just to see what my sleep score was I have to say before eight sleep I'm in the 60s  I'm in the 50s. Oh, I didn't have a very good night last night. It was only 84%  Sleep fitness I have to tell you it  Normally, it's up in the 90s last time I showed it was 98  I think I've gotten to a hundred percent which I don't think I experienced when I was an infant  This is the app is monitoring your sleep it the cover actually monitors your restless  Your heart rate your breathing and then adjusts the temperature  According to how you're sleeping they have something called autopilot. I have a temperature schedule update from autopilot  This is my temperature update. It says at bedtime  I'm gonna be plus four and it's go to go down plus two plus two plus five  I have and and by the way as it gets hotter over because it also is checking the room temperature  This will modify itself automatically  It is amazing it is  absolutely transformative and  You're right Brian good sleep is a game-changer for alertness  But not just for that for health  Research shows good sleep can decrease the risk of heart disease. It can lower your blood pressure  Did you see my rest and heart rate? It's pretty good  Thank you eight sleep more than 30% of Americans struggle with sleep temperature one of the main causes of poor sleep the solution  Eight sleep e i g h t sleep and the pod pro cover now  What's nice is of course Lisa has different my wife has different sleep needs so the temperature of the cover adjusts each side of the bed  It's looking at sleep stages biometrics bedward temperature reacts intelligently her settings are completely different from mine  Eight sleep users fall asleep up to 32% faster  reduce sleep interruptions by 40% and  Overall get a more restful sleep, and I can absolutely vouch for that. Let me just see last night  It was 88%  Friday night look Thursday. I got 99% and  I tell you the other stats are fantastic the time to fall asleep was one minute  That's because it was so cozy time to get up six minutes. It wakes me up by heating up and I jump out of bed  It's  Fantastic you can see your sleep stages your tosses and turns your sleeping heart rate which for me got down to 62  This is I I love you eight sleep. I just want to say this I love you  Deeply with 30% more deep sleep. I feel like my mind and body are moving through the restorative sleep stages  vital for physical recovery hormone regulation  Mental clarity when I work out and I know you know my resting heart rate is down low my heart rate variability  Is high I just feel better  Powered by eight sleep. I can show up as the best partner parent and podcaster  So that's why Brian McCullough you have to get eight sleep eight sleep comm slash twit  We're gonna save you $150 at checkout on the pod pro cover  They also have a mattress eight sleep currently ships within the US Canada and the UK  $150 off when you go to eight sleep e i g h t sleep comm slash twit  All right, I'm gonna stop raving about this  But I have to say it's the best night's sleep I've ever had and Lisa and I are both saying this is gonna be great  On those hot summer nights when it's you're sweating you're hot  You can't cool off you got the we get the fan on and it's like oh you're dying  I don't have to worry about it. It's just gonna cool. It's gonna be so nice. I can't wait so great eight sleep  It's been great during the cold winter nights to eight sleep comm slash  twit talking about VR Harry McCracken I've heard of him fast company  Earlier this month wrote an article what the 1994 Bill Gates keynote  Tells us about the metaverse did did bill know about the metaverse in 1994

Transcript:  They're trying to do stuff. That's out there, but not incredibly out there. They're I  think he was trying to kind of pretty much figure out what the next things would be and  I thought of this again coming back to Mark Zuckerberg  He's somebody who now is making these pretty elaborate videos showing life in the metaverse. That's right  Which are really in a lot of ways reminiscent to this and I think the lesson is a  If you're really smart, you might get some of the broad picture, right?  But that doesn't mean you can predict the little details and be when when the stuff did come along  again kind of a little bit more like  2007 2008  Moving forward rather than 2005  The fact that Bill Gates was pretty good at  Anticipating what would happen did not mean that Microsoft  Dominated all the stuff that came very good point. Instead Microsoft released a lot of things that weren't terribly successful  They did they did not dominate smartphones

Transcript:  Maybe running away from you and somebody else determining that so  So the fact that Microsoft even though it was quite good at predicting the future was not even really able to leverage that  Partially because it had this big business in Windows which defined how it how it saw the world  I think has some lessons for us when we look at well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the graph that Facebook has of people and they're connected and how they're connected other people is very advantageous for a virtual world  And again, I think that that's an interesting puzzle where you see Apple not going down that path  They're not trying to build that out. They're trying to augment what you already have. They're not worried about social at all  Not yet. Not yet. Apple's only assays into social were historic flops  Right. Yeah, because they don't think that way they think so much about privacy and about the individual  But I think they have a hard time getting even even when you look at pages and numbers which I love by the way  But the interaction between other people like sharing your pages or keynote is a great way to just not have it work anymore  So it's like doesn't work at all  Apple did

This is the blue land  Foaming hand soap. So this is designed never to be thrown out. It's a beautiful heavy glass  Container I filled it with water so that didn't have to be shipped anywhere up to the fill line  And then I'm gonna add the let's see. What flavor is this Iris agave the foaming hand soap  Little this is the little tablet and you subscribe and they send you the tablet in the mail  So you never run out it makes the best hand soap ever and I don't throw away plastics  But it's not just hand soap get in there.

I mean that's well, but that doesn't count is that I mean that there that's the the executive has that and so it doesn't  Cost more to put someone in I mean, the only difference is the little sandwiches, you know, so the  You gotta have a taste. They're expensive. They're expensive. Yeah, we'll say the sandwiches are really good anyway, so the  It's more remarkably good like you're like, how did they get really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's cool. So they wanted to stream 160 miles off the coast of  Oregon which means you can't shoot down because you can't you know, so that's how you know, and you can't and then it didn't have an  Appointed satellite dish and so you couldn't so we were we told them isn't gonna work  I'm not gonna say who it was we told them it wasn't gonna work  But they still wanted they were committed to doing it  I was like well if you want me to go up and test it I will  But well they just they just just they just rented a g4 and it comes with the sandwiches and someone who serves them  So and they're really nice they're really good sandwiches anyway, so they come but the Air Force one however can stream  I should say yeah, yeah, exactly. So so, you know that with security though  I mean so a lot of some someone at that level is is typically pulling people out of soft  You know special operations and as well as SAS  I mean those are the two and the problem is is that  The issue that you have with it is that they have to be good at what they do and these are usually people who are  Really good at what they do and they also have to be  Public facing so there's a lot of people who are really good looking in well  They can't have face tats and not gruff and not gruff, you know, like it's not like yeah respond, you know respond badly  Yeah, so so the thing is is that there's you know, so there's a big percentage of the people who aren't  Publicly facing end up at Blackwater and the people who are  Security and but you are competing with Blackwater salaries, which are like 300,000 a year  So so you you know you get a group of people that have to take care of someone then you end up with you know  Six to eight of folks there. That's your base then you have to travel them around then you have to you know  Then you have you know all their hotels and anytime you go anywhere  There's a group of these people that are that are wandering around and making sure their beings working  So you have you know it if the person travels a lot  So, you know, my guess is it's it's heavily related to how much an executive travels is how much in mark  you know, we would assume gets around and and so the other thing is you'd have to
