No, we're back dealt because Delta  Oh well, let's let this has not become the apocalypse show so we'll pretend something wonderful is going on  Let me see if I could find that. Oh  How about this Apple says oh never mind we spent  Many hours talking about Apple's child sexual abuse material detection  Larry I should actually start with you because you are very active in protecting children online  Apple as everybody knows because we talked about it  Adnauseum was going to use the database from neck Mac. You work closely with neck Mac  The national center board for 20 years. Yeah missing exploited children  They're an organization found started and funded by the government but non-governmental they're non-profit  but they do maintain and they're the only place legally allowed to maintain a database of  Child sexual abuse material they create a fingerprint hash that almost everybody uses to detect it on their own servers  So they don't have to send the images around just the fingerprint and Google  Microsoft Facebook everybody uses this to detect it Apple's proposal  Was a little different instead of scanning right there on iCloud as everybody else does  Apple wanted to scan the images on their way to iCloud  Yeah, in other words put the scanner on your phone and I don't know if that was what triggered people  But there was something about this sacrosanct  Phone that made people say no Apple and the Apple's I think  listening

Start time: 401.74
End time: 410.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those ads Apple ran that said what happens in your phone stays in your phone  Yeah, Apple might have been that could have been why people thought this about their yeah  I think you're right

Start time: 410.72
End time: 440.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They created expectations and of course Apple fought the good fight  With the FBI around the time when the FBI wanted to break their  encryption around the  San Bernardino shooter the thing that but I think Apple really had a bad messaging over this  I mean part of the problem is  The kind of stuff that Apple would have reported to neck Mac the National Center for the Females Poetic Children  I don't want to go into it on this show, but this is not pictures of topless 17 year old  Oh, no, it's horrible really horrible horrible stuff

Start time: 440.72
End time: 493.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's we can stipulate that and I think it's important and I'm gonna let you talk in a second  But I think it's important to say right up front  Nobody was opposed to this was in favor of this imagery right child pornography  Pederasty of any kind nobody was saying that but there is also this notion that if a company wants to do something intrusive  they wrap it in  think of the children or  Terrorism they wrap it in these hot-button subjects so that deflects criticism  So I just want to say that up front when nobody's proposing that this stuff should exist  Everybody says yes, it's a good idea to come up with stuff. In fact, I'm gonna go a step farther  I don't think anybody is mad at Facebook or  Microsoft or Google for doing the same thing on their cloud  Servers like Google does it with gmail attachments and nobody nobody said boo about that

Start time: 494.60
End time: 534.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And in fact, they're obligated if it if it shows up on their servers and if their  Algorithm matching software which by the way was developed by Microsoft  It's called photo D&I if it spots that or for it gets a hit against the neck Mac database  Then they are legally obligated to report it to the cyber tip line which is operated by the National Center and  I think that's a good model. I think part of Apple's problem is again on one hand  I think they were thinking that by doing this on the device  They were actually making for greater privacy for their users  but it really confused a matter and and and created the backlash which  Was probably fair. I'm not saying it was it's unfair, but it was unfortunate because they were trying to do the right thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You say the benefits you actually wrote an article about this last month  Outweigh the risks, but has your has your mind been changed in the three weeks since by the conversation?

Start time: 547.50
End time: 595.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to some extent I  Think that if I were to rewrite that article today  I would say they need to figure out a way to reduce the risks and you know to enhance the benefits because  I think again if they move it to the iCloud server and stop scanning on the phone  Then I would say the risks are are very well under control and I don't think anybody would object to that because  What everybody does I was just trying to make the point that there's a really good reason to do this and  And I also made the point that there are always risks in any form of spell. Look, I've got a doorbell camera  I think it has great benefits  But does that mean that if you decide to walk in front of my house with somebody you shouldn't be with?  That your privacy could be invaded. Absolutely. And so we have to figure out all of these trade-offs  You know in the world that we live in right now

Start time: 597.32
End time: 636.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple obviously feeling the heat they were planning to roll this out with iOS 15  Which I'm gonna guess would have rolled out this month. I think it's pretty safe  Have decided to delay it  I don't know if they're gonna wait until the heat cools off and then do it or if they want to find a better way  to do it, but it might be my guess at what Apple Apple did not want to do what you suggested Larry because  Ultimately, they'd like to have end-to-end encryption on iCloud so that they can avoid subpoenas from law enforcement in this country and other countries  They can avoid that whole thing by putting in an encryption on iCloud  Which means the only way they could find those images is on their way in or on their way out

Start time: 637.02
End time: 661.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and by the way, you know encryption is it having been on the board of the National Center  Most of my colleagues were very anti encryption and I argued that encryption actually  Protects children along with everyone else so that there, you know  There are pros and cons from this from the safety standpoint forget other issues from a safety standpoint  There are advantages to encryption as well as some risks that it brings in or at least hamperings of law enforcement

Start time: 663.30
End time: 712.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And it very well could be that  I'm sorry. No, please go ahead that that Apple's  Rationale was based on this kind of reductionist lack of nuance  Conversation that has happened with their peers particularly Facebook and their peers also  Acquire the language around safety and encryption to talk about how your content is protected  But there really has been an unnuanced debate about this exact topic and many of Apple's peers have kind of confused it  And harmed public trust so it could have been that Apple was maybe  Trying to do exactly what you suggested  I  Don't know but I think the the it could have been that they're looking for a simpler solution  I'm not sure who you're talking who you're talking about

Start time: 713.00
End time: 730.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's hope Facebook is getting a lot of flack up from law enforcement and many in the child safety community  Not me, but others I was talking about Facebook specifically  Yeah  Well Facebook and other end Google and anyone who's dealing encryption is bound to get flack from law enforcement and some people in child safety  And some people in child protection and they don't

Start time: 731.90
End time: 753.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Flack from everybody else, but Facebook reported 20 more than 20 million  Images matching the NICMAC database in 2020 Apple reported  20 million from Facebook  256 from Apple I think that number alone was one of the reasons Apple said we got to do something  This does not look good if nothing else the optics

Start time: 754.04
End time: 810.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The main question here and from my perspective is where's the consistency for Apple  So if we look back to the time where the company had the showdown with the FBI over the San Bernardino terrorists phone  The key wasn't you know, should we protect this, you know?  Emmett this data that could potentially lead us to solve like what might be, you know  A terrorist network operating in the US or foil the next attack Apple's argument was if we are to create this key  We are going to create this opportunity for it to be used in the future for things that are not this specific  We're gonna open the door. So therefore we're not touching this at all. And while this is a valiant attempt, you know  They it doesn't sink with the same logic  They had back with the FBI case where like they're not gonna allow any anything to happen on device because you don't know what it's  Going to be used for next and I think that was exactly what the EFF and many experts were worried about with Apple's

Start time: 811.04
End time: 858.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Scanning on the phone is that then the government could come to Apple and said well, by the way, we'd also like you to find  image of gay  Kissing or something if it's Saudi Arabia and as a result that would be problematic  There were other issues as well  In fact, one of the things Apple seems to cite is that some of the technology were a lot of technologists using these neural  Hashes who said you're gonna have a problem. It's not that accurate  The Apple said specifically we want to make improvements before releasing these  Critically important child safety features. It's interesting neck Mac warned Apple at the very beginning  This was another thing that lit a bit of a fire saying you're gonna hear. What was it Larry shrieking?  commentators  Decrying what you're doing pay no attention to them

Start time: 861.05
End time: 919.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that may have been a mistake in neck back again. No kidding. I stepped down from the board a year ago  I stepped down from the board a year ago, so I can't take any responsibility  but there are people who neck neck who get it and there are people who don't and  The ones who get it understand that we have to we cannot use child protection as an excuse for surveillance  And you know in 19 2012 I gave I was looking at two speeches in Moscow and I gave my first speech to a group of basically  NGOs where I argued that you cannot combine child protection or child pornography  With other harms and that was exactly what Putin and his team were doing. It's worse than anything else is what you're saying  Yeah, yeah, you know, you've got to just focus on that  But Putin and and company created this law that lumped all of these things terrorism child pornography extremism into one law  And guess what the next speech I was supposed to give suddenly they ran out of time right before I was about to speak  big government televised event  They didn't like my message

Start time: 920.98
End time: 946.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Wow, that's pretty blatant  Yeah  But so you're making the point that Apple's running and by the way  Apple may back down at this point or delay it but by having announced that they can do it  They've already opened the door to this. Yeah, because in effect you said well we could do it and  And Russia or Saudi Arabia or China could use that as well. We know you can do it. So do it

Start time: 947.48
End time: 990.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It also makes you wonder what's actually behind the privacy messaging that Apple's been pushing at us for the last you know  Few years, you know  Is this actually a message based off of principles and values or is it a convenient marketing message to help position?  The iPhone against Facebook and the iPhone against Android  That's why I brought up consistency earlier if you're consistent with it. We can say okay, these are your values  But if you say privacy for this but not for that and that's what Apple stands for privacy  Then you have to start scratching your head and you say maybe this company isn't as you know  Devoted to privacy as a value as we once thought now, of course  Leo you mentioned that this is not something that anybody would you know want we wouldn't want these images out there at all

Start time: 991.54
End time: 997.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the question. Yeah, we have privacy and  Block child pornography at the same time

Start time: 997.36
End time: 1009.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can have you can have a full you can have full safety in a society and be under authoritarian rule  And it's always a balance of how much safety do you want and how authoritarian do you want to be exactly?  So this is unless it's not for gay

Start time: 1011.10
End time: 1053.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This debate this exact same debate is raging internally with Apple right now with their own employees  And they've had  significant issues with the Apple to movement  you know share Scarlett coming forward over the last couple weeks and  Talking about how look there can be privacy for some things and security for some things at Apple  In fact, she told me like we have privacy and security for our  Devices and our products but not our people or people are exposed if they speak out against Apple  And I think that this Alex consistency is the exact same at the core the exact same argument  That's happening with Apple right now with their own employees. That's an it's a point. Yeah

Start time: 1053.36
End time: 1106.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's a fascinating moment for Apple because  from my understanding they've  There have been departments inside the company that have deployed slack and  When you put these messaging apps inside a company all these things that you used to have in terms of culture  Whether it was top-down leadership or silos like Apple has had or the culture where you don't ask questions to  People above you which Apple has had that falls by the wayside  So I think we're entering an extremely fascinating moment for this company where we see whether it can maintain this siloed  Secretive culture one that doesn't empower employees to speak up unlike Facebook and Google or whether you know Apple  You know shuts down slack and says we're gonna keep doing things the way we've been doing and how that impacts employee morale  so the cat's been let out of the bag and I kind of think it's an exciting moment because  Their culture did need to be tested and I'm glad to see that we're we're starting

Start time: 1107.34
End time: 1149.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're probably referring to the fact that Apple which uses slack for internal messaging  Banned a slack channel that was talking about pay equity  Yeah saying it we don't allow personal conversations on our business slack. Meanwhile, there's a dogs channel and others  That they did not ban. So, you know, they not only did they so nothing they you they banned it they used a completely  Pathetic excuse for doing so Apple employees have slack channels to discuss hashtag fun dogs more than  25,000 members hashtag gaming 3000 members. There's a 2000 member dad jokes channel  But don't have a channel discussing pay equity

Start time: 1150.61
End time: 1208.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  in partial defense  Not around not around the pay equity issue, but around the whole issue of encryption and data collection  the entire  safety community that I'm very much part of  Deals with nuances. So for example as an ACLU member, I feel very very strongly about free speech  But I also feel very strongly about hate speech and about  misinformation of course in the ACLU is famous for defending the Skokie Illinois Nazis  Exactly, but these are competing in other words  There are competing rights or competing issues that aside from any commercial questions aside from the fact whether these are greedy corporations  Trying to extract every possible penny  These companies and I can't speak so much for Apple because they're not one of our partners  But certainly Facebook Twitter Google companies we do work with Microsoft  They do struggle with these questions of how do we balance these competing rights?  You know right of safety differences each etc as Alex has pointed out

Start time: 1208.12
End time: 1249.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't have big advertisements saying what's what happens in your iPhone stays on your iPhone  I'm not going that's true to Apple's kind of walked into this buzz saw and  So we ask you Larry is is is it compatible?  privacy of your device and  Protecting his child sexual abuse material are those I understand you're saying it's nuanced you have to weigh them  But they seem like they're at direct odds. I mean what I do on my phone is  Private it's my personal phone and people are being this is the prop part of the problem is this is a new device  It's a new concept that I would store  Such personal stuff on a device. It's always connected to the internet has a microphone a camera and a GPS is

Start time: 1251.14
End time: 1286.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right there this kind of paradox they are in conflict, but it's not as if that law enforcement has no resources at all  I mean, there's metadata for example, which can be used. I mean, it's not unlike the whole wiretapping rules  I mean, you know how you what you can access and what you can't and law enforcement  I'm sure if they could would love to have a complete access to every device in the world  They don't but they still have tools that they can use to bust bad guys  It's just gonna you know, it's gonna be harder for them not because we want to make the job their job harder  But because we want to as much as possible protect the rights of citizens balance privacy

Start time: 1286.46
End time: 1372.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is what the Constitution is all about balance  Privacy because the founding the founders were concerned about the King of England going to their home and looking for stuff  that's why there's a Fourth Amendment and they and the balance this need for law enforcement versus this need and and  Constitutional right not just need but a right to privacy of in your personal effects  Yeah, and I guess the courts can weigh in on this that's certainly, you know part of their job. I don't know  I  Don't know where I stand in this no one's supporting CSAM  No one's supporting these these horrible people in there in what they do and and by the way  Apple didn't roll it out. They pre-announced it  So you might argue as John Gruber on daring fireball has is this is exactly what Apple's intent was to start this conversation  So it may not be that Apple was acting irresponsibly that they were saying well, we want to do this  What do you think and they heard and admittedly?  Late afternoon on Friday and a long weekend. Maybe is not the most newsworthy time to announce  an embarrassing  Backing down, but they did back down now. We'll see what happens in the long run  They also and Larry I gotta ask you this they also told us how if you're a child pornographer  You can avoid it just turn off iCloud photos and and it doesn't it doesn't happen

Start time: 1373.58
End time: 1393.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and you can find another way to share the data like through an encrypted service  so it's not as if and that's that's interesting you point that out because  This material will exist with or without what Apple is planning on doing  And yeah, unfortunately these guys will go to any lengths to get this to share this kind of material. So  So what's the point of even trying to enforce this?

Start time: 1395.00
End time: 1442.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I would I don't know maybe child pornographers are particularly stupid people but it's not gonna  They're not I mean I have to admit  I've told this story before but when Patrick Norton and I were talking to the Secret Service about forensics and so forth  One of the guys said, you know, the truth is most crooks are stupid and we'll even just hand you the password  So you don't you know most cases  It's easy to catch these guys. I don't know if that's true now, but  Apple it sounds like to be honest Apple was doing this for PR  Because there is a way to turn it off and somebody who's actually doing this by pre announcing it  They're saying hey, you know if you want to keep doing it turn off iCloud photo  So it's gonna have zero impact in enforcement it's a public relations move

Start time: 1446.04
End time: 1474.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Proclamations on privacy over the past few years and the only real problem is it's a it's a PR move in  Contradiction to what they've been saying up to now in both cases. It's PR. It's marketing  Your iCloud was never private by the way  In fact, that's what they told the the San Bernardino the FBI in the San Bernardino case. They said had you  Brought the phone back to his house  It probably would have connected to iCloud and synced up and we would have been glad to hand that data over

Start time: 1476.38
End time: 1482.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Or they would have been forced to even if they didn't do it voluntarily. Maybe they're not glad I can't I can't  It could be subpoenaed clearly their feelings about it

Start time: 1483.18
End time: 1487.18

Transcript:  But we know that they hand hand over often hand over data for cloud

Start time: 1487.88
End time: 1497.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sure, because they have to think and that's the thing and the problem is if it's encrypted on its way to the cloud  You know, it may be impenetrable and that's the problem for law enforcement

Start time: 1498.18
End time: 1523.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is I think that I honestly think that Apple and they haven't said this  Wanted to turn on end-to-end encryption for the cloud  They had to mention this before and apparently according to some sources were talked out of it by the FBI  But I think Apple would and maybe the plan was for Apple to turn that on and say but look  We're giving the law enforcement a way to scan this before it gets to the cloud and that's all we're gonna give them  So maybe this was all about your phone protecting privacy

Start time: 1523.80
End time: 1528.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_07

Start time: 1528.44
End time: 1540.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why that that's why the FBI San Bernardino case was such a big deal Apple said under no circumstances  Are we gonna allow even law enforcement to unlock that phone? That phone is sacrosanct. It's encrypted

Transcript:  Reasonable that we brought up Facebook as the other company that we're comparing Apple to and it comes to detecting these images  I'll tell you why  Apple and Facebook are competitors in ways that people don't speak about enough  We talk about Apple and Android  but the truth is that Facebook has the set of messaging apps that will allow people to unhook themselves from the Apple ecosystem and  Move to Android and in fact, they're probably gonna prevent a lot of  iPhone penetration in countries where whatsapp is strong because what you know, you use your phone message for messaging primarily  it's the most important thing you do on your phone and so  Apple sees Facebook as this ultimate competitor  And that's why you've seen all these ads about what happens on your iPhone stays in your iPhones because the company is positioning itself  Against Facebook because it doesn't want you using those messaging apps  So you stay on iMessage you stay on iPhones and you keep upgrading you buy your next Mac and you buy your next iPhone  And the list goes on and so yeah, I mean I think that when it comes to PR  That's why privacy has been the moment I've been hinting at it at this point, but I might as well say it explicitly  I think that's why privacy has been at the core of Apple's  Marketing efforts Facebook number one and then of course, you know positioning itself against Android number two to make itself a luxury product  And so at the end of the day Leo, I think what you're pointing on is extremely salient  And and sort of core to the whole deal with Apple at this point  Which is that the company is going to scare you about the other?  the other  Companies privacy in order to keep you inside its ecosystem  in order to keep Facebook weak and under the gaze of regulators and third parties while Apple sits out and says okay, I'm doing good and  And to reduce Facebook to an app that sits on the iPhone correct exactly

Transcript:  Yes, everybody together privacy. And so I think what we've seen here is exactly the case  It's Apple all of a sudden and that's again it comes to consistency  Apple tried to make this PR move showed that it was inconsistent that it didn't really care as much about the privacy as it might  Actually be be saying and it was all about the public relations and the marketing impact  You know Steve Jobs back in the day said said marketing is all about who you are and what you stand for  Right, and so that's what they're trying to say. They stand for privacy  But when you start to peel back the layers a little bit  You don't you see that this isn't exactly the big angel that it makes itself out to be and that's I think what's being exposed  In this moment, that's the real bottom line of all this

Transcript:  Let me read you two quotes from an Apple employee and this you know going back to the point of this is a  Critical juncture for this company. I mean first of all, they're never going to invite me to anything ever again  Any of us join the club?  Right exactly  I mean look when I was at CNET I couldn't report on Apple for obvious reasons  But now that I'm at a news company  Let's talk about some things that are happening there one is that they never leak they never leaked at least in any usable way  Now they do their employees leak quite a bit  Let me read you these quotes two quotes that I think are pretty important  The culture of secrecy is great for protecting our products and for protecting our users  But if our own employees cannot speak out about sexual harassment or unequal pay then it works to the company's  Advantage and not yours you become a target you are unsafe  This is an Apple employee who said this let me read you another quote from her  non white non male employees at Apple are I'd a financial and decision-making  Disadvantage because these people are terrified of retribution. That's a direct quote from an Apple employee

It's difficult  So in our Apple coverage, we've kind of you know, no, no, no, I'm not saying to stop  I'm just saying why we haven't covered this more  But you have been and you've been digging is it is it your opinion that this is actually this is a widespread problem at Apple  This isn't just a few one.

I think the verge has done great reporting on it  Cher said after she came out with her initial reports that a thousand other Apple employees came forward to her  She put my phone number and I'm sure she's done this with many other journalists. It's not me  It's many people covering Apple and she put my phone number in a spreadsheet and it's now being shared with a number of people  At Apple and they I mean not my phone nervous my Google voice, but they call and leave voicemails  Yeah, this is widespread at Apple and I look I'm not

I think I would take a Samsung with Knox maybe  But I I still would feel better taking an iPhone. I don't think I would go to Russia with any kind of phone  but also it was creepy enough, but

So this question has become far more complicated  over time and  Largely the factor in my from from where I said is the Chinese government's  Relationship with Apple and Apple's relationship with the Chinese government and once you have those phones  I think it is just the phones in China  But once you have those phones sitting in those in those data servers then or the iCloud sitting in those servers  you know it all of a sudden moves to  Who is the Chinese government gonna want to help and it's not just China  It's China and its allies and you end up in a pretty complicated web  That doesn't make it, you know as simple as it might have once been to say  You know, if you want security go to the iPhone over the Android

Start time: 2117.32
End time: 2153.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's actually complicated because Google doesn't do business in China  So actually so there really is no phone you can buy in China that isn't invaded by the Chinese government. That's just a given  And so your opsec is gonna have to consider that and you obviously keep everything encrypted  Probably don't put anything online at all if I were if I were there. It's we're lucky. We're fat and happy  We could sit here and not worry so much about the security of our phone for it from for the average  American or Western?  consumer  The difference in iPhone and Android is not significant  But that's not the case and you're right. It depends on where you are

What VPN should I use?  And while there are some VPNs that work in China, I always tell them don't use a VPN  You're going to China. You are gonna be under the rules of the Chinese government  It would be rude to try to sneak around their rules  It would might also be dangerous probably not as a US tourist, but don't  You know just understand you're surveilled  used to be when you go to Russia, there'd be a  minder on the floor of every hotel and  That person is watching you're coming and going that just accept that  That that is part of  Where you are you don't try to get around it. That's just a red flag if you ask me  All right, let's take a break  There is a lot more to talk about well, I'm this is good  We're gonna do the big heavy news stuff because we've got a great panel for that Alex Cantor which is here big  Technology podcast and of course his newsletter big technology dot sub stack comm always day one his book  Absolutely a must-read  Thanks for being here. It's great to have you Larry maggot from the national  formerly of the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children now connect safely org with a similar message to protect kids online  And of and a regular in various venues you still do some stuff on CBS  Yeah, I'm still on CBS News twice a week. Yeah, absolutely  And speaking of CBS from CBS News our friend Dan Patterson technology reporter there  Long time all three of you long time friends of the network always great to have all three of you on  Our show today brought to you by Udacity. This is a great story. I love this story Udacity was created in 2011  Udacity was created in 2011. It's exactly 10 years old  Sebastian Thrun who was a Google engineer realized that they weren't the people that were applying for jobs at Google  Might have had the best degrees and the best pedigrees, but they didn't have the knowledge  Google needed he said we got to do a better job in getting people ready for jobs in big tech  He created Udacity and Udacity is famous for its nanodegrees originally with Google  But now nanodegrees are created for Udacity with companies like Microsoft and IBM and Amazon as well as Google  In fact the teachers you'll have at this  Incredible part-time online educational program are often team leads from these top companies because they know what needs to be done  This is a very practical education if you love learning and you're always looking to learn more tech stuff  Udacity is for you, even if you're not looking for a job in the field  Take a look at those cutting-edge nanodegree programs.

They've got a degree for that intro to self-driving cars machine learning engineer my personal choice  I'd want to be a robotic software engineer. I just love the idea  I've taken Python classes there. They're fantastic  The thing I really like best about Udacity is the courses are project-based hands-on  Learning it's not just going and watching videos  You're actually going to be tested  You're gonna be you're gonna have to use what you've learned to create a project all your homework and your project reviewed by qualified  professionals  The code reviews just like you would have if you were working at these big companies  Cutting-edge technology you'll get a real human feedback.

I don't know if this has been signed yet  It will almost certainly be signed into law. It's been passed by both houses of the south korean legislature  requiring apple and google  To allow third-party app payments. This is something apple and google have both fought vigorously in south korea  Trying to protect their 30 percent  Cut of all app payments and I believe I think it's fair to say this is the first domino  Because everybody's looking at this including the fdc and the united states doj and and and congress  um  There apple says you're going to destroy this platform. You just destroy our security  You can't do this google hasn't said I don't think honestly it changes much for google since they've always allowed side loading  Apple also says hey, it's fine. We'll just bill you  So if you if you are let's say fortnight epics fortnight and you decide to use stripe for in-app payments  Apple says that's fine. We're still going to bill you 30 percent  I don't know how that's going to work. I don't know what's going to happen in korea. So what's that?

Transcript:  30 yeah, you pay 30 so you can sell so you can put it on the app store, but yeah, I guess  This isn't side loading, but I guess you're you make a point  You know we have this drives me nuts. We have a vicious debate going on on mac break weekly because alex lindsey says look  You're getting i've sold software. This is the this is a huge improvement over the old system where you'd have to print up  Disks and put them in a box with a manual and put it get it on the store shelves and they'd still take 50  percent or more  Uh to to do it. This is a huge improvement apple's apple's hosts it  They market it for you a little bit. They they make it possible and they only take a mere 30  it does feel if your netflix or amazon selling books or  it does seem like rent seeking a little bit because  After all netflix doesn't need apple's platform to get people to subscribe to netflix  That's a good question if netflix used a third party  They use stripe or some other third party or paypal some third party's payment system  Apple be giving them no benefit really, you know  And why should you if really the main reason you want to watch netflix is at home on your big screen tv  But you're buying it on apple's platform netflix loses 30 percent  It actually costs us in some ways because many many companies if not all if not most  Will add that 30 to the cost you'll see the differential sometimes  If you buy on a website, it's 30 less than if you buy it on iphone. If I remember years the argument epic used right?  It's costing consumers

Transcript:  Am I remembering that right? You never could have side loaded  But what amazon did if you had a jailbird if you had the kindle app  And you wanted a book you would have to exit. Oh, you had to buy it somewhere else launch safari buy it through safari  Then it would be available in your app and that thing's so I think that's still the case for kindle not for audible  uh  Amazon has made some deal with apple. That's another argument by the way that I mean there's the consistency thing again, right?

Start time: 2738.02
End time: 2789.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What we're talking about in these these  Applications of the fees. I mean we can debate about the amount of fee which is a different argument  But it is this consistency and leo you're exactly right apple did make deals with some companies and to larry's point this  they were pretty  uh  Nuclear with amazon like no go no go until they quietly made some changes in audible now  You can't purchase things in audible, but you can't apply your credits right audible and they're  Sneaking things coming into the amazon app too. So really it's it's although we could be frustrated at the policies  I'm more frustrated at the inconsistency of the policies. I'm the same frustrated at facebook twitter and all other big tech companies. I'm sure  I'm not the only one here. I think there's a guy who has an application has a podcast in a newsletter about big technology

No, I think you're making great points and I live in the same side of the street, man  That's right apple said this is all about um, this is all about security  So here's an idea  Why doesn't apple give iphone users one option to go through apple pay and use the app store payment system  And give like a verified check next to it so you can be comfortable. I think that's what they're gonna do security  That's exactly what they're gonna do and then make another one. Yeah  Yeah  And make another one and say okay if you want to take a risk and you're not going to pay as much go ahead  Go in there. I mean this is all about it should be at the end of the day about the customers all these companies  Talk ad nauseam about the customers, but it's really about their bottom line. They talk about users

It no longer stays  The checkbox no longer stays on the buy on third party stores. It only is for that one purchase  Apple says we could do that  But that's confusing to people  It's not a good experience and what we want is and by the way, there's  You got look they're not almost three trillion dollar company for nothing  They're they're for most users apple is the painless  Way to go

Look you can only get stuff from the app store  I mean, I think a desktop computing experience should be different  I by the way now use linux almost exclusively for that very reason  But there are plenty of people most normal people who want  Simple clean and alex lindsey is a perfect example  He says I try to buy everything in the app store because then when I have a new mac it automatically updates  I can buy it once and it runs on all my macs. It's just simpler. I guess

Transcript:  I think we would all buy tim cook's argument here if  It was just you paid that two thousand dollar premium and you got the app store and it was clean  But the complicating factor here is the fact that the apple does make that 30 percent  On each one of those purchases when you pay through them and tim cook has outlined the fact that apple's new strategy  Is not necessarily device sale, but it's software and services  Among which the app store fees are a tremendous part of that  So, you know, I I think that it sort of comes down to are we buying the company's marketing messaging?  Are we looking at the financial statements?  Are we looking what they tell analysts on the earnings calls and giving that more weight?

And end up consolidating all the value that they're creating within one company that's using this approach as you know  Something of a monopoly.

Transcript:  We are an equal opportunity offender. I just want to point out  Microsoft had a little problem with windows 11 this week. You know, the next version of windows 11 comes out  Now we know october 5th. So they're  Beta testing it actively with insiders and the insider preview build that came out this week had a little flaw  Recently microsoft writes windows insiders in both the dev and beta channels began reporting  That the start and taskbar were unresponsive  And settings in other areas of the os wouldn't load we quickly discovered an issue  With this is why you do bug testing. I gotta say with a server-side deployment apparently they turned on  an advertisement for microsoft teams  And because the server that was serving the ad it has to go out on the internet to get it was unresponsive  The whole system was freezing  But good news good news if you're an insider, there's a fix  Hit control alt delete choose to open the task manager go to more details to expand task manager go to file choose run new task type  cmd in the open field then paste the following  Into the registry reg delete hkcu software microsoft windows current version iris service  F ampersand ampersand shut down dash r dash t dot zero bingo.

The reason microsoft is doing windows 11  Is because pc sales have started to tail off  And traditionally in the windows world people get a new copy of windows when they buy a new pc  So really what microsoft's doing is supporting the pc industry by creating a whole bunch of new pc's this fall  That run windows 11 hoping consumers will say oh I gotta have the new version  In fact, it's one of the reasons they've made it hard to upgrade to windows 11

Transcript:  I just wanted to show tim cook. I'm paying out 30. We skewer everybody  It's all the same. Actually, I want to talk about locast when we come back. I'm gonna take a little break right now  it is said  that  If if you're paying for something you're the customer, but if you're getting it for free you're the product  um  In in the case of television channels, you're both the customer and the product good news  Uh, we've got the worst of both worlds. We're talking about that in just a little bit with our great  panel  you said when you're  When you are protecting yourself in a country where it is not safe to be a dissident you never touch the internet without a vpn  I agree with you dan  If you want to preserve your privacy in the us, you might also want to use  a vpn  And if you're going to use a vpn you want to consider which vpn very carefully because all of the privacy and security issues are just  Passed down to that vpn server. That's why I use express vpn and recommend it express vpn  Protects your privacy if they they actually go the extra mile with this trusted server technology  They invented and have deployed on all their servers when you open and by the way, it's really nice express vpn  They have an app for every platform including smart tvs when you press the button  It chooses the server closest to you. And at that point what happens is cool. It spins up in ram only  A copy of the trusted server. That's what you're using on their servers. It's in ram. It's sandbox  So it cannot write to the hard drive it only operates in ram and as soon as you close that server  It's gone as is every trace of your visit. You are completely  private  so privacy  security absolutely  Every time you connect to an unencrypted network, whether it's at a starbucks or a hotel or an airport  Every person on the network can see you and if it's a bad guy  They can run tools that will allow them to do all sorts of stuff to mess with you. It doesn't take much expertise  Honestly a script kitty can do it  That's why you want to protect yourself  online for your privacy and for your security and oh by the way  When I when it chooses the server you can say I want to be in england instead of in the us  I don't want the closest server  I want a server in tokyo and you can use it to watch content that you can't get in the us  So lots of good reasons express vpn. It's kind of like you wouldn't drive without car insurance  Would you use the internet without?  The insurance of an encrypted tunnel between your device and the outside world. No  Express vpn strong encryption fire up the app one button click. Yes. It works everywhere including smart tvs  I think they're the probably most invasive  Technology ever in fact, you can now and that's what we do. We can put express vpn on your router  So everybody in the house is protected and express vpn  Again, this is why you want to choose a good vpn provider  They invest in infrastructure so that they're fast so that you can do that  You can you can make all your traffic going on in the internet to go through the vpn and still watch ht video  Still nobody will say oh what happened? It's all slow because express vpn invests in their infrastructure. I  Recommend and use express vpn. I think you should too secure your online data today with the only vpn. I trust express  vpn.com slash  Twit three extra months free when you go there right now express vpn.com slash twit get the one-year package  You'll get 15 months for the price of 12  exp res s spell it out another reason I like them they don't they leave the vowels in express vpn  Dot com slash tweet. We thank them so much for their support  We thank you for supporting us by as I always say using that url so they know  That you saw it  here  Locast has given up and uh, there are a lot. Do you guys know about locast?  Yeah, you've heard of it  Yeah, locast was actually  Kind of like ario remember ario. That was the new york city. Yeah start up that put  Dime sized antennas and a giant arrays and then let you  In effect use that antenna to get local live television stations. I was a paying subscriber were you?  Well, of course, absolutely. It was innovative. The first thing that happened was the networks and broadcast stations sued  To their credit ario fought it all the way up to the supreme court where they lost  Uh, I actually don't remember what the scoto why scotus said area was uh illegal  um

Transcript:  There's some there's some non-profit youtube youtuber uses  You're right. They're still protected. Isn't it? Well somehow they felt like if we don't make any money we're protected a judge ruled this week  Uh that well, that's not the problem. The problem is  Is  You are a non-profit, but you take the proceeds so the way locast worked. It's free locast.org  It would only work in the same adi  Area of dominant influence that of the stations you want to watch so i'm in the bay area. I get san francisco stations  Nobody from chicago could see those but people in chicago would see the chicago stations  And what aria was doing was take and then they put a little announcement saying aria is non-profit  But support us for five bucks and we won't bother you with these ads asking you to support us  And they did it quite frequently every few minutes  Uh, and and I know a lot of people a lot of cord cutters who said this is great five bucks a month  60 bucks a year. I get the live locals. It lets me  Cord cut because I don't need the cable anymore. I could just get internet and watch netflix amazon prime  But I get my live locals so I can watch football the academy awards that kind of stuff local news local news  Uh, that's a big thing. That's the gap with cord cutting  Is that live local stuff if you're not close enough if you don't have an antenna or you're not close enough to get  via an antenna the tv stations

Transcript:  Here's what I understand look  Anybody can sell an antenna, right? You can go out and buy an antenna. They're perfectly legal  How is locust really any different than an antenna if it essentially gives you the same content that the antenna would?

Start time: 4012.36
End time: 4184.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's the argument a lot of cord cutters use like  but here's  Here's why ario got shut down and why locust got shut down as well  So the again they got sued by the broadcast stations  Uh, and the judge ruled look because okay, it's good. You're non-profit good start except  You're taking the proceeds and using it to expand in new markets. That's not allowed  Locust could of course appeal and they could even do what ario did and go all the way to the supreme court and said they said  Oh screw it and they have stopped operating  So they were they were really I think they they were designed to get around this thing, but the judge said  No, so here's  Here's the argument  I think  And this goes back to are you a customer?  Or are you a product?  If you're listening to twit for instance right now, you could be one of the you could either be both  If you're listening and you're hearing the ads  Then in effect you're the product we sell we make money by selling your ears to the advertisers  That's how we survive  And that's how broadcast television broadcast radio survive  If you decide you want to join club twit pay seven bucks a month. We say fine. Now you can be the customer you pay us  We don't need to put ads in  So we give you the choice  broadcast television  Discovered that they could do both and that's what happened  When the this goes back to the cable companies and retransmission agreements and the must-carry rules initially  Cable companies were created so that you could watch the locals right? I live in petaluma. I'm too far from san francisco to use an antenna  Comcast comes along put up a big antenna  They can get the channels digs a ditch to my house puts copper into my house and says here now you can watch from our antenna  pay us  Broadcast station said whoa, wait a minute  FCC jumps in and says all right, you've got a choice broadcasters. You can either require that they carry you  And then you can't charge them  Or and most broadcasters chose the second choice  You can say  We want retransmission fees  Comcast you can broadcast channel four  But you've got to give us a fee buck or less usually per subscriber that those fees vary  Um  And so most stations now are double dipping they get the ad revenue  In fact, they love it because i'm seeing the ads here in petaluma, too  But they also get the revenue from the cable companies. You're both a product and the customer  The problem with ario and the problem in my opinion with low cast is you're cutting off  You're cutting off all these lucrative cable fees people no longer need to watch on cable  And I think that was why they ultimately sued

Well, we have cbsn which is 24 hours a day streaming news  It's hard news. There's no opinions and we are launching these in different markets like denver  You know new york, san francisco  And exactly to your point leo, this is not a for-pay product. This is a local news product  But it is the traditional model where the  The viewer is the product being sold to advertisers, which I think most of us are familiar with and fairly comfortable with and I  I don't I don't work on the business side. I can't speak for our strategic plans  But I know when this was rolled out it was this was considered a benefit that we're not charging our customers and we're not double dipping here  Or we're not charging the viewers

I'm like in the heart of new york  So I had no problem with it and I installed it in particular so I could watch cbs. Thanks guys  um watched on sundays watch football for free so  um  I think that like it's kind of interesting that I am able to do that just because i'm in service area  But if you're outside of service area like, you know, leo might be and you can't use locast  You know because you might be costing these these companies some money.

I mean  That's my point I frankly still don't see the difference between your rabbit ears and  And a locust subscription in terms of what it accomplishes. I agree 100

Start time: 4328.04
End time: 4471.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I agree 100 and I think you know the folks at locast argue. It's just greed on the part of the networks  the broadcast stations  Um, they say they get a free license from the u.s government to right to use those airwaves  But the retransmission consent fees  Which are on the order of at least 12 dollars a month according to new york times  Um at billions of dollars for broadcasters  The founder and ceo david good friend of locast says locast was always meant to be a public service  For people who want to watch their local broadcast tv stations  Can't get them over the air can't afford expensive cable satellite or streaming services  Locast showed that millions of americans fit that category that he serves something better than the status  Quo locast says 3.2 million people sign up for the services. Not know how many paid for it, but they  Did generate 4.3 million dollars in revenue last year  Um, that's not nothing not well and that's  Still all legal by the way nonprofits generate revenue all the time  the judge  Louis l stanton of the southern district of new york  Said that the issue is locast was using the proceeds to expand its service to other cities  A move that in his view ran afoul of the law the copyright code  This is weird, but the copyright code allows non-profits to solicit funds to defray the actual  And reasonable costs of maintaining and operating the service  But the judge felt that expanding violated that  Um the networks called the ruling a victory for copyright law  Vindicating our claim that locast is illegally infringing copyrights and broadcast television content in violation of federal law. It's a very narrow  It does not vindicate copyright law. It's a very narrow slice there  And I think they would like to put  locast out of business  I think there are a lot of locast users who are pretty unhappy and there is no reasonable alternative for a while  You could watch locals on sling for five bucks a month and I was telling people to use that but it turns out sling was  using locast  so  Never mind  Um, I don't know. What do you think? Uh, who's right in this one?  I'll let you recuse yourself network guys if you want to

I I really just think why make it the the victim here is the consumer  Agreed if it is comcast a victim maybe but comcast is a victim  The handwriting is on the wall and of course comcast and their ilk are making a fortune in internet charges  I have the full comcast double play right i've got tv and i've got internet  It turns out that the internet is the vast majority of what my monthly payments are  So even if I stop paying that little cable bump that that they get they would still be getting  You know over a hundred dollars a month for me for my high-speed internet  So I just think that you know enough is enough and to make it harder  For people to get stuff that they could get if they had a big enough antenna leo.

I know but but some people might not know that  Yes, but I I mean look when I was in  Uh an aria or an arrow subscriber I kind of I I felt like at least what was sold to me was that this is a physical  Array, this is an actual transmitter and you are renting time on it or you're paying for that physical time  And I look I lived in brooklyn. I live in brooklyn. I've lived in new york for a long time and sometimes you just cannot get  A transmission signal in the middle of building so it felt like  Okay, i'm not ripping anyone off and at the time I worked for a different news network  It did not feel as though  Uh, and I think I I think the same about locast but I I don't I don't know the fundamentals of their business model

Transcript:  Here, I found it. I found it. This is in us code section 111 of the copyright  Code it's specifically tossed about  retransmission of broadcasts  secondary retransmissions  Are exempt from copyright if it's not made by a cable system  It consists entirely of the relaying. Oh, this is why they did it by the management of a hotel apartment house  That's why they did it so that you could have an antenna  For a hotel and all watch that or similar establishment of signals transmitted by a broadcast station licensed  By the fcc within the local service area of such station  And as long as you don't make money at it  So this is an exemption that was carved out I think probably not for companies like locast and ario but  but for others  As is it's not actionable if the primary transmission is made by this carriage's signal  So the key is you can't make money at it, but the hotel is making money.

Because it will require people you know, you're not going to really get a lot of people signing up to locast if they can use the antenna  Like someone were in a location like me  You're also not going to get a lot of people signing up to locast if they have a cable subscription  Someone like leo.

So they had I wouldn't be surprised if uh, you know  They're nudging them. Brian rogers called up and said, you know, ryan roberts called up and said could you sue these guys?  Because leo  The only thing stopping leo from getting rid of my cable subscription is I want those locals and I can't get them any other way  If I have locast  And I add locast maybe to netflix and amazon prime all I need is an internet connection. I don't need the cable  TV, right?

Transcript:  Well, just like the bbc and iplayer they attempt to discover if you're using a vpn and block you  The the issue is that?  many vpns  You know are doing  Things to get around that like changing ip addresses regularly using, you know, clean pool and stuff like that  So I think it's not easy to know if you're coming in on a vpn, but they try and I bet you  If locast did a good faith effort, which I think they do to block vpn traffic that would be considered sufficient  You can't you can't block everyone but uh, in theory you're only watching if you're in local  So it's uh  This is an example of uh, you know, i'm i'm on the side of users and enthusiasts  So i'm saying damn you  But at the same time I kind of understand  That this is really a game that locast is playing that they looked at aria and said how can we get around that?  And they're making money on it. I'm sure they're making money on it. I mean they're a non-profit but  You know, they pay their staff actually on reddit. There was up outrage because good friend makes  180,000 a year  To which people said are you kidding? Do you know how much the head of the red cross makes this is nothing this guy's not  Million dollars probably not raking it in that's actually quite reasonable for the head of a non-profit  Uh, well, I don't know I you know, so on the one hand I know all of our listeners, uh,  A lot of them use locast i've recommended locast over the years. It does seem like it's just  I don't know really what's happening is we're in a transitional period where  Broadcast is going to be replaced by streaming right ultimately, isn't it? That's why we have cbsn. Yeah  Cbs isn't dumb. They know that's the future and they maybe it's a loss leader right now

Transcript:  But ultimately they need to understand this business why the cable companies have internet access  You know, I don't know if there's any major cable company that doesn't isn't the internet provider in their market or one of the internet  Providers in the market. So  You know, it is a transition. You're absolutely right. And I don't think any of these companies are going to go out of business  I mean cbs makes money or should make money because they've got great content  I mean, that's the reason why there ads on cbs on the cbs streaming cbsn.

Transcript:  You know, i've never tried. I mean if i'm watching a segment it's uh on on the website or on youtube  It's youtube ads and if i'm on the website like I can't skip the ads, you know  I have and I have ad blockers running like crazy on some browsers and I can't skip the ads. Yeah, which is fair  You know, it's you know, what's that?  No, that's completely fair right great. It does feel fair and that's I mean that's what like it really does again  I'm really sorry. I'm not trying to log roll for cbs, but it really does feel like a fair proposition  Here's the challenge we give you news we put ads in it and that's it you can watch or not watch right?

Start time: 5039.32
End time: 5085.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the challenge nothing. Nothing shady. Here's the challenge and this is the same challenge radio stations face. There's several  first of all broadcasting  As a different business model when you're broadcasting a million people could watch it doesn't cost you any more than one person watching  When you're streaming  It's more it's completely the opposite it flips it right every single person who watches costs you not a lot  But costs you some money those costs are going down. The other problem is  Now you have to sell advertisers  So when i'm a local station i'm selling ads for the local businesses  Does cbs can only sell national ads or are they doing some sort of  IP address geo location stuff do they have different ads do you know you probably i'm again i'm not on the business side

Start time: 5085.20
End time: 5106.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I do know that our ads on cbsn are national i'm sure there's geo location stuff  But we are rolling out to local markets and I know that the editorial priority was that we believe in local news, right? And  The reason in those cases is local news. You're gonna get local ads  You'll probably get national ads too, but i'm sure you'll get if you're in denver. You'll get a local ad

Start time: 5106.74
End time: 5125.92

Transcript:  So I have to get little anchors that you know ads work. The only thing that gripes me at all  Is when you charge for something and you run ads. Yeah, I know  And exactly that's everybody. I mean that's what cable cnn does. I'm like, yeah  CNN runs ads and i'm paying a lot of money

Transcript:  Well, everybody does it and it you know, I have to pay for a higher tier of peacock and hulu so I don't get ads  um  But you know, so I like how we're doing it at twit you either get ads or you pay a seven bucks a month  And you don't get ads  There's you don't pay seven bucks a month and get ads that's double dipping but everybody double dips now  So I guess I can't complain but I

Start time: 5158.74
End time: 5164.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it bugs me give you isn't peacock free plus ads option. I am yes, so there's a free ad supportive version

Start time: 5165.04
End time: 5293.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a little bit pay a little bit more you still get ads  But you get more content  And then there's the peacock premium which I ended up buying because I don't want ads and I want all the content  and that's probably their point is  We give them it's freemium, you know  We give it away, but you're going to end up wanting to pay for it same thing for paramount plus same thing for I kind of  Like that model actually  For the free you their choice, yeah, give me choice choice. The reason I like  Ad supported free is it's democratic. There's anybody who's got internet can watch us  I think that's the right way to be I think you want to be everywhere you can be  And I don't think you want to have people to have to pay but I understand some people don't want to be tracked all ads  In some way are going to end up tracking you  Because advertisers demand it now and people don't want to see ads. So fine seven bucks a month  That if that doesn't exactly I I don't know what the exact replacement would be I don't know how much we make per  advertising listener  Uh, it's probably more than seven bucks a month, but but it's enough so that we can say okay no ads  I guess the ideal way would be for us to figure out how much per  Per listener we get and then make that be the fee to get rid of the ads, but I don't think we're that sophisticated  Hulu apparently thinks it's 11 bucks a month  I  Think I'm more stuff  They have below deck wouldn't you rather watch below deck than listen to twit I think so  Club twit going Leo pretty good. Uh, yeah, you know, I didn't we didn't know what the expectations would be  Um, you know lisa our my wife our ceo and our the only person understands business in this  this company, um  Was hoping that we could get a 10 percent  Uh subscribe rate, which would be phenomenal  Uh, that'd be that would absolutely be enough to just eliminate advertising  I was a little less sanguine because we'd already tried this the very beginning of twit  You know in the pbs world with constant pledge drives and everything. I think they get five or six percent  So I was hoping that we would maybe get 10 percent of our audience

Uh the and I said to them I said, you know, what's going to happen is that eventually you're going to be able to listen to  Streaming radio in the car on the iphone or the android and of course that came about I can't remember exactly what year they came about  But it's taking but we you're still at the point if you want to listen to local traffic and you're driving  You know through silicon valley, you're probably going to turn kcbs on on your fm radio  But you don't have to there are alternatives and and that's where I think broadcast is  Eventually going to have to change their business model. Is it traffic? Is that the only thing keeping?  weather and  Listening to me, maybe I don't know. I think you can get weather

Transcript:  My clear started in radio and I remember my boss  I think this is still true and it's the problem that you're describing that radio still solves and he was my boss told me  um  That look we have a our our value proposition is one button  You turn your car on and we are playing right and when you're driving  Although we have all of this technology which will provide us with news and music and weather and all this information  Even with my phone, I mean that's a ridiculous proposition use my phone while i'm driving  What I can do with the radio is punch a button and change the transmitter now or change the station

Start time: 5573.88
End time: 5596.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Transcript:  I think i'm missing the key here though  I think that the station manager got something wrong power to them, but it's not about convenience to listen to local radio  It's the fact that local radio brings you together with the people that you're living around  And you feel like you're part of it's alive it's live better than yourself  And I know those dj's those anchors exactly. I just moved back to new york, which is where I grew up from california  And I gotta say I get a thrill turning on these radio stations as opposed to playing from bluetooth  Because I remember that i'm part of this and I can you know when they read the weather  That's not just me checking my weather app  That's all of us together learning what it's going to be when they tell us traffic  That's all of us sitting on those roads learning what it's going to be I think that's  That was station and algorithms have pushed us into silos  Exactly and when I hear the sports guys talking about like how the jets or the mets or the nicks are doing  I'm like dang these people are connecting me with thousands of other people who feel the same way  I think are tuning on now and it's one of the few shared experiences.

Transcript:  I don't think live is the issue except for sports and in certain breaking news  I think it's I think it's something else. I think it's the fact that we have such a  Balkanization of providers. That's the problem and again and again i'm not bemoaning that because it's also the benefit  We wouldn't have a twit or or you know  The big tech podcast if it weren't for the fact that anybody can get into this business without investing billions of dollars in transmitters  So that's the good part the bad part is I only invested millions of dollars. So  But you didn't need to invest millions simply to get on the air  You could have done that. What's funny is when I started in 2005

They're different  Spotify might own both of them. In fact, probably that's why spotify owns both of them because there's an impermeable barrier between them

Transcript:  One of the most famous  Cambridge analytical whistleblower and all of them said I asked them are there good things that come from this they all said  Look community can come from this kind of like what alex and and larry and you were describing  But they said the harm greatly outweighs it because we're actually not creating communities  We're creating silos and they don't talk to each other when those silos only talk to each other they create  Challenges some of those are not so bad. Some of those are really bad  When you have information ghettos and silos, it's not a good thing what you guys are describing are communities  Broadcasting many people with shared values what social media algorithms do is the opposite of this at least that was their argument

Transcript:  So I i'm a member of the next door, you know nextdoor.com and in palo alto  And we're having a vibrant debate over this recall  You know this attempt to recall governor newson and replace him with larry elder a right-wing talk show host  And i've been very vocal because I really think the recall is horrible  But um, but the point is that there's actually is a conversation going on  Between a handful of people who really are pro recall and a group people who are anti-recall and it's it's refreshing  And I don't get that on facebook because facebook everybody I know agrees with me  They're all they're all like-minded people and it's kind of boring. Is it uh, boy  Is it a shouting match on nextdoor? Uh, yeah, it's a shouting match, but respectful. I mean, these are really interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's what I was about to say. That's the problem is no  They're talking at each other if you are a pro recall guy  You are convinced that gavin newson is a devil incarnate, right? And if you're an anti  Pre-recall person you're worried about a republican takeover, you know based on 10% of the vote right after they recall the guy  So so no, there's that's the problem. There's still no movement

Yeah, probably more  Also with us, it's great to have alex kantrowitz  Big technology dot substack.com. And of course the podcast is there as well. Is he a ridgeback somebody says, uh, mr  Bean thinks that the that uh, that the good boy is a not you alex. You're not a rodigian  I was about to say this is a pure mutt. He's a mutt. I like the mutts. He's a good boy though  you know if you have a dog  or you have  wildfires  or as in petaluma you have a  Season where people are fertilizing you might wish you had a molecule  We got a molecule I have to say and uh, we we know when it's not working  We have to remember sometimes people turn it off or whatever and lisa will wake up and say the molecule was off last night  Wasn't I said yes it was she's not got a headache  Molecule that was the first one we got we liked it so much. We got one for michael's bedroom. Now we have one in the studio  Molecules reimagining the future of clear air starting with the air  Purifier now the thing to understand about the molecule thing a lot of people don't understand  It's it's not a filter. It's not something trapping particles  Uh for later disposal molecules core technology is it's called pico p e c o  It's short for photo electrochemical oxidation. It actually destroys  tiny harmful pollutants  Things like things that no filter will capture like volatile organic compounds paint thinner in the air formaldehyde  Viruses yes bacteria. Yes mold. Yes  Molecule air purifiers help protect homes businesses even medical spaces  In fact, I should mention the molecule air pro rx uses the same technology  Got fda approval 510k class 2 medical device  to just specifically for  Medical offices to destroy bacteria and viruses in the air. It really  Works. In fact, if you go to the molecule website, you can see research papers  from  Government research labs doe labs like the laurence berkeley lab where they tested the molecule and found it actually eliminated  Formaldehyde from the air  One of the things molecule does is great some air purifiers put ozone into the air molecule also reduces ozone another harmful  Compound in the air and by the way, yes  Molecules pico technology meets the performance requirements and the fda guidance for use in helping to reduce the risk  Of exposure to sars-cov-2 the covet 19 virus in healthcare settings now  I'm not saying you shouldn't wash your hands and practice social distancing and wear masks  But it is that's one of the reasons we're really glad to have molecules in the studio  It's an extra layer of virus protection for your spaces  I am very impressed  Dirty indoor air is actually worse  Than outside air and a lot of offices. You can't open the windows. You can't open the windows here. It's a sealed office  That means the air in here is not great. That's why you need  to get a molecule the molecule air mini  Designed for smaller rooms up to 250 square feet your bedroom would be perfect the larger molecule air  For larger rooms up to 600 square feet. We've got the molecule air pro. That's for a thousand square feet. I'm looking at it right now  One actually one of the reasons we had to have it is after the wildfires a couple of years ago  It made it impossible to be inside because of all the smoke  took care of that  They also have a molecule air mini plus which helps protect small rooms with the particle sensor and auto protect mode  So the fan speed is adjusted depending on the quality of the air  We just love our molecules and I mean molecules i've invested quite a bit in molecules for limited time save up to  $120 on molecule air purifiers just go to m o l e  Kule.com molecule.com molecule with a k not a c  And use our promo code twit you'll get free shipping a 30-day at-home trial on your order  You know if you're at all, you know, is this going to work for me try that get the 30-day trial and see  The code twit will save you up to 120 on molecule air purifiers at molecule.com  If you don't if you if you're skeptical  Read the research. There's a lot of research papers on the website  So you can verify that I am speaking  The truth it really does work molecule. We love a molecule.com offer code  twit  Uh, we are probably something like a week away from a new iphone. It's unclear  Uh, typically apple will do it early in september. No one's saying  Best guess would be I think not this week  But on the 14th there was a wild rumor  That apple would add satellite features  To its phone that it would use low earth orbit satellites specifically from global star  to  Provide emergency services on the phone  Uh, this originally came from a an analyst. Let me pause that so we don't hear the video from uh, bloomberg  um bloomberg's  Mark german who's usually very well connected kind of tamped down the speculation  He said  The next iphone could have hardware needed for satellite communications  But he says even if they do the features are unlikely to be ready for before next year according to  A person who has to not be to identify because the plans are not yet public  Bloomberg also, this is bullet boilerplate now in all apple rumor stories  These features could also change or be scrapped before they're released and apple representative declined to comment  But mark had a lot of detailed information. I think this is probably a good thing  Emergency message via satellite. So if you are lost  Or injured and your outside satellite you could send a message  In your messages app using not sms the phone network or imes message using data  But using satellites  And you'd get a gray message bubble instead of green or blue. I like that  Uh, the second feature will be a tool to report major emergencies like plane crashes sinking ships also using  Satellite networks the texting via satellite tool is code named stuie  Inside apple and they will be short length  They'll push through to an emergency phones emergency contacts phone, even if the do not disturb setting is on  So, uh, I think this is a good thing. We'll see if it happens  An apple event if it happens will be  We'll certainly stream it  Uh, and uh, i'm gonna guess my best guess is september 14th, which is a week from tuesday  Anybody want to say anything about that  Like this idea, I think it's a great idea, right? I think that if we had this idea

Yeah, there are uh, there are two different kinds of um,  this kind of emergency stuff rei had a  Good article the um, they're the bank the camping supply  Trackers  And uh, then then messengers emergency messengers spot watches. I think a good thing to have and certainly these are small  There's no reason you couldn't have that technology in a in an iphone or even an apple watch. So  I will hope that uh, hope that is the case  Um, I guess that wasn't a good conversation starter. So let me find another one. How about texas?  Abortion no, we're not going to talk about abortion  But there is a tech angle to this which is that this law which  Uh again, it's kind of gamifying. Uh roe v wade would encourage  private people to snitch  On abortion providers or anybody who abets aids or abets an abortion and in order to do this  They set up websites  Uh to do a  Uh to do this which immediately stimulated, uh action from the tech sector silicon valley  Responded right away go daddy the initial website which was set up on go daddy  Was shut down within a day they moved  to uh, um  Digital ocean which I think has already shut it down mark benioff has cancelled all of salesforce's business in  Oh, no, i'm sorry.

I got so addicted to the thing  It's very time where there were like there were some nights where I like finished work and I was like  I just want to lay down in bed and be on tiktok and I would be on for a couple hours  And I said, you know, it's much like uh, like dan said i'm just just like i'm done with this  So I deleted that I deleted instagram and you know, I didn't I don't miss it.

Although there are things that I feel like I overuse but  I just you know, look at tiktok for a few minutes now and then and just kind of laugh and move on  And if anything, I probably use too much facebook  Because what happens is I get really i'm a very political person and  I get irritated by things that go on in the world and I want to complain a lot so I can vetch a lot on facebook  Um, but I guess I am willing to make those trade-offs the ones that some of you guys aren't going to make  Because I do derive value from them

Yeah  Whether they're left or right anything that's that's doing that it would be bad  On the other hand, I kind of have some sympathy for what china's doing to  Big tech, you know, they shut down dd. They shut down alibaba now the latest  This one i'm not sure I agree with but I kind of understand  they've told uh  teenagers  You can only play video games three hours a week friday saturday and sunday  8 pm to 9 pm and on national holidays  Three hours three days a week and they even say the specific time  God I you couldn't do that in the u.s.

Yeah  Well, this is the thing is darren's always sold a lot of hacking tools  On hack five's website, but boy  Apple did not respond to a motherboard's request for comment  the cables  include uh  these  Indistinguishable from apple's type a to lightning  Cables, there are also usb c to usb c cables  What I mean the thing that's important to understand is now you can put chipsets are so small without  Modifying the cable in any significant way you could put a radio in there  That streams out everything you're you're using and uh motherboard tested it in downtown oakland  They were able to trigger payloads. Oh, no, i'm sorry mg tested it and over a mile. You could be a mile away  And see what's going over those cables  So they've even added a geo-fenching feature where a user can trigger or block the device's payloads based on the physical location of the cable  So as long as it stays in the victim's house, it works. Otherwise, don't worry about it  Anyway, I just thought i'd let you know hack five.com if you want to buy one of those  And I guess the bottom line don't trust any cables unless you know where they came from  They came from  Uh, don't enjoy your labor day weekend if you're in it the u.s.
