Hello.  From channel dvorak.com.  Star of Cranky Geeks, No Agenda, and many other fine internet podcasts.  We do our best.  You used to be the world's most prolific computer columnist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now I have to do new media to make it work.  So sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is.  So speaking of new media, look who's here.  Sam Whitmore is here.  Haven't seen Sam in an age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello, Leo.  How are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sam and I worked at Tech TV, right?  Or no, it was ZD we worked at.  You were never at, were you at Tech TV?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No.  This was the site.  This was 1997.  God.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  MSNBC's the site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's right.  I have lots of reminiscences, but we won't fog the show down with them.  But I'm sure people would enjoy that.  Solidette, O'Brien, Devnol, all that stuff.  Oh my god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you were a ZD guy.  I remember very well, Sam, sitting in an airplane with Sam.  He said, I'm so bored with this tech stuff.  I'm going to go fly a plane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I no longer fly, but I did get an instrument rating.  I had 700 hours when I finally quit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You burned out, and I can understand.  I mean, this stuff, you have to be obsessive.  It's night and day and endless cycle.  And if you're not just crazy about it, I can see how easy to get burned out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I learned was I loved media.  Right.  And I still do.  And in fact, I had to go start my own business in order to build exactly where my passion was.  But I still love tech.  And you couldn't avoid tech today, even if you wanted to, Leo.  It's everywhere.  Especially in media.  Yeah, exactly.  In fact, I was interviewing the publisher, The Economist, on Friday.  And he was saying that he is a big fan of agile software development.  In fact, his previous job was at IBM doing social media.  So here's The Economist, probably the stodgiest title of all time.  And the guy that publishes it is this agile software development freak who is trying all  these new European rapid deployment app dev jobs.  It's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really quite amazing.  And I tell you, you couldn't have picked a better time to say I'm going to focus on media  because boy has this stuff exploded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  One super quick anecdote before we get going.  When I was doing on air for the site in 97, I didn't have an idea.  And I said, Leo, I've got to do it with sold at I've got to do a segment.  What should I do?  And you said, well, there's this audio format called MP3.  And I think it's going to be big.  And so what I did was a Pepsi challenge sort of thing.  I took a CD of B-52s and I said to Soledad, I'm going to play a 15 seconds of Love Shack.  I'm going to play another 15 seconds of Love Shack.  And you have to determine which one is the digital copy and which one is the original  CD.  And I took a chance that she couldn't tell.  And of course, on camera, she couldn't tell.  So it was perfect.  So I give you this public thank you, Leo, for that.  I invented that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm going to do it.  MP3s, that was my idea.  Now, I remember the way I found out about it was a kid, 15 year old kid named Glenn,  maybe 16, Glenn Rubenstein, who I had known for years.  He was one of those little kid bloggers who did a gaming blog who went to college.  And he told me, he said, Leo, everybody is doing they're taking their CDs, they're making  MP3s out of them.  They're putting them on central hard drives available on the college network.  And that's what we listen to for music nowadays.  And I thought, well, that's an interesting transformation of the business, isn't it?  And it was.  It was completely changed how music was performed and bought and sold.  Also here with us, thank you.  It's good to have you, Sam.  Thank you for joining us today.  We really appreciate it.  Also here with us today is Nicole Lee from CNET.  She does the Dialed In podcast for CNET.  She's their expert on cell phones.  It's good to see you, Nicole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She came up just for Valentine's Day with her hubby and I enlisted her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I brought you some Chinese New Year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's right.  Gong Hei Fat Choi.  Yeah.  Yeah, it's Chinese.  You're the tiger, Johnny.  You say it right.  Wait a minute.  How do you say it?  Gong Ho Fat Choi, says Johnny.  Gong Ho.  They did no agenda this morning.  Tell me why you butchered it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, because I believe we were working on the title for the show and I and Adam had  the right spelling, which is unpronounceable to me.  I said, no, everybody says Gong Ho Fat Choi.  And of course I changed it so it now reads Gong Ho Fat Choi.  Oh, yeah.  So it's almost an epithet.  Yeah, Gong Ho Fat Choi.  But for SEO love, just specifically for software engine optimization purposes.  It's the only reason you do things nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nowadays, it's all link bait to everybody.  Isn't that true?  So the big story of the week.  Apple, Mac World Expo, all the big announcements.  Huge.  What are you laughing at, Nicole?  There was one big announcement.  It took me half an hour, half an hour to see everything at Mac World Expo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That long?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, Apple leaves.  Last year was Apple's last year at Mac World Expo.  Did you go, John?  You were there.  I saw you there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You bumped into me.  I bumped into you there.  What did you think?  In fact, you gave me two shots of the ribs.  We almost broke a rib, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I elbowed you like I checked you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you were just roaming around the place like you owned the place.  And you gave me a rib shot because you were trying to move me aside.  Out of the way.  And then I said, hey, Theo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I thought you were just one of the little people.  So.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it was pretty small.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it wasn't that small.  It was hurt by, well, it was very small.  It was half the size of my own.  In comparison, yeah.  And I mean, the whole South Hall was closed off.  It was just in the North Hall.  That's where the Apple booth would have been.  But there were a lot of people, though.  There were a lot of people.  In fact, I talked to Paul Kent and he said attendance on the first day  was just a few hundred below the first day last year.  So that's good news.  However, I think part of it was in the shadow of the iPad  because you can't say anything because we don't know anything about it.  But that's clear.  I mean, Apple had nothing to talk about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There was a whole segment where they were doing a big speech in room 132.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mac World, Jason Snow and Mac World did a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it was like they just had a Styrofoam mock-up.  They don't even have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's nothing to talk about.  It's pathetic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Styrofoam iPad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, it was to the point where I had some people saying,  does Apple hate IDG?  Does Apple hate Mac World Expo?  Are they actually intelligent?  It was causing some millions and millions of dollars ago.  I don't think Apple cares about Mac World Expo.  I think they're a consumer company now.  They don't need the enthusiasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My point was that they've got an Expo 24-7 at all these stores.  The New York slice is essentially a Mac World Expo.  So I don't see the point of this.  And by the way, this will be the last one, I'm sure of it.  Because when they stopped going to the Boston show,  boom, Boston was dead after one extra show.  It took one extra show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think we did?  This is the last one.  I don't know.  I hope not.  The friend went to the Apple store in San Francisco just a few blocks away.  And there was no signage.  There was no welcome.  There was no nothing.  And there weren't a lot of people even from Mac World Expo.  The manager, the general manager of the store said, no,  we've seen zero bump in traffic this week.  Wow.  It's not.  But that doesn't mean it's bad for Apple, does it?  I mean, isn't Apple transcended this?  No, I think Apple's fine.  I don't think it's got anything to do with Apple.  They've transcended it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's bad for the show.  And some of these shows are dead anyway.  And if we're all going to get to H1N1 drop dead in the streets,  you don't want to be in crowds.  Is that what it is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sam, is it over for trade shows?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, it is.  Well, especially for Apple being so vertically integrated.  I mean, normally, a vendor would want application development  to be done for their platform.  That's why CA has its show, Oracle.  And also, they have big distribution networks,  these big vendor-specific shows.  But Apple is its own distribution.  It goes direct to customer.  It doesn't really have middlemen.  And also, it now controls app development directly.  So there's really no need.  It is a consumer company.  There's no need to cultivate relationships.  It's just not an ecosystem like it was under, what's his name  there, Emilio.  Gil Emilio.  Clones.  When he had clones, and they had three or four different kinds  of word processors, three or four different kinds  of spreadsheets.  It's all a closed shop now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple has a developers conference.  They can get people to WWDC in June.  It's the only conference Apple does.  I think my position is Apple's become a consumer electronics  just as you said, a consumer electronics company.  So the geeks who go to Macworld, the 30,000 of them,  are really the enthusiasts, the cult of Mac people.  And Apple no longer needs those people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The other thing is, what Mac was there?  I mean, this was about iPhones.  All iPhones, iPhones.  It has been for a long time the iPod iPhone accessory show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  For sure.  Last year.  There was a whole mini-

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Go ahead, Nicole.  I was going to say last year was MacBook Air.  Last year was MacBook Air.  That was the showcase.  But we've moved on from that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And because there was no Apple and no iPad there,  the vendors are kind of hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There was a whole little section called the tiny, tiny town,  the mobile app town.  And that was probably very busy, actually,  all the little mobile app applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The problem is you make so little, most of you  make so little money on an iPhone app  that you really can't justify a booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, I can't tell you how many people-  The flashlight guys were there.  Maybe they could all get together and do one booth.  We should have a fart booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just all the fart apps could have their own booth.  And maybe we could put that somewhere else, like outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A different country.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now, Leo, I saw you had a session at a Macworld.  You were doing some presentations, I think,  not maybe this year, but in years past.  Oh, we've done it in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've done many, many presentations.  This year I did one event, which was the Macworld Live.  It was really like a talk show.  We had Roger McGuinn of the Byrds, your friend John.  I was hoping you'd be there, actually.  I was there.  Oh, did you come by?  I wanted to introduce you.  Do the Ed Sullivan thing.  And our audience today!  And you'd stand up-  No, the place was packed.  I couldn't get in.  It actually was a sellout.  Roger McGuinn, Adam Savage of the Mythbusters,  Heather Gold, my friend who's a comic,  and the rock band Warp Eleven.  It was just like a talk show.  It was fun.  But it had nothing to do with Apple or Macs.  In fact, I wore a black tie  that had a tux the penguin at the bottom of it.  And I said, oh, I'm sorry, wardrobe malfunction.  And then I said, it could have been worse.  And I pulled out a t-shirt that said, I'm a PC.  That was my monologue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was your bit.  That was my bit.  No, there was another-  Now I'm glad you didn't get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, you didn't miss a whole lot.  I also, I said, I feel uncomfortable up here.  Wait a minute, something's missing.  And the Iatzi stagehands, because it's a union shop,  brought my little rubber ball that I sit on.  They brought that out.  That got a good laugh.  And then I rolled it down the thing and the guy took it.  And he can't, no, and cause I said, I was joking.  I said, I'll give it away.  And then he came up to me and said,  would you sign your ball?  He had deflated it.  He said, oh, oh, he didn't say, oh.  He thought he said something else.  I felt so bad.  I felt so bad.  I said, can I have it back?  Because I don't have another one.  And I kind of need it tomorrow.  And the guy, his face fell.  I felt so terrible.  He said, okay.  But I've DMed him on Twitter and I said,  as soon as I get another ball, I'm deflating this.  I'm gonna sign it and I'm gonna send it to you.  So just give me your address.  You can have this ball.  I just needed it for today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you took the guy's balls away.  No, he just won.  He only had one.  It was blue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh God.  You know, with the last ball burst, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Everyone saw that.  You were famous on the internet for about a week.  It was my meme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was a viral video.  I got to be a keyboard cat for a Brit.  It almost looked as though you hurt yourself.  No, but it could, you know, you could.  Cause when they burst, it's kind of scary.  I've had it happen twice.  It's like suddenly nothing's there.  It's like, you know, when somebody pulls the chair out,  you're literally just in the air and you're on the ground.  There's no like slow deflating.  It goes, boom, and you're on the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it just kind of went down for a little bit  for about one second.  It did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then it went.  And then it went, went, went.  So you know what we did?  In fact, we have them in the other room.  We cut the ball up into about a hundred pieces  and I could send anybody who wants a autographed piece  of my ball.  What are you guys laughing at?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hey, listen, I'll tell you, go to the chat room right now.  It's full of LOLs.  There must be about a hundred LOLs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all love the ball.  Yeah, they do.  It's the, I can't tell you how much mileage  I get out of that.  It's ridiculous.  All right, let's face it.  This big story of the week was not Mac World Expo.  It wasn't even close.  We're going to talk about, actually it was all Google  all week.  I mean, this was the week of Google.  And we're going to talk about some of those big stories  in just a bit, but let's take a little break here  and say hello to our friends from Citrix.  Hello, say hello to my little friend.  Go to meeting.  Folks, if you have ever had a conference called  drag on and on, kind of like this show,  and you just, you're playing Tetris,  you're playing solitaire, you can't,  you're losing the audience.

Before we talk about Google,  somebody in the friend feed room is saying,  and I think it's a good point,  that we should talk about Kevin Smith.  You know what happened with Kevin Smith?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What happened?  The fat guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The fat guy.  He refused a seat on a Southwest Airlines.  He doesn't look that fat to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because he was fat?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, so here's the weird thing.  Kevin Smith, who is the director,  of course he did Clerks and Silent Bob and Jay.  What was he doing in Oakland is the bigger question.  No, he came up for Macworld.  He gave a session at Macworld.  And I saw him at Macworld, and he's a big guy.  He's not like, dead?  I've seen bigger.  Oh yeah, on planes.  So he flew up on Southwest.  Done with his thing yesterday.  Wants to fly back on Southwest.  Gets on the plane.  And he tweeted the whole thing, by the way.  If you go to twitter.com slash.  Yeah, they're embarrassed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They gave him 100 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they gave him 100 bucks.  That, Kevin, I think they're gonna give him more than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, because he tweeted about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh my God, he did he Twitter about it.  So, I mean, I like 100 tweets about it.  He said, I just got thrown off the airplane  because the pilot said, I'm a hazard,  because I'm so fat.  But the plane wasn't even full.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the worst part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He had already put down the armrest,  so he wasn't overflowing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe the pilot just didn't like his movies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's what's, Kevin's point is,  look, I flew up, they didn't throw me off.  They threw me off this plane,  and I got on the next flight, Southwest, and went home.  So we don't know what really happened,  and it could be that he was acting badly in other ways.  It could be that they said, we don't know,  but we do know from the tweets.  The point is not so much whether  what they did was wrong or not,  but the point is that he tweeted.  Boy, did he tweet.  He should tweet.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now listen, as a former pilot,  there's this thing called weight and balance,  and you do want to balance the load.  So for example, if he was sitting in the front  where a lot of the luggage is located.  Maybe they could have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  737 for God's sake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be 100 pounds more than a normal person, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've had that.  I've gotten on a commuter jet where they said,  okay, we got to rebalance.  Yeah, they move you around.  Could you move back?  And they look at me and they go,  you, sir, could you sit in the way back?  So I'm used to this.  He's pretty heavy.  He said I did not need a seatbelt extension,  so he can't be that heavy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, he can be that big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They offered him $100 credit,  but I think really what it was,  I didn't realize he was that Kevin Smith.  And look at the power of Twitter.  In fact, ABC News called him and said,  we'd like to do a story on this.  He declined.  He said, you know what?  I've done it on my podcast.  He does a podcast called Smodcast.  And he said, I'm going to do a SWODcast  for Southwest tonight.  It will go up tonight, Sunday night.  And in fact, it should be up right about now.  And he said, that's all I have to say about it.  But boy, let me tell you,  Southwest is jumping around trying to make this guy happy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, they should be.  And by the way, anybody in the chat rooms,  the official Southwest blog is called Nuts About Southwest.  And that's a good place to express your concern  because they do invest a lot  in that resource Southwest does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it is interesting.  It just shows you how, by the way, it's down.  Nuts About Southwest, it's had so much server traffic.  I don't know if it's being DDoSed,  but it's been down all afternoon.  But they did do an apology, apparently,  on Nobody Can Tell, because I can't see it.  But apparently they did do an apology on the blog.  A nightmare.  It's a PR nightmare.  And I guess the point I'm making  is not that Kevin Smith was right or Southwest was wrong,  but the power of social media  to really cause a problem for a company.  He's got 1.6 million followers.  He's carrying a big stick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But in a way, couldn't that turn somebody

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  into a bully?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It could be a huge problem for companies because...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Imagine Callie Candace getting a hold of that many people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think he has almost that many people, doesn't he?  No, not that many.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not that many.  No, no way.  He was never listed as a,  oh, just sign up for this guy.  Oh, you have to be the SUL.  Suggest a USUL list.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, but I mean, it's very interesting  how much power that gives, that confers on somebody.  And if somebody wanted to be a bully,  and you could even blackmail companies,  you could say, hey, I want a better seat  or I'm gonna tweet it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you still need an injustice done to you.  And it also has to be an experience  that many people themselves have gone through.  Like, everybody flies so you can relate to that.  Like, how would you feel if you were kicked off the plane?  Here, take your bags and get the hell out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got an email from an airline pilot.  He's a 767, 757, and 727 pilot.  I'll just call him Captain Paul.  He said, I'm very disappointed in your encouraging tone  concerning the Kevin Smith Southwest Airlines  incident.  By law, the captain is responsible for the safety  of his or her passengers, crew, and airplane.  If he or she feels for a millisecond  that safety is compromised, he or she must take action.  Leo, it's the law.  My sources inside Southwest,  and this is maybe the story here,  tell me that Mr. Smith was acting irrationally  and was possibly impaired by alcohol,  which would explain why he was allowed  to take a later flight.  I wasn't there, so I won't speculate  that this was the primary reason he was asked to leave.  The bottom line is that this captain  was acting well within his authority to remove Mr. Smith.  The fact that Mr. Smith decided to out the captain's name  in his tweets, which he did, he mentioned the name, we won't,  further degrades the safety of not just his flight,  but all flights.  The captain was doing his job,  and now his name has been added to millions  via Twitter and the mainstream media,  and maybe he's gonna be,  and other captains will be a little less likely,  I'm adding this part, this editorial here,  to call people on safety violations,  especially if they have 1.6 million Twitter followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First, I should, when you check in,  they have to ask you how many Twitter followers you have.  If you're over a million, then they say,  okay, we get, put them in the front.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says, and I can't say I disagree,  the sad fact is our society places such a high value  on celebrities, which in turn gives them untold  wealth and power, as this incident illustrates,  when power is abused, as it clearly was in this case,  everybody loses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they should have waterboarded him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, but it does raise the issue of how much power,  and can a celebrity become a bully,  especially with this go directly to the audience,  but you make a good point, Sam,  there has to be something that resonates.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that was the element here  that people could relate to being humiliated.  It's humiliating enough to fly Southwest many times.  That's true.  That's the real story here, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the cattle car airline, I don't fly it anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I happen to like it, but I live in Oakland,  and it's a good hub for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a great airport to fly out of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it is, but there's no legroom in those planes,  and it's not hub and spoke, it's point to point,  so it's a bus line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It gives a whole new meaning to the phrase,  do you know who I am?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you know who I am?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People often say you could get better treatment,  Leo, with tech companies, if you would say that,  but I don't, I hate doing that.  Do you ever do that, John?  I'd know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, only people, I don't know.  It's embarrassing.  It's embarrassing.  And you'd rather let the situation get out of control  anyway, because it gives you something wrong about it.  My point exactly, I want them to mistreat me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Can't believe how these people.  Please mistreat me so I can tweet about it.  What idiots, unbelievable.  They're morons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you can't get any material if you push yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, the big story, really big story of the week,  and I apologize for pausing moments  with some other stories, but this is really a huge story.  Google on Thursday, without warning,  without any notice, did something that could really rock  the social media world they announced and released  at the same time, something called Google Buzz.  If you went to your Gmail account,  you may still want to go to your Gmail account  if you haven't seen it yet.  You'll get a big screen that says,  hey, we got something new called Buzz.  You want to participate?  And if you say yes, well, it's actually interesting.  Google's already changed what happens if you say yes.  In the first few days, if you said yes,  Google would set it up and they would look in your Gmail,  they would look at your Google profile if you had one,  they would build a social graph,  a list of all the people you knew and followed and so forth,  pick the ones you were most likely to want to follow  on a Twitter-like service and automatically subscribe,  but even worse, automatically subscribe.  So, I was subscribed immediately to, I think, 41 people,  from my, which is, by the way,  a small part of my big social graph,  so I don't know how they ranked it,  but this is the worst part.  At that point, anybody can go to your Buzz profile  and see who you're following,  and they get the full email address.  They get the Gmail address.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It would have been a good time  to score some interesting networks.  It immediately publishes and affects people's email addresses

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  without their permission.  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the big full part.  That was a big privacy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it.  There were blog posts.  There was a blog post from a woman  who had been stalked, victimized, I believe raped,  and she said, I don't, this is, look, I'm at risk here.  Google put my life in danger.  They did fix it, Leo.  Well, that's what's, yeah,  that's the second half of the story,  is they responded very quickly.  What were they thinking?  Well, you know what?  We talked to, we had Yuri Engstrom and Kevin Marks,  both former Googlers.  Yuri had worked on, he invented Jaiku,  and so he'd worked kind of on a credit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, so Google bought Jaiku, and that was-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google bought Jaiku, and he says it wasn't the Jaiku code,  but it's very similar to Jaiku,  which was a Twitter with threaded conversations  and location and so on.  And so he'd been using it for a year,  and he said, you know, the problem is,  we'd been using it for a year within Google.  Nobody at Google had this problem,  and you know, everybody knows everybody's address,  so nobody even thought of it.  Interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One big happy family over there at Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We just put it out,  and immediately it was obvious there was a problem,  and to their credit, within a day, Google fixed it.  Now when you join Buzz, it's safe to do so  because you'll see an opt-in list of the people,  and there's check boxes, and there's very clear instructions  on how to hide that information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does anybody think this is gonna go anywhere?  Buzz?  Yeah.  What do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know, I haven't even looked at it.  Jason, your favorite, Jason Calacanis said,  immediately, on this day,  Facebook lost one half of its book value.  He thinks it's that important.  No.  No?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's Jason being PT Barnum, that's what he does.  And he got a lot of traffic,  but I think he looks really foolish right now.  There's no way that they could ever  do that much damage to Facebook.  Have you been on there, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I use it, by the way, this just in,  Kevin Smith is watching, I'm sorry, Kevin,  because he has tweeted, let me pull this up,  ha ha ha ha, some pilot on TwitLive wrote in  with insider info, and Ferringham might have been drunk,  that's really, really funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, apparently someone in the chat room  said that he doesn't drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, well there you go.  So that is BS, that is bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the pilot is a stooge for Southwest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't know about that either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's just say that I apologize, Kevin,  I just read that email and I didn't know  what the situation was and I take it back.  We don't, as I said the very beginning,  we don't know what happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he has a crawler out there looking for anyone  mentioning his name.  Probably, I would guess that Kevin's not listening.  He has people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kevin, if you're listening, I'm following you,  you can DM me with your Skype handle  and we'll get you on the show,  but I know that Smodcast has already covered it.  That would be good.  That would be good, get on the show.  Kevin's a guy, look, I love Silent Bob,  I love Kevin and geeks love Kevin  and I think they're very well disposed towards him  and I think that's one of the reasons  the Twittersphere picked this sucker up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that he's not that fat.  And he's not that fat.  That's the main thing.  You know, one time I was at the Alaskan Airlines counter,  I swear to God it was the weirdest thing  because this woman was actually trying  to get a special seating for herself.  I mean, actually, I shouldn't even tell this story  because it's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we're all, you know, all of us geeks are a little-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, we're talking about like somebody who,  I swear to God, from the shoulders up at the counter,  looked absolutely like, maybe almost like a model, thin,  and then she had just a weird body  and so just below the waist-  Little callipages?  It was unbelievable.  Stay out of the pages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've worked with that woman, actually.  I know exactly who you're talking about.  All right, so let's move on real quickly  because it's only getting worse.  Kevin, if you would like to call, we'd love to have you on.  I know you're gonna talk about it on Smodcast  so people can get the real story there,  at least from Kevin.  And Southwest did apologize,  but apparently their site is down.  I wonder why.  I think they made some enemies in the geekosphere.  They totally did.  I like Buzz.  I think Buzz, I'm not gonna maybe go as far as Jason did  to say that Buzz is a Facebook killer or a Twitter killer,  but I do think really is true,  and this is especially true if you look at the APIs  and what is apparently Google's intent,  is that this solves a problem I've had all along  with Twitter and Facebook,  which is that there are information silos.  You go to Twitter,  we're all pumping huge amounts of value into Twitter,  but that information Twitter holds onto,  in fact, you have to apply to them to get  what we call the firehose, the tweets,  and they only award it to some people.  They're very careful about who can get it.  Through the API, you're limited to only a certain number  of calls an hour, so you can't see all the content in there.  They're really holding onto it.  Why?  Because that's the value in Twitter, right?  I don't know.  Yeah, that's the value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought the access was the value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, how do you monetize Twitter?  Somehow it has to do with the content  that we're pouring into it is somehow in there,  in that equation.  In any event, I don't know why.  I've asked them that question directly  and have been told a variety of different things,  including, no, we're gonna open it up,  and that was over a year ago.  So what Google has done essentially is said,  no, look, there's open standards here.  We're gonna create an open platform.  We're gonna encourage Facebook and Twitter  and others to play, to pump their data into us,  to let our data pump into them, and then it won't matter.  You can go anywhere you want as a user.  You can participate in any social network you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does anybody but me think that Google  may be seriously considered buying Twitter,  and then Twitter wanted too much money?  So it's like, Google originally wanted to buy Friendster,  and they wouldn't sell it, and so they started.  Well, they have or could.  No, they started because they couldn't get Friendster,  so they did a make-buy decision.  They said, well, hell, we'll just do it ourselves.  They created their own system,  and now I think they're doing the same thing here  to try to screw Twitter.  Is that possible? Am I wrong?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know that they're that worried about Twitter.  Twitter hasn't made a dime yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, but they wanted it.  It's something that Google could monetize  because they could see the direction of tweets.  They could do a large analysis of huge numbers of people  for marketing purposes.  There's a lot of possibilities there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  I just feel like Google Buzz,  as it stands right now, it's so new, it's so nascent.  There's so many problems with it personally.  The comments, for one thing, they're not collapsible.  So you keep on seeing this really long comment thread.  You can't collapse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you follow somebody like me or Jason or Robert Scoble,  we take over your inbox because every time a comment's posted  on one of our posts, and of course ours get hundreds  of comments, they float back to the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  To the top, and you keep on seeing the same Buzz post  over and over again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, I'm looking at this stream  and I'm dominating it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Justine is there.  Nobody in their chat room says that Buzz will be big  in Brazil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Or could is, right?  Or could is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I read somewhere that if you press the M key,  M is in mic, you can mute a particular dialogue.  So if a Scoble is, yeah, so that's a relief valve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard to unmute it though.  That's one issue, which is you can mute it.  In fact, there's even a dropdown that says mute this post.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would just prefer having a little plus minus thing  to collapse the comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they're gonna have all of that.  And I think this is the key.  If Google does commit to it and put as much energy into it,  see, it could be a Jaikoo or a Kut, or we could think  dodgeball, we could think of hundreds of Google projects  where they created it or bought it and just let it go die.  But if they don't do that, if they put resources behind it,  they've already responded immediately in this privacy thing.  If they respond that quickly to users,  and let's see if in the next week they put collapsible

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They released it as a gold product.  Google released something as a gold product.  They shouldn't have done that, it's a beta.  I mean, Gmail was beta for years, Google was beta for years,  and why was this not a beta?  Why was this just gold?  Oh, there's some nice features though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, for instance, on your iPhone or my Nexus One  Google phone, it does automatically,  it's got four square style locationing.  The threaded comments, I love so much more than Twitter's  broadcast model.  There's real conversation going on here.  On the other hand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much conversation does a person need in their life  on a day to day basis?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And to amplify that point, John,  do we really need another place to check out?  Yet another social.  I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the first reaction, a friend of mine,  I told her about it, she said, one more spot to do?  I don't have room for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And Facebook, there's Twitter, there's, I don't know,  MySpace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now the thing is that they are bolting this,  I don't think we've made this clear yet,  is they're bolting it onto Gmail.  It's not a destination unto itself.  And yes, Gmail has 30 million users, but let's face it,  we all know people that don't even use email,  they text, especially younger people.  And so I think they're making a big mistake  to tether it too tightly to Gmail  because they may be missing a large swath of people  that might enjoy what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're a Gmail user and you hate buzz,  of course you could say no up front,  or go down to the very bottom of the page  and there's a little tiny turn off buzz.  Turn off buzz.  Turn off buzz.  You can control privacy a little bit.  It does encourage you very strongly  to create a Google profile  because that's where it gets the social graph from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's the thing, if you don't create a Google profile,  people can't, you can't block people.  Right, you have to really create a profile.  You have to create a profile to block people,  we just like, come to the Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I guess some of the pushback on this  is that Google's pushing us to do it their way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm like joining.  I like it.  You know what else?  You like everything, I mean let's face reality.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the conversation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Leo, doesn't it, it looks like Unix.  It's alphanumeric.  I mean part of the elegance of Facebook is how it looks.  The fonts, the shadings, and it's much more visual  and it's prettier.  And also it's a huge application platform, right?  Just all those cool applications and.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well that could be a problem as well as a plus.  I mean the applications could take over Facebook as well.  I mean it becomes the Farmville game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well it hasn't slowed them down.  And then the other thing that Facebook  hasn't really played out yet is the FriendFeed guys,  right, that they bought,  they haven't really delivered the value yet.  They're still in the labs unless I'm mistaken.  Have they really in your view?  I mean they were bought in last summer,  I think July or August.  And they've had six to eight months  and they haven't really iterated Facebook  with all that many to many capability that FriendFeed has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, and I deeply love FriendFeed.  And one of the reasons I'm attracted to Buzz  is it looks like they were very influenced by FriendFeed.  And so while I'm afraid that FriendFeed,  I mean it's the kind of redheaded stepchild now  that Facebook is not gonna belong for this world.  At least there's this Buzz thing  which clearly is influenced by it.  I'll be honest, I don't want,  I think Facebook is as bad as AOL.  Facebook is the AOL of the decade.  It's a silo, it's got huge privacy issues.  Every time you play a game or answer a quiz,  marketers are collecting not only information about you  but your entire social graph.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have no problem with Facebook, I'm not a member.  Well that's why you don't have a problem.  There's somebody that has a Dvorak page on Facebook,  maybe two, that actually looks like it's something  I might have done.  Well there's another problem.  Yeah, well that's another thing.  But it's not bothering me because it seems  to be a fan or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know what Leo, go ahead Nicole.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well I have to say that the only way  Facebook was actually usable for me  was I went into my privacy settings  and I just like tweaked it and I micromanaged it  until I could separate my friends from my coworkers.  I had to go in there and micromanage my privacy settings  and that was the only way it was palatable for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm in Facebook a big time, I have many Facebook pages  and I use it and it's a promotional vehicle  as well as a personal vehicle.  It's how I stay in touch with old girlfriends.  But I don't think that, you know that's where  the 5,000 limit really becomes a problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your 5,000 girlfriends, ex-girlfriends?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, it's more like 6,500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know and I'll tell you those last 1,500 are just bitter.  It's just bitter about it.  It's like I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What else are people saying in chat about Buzz?  Certainly other people have played it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a very polarizing technology.  There are people who love it.  Mostly it's those social media mavens like Calacanis  and Scoble who see another platform or me.  And then there's a lot of people who say exactly  what we've all been saying which is we don't need another one.  It's not very attractive.  We talked about it on this week in Google and Kevin Marks,  one of the things he said it needs  and I agree with him is faces.  You get it on the posts.  You get the faces of the person who made the post  but not of the commenters and that's a huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well that's one of the things that the reason Orkut  I think took off in Brazil which is the most social  of all cultures that I've ever visited  and because it's all photos.  You want to see the person who's talking.  You got lots and lots of photos and so it's like.  Very visual.  You go through and you see somebody else's friends  and you go wow who's that?  It's actually quite entertaining.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we like so.  Humans like this kind of thing don't we?  Yeah we do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We like photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We like photos.  Photos are easy.  Our monkey minds can grasp it.  We can sort them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Speaking of Facebook, did you read this Read Write Web  story about the Facebook locket?  Let's talk about that in a second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that was a huge story and very, very interesting  and I want you to explain it to me  because I've been watching.  By the way this is why I like stuff like Buzz.  I like Twitter too but I think Buzz is going to be  more useful this way is it surfaces what's going on.  I feel like I stay connected by virtue of watching Twitter  or watching Buzz and watching the conversation.  I can see what people, I found out about Kevin Smith  that way.  I find out what is the topic of discussion.  It's the internet's water cooler  and I like these kinds of platforms.  However we are going to talk a little bit about  the Facebook Read Write Web story.  I think a very interesting story.  Before we do that though I want to mention our friends  at Squarespace.com.  This is a great engine I would say  is probably the best word.  It's web hosting, yes.  It's hosting but it's also software  and that's the key on Squarespace.  It does both.  Very affordable.

We thank them so much for their support.  We're actually talking to them.  They've moved into beautiful new offices in Manhattan  and I'm thinking we might wanna use their old offices  for a twit East Coast studio.  Oh, you're expanding to East Coast.  East Coast.  You know why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You got a bedroom in there?  Some place you can scratch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, I can afford a hotel now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, I'm saying for guests.  Oh, you wanna go.  Well, here's the deal.  Okay, you tell me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You tell me.  So we were thinking, I was thinking.  I mean, New York, eh, is anybody using the suite?  We could call it the twit club.  Yeah, you could do that.  Like the Yale club or Harvard club, the twit club.  For twit alumna only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, you can go and stay and spend the night  or a couple days there instead of having to spend the night  in an expensive hotel.  Okay.  And boom, you're done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, that's kind of what it is here.  You know, we have a shower and a coffee tub.  We got a whole suite upstairs.  Yeah, that's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  As long as somebody doesn't hog it.  You just say, make a rule.  You don't wanna spend two nights.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't imagine who would hog it.  Two or three nights.  Who would that be that might hog it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So the idea is.  You can stretch the budget, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The idea is, John's been living there for six months.  Can we get him out?  The idea is we wanna do a morning show.  There's no geek.  The zoo?  Yeah, but a new.  Hey, I gotta tell ya.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You wanna be on it?  You can be on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The zoo?  Yeah.  But it's a zoo for new media.  It's a zoo for social media types and geeks  and stuff like that because we are now  on all these mobile platforms.  On your iPhone, go to live.twit.tv in Safari  and you can start watching live.  It looks great.  It works beautifully.  On the iPhone?  On the iPhone.  We're working on other phones.  iPhone handles it right.  Is it Android?  Android doesn't do it.  We're gonna get that working.  So we're talking about.  So the idea is you wake up.  Okay, you're in bed.  You're a geek.  Instead of the radio.  You get up what, at noon?  Or the today show.  You get up at noon.  Well, I'll explain why we're on the East Coast.  So you set the alarm.  You wake up.  You're listening or watching,  because we do both.  You get in the shower.  You get out of the shower.  You're still watching.  You're getting the subway.  You get in the car.  You still can listen and watch,  because we're portable.  You get to the office.  You turn it on.  You can watch a morning show.  And the idea would be,  it's gonna be the stuff that you care about.  It's gonna be the stuff you're into.  But the reason we have to do it on the East Coast  is because if we wanted to start at 6 a.m.  and we wanted to air it nationally,  we'd have to start at 3 a.m. here.  So we thought we'd have to be in the East Coast to do that.  What do you think?  Track down David Lawrence.  That is a fantastic idea.  David Lawrence would be good.  Do it.  Track down David Lawrence.  He did it.  It's Tnet Radio.  Yeah, I remember.  Didn't go so well.  But that's another matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's why you should track him down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe I should ask him what he did wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm watching you on the iPhone as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, isn't that cool?  That's streaming, HTTP streaming.  That's not Flash.  No, I think it was so good,  we should hear it twice, don't you?  Such a good bit.  Turn it sideways.  You'll get the full experience.  There you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, pretty cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, thank you.  Okay, thank you.  Now Sam Whitmore has become the John C. DeVorek of Twitter.  John's finally gone off the deep end.  So what happened, Nicole, with Read Write Web?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, well, what apparently happened is that  Facebook users are Googling for Facebook login,  the phrase Facebook login,  because how is it gonna log in to Facebook?  Clicking the first result, which is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  First of all, this is the problem with people.  In general.  That they Google Facebook login.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They Google Facebook login.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like what the hell, you go to Facebook, dude.  What are you talking about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's not, anyway.  So, well, a little pre-story was that  apparently Facebook redesigned their login page.  Oh, they couldn't find the login.  They couldn't find the login, anyway.  So they Googled Facebook login.  This is because of the redesign, I get it.  Anyway, so they clicked the first result,  which was a story on Read Write Web about Facebook login,  assuming that the site itself is Facebook,  scrolling to the bottom to get the comments form,  still thinking they're on Facebook,  and then using the comment form to complain about how  this Facebook looks awful.  It looks horrible.  What is this place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Read Write Web had to put up an announcement  on their page that, what, they said,  Dear visitors from Google, this site is not Facebook.  This is a website called Read Write Web  that reports on news about Facebook.  You moron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's your Facebook users.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can, however, click here.  I think that says it all.  You're right, but AOL.  That says it all.  I should call my mom.  Just to see.  Hey, mom, do you know the difference  between Read Write Web and Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, Leo, that John's a good guy.  She loves you.  She would love it if I would.  Did you say hi to him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She didn't ever get to say hi.  I talked to her this morning.  I wished her happy Valentine's Day.  And she said, how is John?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  And then she took off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a great mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love my mom.  She is fantastic.  So is this just stupidity?  Is this just an example of dumbness?  It says, for future reference,  type Facebook.com into your browser address bar  or enter Facebook into Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds like the zoo already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is, don't you think, a morning show?  I'm telling you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But this is like.  We just need some sound effects and here I am.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wacka, wacka, wacka, wacka.  Leo, this underlines this big pitch battle right now  that's going on in the publishing business  about let's optimize everything  and let's get as high up in the engines.  For example, people in the chat can do this now.  Go to Google and type in the word cheapskate.  Okay.  The number one hit ought to be the CNET blog.  The cheapskate.  Called the cheapskate.  It is.  Now, the editor in chief of CNET showed me that  late last week and said, this is amazing to us.  Cheapskate is a word that is commonly known.  It's an English language word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There are six million hits for cheapskate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's a tech blog that's number one.  So they're very smart people all over the world.  They're just trying to optimize publishing results  and get them up and you're going to see more of this confusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  SEO, baby, SEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if I type twit into Google, the first result is, oh, me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and twit is a English word.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But now that was a good choice though,  because it's not a really common English word.  Cheapskate's pretty impressive.  So what are you saying, Sam?  Is that good?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm saying that we will be three or four times a year.  You're always going to be able to talk about an example  of a search result being skewed  because a publisher had that number one spot.  Right.  Right, this is going to happen all the time  because the professionals now are gaming the system  and they're so good at it  that confusion is just going to be part of the web experience.  Not for people that are tuned into this show,  but for the bottom of the iceberg,  there'll be some confusion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're right, that's what happens with Read Write Web.  Read Write Web came in very much higher than it ought to have  for the search Facebook login  because they are apparently good at SEO.  Is it possible to be that good at SEO?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's some amazing things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, those guys are super technical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, like what? What do you do?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't tell him.  He's already too big.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I haven't done Diddley and I'm still number one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I know, Leo, but you could probably...  You know what I did?  You could be number zero.  You could be higher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what I did?  I had a lot of people link to me.  That's all you do.  Yeah, that's true.  Right? Isn't that what matters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but also part of it is you have to link out.  You also have to link out to popular people on a regular basis too.  That's something if you're not doing it,  then that will advance your results.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He doesn't even answer his email.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Every single show we do, we have show notes that are rife  with links to other media outlets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And that's why you're so high.  That's one of the basic things that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why you got a high SEO rating besides being high.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But let me just say that this actually is a great segue  because on the radio show today, somebody called me and said,  I want my site to do better.  And I said, whatever you do, don't hire an SEO guru.  Is that wrong?  I thought this was snake oil.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, there's some oil at the bottom of the tank,  but there are some basic things that...  So what are the basic things?  All the public short headlines.  And also the CNET editor said, always take the name of the company  and the product name right next to each other, juxtapose them.  Because that will give you a better result.  And shorter headlines are better.  Never write a nine-word headline when a six-word headline will do.  He didn't give me everything, but I'll give you...  New York Times, Wall Street Journal all have training,  not only at the copy desk and the headline writing desk,  but also the reporters use words in their leads  that are known to be attractive in a search result.  Linked bait.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, these things are movable.  These are not these rules...  It's a moving target.  It's a moving target because Google is constantly fighting off  with anything they see.  Well, that's what I was going to say, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's job is to not let you game the system.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The most important thing is good content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wordstream.com, I think, is a free utility  that allows you to type in a word  and it will give you the 10 most common searches on that term.  Anybody can do this.  If you're a blogger, you get a website of your own,  you should look into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I just searched for...  Okay, that was a search on the site.  So enter a keyword and try it now.  So I'm going to enter in tech news, right?  Because I would like to show up high in tech news, right?  That would be my SEO...  That's not going to happen.  That's not going to happen, says John.  So, and then this shows...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Turn keywords into profits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What am I getting here with this graph?  What is this telling me?  I don't know.  So enter one key.  Oh, these are related phrases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So then the related phrases should be phrases  that I should use in story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In your writing, yeah.  In your writing or in your marketing copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It looks like bull crap to me, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is bull crap.  So in other words, when I write about tech news,  I should make sure that jobs, group, company...  This keyword is John Dvorak.  Jobs, jobs, jobs, mower.  John, you think you would be getting so much more traction  if you put the word tractor in every podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got an implural to tractors, mowers, sorry.  That's a classic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's a good one.  If you just enter Dvorak, you get Quirti, Novotny, Antonin, Orloff  and Smetana.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, this is nonsense.  What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you should be happy because after Dvorak and Dvorak Keyboard  and Antonin Dvorak or Dvorak, you come in number four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm also Ubuntu John Dvorak and PC Magazine John Dvorak  and No Agenda Adam Curry John Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you make an interesting point, Sam.  So is this good for...  It's good for media that can spend the energy to figure this out,  but it's really kind of bad for users, isn't it?  Because their results are skewed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It is.  In general, people in the publishing business are being accused  of polluting the search results collectively.  I don't know if you guys have ever talked about demand media  or what Saul Hansel is doing now at Seed.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Saul left the New York Times.  In fact, we've interviewed Saul many times.  I think he was a very good reporter.  So what is he doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, he's doing content farming.  In fact, for next month...  Oh, this is creepy what he's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  What's content farming?  Let's go.  I was just talking to somebody who's working for him,  and it's reprehensible.  It's not real content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come on, let's...  Oh, you know...  I got a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's Sam tell us what content farming is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Content farming is the practice of paying people peanuts  to write about service journalism,  how to change a tire in the rain, how to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a friend who is, for instance,  an auto journalist.  She is a car reporter who does freelance.  She's been hired to edit the car section,  but they pay people like bloggers five bucks  to write an inane article that just has a lot of keywords in it.  And links.  And links.  And then she does this curation thing  where she puts these all together.  Now, what are they selling?  What's the...  Are they putting ads on this?  What happens?  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think there are ads on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, well, the bottom line is that when people go to a search engine,  they want to be able to get valuable content,  not just one or two links,  but three or four pages of valuable editorial content.  And a lot of this quasi-advertorial, slap-chop sort of stuff  is getting optimized so high up in the search results  that it's hard to be able to pull down high quality content,  not today, but tomorrow.  There's a lot of concern that there'll be so much dreck in the search results,  like an advertorial essentially,  that it'll be a very unsatisfying process to search for content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, Jason should talk about this  because his actually his mahalo practices.  It's all about SEO.  It's all about that.  About this stuff.  Although he provides good content.  He's not...  Well, if you really want to go back to the originals,  about.com is the originator of this entire idea.  And then if you really want to take the idea further,  Wikipedia, which is always ranked very high,  even though they don't do it for the purposes of advertising,  essentially does the same thing.  These are all just things that are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But that's what Google says.  They say you want to get hits, do good content.  That's what you're saying.  But the problem with these content farms is this business,  I'm kind of disappointed in Saul for doing this.  I guess he decided to go for the gold,  is that they're polluting content with the purpose of generating hits  for advertising reasons.  Now, I have to point out this isn't the first time this happened.  Google had a big problem just a few years ago  where you'd search for something, you'd get all these link farms.  Right?  They fixed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they fixed all that.  I hated Parker sites.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a middle ground though.  It's not quite that as reprehensible.  But to Saul's credit, next month at South by Southwest,  he has an objective to have every single session covered by one of his  20-buck reporters.  So he's trying to mix sort of swarm reporting along with his direct.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now that's interesting.  Is he really looking to put good content up  or is he looking to deflect criticism by having kind of something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Don't know.  You'd have to ask him.  But the point is that I think what he's going to try to do is  elevate the editorial quality within the content farm,  which is to say he wants to be the tallest dwarf  or the least smelly skunk or whatever metaphor you want.  The fact is that we really have to collectively watch  that the search experience could become much less satisfying  than it was in the past decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's bad for me because if somebody's searching for a legitimate tech coverage  and they find these sites are bubbling up above me,  it's very bad for anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But it's not happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not yet.  But I think that if...

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, but the battleground will not be on editorial reputation.  It will be on how deftly you can push your results to the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I believe that this is just something that's just another one of these.  You know, the SEO business is a moving target  and that's why you don't see big websites that reveal all the secrets  because once the secrets are revealed that are trial and error secrets,  then the Google just says,  oh, let's fix that and that's the end of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't it interesting though how the position Google is now in  that we've kind of given them, which is it's up to them to save us.  That's a little scary, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You know, the number one provider of video to YouTube,  take a guess what it is.  CBS, NBC?  Number one provider.  I don't know.  See, you're thinking like a media guy and I am too,  but the number one provider of video to YouTube is Demand Media.  What is Demand Media?  Demand Media is the number one provider of this  advertorially cheap factory produced content,  but they do have branded sites.  They have eHow.  Have you ever been to eHow?  Yeah, eHow's okay.  eHow's really high on almost all results.  They have Livestrong.  They have Livestrong.  They're also going to come out with a branded site for gardening.  These are like, you know, John remembers the Bill Ziff passion verticals days, right?  You'd come out with magazines that served photography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  These are phony, right?  They're not.  This is the thing.  I'm passionate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But they're just really insipid.  There's like, there's like common sense.  There's no editorial horsepower behind it.  It's service journalism.  Like John said, go to about.com.  That sort of thing.  That's the model only at scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, then maybe I'm just being a snob saying, well, that's not real journalism.  Absolutely.  That's just some 20-buck blogger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, 20-buck reporter.  20-buck reporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And so that's just the people's medium.  It seems cynical to me.  It seems like some wise guy said, yeah, the people's media is the ticket.  There's some money in there.  You know what, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There's one point and we probably shouldn't spend a million hours on this, but there's  one point I left out and that is that before they assign these articles, these bots that  search that demand media has, for example, and AOL has these bots go out and search the  entirety of content on the internet and they look at what is under covered.  I'll give you an example.  Harley Davidson belt buckles.  Is a topic that very few people write about, but there's a lot of passion about it.  Sure there is.  And so the bot goes out and it tells us all Hansel, hey, there's a supply and demand  opportunity.  There's not enough supply to meet the demand for Harley Davidson belt buckles.  Let's create content about Harley Davidson belt buckles and then we'll sell AdWords off  of it and add cents.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess I have no problem with that if the content is good, real content generated by  enthusiasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For Mevio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If it's generated by, well, Mevio does this too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, my son was writing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Mevio invented this.  Let's face it.  I know you're a vice president of Mevio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They could have done, if they invented it, they could have gotten a little more credit.  They should have done a better job.  They should have given it all to these guys in the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, but I think that it's okay if they do it and they bring in enthusiasts.  If you find some real Harley belt buckle wizards and they're really writing about Harley  belt buckles.  Yeah, there's your people care.  I have no problem with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think over time, Google will take care of this issue and it'll be something else.  Help us Obi-Wan, GNUBLE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm on ehow.com right now and the top story is how to cope with Valentine's Day when you're  single.  And there are four other stories called how to have a great Valentine's Day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sounds like People magazine to me.  You're single.  Only they pay more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How to cope on Valentine's Day, how to cope with being single on Valentine's Day.  They're all separate articles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apparently, there's a lot of demand for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny because I actually have on my iGoogle, I have an ehow box.  You've been duped.  I've been duped.  I didn't realize that they...  Well, maybe not.  Maybe it goes to WikiHow.  But I like that because let's see what's on my how-to of the day.  Five ways to enjoy being single.  Get a few extra curtain hooks, make a bracelet and how to make a biscuit joint.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay, now Leo, that's not editorial, right?  That's content, but it's a service journalism play.  People care about these things.  Sure.  And they're getting great traffic.  And the search results for that stuff are going all the way up to page one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In that case, if it's genuine content, I don't care if it's a professional journalist,  but if it's genuine content, I think this is the democratization of media and it's a good thing.  If it's a cynical attempt to get advertising dollars by putting bogus content up there,  then I'm not crazy about it.  So which is it?  It's real content.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My son, when he was writing this stuff, he would tell me all these crazy things.  He researched and found out about it.  And he cared about it and he wrote it well.  Did you know that deodorant is made with a combination of the ingredients?  You'll have to do a thing like deodorant, the chemical analysis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  In fact, this sounds like there's going to be jobs for young people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Not at these prices.  So how much was he getting?  He was getting the same thing, 20 bucks or whatever.  That's kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute.  Let me ask the question.  Because when you started out in the newspaper...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  By the way, you've never seen my son type.  He's fast.  He's just...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  When you started out and you were a copy boy in the early days of the newspaper...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes, boss.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's how you started out.  You didn't go to J school.  You started out, some guy, some curmudgeon, invite you over and said,  kid, I think you're ready.  Write a headline.  Right?  Isn't that really how newspaper used to work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, maybe.  It wasn't my idea.  It wasn't the road to riches that I took.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  We're going to take a break.  Come back.  There is another Google story.  Google really...  I love how...  I don't know if I love Google, but I love how they're thinking.  We'll talk about this in just a second.  You know who passed away just today?  The great Dick Francis.  Did you ever read any Dick Francis novels?  Oh, yeah.  Those horse ratings?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Fast reading.  He never believed in using adjectives.  So he just blew through the stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're the one who taught me not to use adverbs, but he went even a little farther.  Yeah.  There was...  Nothing was hot or cold.  It was just...  Dick Francis passed away, but you can get so many great Dick Francis novels at audible.com.  And maybe in honor of Dick, we should mention a few of these great racing stories, high stakes,  even money, second wind, dead heat, fast reads.  This is kind of...  You know, sometimes people say, I'm a little afraid of getting into the audiobook thing  because, you know, it's going to be dull.  It's going to be boring.  It's going to...  I'm going to fall asleep.  No, it could be anything you want it to be.  I mean, there is nonfiction.  There's history.  I listened to a lot of great history, a lot of science and technology, but also  great thrillers and novels of all kinds.  And boy, something like Dick Francis is a great way to listen.

Transcript:  I know you already did the go to webinar spot.  Just 10 seconds.  I run media survey on go to webinars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Say go to meeting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, go to meeting too, because we, those are sort of like the ad hoc things and you  can have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they have their own webinar.  It's the same Citrix though.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't know they had to go to webinar.  Oh, that's neat.  How many people can you have in there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Up to a thousand for go to webinar.  So anyway, that's all they paid for, but I'm a very happy customer of theirs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If people wanted to do, if they're interested in your media stuff, they go to samwitmore.com.  Is that the place?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  I do have that alias over to media survey.  Our business is called Sam Whitmore's media survey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's who are your customers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There it is.  About two thirds are tech PR agencies, but we have CA, we have Teradata, Novell, we have  some tech vendors too, and we analyze tech editorial.  In fact, as we were saying off camera, I did the iPad coverage analysis last month and  I just-  I like your conclusion.  Yeah.  I had to conclude that Twitch TV just kicked everybody's ass and I said so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you for the link.  Yeah.  That's really awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You guys did a great job.  You guys did a great- Gaget did a really good job of live blogging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they were smart because they didn't use Cover It Live.  I came this close to using Cover It Live.  It crashed.  And everybody else, including N-Gaget, used Cover It Live and it died.  Was CNITE using Cover It Live?  No.  No, we didn't.  Okay.  But GDGT did not.  We did not.  And I know I saw Ryan in there.  Ryan Block was typing away like crazy and everybody else was just stymied.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think it wasn't Dwight from-  Dwight Silverman was using it from the Houston Chronicle?  He can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I felt bad.  That's too bad.  By the way, and we didn't talk too much enough about the Mac show,  but I will mention that if you go to the Dvorak Uncensored YouTube videos,  I just posted my random walk video walking through the show.  What would be the URL for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  YouTube?  No, no.  Dvorak.org.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't put it on the blog yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's only on YouTube.  Yeah.  So it's YouTube.com-  Blog is what you're getting.  Yeah, but it's YouTube.com slash Dvorak Uncensored.  Yeah.  Oh, I didn't even know.  So you don't necessarily always put it on the blog.  No.  Well, I'll post it.  There's more there on YouTube all the time.  There's a lot of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's stuff, you know, constant-  I got the tech hippie there on there.  But here's the-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A random walk through the last-  So what do you do?  You just take pictures?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just take this little camera and walk around with it.  With on video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, and we spent thousands and thousands of dollars and brought many-

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I used a buck and a buck and a buck fifty device.  This is really the truth though, is that

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  all these tools really allow you to cover stuff.  I mean, did we learn anything from this?  Is there audio on it?  Yeah, there's audio.  Oh, you put-  This is-  Oh, so this is-  It's not you narrating it?  There's no editorial?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I try to catch people when they're having conversational stop and eavesdrop.  So it's as if you were there.  Yeah, this keeps people from having to go to the show.  You can see what a miserable experience it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And the truth is-  How many minutes is this?  Seven minutes?  Seven minutes, yeah.  You really saw everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pretty much.  You didn't miss a thing.  Five, but I think the seven is-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it took me half an hour.  I couldn't believe it.  I went upstairs to Samovar Tea Room and had a cup of tea.  It was like a-  This is great.  It is.  It's exactly like going there.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is Merlin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Merlin doing his Omni Group thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ...anything up to anything.  This is terrific.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is riveting television.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, it's like the show.  The show is not that riveting.  You have to produce stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can only be as good as the show you're covering, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The way it is, the only reason people think these things are interesting is because the  crew goes in, they shoot it, and then the guy goes and edits it.  So it's exciting when in fact mine's more believable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  CES was very vital though.  I thought CES was a happening for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You really liked it going there because you were a big shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was.  I was fetid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You had a whole crew of people down there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When I say fetid, I don't mean F-E-T-I-D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what it sounded like to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a homonym if I ever heard one and not a Feliz's one either.  So Google made an interesting announcement and I think in a way this is kind of,  they're throwing down the gauntlet.  They said they are going to pick several municipalities in the U.S.,  towns ranging in size from 50 to 500,000, and they are going to become an internet  service provider in those towns offering, get ready for this, gigabit internet access using fiber.  The best you can get right now may be 50 megabits.  So we're talking 20 times better than the best you can get at any price.  And Google's point is this can be done.  The fiber exists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well no, there's a bunch of dead fiber out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My new rallying cry is light the dark fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the fist in the air.  I think that's what really makes it work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Light the dark fiber, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I could rallying cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think?  Or cry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Light the dark fiber.  It could be a t-shirt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we'd make a good t-shirt.  But in the dot com boom, a lot of fiber was laid, even before, was laid under the ground  and never used.  We overbuilt the infrastructure as often happens in these tech booms or booms of any kind.  Remember the Tulip boom?  You remember that in Hollywood?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah, back when I was a kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, laid the infrastructure for the bulb network.  Yeah, the bulb.  I think that that's, I was read somewhere, maybe I shouldn't read, but I read somewhere that...  Or listened.  Maybe you told me that economic boom-bust cycles did have a value because the boom  created overbuilding, overoptimistic overbuilding that later after the bust,  the railroads are the classic example.  The railroads joined the country.  All the railroad companies after that went bust, but we had the railroad and we had the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's what we're seeing today that after the dot com, if it wasn't for the dot  com bust, we wouldn't have all this great stuff that we use now that's...  Exactly.  There's a lot of really good dot com companies out there now that make usable products.  Right.  I'm actually stunned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's all this gigabit or faster fiber under the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, sitting there waiting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Google says they're going to offer fiber to the home.  I love this.  I just love the phrase, fiber to the home trials.  Yeah, but where?  At the astounding data speed of a gigabit a second, they'll sell this service,  they say at a competitive price.  Well, here's the deal.  Is this going to be ethernet?  They'll have to.  I think that's how...  Isn't that how Verizon does it?  They do fiber to the curb and then ethernet in.  But you have gigabit ethernet.  I use gigabit.  We use gigabit ethernet here.  I'll tell you, let me tell you about gigabit.  It's almost hard drive speed.  You feel like you can copy files very, very quickly.  It will empower things like high def video.  It'll be huge for what we do.  It'll be huge for anybody who's using internet to deliver rich media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where?  Where and how much?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just all talk.  No, it's not talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's not talk.  It is talk.  Give me an example.  I want it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I want it in my house.  It's talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sam, would you talk him down right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I read a story in prep for the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll tell you, the company is looking for communities to work with across the country  and is taking online nominations from citizens and government officials until March 26th.  We are lobbying in Petaluma.  I'm lobbying my friends.  You're slobbering?  I'm slobbering on my friends.  I'm just practicing for the zoo.  You're going to be good.  Can I give you a cowbell and you'll be set.  This is a little zooey.  It is a little zooey.  I've been that way for a while.  If you go to google.com  google.com slash app serve slash fiber fi.  Google fiber for the community.  Here he is.  Here's Mr. Google talking.  It says, think big with gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hi, I'm James Kelly.  I'm a product manager on Google's infrastructure team.  Hello.  Today, we're announcing our plans to build and test ultra high speed broadband networks  in the United States.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He doesn't sound like he's from around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We plan to provide fiber to the home service with speeds up to one gigabit per second.  Woohoo!  At least 50,000 and potentially up to 500,000.  We saw that.  The selected locations will offer internet connections 100 times faster than many Americans.  How embarrassing.  That was so exciting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just couldn't get to the camera fast enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm just so excited about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Allowing applications that will be impossible.  It's like watching a train wreck in slow motion.  You want to try out new ways to build and operate fiber.  If you didn't hit the glass, you would have probably broken it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Finally, we're going to operate open access networks,  meaning we'll share our network with other service providers, giving users more choice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I think I'm going to lobby our local.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The ball will be the death of Leo, says Eureka on the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the first time I've actually rolled off the ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was quite funny.  Really?  I went down hard.  Are you okay?  Because it was in slow motion.  You didn't hit it that hard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  I was in control the whole time.  So I personally would like to lobby our city council.  I know a couple of members of our city council and say, look, you guys got to apply for this.  What better way to get reelected, John, than to be the city councilman or the mayor  who got Google to bring gigabit internet to your community?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Petaluma?  Yeah.  Oh, they're all going to be going, what the heck is gigabit here in Petaluma?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, no.  This is Telecom Valley.  Oh, yeah.  So you go there.  There's a button to push.  Easy for government officials.  It's a big button.  And then you get get involved, request for information for residents and community groups  or for government response.  I'm going to nominate my community.  And I can imagine that Google's received a few, you know, million people saying,  yeah, I like gigabit.  Why is Google doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Publicity, just what I know.  They want to go in everything.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sam?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Wrong.  This huge asset in YouTube.  Who has a huge what?  Asset in YouTube and they can't, they see Netflix succeeding.  They want to be in the video world what Google is to search results.  So you're saying they're doing it for YouTube?  Yeah, absolutely.  They paid 1.6 billion and they see what's going on in Korea.  They see what's going on in Europe and they can't wait for the United States  telcos to provide the level of bandwidth that Google itself needs to monetize the YouTube  asset plus whatever else they're cooking.  3D.  I mean, people go see Avatar.  Eventually we're going to be seeing that sort of thing in our homes.  Eventually.  You'll see it on the 2050.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll see it on Blu-ray.  But the point is, let's see it on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's the what's the is your Google.com slash what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, it's a really lousy URL.  You know, somebody tells Google about this thing called SEO.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's for crying out loud.  It's Google.com slash app serve.  App serve.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  App serve.  Slash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  A P P S R D.  F I B E R F.  No, there's two R's in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  F I B E R R F I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  Well, that's dumb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm telling you.  It's just at Google.com slash A.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How about just how about just like Google.com slash fiber or gigabit or.  Get involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Learn more about the fiber optic trial.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I think this is I'll tell you there's the there's also the.  The merely the interpretation that Google is altruistic and Google's already said,  I think this is true.  We make money.  The more you use the internet, more we make money.  That's all simple.  So we want you to use the internet more.  How do we get using it more?  More bandwidth.  Make it more appealing.  And I think it's very simple.  I think they want to put the screws to internet service providers in the United States.  They're artificially maintaining scarcity.  I've said this before.  John and I have had this argument for a long time.  They're overcharging.  They're underperforming.  And Google's saying basically we got the fiber.  Light it up.  That's my rallying cry.  Light the dark freaking fiber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is this that is this money, Leo, this related to the Google's efforts to like  put Wi-Fi in some cities.  Yeah.  Related at all to that effort.  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't.  I'll have to go back and look at the Google blog.  But one of one Google executive said and it wrote a very good piece and said,  really, our business model is simple.  The more users the internet, the more money we make.  It's really simple.  So if you look at Google through those eyes, everything they do makes sense.  They just want you to use the internet more.  Right?  Does that make doesn't that make sense?  Sam?  Yeah, it's YouTube, but it's everything else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, that's true.  That's true.  I think that they have a political issue against the telcos.  I mean, they decided to end run them with the phone.  And I don't think they I think they're political enemies.  And I don't think they want to they want to tether their business trajectory,  their multi-year revenue plan and be beholden to telcos.  That's true as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's also it could also be a preemptive strike against the whole net neutrality,  you know, debate situation.  Very good points.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Good point.  I mean, nobody likes the telcos.  Nobody likes the cable companies, even Comcast in an effort.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I feel I'll just form to get the city nominated.  It's ridiculous.  Well, if it were easy, everyone would do it.  Supporting material.  You know, it's both this is crap.  John wants it.  Of course it is.  He doesn't want to do anything for it.  No, I don't.  I don't have any web link to supporting material.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Forget that.  Just tweet and tweet.  Hey, it works for Kevin Smith.  Just go online and tweet.  Give me gigabit.  Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to take a chance.  They're not going to look at anything.  I'm going to send them to the FBI site.  That'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're just screwing it for Oakland.  Let me tell you right now, this is it.  If Oakland doesn't get gigabit, you'll know why.  Actually, I think Petalum has a good shot at it because this is the  it was the second area that Comcast did their at-home stuff.  Did you notice Comcast renamed themselves by the way?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What?  They did?  Yeah.  To what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  To what, Leo?  What would you know?  This isn't a joke.  He's looking at me like it's a joke.  It should be a joke.  Comcast is no longer Comcast.  It's Xfinity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What?  Oh, I saw this.  That means they're no longer Comcastic.  They're Xfinitastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Comcast admitted that they are so hated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, look at Sam's video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there it is.  Sam's got it.  Speed, security, convenience.  It's a new era of entertainment is about to begin.  Get ready, boys and girls, for Xfinity.  Please.  Oh my gosh.  They're rebranding.  Is that the worst?  And then here's right in the web page.  What is Xfinity?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Comcast.  Yes, tell me what's coming.  It's Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember Comcast?  We're better than Comcast.  We're the new Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, why?  Why do they change it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if they're abandoning Comcast completely  or if Xfinity is some sort of bizarre brand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's a brand.  They got too many ads out there.  There's all of a sudden changes.  It's very confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I think this is the new.  Xfinity is the new.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See, there's Fancast.  That's the Comcast web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's Xfinity?  Well, let me click the link.  What is Xfinity?  When you click that link,  Xfinity is a massive selection of TV and movies  you can watch on TV, online and on demand.  Wait a minute.  There's more.  It's also lightning fast internet access.  But there's more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  It's Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's Hulu for Comcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Exactly.  In fact, I'm a member of this.  If you have a Comcast email address,  you can watch some percent of the shows  that come in over your coax, over the web.  This is the portal for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But they're also selling it for 80 bucks a month,  even if you're not a customer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what's Fancast?  I'm confused now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're replacing Fancast.  But Fancast was a limited on-demand system.  This is basically, you know,  you get I Love Lucy and everything else.  This is like your TV.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you have a Comcast account,  you get this free.  It's free if you have a Comcast account.  Great.  I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  John C. Dvorak is at channeldvorak.com.  He does a lot of stuff, but you can see it all there.  It's all consolidated.  Here, by the way, is an apology from Southwest Airlines.  Should I do a dramatic reading?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes, please.  Can you do it in German?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It starts, not so silent, Bob.  Well, this is a little weird.  Well, it's weird about it.  Oh, I thought it was.  OK, it says Christie Day.  I thought maybe that was some religious holiday,  but I guess that's her name.  Many of you reached out to us via Twitter last night  and today regarding a situation a customer,  capital C customer, twittered about  that occurred on a Southwest flight.  It is not our customary relation,  method of customer relations to be so public in how we work.  First and foremost, Mr. Smith, we'd like to echo our tweets  and again offer our heartfelt apologies.  We're sincerely sorry.  As soon as we saw the first tweet from Mr. Smith,  we contacted him personally to apologize for his experience  and address his concerns on both Twitter  and with a personal phone call.  And so they explain what happened.  He originally purchased two Southwest seats  on a flight from Oakland to Burbank,  as he's been known to do when traveling on Southwest,  but he wanted to get on an earlier flight.  He flew standby and when he got on,  there was only one seat.  Apparently, Smith normally buys two seats  Our pilots are responsible for the safety and comfort  of all customers on the aircraft,  therefore made the determination that Mr. Smith  needed more than one seat to complete his flight.  Our employees explain why the decision was made,  accommodated Mr. Smith on a later flight  and issued him a travel voucher for a hundred dollars.  That sounds reasonable.  Well, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Let's find out from Mr. Smith.  You've read about these situations before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Southwest instituted our customer of size policy  more than 25 years ago, requires customers  that can't fit safely and comfortably in one seat.  That's reasonable.  You don't want to be next to somebody  who takes more than one seat if he's only got one seat.  Yeah, no, that's true, Bob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although I've seen it, but what I've been convinced  over the last few years that we should be charging people  on any airline by the pound.  I think a person that is a hundred pounds  should not pay as much as a person that's 250 pounds.  What if they're just tall?  Tall? No, I said, wait, because the planes are always...  Japanese airlines don't want to give me this idea  because they said they're going to make people take a crap  before the flight.  It's a fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It would save us a million dollars a year.  They figured it out.  It's a morning zoo.  So as a matter of fact...  I'm sorry, they can't do that.  What are they going to say?  You go there, you have to...  You can't do that.  What are they going to monitor it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know crappy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wait a minute, they could do that because isn't it true  in Japan that they have toilets that say thank you when you...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe they give you a ticket or receipt.  I don't know.  I think they weigh it.  Whatever the case is, they could make you...  Oh my God.  If they just charge you by the pound,  they wouldn't have to make you take a crap  because you just pay more.
