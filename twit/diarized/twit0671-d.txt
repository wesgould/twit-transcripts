Well, you've done some really interesting and I think important  innovative stuff in the news gathering going back to your coverage  of Occupy Wall Street and so forth.  Although interestingly you did that on Twitter right with and  storeify was a storeify used.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've never been I've always been a skeptic of social media.  I mean that was in the Twitter beta because I was a part of  audio and kind of saw it become our little open platform that  Noah Glass promoted and watched and been a part of the rise of  social media and in many ways benefited from it.  But I got to tell you long before the Cambridge Analytica  scandal broke with Facebook, although I knew Alexander he used  to call me at weird times at the night and talk about all the  yeah, I covered Cambridge in 2016 and Alex would I assume be  inebriated and call me at weird times of the night and rant  about stuff.  But I left Facebook a little under a year ago in Instagram  because I just didn't like not only how that it made me feel  and I don't want to get all the email on you, but it made me  feel is kind of bad every time I logged in and I didn't like my  behavior on the platform.  I mean, I mostly just spam work links on all social media.  I just am here's a link that we're working on the Tech Republic  or CBS News and with Facebook.  I felt like I was bragging a whole lot and you know, at least  on Twitter.  It's contextualized like you really don't have to follow me  and I don't care if you don't want to follow me and on Facebook  because it's a linear connection with people.  I felt like maybe I was kind of being a dick to people who you  know, I don't want to show off or be abrasive in any way.  I don't think I was but I don't like any of the behavior and  I know Brianna experienced a lot of this Jeff.  I'm sure you've experienced a lot of this every time I'm on  I get, you know, 10 to 1 hate to to anything positive and I  just think that  does seem to bring out the worst in people doesn't it?  Yeah, Facebook has isolated us.  It is they behaved in a way that maybe isn't intentionally malicious  but that has work to alienate us and I think that the what they've  done with gathering data on mobile phones has been insincere  at best and and malevolent at worst and so I just felt creepy

Start time: 366.72

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  by the platform and left but you see what's happened.  You have all this pent-up stuff that you haven't been able to  express.  Right, right.  That stuff should have been a tweet storm, man.  I don't know.  Wait, I got to dig deeper though.  When you say Alexander used to call you drunk in the middle  night.  Are you talking about Alexander Kogan of Cambridge?

Start time: 387.12
End time: 428.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Analyst the former CEO of Cambridge that's drunk but his  behavior implied that perhaps he was inebriated sometimes not  all the time sometimes like you're but I'm not saying that  he was because I don't know that he was but yeah, I covered  Cambridge and had a mixed relationship with them in 2016.  There weren't so I cover politics and there just weren't  a lot of people covering big data in politics.  There certainly was Sasha Eisenberg in 2012 but in 2016  if you covered data and how data was driving the election  there weren't there wasn't a lot of competition.  So sometimes I would write a story that Alex likes sometimes  I'd write a story that he didn't like and I would get an  earful from him and other executives at the company.

Transcript:  Miss you know what I found Dan, you know running for office.  I was out the other day and I was like I was just thinking  of myself how happy I felt just like deep joy inside and I  think a lot of that is the process of this makes you get  off the computer.  Yeah, off Twitter off Facebook you spend so much of your day  smiling at strangers waving at everyone even if you don't  know them trying to make friends everywhere you go.  I really feel like it makes you become a better person it gets  you away from that.  Like do you know the behavior on Twitter where it's like you  get someone's tweet and you snark tweet it with the most  cutting sarcastic thing you could possibly say there and I'm  certainly guilty of I don't but I see it.  Yeah.  Yeah.  I just think like it makes you feel better or at least I feel  better since so my question is my question about this is is

Start time: 487.34
End time: 510.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it a function of human beings being connected to one other  one another that does this or is it a function of these  platforms because I think we just incapable of as a species  of being able to communicate globally all the time to  everybody or is there something specific to the way these  platforms handle that process that elicits this kind of  behavior.

Start time: 511.60
End time: 589.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a great question Jeff.  I think that it is these platforms in particular,  especially with algorithms that incentivize fast behavior and  fast reactions in the platforms that design.  So if you remember Facebook us used to have to enter before  responding to a comment and I'm sure all of us with email are  never like that and email is certainly an example of a  platform that connects everyone MX records or something that  is interpreted by every mail server in the world.  And so we can connect with everyone.  I believe that Facebook is engineered in such a way so that  we we are does we get those dopamine pings with every  notification and we are incentivized to leave a very  quick fast response.  I also think that the algorithm segments people and I think  that it plays to our worst nature.  So there are there are ways that perhaps we could design  platforms and you guys might be the experts Jeff and Brianna  especially with your expertise in gaming on how to bring out  the best in people and I think that Facebook probably has  followed the their own stock and they've had to do things  that that set them above and beyond their competition.  But in doing so they behaved in a way and they built a platform  in a way so that it brought out the worst in people as the

Transcript:  old-timer here though.  I am going to point out that I don't know of a single social  network that hasn't done.  I mean start going back to the days of the newsgroups of  use net where I flame Roy's eventually destroyed it then  the well which I loved that flame wars eventually made in  you know intolerable almost it seems and look at YouTube  comments look at any place you get a bunch of people together.  It often starts out very pleasant wonderful as a beautiful  warm bath of a human interaction and then somehow for some  reason it just degenerates and it seems like that's  just part of being a social network after some number of  years even email.

End time: 666.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  the garbage we get an email right.  Yeah, yeah true true.  So maybe this is I mean, I think you're right that algorithms  exacerbated and Facebook's algorithm and we were talking  before the show.  I don't think anything.  I don't think they're evil.  I think that they're just optimizing optimizing for engagement  but that has the side effect of creating this kind of cesspool  but I even then I think it just it's just weaponized something  that's always been around with social networks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, definitely.  I think a lot of I mean, I just read Emily Chang's book a book  Brotopia, which was wonderful.  Everyone in tech should read that book and she talks about  the leadership being almost entirely male and they had one  of the worst bro cultures there and they cynically marketed  to a female demographic, but I don't know anything about

Transcript:  Maybe, you know, we all should joke about people but we joke  about, you know how Facebook is now where your mom hangs out,  but I think about how my mom engages with Facebook and it's  pretty positive.  It's a pretty positive experience for her.  Yeah, you know, she I mean, I'm sure she sees all a lot of  political stuff as do everybody on on Facebook, but the way  what my mom gets out of the experience of logging into  Facebook is almost entirely positive.  She's connected with her kids and grandkids.  She's connected with her high school friends.  She lives in a world of connection that just wouldn't  have been possible for her in any other way really and so  there is some positive stuff obviously that that is enabled  by these platforms and maybe it's I don't know.  I don't know if it's the platform or if it's human beings  that are misaligned here.  You're probably right.

Transcript:  It's us.  It's so funny because this is probably the fourth twit in a  row that with that inadvertently has ended up being this  conversation.  I think it's something that people it's really on people's  minds right now.  Yeah, what's going on?  There's a reckoning coming.

Start time: 805.60
End time: 840.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a reckoning with with all this stuff.  I mean, we've seen that obviously the beginnings of it  with, you know, Zuckerberg testifying and stuff like that,  but I think there's going to be a cultural reckoning with  it very very soon and I don't know what that's going to look  like or what that will how it'll play out.  But I I think that everybody is having this conversation  whether it's you know pundits like us on on shows or just  average people in the street like there's a weirdness.  I mean to the point where I'm sure I'm not the only one  that noticed every ad during the NBA Finals was company  saying I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know it's the apology tour.  Yeah, it was uber.  It was Facebook.  It was Wells Fargo.  Yeah, everybody.  I'm so sorry, but what we did except wait a minute because  and this is perhaps germane, but Facebook wasn't apologizing  they acted as if it happened to them.  They said our Facebook was this wonderful place and then  something happened.  As if they had nothing to do with it.  We're so sorry you got upset something happened.  We got caught.  We're going to interview on June 29th Siva Vijayanathan who  is a great academic covers all this stuff and his new book is  anti-social media how Facebook disconnects us and undermines  democracy.  This is an example of the drumbeat that you're seeing from  so many sources now and it's not just I have to say it's not  just Facebook.  It's social but how about gaming?  Let's talk about gaming because that's what we're here for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  All right.  Let's take a break and we come back a good e3.  Has it finally happened?  This was the first e3 that I know of that regular people  could come to right was that made it so good.  They sold tickets.  But first a word from our sponsor and actually this is a  great company that I'm a big fan of and I have on my iPad.  It's one of the first things I installed when I get a new  iPad is texture and I was so pleased when I saw Apple  bottom.  I think that's going to mean very good things for texture  texture is basically Netflix for magazine the magazine app  it offers unlimited access to more than 200 of the best  magazines all in one place.  You get complete issues every page on the newsstand plus  back issues plus bonus features.  You don't get on a printed magazine like video anytime  anywhere.  It's all in one app.  You'll stay connected to the biggest and best stories today  with texture from the best magazine.  We just look at time and people and Esquire good housekeeping  and Forbes and Sports Illustrated you like your gossip  you got your entertainment magazine your people your maximum  you like travel travel and leisure you like show business  for I would never subscribe to variety, but I love reading  variety and billboard and adage.  That's one of the things that's great.  It's a lot of these magazines you might not subscribe to  but having an article in one of them if you like, you know  Tech they got CNET they got Macworld PC magazine popular  science popular mechanics Wired magazine you like audio  sound and vision and the curated sections mean there's  always something great to read.  I would say that every every week.  There's something great in the New Yorker every month something  great in Vanity Fair or Rolling Stone and I want to I want  to read those but I don't want to have all that clutter on  my coffee table.  I don't want to pay an arm and a leg to subscribe to 20  magazine.  So one $10 subscription and I get them all textures the  magazine app with no coffee table clutter.  Look at all this great stuff beautiful to images when you  if you're a photographer you'll love the photography magazines  like National Geographic because you can zoom in on the  images.  You can pixel peep to your heart's content and they look  so much they look like the originals.  They probably are the original so much better than anything  in a print magazine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't know if I would say best yet.  I think I think it's it was a solid year.  It's an it's an interesting we're in a sort of weird  transition state for e3 because many of the big publishers  are pulling out or having satellite shows that are  concurrent with e3 but not actually part of e3 and so the  big crazy floor chaos that used to used to be what defined  the e3 has subsided a bit and the floor itself is still  cacophonous and intense and has a lot of companies but fewer  than it used to I mean EA does its own event now in Hollywood  instead of downtown Los Angeles Microsoft this year pulled  out and had an event that was adjacent at their funny.

Start time: 1117.42
End time: 1121.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought they were the three because they had the press  conference just like always.

Start time: 1121.96
End time: 1189.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well they you know the Microsoft sponsors the the  theater at LA live now, so it is adjacent to the Convention  Center, but it wasn't actually part of e3 and their floor  presence on the show floor of e3 was nonexistent because  they have their own location now.  Yeah, so it's it's interesting.  It's in a it's in a really interesting state.  Of course Nintendo for years has done what they call Nintendo  Direct which is not an actual press conference.  There are no human beings in an auditorium listening to  someone on stage.  They have a pre-recorded edited composed presentation that  they just live stream whenever they feel like it and they they  do that at e3, but they do it multiple times during the year  and I think you're going to see many companies moving away  from e3 and moving to that model because it they have control  over the message.  They don't have to deal with pesky human beings and you know,  they're able to cut out the middleman and and why you know  as you keep saying on this show many times I've heard, you  know disintermediate that's that's the there's no reason to  have press between you and your message anymore.

Start time: 1189.52
End time: 1214.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's what's killed are not killed but certainly cause  problems for trade shows in general.  I mean Microsoft pulled out at CES Comdex has disappeared.  Well, yeah, well, I mean Apple showed the way Apple doesn't  go to these events.  You just have your own events and you get more attention.  You're not competing with anybody else somehow though.  It seems like Microsoft Sony Nintendo still feel like they  have to be somewhere around e3.  That's still the week right?

Start time: 1215.30
End time: 1271.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's still the week that all the news is coming out right like  in you know for a gamers perspective.  You don't really care if Nintendo is announcing smash like  as part of e3 or like with the Nintendo Direct.  I just care the new smash is coming out.  So I really hear what you're saying Jeff, but like they've  they've struggled with this for years.  You know, Leo you were saying this was the first e3 that was  open to the press.  If I'm remembering this correctly, they tried that a few  years ago like letting people in then they shut it off to  journalists again and let people back in if I'm remembering  that correctly.  I just think ultimately it matters like what games were  announced and what games are coming out because they're all  kind of competing for that mind share.  Like is Fallout 77 going to be the big game that people care  about is Anthem and I think what we saw this year were some  fresh new IPs really getting a lot of attention from people.

Start time: 1271.62
End time: 1283.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think according to GameSpot e3 opens the public  for the first time ever 15,000 tickets.  Oh wait, that was last year.  Okay, there you go.  So it is the second year in a row.

Start time: 1283.80
End time: 1328.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay second year and they this year the first time they had  different hours for the public and the press which was which  was kind of nice.  We got a couple of hours at the beginning to go in and just  have press only but I agree with you Brianna.  I think you're right.  I think it ultimately comes down to what games were shown what  things were talked about because it is the biggest week in  in the gaming calendar and and that's really the most important  thing.  It is interesting how the show is changing and and I think kind  of receding in a certain sense, but from a gaming standpoint  from just what was announced it really was a strong year for  some exciting stuff.  We did get a lot of sequels as we always do but some some  exciting new stuff some interesting and trends.

Transcript:  Go ahead, you know and and just the the I too.  I'm a gamer.  Although I suck at games.  It's it's a huge part.  It is explicitly my hobby.  Like I'm not working if I'm playing games and it's been  fascinating to watch games both pioneers some of the spaces  that we've talked about specifically social hooks.  I mean in social mechanics.  They figured out long before social media cyber security and  cyber defense game the game industry had to pioneer these  things and they're now kind of following the SAS model and  it's interesting to see the games industry take a page out  of the the services book and really transition almost every  major publisher has transitioned from releasing standalone  products and single-player products over the last decade to  these these always on service models and whether you I mean  gamers.  I know are very vocal with their opinions, especially on Reddit  but whether you love this or hate this it really has  represented this kind of massive sea change that's happened  in a multi-billion dollar industry that the mainstream  media has kind of turned a blind eye to it's interesting.

Start time: 1398.64
End time: 1484.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead.  I was just going to say the this very true and it's one of  the big trends coming out of the show that I noted as well  that the sort of destiny afication of game destiny was  a game a few years ago that was this always on service that  bungee did for Activision and has been a big success for them  and it just seems like in the wake of that.  We're now seeing the games that fall suit anthem fall at 76  is fallout destiny a fight and it really only Sony is is the  big publisher that still front and center with single-player  playable offline games.  I mean their slate this year was Ghost of Tsushima Spider-Man  last of us to Death Stranding.  Those are the big four that they showed days gone was another  one all single-player narrative driven experiences traditional  what we think of as big triple-a video games, but everybody  else everybody else is focused on much more games of service  perpetual always updated.  We can sell you one thing then we can sell you at a hundred  more times with cosmetics and with DLC content coming down  the line and you're seeing that over and over and over again  of these looter shooters as they call him or you know,  you get a bunch of loot and you're shooting stuff many of  many games dominated e3 big triple-a games that are that  are doing that and looking to make that kind of money.

Transcript:  Yeah, think about Red Dead as this crazy hybrid of I mean  take two made bank on the social mechanics of in in this  this nickel-and-diming of Grand Theft Auto 5 and they also  have a linear single-person story and and there took what  they learned from that and are applying it to Red Dead  Redemption, which is right now at least a PlayStation  exclusive.  So Sony exclusive it is a single-player game with all of  this massive multiplayer stuff attached to it.  It is not an exclusive.

I think this is a really concerning trend for the  industry and I do understand because being a game developer  I want to tell you like developing games is more expensive  that I think people understand.  It's really it's really Hollywood movie level at the  it really is the every one of these games were talking about  they cost over a hundred million dollars to make every  time I add a character to one of my games that's going to  cost me $20,000 to model the character and get a rig and  the texture job and all of that and by the way, that's

Bioware like no one out there that loves Bioware titles  loves Mass Effect loves Dragon Age.  None of us like buy those games because we like Destiny  shooters and it was so frustrating to see, you know,  Bioware's next big IP anthem just basically be a Bioware  version of Destiny, which by the way has the worst story  of any game that's ever shipped in our industry and it's  it's a really I understand the finances of it because if  you get someone keeping your game for a long time and  interacting with your game for a long time, they're not  going to sell that game back.  They're going to keep doing in-app purchases.  I understand it.  But you know, I'm probably I don't feel like I'm the only  person that when I play games at the end of the day a lot  of the time.  I don't want to be social.  I just want to kind of go into my own world and recharge.

Fortnite actually is funny because it is an MMORPG, but  I guess I mean, it's not really not a battle Royale, but  it's a massively multiplayer game and massively with a  hundred people.  It's a multiplayer game.  All right, it's online, but I get killed almost instantly,  but I still watch the rest of the game.  It's actually I think it's doing well for eSports for that  reason.  It's a fun game to watch, which is an interesting thing.

Star Citizen has raised well over a hundred and eighty million  dollars in crowdfunding starting in 2012 and it had I mean  the product there is no product.  You can download something that's extraordinarily.  Clujy at best and they sell virtual ships for twenty seven  thousand dollars.  What?  There's not even a game yet.  Yes.  So what's fascinating is is the the fallacy of some cost and  this games as a business model where the business model is  vaporware.

There's a lot of failed Kickstarter's and a lot of early  access games that are sort of meandering but there's nothing  on the scale of Star Citizen.  So I think it's it's an interesting thing to watch because  you know, will it ever be anything is a great question  but and certainly there have been lawsuits there are ongoing  ongoing litigation.

Now it's kind of broken up into parts and they they say that  those modules will all come together to be a cohesive game.  There's sort of a first-person shooter, you know, human being  on the on, you know, in space shooting things.  There's a spaceship ship to ship combat situation and then  there's sort of a trading intergalactic layer.

Transcript:  Well, that's what this is what's interesting to me.  So Brianna you're as the developer here.  You're saying a hundred million dollars to make a game not  I mean unless you're EA or you've got somebody like that  behind you.  This may be the only route you could make a A-list game,  right is to crowd fund it and it's gonna it's gonna be slow.  How do you address this with your company?

Start time: 1881.96
End time: 1939.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, you know for us we took the Apple approach that  we just kept our heads down and didn't release anything until  it was perfect like it one Pax East.  We got a lot of really negative feedback and about combat being  too slow and we took it we massively redid all of our scenes  and made huge changes to it.  We personally didn't ship games until it was ready.  That's always been my motto.  There are a lot of people I personally hate this trend of  releasing games like while they're still in development.  I think for Nintendo releasing a game to make sure the network  has cohesion like with Splatoon that makes sense to me because  you know, we all remember Ultima online when that shipped it  was just impossible to log on for days, you know avoiding that  makes sense to me.  I personally don't like this and I think it really takes away  the the magic of turning on a game and just having an experience  is already ready for you.

Start time: 1939.70

Transcript:  That's an open question the in the game industry, right?  Like I would have to say for anyone Jeff, you're a huge VR  proponent.  I love reading your stuff on Twitter about that.  But as far as being a good venture capital bet, you know,  venture capital funding independent funding for VR has  really really severely dried up in the last year because it's  just not possible to make money from it.  That's pressure that our whole industry is feeling.

Start time: 1969.40

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's interesting because you haven't seen a lot of great VR  titles that there was a yeah a burst when the Oculus Rift and  the Vive came out and it seemed to be kind of more abundant to  be Frank.  Yeah, what do you guys think of Oculus Go?  We were just playing with it yesterday.  I was very impressed.  I think it's a I think for 200 bucks is a standalone VR.  It's it's actually not bad.  I have a Rift and a Vive and the Go is you know, not bad.  This is missing some of the motion components, but I think  it's going to be a way to introduce people to it.  But I wonder if there's a market Jeff.  Do you think there's a market you think people are going to  run out and buy VR headsets or have people are just I feel  like they've decided already and they've decided against it.

Start time: 2010.10

I think I think my kid who is about to turn to will think  it's weird that I played games on a 2D flat surface.  I think he will think it's weird.  And so we're just in early days and I think once Apple enters  this market, which they will it will everybody will change  their tune.  I really believe that VR completely disagree with you,

These are you download them to your service.  They're real games.  Yeah, right.

Transcript:  Okay, hold on a second.  Just one thing.  It's clear though that what's really happening is that people  are looking at mobile and saying look all the gaming is going  to casual mobile.  So we've got to somehow respond to that and that's what these  streaming solutions are obviously.

Start time: 2213.18
End time: 2249.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think what you're seeing is that just like with films people  want to watch them on everything want to play them on everything.  So it's not that it's all going to mobile.  It's that we also want it to be on mobile.  So sometimes you watch a movie at home on your big screen and  sometimes you watch it, you know on the train on your people  still take trains, right?  On your phone.  Yeah.  So the idea here is that you disconnect the experience with  the device that you're watching it on and it can just be on  everything all the time and you're already seeing that with  Fortnite, which was just announced and released on switch  at e3, but it's also available on mobile and it's also available  on all these other platforms.

Transcript:  The idea here being that the the with a streaming service  like Netflix all the rendering will be done on big beefy  computers in the cloud and you'll just get the image sent  to your phone.  So your phone really won't have to do all the heavy lifting  of rendering the graphics or even any of the AI processing  any of it.  The game will all be handled exactly remotely and you'll just  be getting the frames sent to you.

I've spent 30 years working on my theater on my Street Fighter  skills and you know, I won't even play with the wireless  controller for Street Fighter because that gives that little  bit of lag and inputs for playing people competitively.  If you're talking about like then the round trip between  a server center and your computer and the lag on top of  that because so many of these games are competitive Gears of  War, you know, pug, you know, fortnight.  I am unsold on this being the feature.  We try it with on live, you know, Sony has been offering  this for years.  If I remember correctly, they bought all the patents for on  live Sony did and then tried to turn into we're going to sell  the entire PS2 catalog when you play those games.  They're blurry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think I think that there is the gaming industry,  especially over the last decade has been an industry that in  transition where it once catered to gamers who Brianna  I'm in your camp, especially when it comes to competitive  games.  I want a lag free experience, but the market of us versus  the market of like Leo said mobile or casual gamers.  I think that it is orders of magnitude larger and the  industry is looking at the bottom line and especially  because so many of these companies the publishers are  public companies.  They're really looking at their bottom line and they're  looking at the market and the ability to capture a market  that was not previously gamers and didn't think of themselves  as gamers and to drink transition.  These people is in capture.  This audience is far easier than it is to like we've said in  this conversation Super serve in a market that's already there  that may have very specific niches of things that they want,  but there simply is high overhead low return on that  investment.  So I think that you score that point.  Sorry to tell you that I was just going to reaffirm what you  said.  Yeah, the the market is just much larger for people who care  not about milliseconds of lag.

Start time: 2472.42
End time: 2528.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and and you know, Leo brought up the fact that  fortnight has is overtaken PUBG as far as the the Battle  Royale the global Battle Royale of choice and there's a lot  of reasons for that but a very not insignificant one is the  fact that fortnight's free and I think driving costs down is  is a huge factor in opening these experiences up and as I  said, if you're having a situation where in order to render  a game you need a three four five hundred dollar box in your  house or heaven forbid a one to three thousand dollar PC you  compare that to a device you already have because it's your  phone or your whatever and you don't really care how powerful  it is because all of that is handled in the cloud and it's  just sent to you it's it expands that audience exponentially  because there's people are just able to not have to worry about  investing in the device that plays the game.

It's driven new economic models.  AI is driven the cloud is driven AI and one of the things  as an outsider, I mean, I'm a casual gamer but as an outsider  one of the things is clear to me is that gaming is an incredibly  diverse market.  I mean if you just listen to this conversation there are  initiatives going in a lot of different areas and I don't  think anybody knows if VR is going to be the next big thing  or if streaming games are going to be the next big thing or  Battle Royale is going to be the next.  I mean Fortnite came out of nowhere.  Everybody thought PUBG was going to be the next big thing  and along comes this game that was fairly weak and they said  well we could do a Battle Royale and it's and give it away and  make all our money in digital goods.  It's really I think it's very difficult to I don't envy you  Jeff and people who have to cover gaming because it is an  incredibly diverse field is not one thing at all.

But I did a stream recently with you know that I was hosting  with some of the biggest League of Legends streamers and they  competing this is a year or so ago and these guys we the whole  like the whole gimmick for the stream was that we were going  to make them play games that aren't League of Legends and  they just had a no interest and be no knowledge of any right.  They weren't video gamers.  They were video game your League of Legends players and  that's and that's an increasingly strong distinction of  people who just play Fortnite or just play whatever the that  particular game is because the games are deep enough the  experiences are perpetual enough that they can do that and  the audience is for those things you can make a living just  streaming one particular game and getting very very deep into  it and the skill set that you need to be a top-level player  in those those fields it allows precludes you from playing  anything else because you have to spend so much time perfecting  your skills.

We don't know how that money is going to be given out but a  hundred million dollars to give away as prizes to entice e-sports  players to play Fortnite.  Now if you look at the next 20 e-sports League of Legends,  Dota, whatever, whatever any game you want, you know,  Counter-Strike anything the biggest stuff and you add up  all the prize purses over a year.  They don't make a hundred million dollars.  Yeah, the next 20 games.  So it is a huge initiative.

We the visual fidelity of these headsets is when you watch  video is still a little disappointing you get you get  some graininess you get some it's not great, but it's  improving with PS you know the Vive Pro and the new Samsung  headset have higher resolutions and I think we're going to  see that trend continue and I'm I'm very bullish on VR have  been for a long time.  I think that when people try VR it is it is a special  technology that I think is completely different kind of  way to engage with an interactive experience than anything  else and I think that you know, there was a lot of energy  as you guys have mentioned around it when it was when it  sort of was launching and that is wane and I'm certainly I  certainly agree that it has wane, but I think as the technology  improves and some of this rough stuff gets ironed out and  bigger players get in the game.  I think you're going to find in 510 years that VR is is  massive and AR even more than VR I distinguish between

Transcript:  the two and I don't that's where I disagree with the Jeff.  I do think I think AR is going to be what catches on eventually  because for me it's like I would love to see like my Twitter  feed or my email or all that stuff like do you know what I  mean like that's something I can use all day long getting  information around me AR games have huge potential.  We've only begun to begin like think about VR just closes  you off so much and it brings up the nausea problem.  It brings up the you know, it limits your gameplay because  you have to have that teleport mechanic because your eyes  and your inner ear aren't seeing the same thing.  I think when Apple comes out with that product is going to  be far closer to HoloLens.  Yeah, I think they're doing AR.  I wonder if they're doing VR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  because it eliminates the nausea problem.  You're seeing the real world in addition to overlays.  It has uses well beyond gaming by the way.  It has lots of very practical uses.  I think AR we played with another AR headset.  How much was that headset yesterday that we played with  Dreamworld?  It was I think two or three hundred bucks, but it was very  much like HoloLens except it had a full field of view very  it's very impressive.  I think we're coming along with AR and yeah, I would expect  Apple will do it when they can make something that's a little  bit more compact than today's VR headsets.

Transcript:  Again, like I said, I shouldn't I shouldn't conflate the two  terms because they are distinct but I do think that the future  is AR with VR capabilities and video games will still be  mostly in the in the VR space.  I think you'll still want this world to go away and a new  world to replace it for fun.  And I think that you'll that that will be the way my kid will  experience most of his digital entertainment.  That's going to come down.

Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  And and there definitely will always be a market for and  we've all talked about it for there.  We want some sort of escapism at some point.  I just think that market is a fraction of what the AR market  represents.  I have a question for all three of you guys about Microsoft.  You know the HoloLens I tried that in 2015 and it doesn't  seem to have made much.  It hasn't changed since.

Start time: 3034.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft has made some tremendous investments in the  last couple years, especially with their acquisition of  LinkedIn their acquisition of GitHub.  And I know I doubt this will happen but Brianna and Jeff  and Leo too.  I'd love your speculation on this.  There's been a lot of rumors about Microsoft buying steam.  I don't know that I buy that but I could see their emphasis  again not to mock Balmer with developers developers developers  but when we're having conversations about AR AR  especially and we think about the HoloLens and all of these  emerging technologies IoT big data artificial intelligence.  I could really see Microsoft buying steam not to acquire  the game platform but to to ingratiate or by the next  generation of developers who might create content to populate  AR systems.  What do you guys think about that?

Start time: 3093.54
End time: 3168.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there was a lot of sort of a lot of hullabaloo.  I don't know for six months ago somebody on a very well-known  video game website wrote an article speculating that would  be a good move for Microsoft and it turned into this whole  thing and kind of snowballed and it actually affected the  stock price of companies.  It was pure speculation.  Sure speculating.  Yeah Microsoft at e3 interestingly enough and did announce  five new studios that they have acquired to create first party  content for their platforms.  So they are very much aware of needing to create exclusive  content for their platforms and they didn't have any of that  to show but they did announce these these partnerships with  some really actually very interesting developers that are  have made some really cool stuff.  But I think the idea of them purchase buying steam.  I think it makes a lot of sense.  I that doesn't seem to be any indication that they're going  to do that, but it it would make sense on a certain level  because steam kind of owns the PC market.  It's going to owns but I don't but that doesn't get them what  they really need which is content right?  It would make me want three indie studios though.

Start time: 3171.24
End time: 3213.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and and they're really strong studios are many of them  were already working on sort of pseudo first-party stuff stuff  that would be exclusive to the platform anyway, but some weren't  and I think it shows an understanding that that is what  differentiates Sony as a platform right now from from Microsoft  the PlayStation is that Sony has really strong exclusive content  and Sony leaned into that very strongly at E3 this year.  But as far as you know acquiring valve or steam or some variation  of those two entities valve basically doesn't make games  anymore.  They claim that they do and they have a new card game, but there

Start time: 3214.04

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  are some for indie developers and that's when I think about  AR and I think about Apple Apple already has a pipeline for indie  developers or in for major developers and if we're looking at  2019 at the earliest maybe 2020 for an Apple AR product.  I think well, how does the rest of the industry compete and that  is with content and developers.  So that's that's one reason I think about a quiet Microsoft  might want to acquire valve, but you're absolutely right.  This is all been speculative.  I just think what is the pipeline to get content creators to create  things because we've all had this conversation VR has has failed  in large part not failed but has stuttered because of the lack  of content and this is something that will or could also kill  AR and so every major major tech company has to be thinking about  how do we populate our platforms with content and with talent?

Start time: 3271.30
End time: 3337.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I just feel like I need to say here.  I want to take a step back and look at some of our assumptions  here valve.  I would say increasingly has a toxic reputation with developers  and a lot of that reason is because rampant harassment of  developers goes absolutely unchecked on that platform developers  get rape threats get death threats.  I've certainly had that on valve, you know, there was actually  some people in the hatred community.  This was a mass murder simulator that came out a few years ago  that were actually demanding to put specific women in the game  industry into this game to kill as DLC for that.  So I would say I think there's a cultural shift.  I was at Microsoft build just a few weeks ago and what I see  is a Microsoft that is increasingly fundamentally culturally  different than what valve is it has evolved into which is this  Laze fair anything goes kind of, you know, bonanza Marketplace

Start time: 3337.46
End time: 3353.42

I'm not condemning those, you know with a broad brush, but I  do think that for the industry to broaden and to you know,  really take a cultural place that I think it deserves that  will it will require this kind of event e3 being more than just  what's the next ultraviolent thing that we can we can show  people and I actually believe VR will have a big place in that  because while there's a lot of violent VR stuff.  It's also a place for empathy.

Transcript:  So yeah, I think what I worry about  is that the incentives are all upside down like we've seen  the loot box structure take over because what you're talking  about Jeff like free to play games.  It brings people in and then people like me like I will buy  every loot box that comes out.  I've probably spent three or four hundred dollars on gears  of war for you know, the incentives don't really reward  a game like Mass Effect as much today, which is a game about  war and conflict and about the human cost of war and trauma.  Like it's a really big game with some really ambitious themes.  One of my very favorite games of all time is the Dangan  run put series, which is essentially just a long visual  novel about despair.  Those are the can't wait to play that it really really foreshadowed  Dangan run put came out and it's at the courts about a group  of people that love despair and they want to inflict you  on the entire world and it's so contagious that they cause  the world to turn in on itself and it's about 16 students  trapped in a school trying to murder each other to escape.  It's it's a really powerful story, but that's that's such  a niche.  It's a very important game to me, but that's not what our  industry is putting out as much as we used to and that makes  me sad because the financial incentives are just not there.

I think we're getting there and it's it's taking longer than  it should and I think there's a lot of room for improvement  but you know, I'm I'm generally pretty optimistic about that.

Well, we can we can move on from gaming.  This was a big week for content and other ways net neutrality  fell and almost exactly at the same time on Monday a judge  ruled that AT&T could merge with Time Warner and by Friday  it was a done deal.  Comcast said oh and immediately made a 56 billion dollars.  I'm sorry 65 billion dollar bid for 21st Century Fox.  They were waiting to see if the AT&T Time Warner merger went  through.  This is a bad Nexus.  This is a bunch of I thought Neelay Patel did a really good  job on the verge.  He wrote that the court's decision to let AT&T and Time  Warner merge is ridiculously bad.  And I think he made a very strong case that the the judge  seemed to confuse pipes platforms with content creators  and the judge I understand the way law is written says, oh,  you know, these are two vertical independent vertical  markets.  There's no competitive issue here.  So there's no reason they shouldn't merge.  In fact, he hadn't he placed no restrictions on their merger  Richard Leon of the US District Court for District of Columbia.  It's I have to say I've been pointing all week.  I've been pointing out that at one time the movie movie  companies owned all the movie theaters and it was clearly  bad.  There was no independent movie industry because you couldn't  get it shown anywhere and we as a nation decided that that  wasn't a good thing and we broke him up.  This is to me exactly the same thing with the companies that  distribute content are now owning the companies that make  content and that's going to be bad for the independence.

You know, I think it's ridiculously anti-competitive in  the way I feel is you know, when I get to Congress, I'm going  to do everything in my power to break these giant companies  out and you know, they just have too much power.  If you look at the amount money they're throwing into the  system, it's bad.  This is bad for United States innovation.  It's bad for cybersecurity.  It's bad in every possible way.  It could be bad including consumers and this is only going  to get better if you vote people in that care about you more  than they care about accepting money from these companies.

Yeah, and be you know, the states have become the front line  of defense for all of the reasons that you guys enumerated  here that this is bad for innovation.  It's bad for big business and it's bad for independent business  and it's certainly bad for consumers and and to have the  state stand up and say hey look we're a part of the conversation  too is incredibly important because this is yet another road  block or at least the states represent a roadblock to to this  roll rollback.

But I have to say if without net neutrality when a company like  AT&T owns a lot of content and doesn't own other content.  There's no thing nothing to stop them from saying well, we'll  give you access to HBO for free no bandwidth cost, but we're  not where you're going to charge you if you want to watch  Netflix that seems to me baldly anti-competitive it hasn't  happened yet, but I expect it will.

You know, I I'm hopeful we see Washington State as being a  state where that seems to be fighting this California.  I understand is going to 23 States.  Yeah, so I'm hopeful that within the borders of individual  States this stuff will take a hard line and we'll say hey we  will still enforce neutrality, but I can't imagine that's going  to last and if it's I don't know I feel like this is a very  bleak moment for our digital future to be honest, but I've

Transcript:  So it's inconvenient after twit last Sunday night.  I published a op-ed piece a commentary and seen that saying  I support a free and open Internet.  He says you don't understand that if we don't if we don't  change these rules, you're not going to get investment in a  better and faster Internet.  You're not going to see the better access that you want.  You're not going to see rural Internet progress that it's  important to give these companies a free hand so that they  do invest in an improved Internet, please.

Transcript:  That's always worse.  Historically, please.  Yeah, you know net rural electrification only came because  we mandated it and it's the exact same with the Internet.  We can we can solve that in other ways.  We can give tax incentives or thousand other ways to solve  that problem that don't involve giving, you know, these  telecom companies free reign over information to this degree.

Start time: 4433.46

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So now try again says this approach will be very positive  for consumers.  For instance, recently I heard from a rural broadband provider  in Vermont VTEL say they wrote to say regulating broadband  like legacy telephone service would not create any incentives  for VTEL to invest in its network.  It would have the opposite effect.  I'm sure he's heard the same thing from AT&T and Comcast  and Verizon.

Transcript:  But there's also a little bit of a lie that he's repeating  that I keep hearing from people who are in favor of scrapping  net neutrality that at the dawn of the Internet Congress and  Clinton agreed on a light touch framework under that approach.  The Internet was open and free network investment topped  one and a half trillion Netflix Facebook Amazon and Google  went from small startups to global tech giants.  I hear this again and again.  No, we're just going back to the way it used to be the unregulated  light touch Internet.  Well, okay, you can you can sigh but you've got to you've got  to tell me why that's not true.

They do business here in America.  The question is, is this best better for the American people?  It's not and you know, I just I think it's a Texas two-step.

Let's not forget that 5G is coming and coming somewhat fast  and and 5G is is a disruptive technology like we have not  seen in in mobile and if it's if these companies are not able  to control it in the way they want it could fundamentally  disrupt the way they operate now actually the 5G standard

It seems to me different things to different people even  different things to different telcos, but I think what we  all want is a faster network that can handle more traffic  and I think that's what 5G promises even gigabit speeds  over wireless broadband.  That would be pretty impressive and it would make and I  guarantee you that's exactly what companies like Microsoft  Sony and EA are looking at when they talk about streaming  games.  They're looking at the future where 100% absolutely.  Yeah, you can you can play Fortnite on your smartphone  in the middle of a desert because you've got 5G.

We want people to invest in these and we we see 5G coming  and we don't feel like if we regulate the hell out of these  ISPs, they're going to they're going to be incented to  develop things like 5G.

They're both bidding for 21st Century Fox not not Fox News  but regional Fox Sports.  I don't know.  Sky I think is part of it and the other thing that's interesting  is Hulu.  It would give Comcast a 60% controlling interest in Hulu.  And that might you might say well that really is these  companies saying okay, we've got to recognize that the future  is upon us and we need to be if we're going to succeed we  can't succeed Comcast can't succeed as a as a dumb pipe  company.

Transcript:  There are this is another New York story.  I don't know if your wife is involved in this but New York  is threatening to revoke Charter's purchase of Time Warner  cable because they made promises including network construction  that they never completed in there.  The New York State Public Service Commission ordered Charter  to pay $2 million in fines and finish that gosh darn network  construction.  I mean it really does show you they don't they don't care  they make promises.  They don't care.  They don't care.  Also shocking shocking shocking shocking shocking shocking.  Yeah, I don't know.  I just not a lot of love lost for me for Comcast or AT&T or  Verizon or any of these companies.  They don't really seem to care that much about consumers and  they know Comcast for instance used a throttling system.  Remember when they said oh, you know bandwidth hogs remember  those bandwidth logs after 2008 they turned on a bandwidth  throttling system to block BitTorrent.  They just disabled it and John Brodkin on Ars Technica says  it just proves that the data cap is just a money grab.  There's no network congestion issue.  They they did deploy their network congestion management  solution after it was caught throttling BitTorrent traffic.  Oh by the way, that was that was back when oh yeah, there  was net neutrality regulations.  Comcast was was throttling BitTorrent and the FCC said you  can't oh, okay.  Gee that free and open Internet hmm news of Comcast disabling  it came in a company announcement on Monday.  Monday was a bad day for the Internet.  When asked when Ars Technica asked Comcast why it still  imposes data caps now that it has no need for a congestion  management system.  They offered this statement our network and consumer devices  have evolved to a point that our old system is no longer  necessary.  It's been inactive for more than a year well over 99% of  our Internet customers are using more modern gateways and  modems.  So we don't have congestion on individual channels.  It's not a problem fixed itself fixed itself.

Transcript:  I think Comcast does have because of Docsis 3 more  capability to manage the network at the cable modem.  Okay, so I think that maybe but you know what thing Comcast  has never done and I've gotten hit by the you know, three  months in a row going over your data cap.  They start charging urging you $10 a gigabyte.  What would it know I came or what the price is $10.  Yeah, a terabyte.  It can't be that must be must be more than that.  Anyway, they don't they don't tell you how they measure it.  My measurements never match their measurements, but that  doesn't matter.  All the only thing that matters is their measurement.  So you don't there's no appeal as far as I can tell.  So I just bought a second Comcast cable modem.  I just got more about more Comcast.  What else are you going to do?  Yeah, what else are you going to do?  It looks like that this what's the pressure is going to be on  the content creators like Google like Netflix to become ISPs  with and that wouldn't be a bad outcome that would encourage  competition.  I'm a little disappointed frankly that Google gave up on  its ambitions and fiber.  Yeah.

We're not going to get speed increases if there's no motive  to do that like throughout the United States.  It's clear the ISPs are a duopoly here in Massachusetts.  There are vast parts of the state that do not have broadband  do not have computer science education in schools.  It's like how on earth like our kids today that are trying to  you know, get an education go on to work and have productive  careers if they don't have broadband internet access at this  point.

We don't offer it because no one wants it and then no one comes  Google offering it at 40 bucks and then suddenly everybody  wants it.  Oh, yeah, you could get that.  Yeah.  And and of course these companies stepped up.  They lowered their prices where Google was doing fiber prices  went down speeds went up.  It's a shame that they've just I mean Atlanta, I guess lost  out because they were the next I think they were the next city  and Google just seems it backed off completely.

I once had somebody that was working on big data  analytics sit down and show me all the information they had  on the people that were playing their game and they would  actually tailor the return rate on the loot boxes for how  much they thought that person would spend.  What I want to see is like I'm an adult and I'm just going  to own it.  I am the whale that these people look for when they're  trying to market these games.  I do buy loot boxes.  I buy, you know, I buy gold.  I will do time speed up items.  It's just it's a vice of mine.  But I think that they need to be upfront with the odds for  people.  It really worries me how they are marketing these mechanics  towards children because like I'm over 18.  I can make a poor informed choice there.  But like a child, it's just a fact that many parents are  having kids.  They're making these purchases on their bank accounts and  it just it seems very exploitive to me.

Actually, I read a story that's a little scary.  I was on the front page of Techmeme this week about a Chinese  company that has managed to...  They're a logistics company.  I think they're kind of like JD.  What is it called?  JD something.  They're like an Amazon, a smaller Amazon.  They've reduced the size of their workforce to four people  while sending out something like 200,000 orders a day.  Automation.  Automation.  I think this is what's coming.  Now, this is in China.  And as we know, the president is very interested in making  China great again.  So I'm sure he has a plan.  There's Shanghai fulfillment Center ships 200,000 orders a  day with four humans.  And by the way, the humans aren't doing any shipping.  They're just there to service the robots.  JD says it's objective is not to eliminate workers, but to  get faster and more reliable.  And then eliminate workers.  No, they say they're going to shift warehouse people to  other jobs.  But really, come on.

Transcript:  I was talking to a woman yesterday that had a job at an  Amazon distribution center right here in my district.  And it just is a matter of like being dangerous and you know,  like having the capacity to hurt people like you're essentially  running all over a football field sized warehouse all day  long.  I am amenable to the idea that you know, there are some jobs  that maybe robots would be better off doing.  The problem is when we look at this trend of our tax base  starting to shrink and shrink and shrink, which is why so  many smaller communities throughout America don't have  functional schools or towns because the tax base is just  eroded.  I really worried this trend is going to accelerate it.  So I agree with Bill Gates who put out a very thoughtful piece  a while back that basically proposed that the robot that  takes your job should pay your taxes for you.  That's kind of an interesting.

Transcript:  Yeah, you know, we've always taxed in this country.  We've never taxed production, right?  We've only taxed income.  Yep.  So taxing production, you know, I guess that's what a VAT tax  really is all about in a way, right?  Because value-added taxes in Europe and other countries, in  fact, I think we're one of the few developed nations that  doesn't have a value-added tax basically follow the production  of the good and the taxes applied at each stage in  production until it gets to the consumer so that you're  in effect taxing production.  That's I think what Bill Gates really is talking about.  Maybe he's definitely maybe secretly saying what we need  is a VAT tax.  Jeff Bezos is the richest man in the world.  He's already 40 billion dollars richer this year.  Compare that to the average Amazon worker who makes $12,000  a year.

I'm just waiting for the stories about people driving off  of bridges.  Never coming home.  Did anyone notice?  No, I didn't.  Actually, I saw the story and I immediately went to Apple Maps,  but I you know, I think it was only if you were trying to  get directions because Maps was working, but I couldn't get  directions.

I was supposed to run tapes of church services because it was  Sunday morning and I foolishly during the middle of a church  service said I just lie down and take a little nap.  And I woke up and the tapes going.  It had run out.  We got knows how but the thing that the epiphany for me was  that not one line was lit up on the phone.  Nobody even noticed.

No, the company has launched a pilot project called get this  hands off the wheel.  It automates demand forecasting negotiating prices with vendors.  And of course because of the Amazon marketplace vendors can  bypass Amazon buyers sell their word direct wares directly.  This has been going on for a couple of years algorithms.  Originally could be overridden by humans if they thought there  was a mistake, but you know.  It's not really necessary anymore.  So now if you want to override the software you have to justify  it.  You have to explain.  Neil Ackerman a former Amazon executive told Bloomberg computers  know what to buy and when to buy when to offer a deal and when  not to these algorithms taking thousands of inputs and always  running smarter than any human.

I'm be interested Brianna when you get to Washington and by  the way, yes, we will be there on January 3rd 2019 for your  inauguration when you get sworn in in the Congress.  I'm looking forward to that the hundred 18th Congress when we  go though, I'm not going to bring my cell phone because I  get apparently there 40 more than 40 stingrays in Washington  many of them outside of embassies government offices and  it turns out when John Kelly currently chief of staff at the  White House was serving as the Secretary of Homeland Security  his phone was hacked BuzzFeed via FOIA request found out  Kelly wrote in an email that his personal email had been  hacked.  Stingrays are no joke.  Yeah, as we discussed Kelly wrote my folks are nervous about  the emails you send and ask that you no longer include them on  any postings then there is the there is hacking which one of  my own personal accounts has suffered recently.  I do almost everything now by phone or face to face, you know  phones not much.  Yeah, Politico had reported that Kelly used a compromised  smartphone for months.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And there is significant evidence that we've written about  and in other news outlets have written about that some of  these stingrays were Chinese and this was right before the  president met with the North Korean leader last week.  These aren't all White House stingrays or US government  stingrays.  Some of these are from foreign actors and we are seeing an  escalation in foreign cyber war that seems hyperbolic to most  consumers but we inside Taika of course know that hacking is  real but it is an escalation of hacking and these these are  attacks by foreign actors or by surrogates of foreign actors  directed at political or high-level business targets with  the intent of undermining communications and trust in  critical infrastructure.  This is very serious from this picture.

It's been five months without having the phone checked by  security experts.  He has two phones one equipped only with Twitter.  And preloaded with a handful of news sites and the other  capable only of making calls.  I don't know how that makes it more secure.  But anyway, normally the president would hand over his  White House phone every 30 days to be examined for hacking  and other suspicious activities.

So remember when you got last couple of weeks ago, May 25th  was GDPR became law the week before that lots of email,  you know, we're changing our privacy policy.  Well turns out a lot of that email was now GDPR says if  somebody bought something from you, you don't have to have  their permission to send them email.  But if they just showed interest or they sign up for a mailing  list, you got to get their express permission.  So a lot of those emails were asking you is it okay if we  keep sending you newsletters, but you just ignored them.  I just ignored them so they can't.  This is from a great policy.  I love it.

Transcript:  There is there is a downside to spam in the GDPR though, and  it should be said that almost everyone have spoken with at  least in business technology is is very supports the GDPR,  but I talked to IBM security last month and they said we can  see expect to see a short spike in spam in large part because  of the who is database and then many people in the infosec  community would use who is and other similar tools to track  down IPs that were were spamming and it was one of the  first things you would go to because it was very easy to  do just blacklist the IP address and use automation to  blacklist lots of IP addresses and it cut down on the amount  of spam that we saw over the last half decade or so and and  what his name is Caleb Barlow and and he's a GDPR expert at  IBM security and he said well this actually kind of in the  short term in the very short term hurts this the anti-spam  initiative because now without these tools spammers will move  around a lot more freely and use IPs and and hack domains to

We're take a little break come back with our final thoughts  final words. What a great panel you guys have been fantastic  this week our show brought to you by last pass. Now I don't  have I probably don't have to tell you about last pass. I  hope I don't 33,000 businesses including ours use last pass  to manage and secure our company's passwords. We started  using last pass when an engineer who no longer works here  thought it was really too inconvenient to remember all the  passwords to our website and our e-commerce stuff and so he  just made a web page with all the passwords and posted it  and we've a little perturbed when I found out and that's when  we started using last pass Enterprise. It's the password  vault secures every password protected entry to your business.  If you think about it, you've got passwords all over your  business that can make a huge huge difference if somebody  were to get it 81% of breaches are caused by weak passwords.  You know, I was just thinking I think my Twitter password  is you're fired. I better change that last pass protects  every password in your business without slowing down your  employees from easy onboarding to password auto-filled  automated security reports last pass makes it easy for  businesses to take control of passwords and reduce the  threat of breach. We have had no problem since we started  using it. We require two-factor which is a big feature of  last pass Enterprise. I really like that every employee gets  their own secure vault for managing passwords. You have  complete control over not only the master passwords, but  access to specific devices and location. You can enable  password resets. It password sharing is great because you  completely control who has rights to which password keeps  our data secure. And of course everything at last pass is  encrypted with AES 256 bit encryption prevents man-in-the-middle  attacks. There's a last pass for everybody last pass premium  for personal use. We use last pass families at home and I  have for years last pass teams if you're a smaller business  for 50 or less or last pass Enterprise, which is what we  use. In fact, we love last pass so much. We actually give  it as a benefit to employees. When you when you work here  you get a get a free copy of last pass for yourself, right?  John you use it Karsten you use it now. Are you using two  factor? Yes, Karsten. Yes, John. Yes, you guys a plus gold  stickers for you both at working at home fix your password  woes with last pass the number one most preferred password  manager. I use it. I started using when Steve Gibson  interviewed the founder and looked at all this all the  source code and everything you got a complete look at last  pass and said yeah thumbs up. This is it Steve uses it. I  use it and I have for years learn more about last pass at  last pass.com slash twit. This is the way to secure yourself  online last pass.com slash twit choose the product is right  for you. We use Enterprise last past does not have the  problem. I'm really upset that PGP has this week. We've there  was a PGP issue open PGP issue a couple of weeks ago and  now we've learned that PGP signing has been broken for  years. It's a decades old bug that allows anybody's booth  anybody's signature. I use GNU Privacy Guard to sign all my  emails so that you know a that I wrote it and be that it  hasn't been changed since I wrote it turns out not so good.  The good news is this flaw which is CV 2018 12020 was fixed  before it went public. So that's the good news is a word  should go out though. If you're using open PGP or GNU Privacy  Card get the update.  GPG has been updated in 2.2.8 and NIGMAIL 2.07 GPG tools  2018.3 Python GNU PG 0.4.3 all fixed.

One I wrote a story about who was a migrant who was stuck in  Sudan and he had to sell a kidney or be make bombs for ISIS.  So their situation is not great.  But what they they did do is understand the fundamental  concepts of privacy and privacy of thought privacy of communication  and why that enhances not just democracy because we weren't  there to teach democracy but why that enhances their agency  and ability to be humans and if you live in a repressed society  or if you live in any society when we cannot think and form  thoughts privately when we cannot communicate privately it  suppresses our our own ability to act within our society  and be change agents.

Transcript:  Yeah, and I honor your attempt to spread the word on that.  I think that's what that was really a good thing to do and  these people are whose lives are at risk.  Yeah, really really do need to do the best they can learn this  stuff.  Another bad thing that happened to the Internet on Monday if  you're in if you're in Tanzania in Tanzania all bloggers and  online for forums were told to suspend immediately or face  criminal prosecution if they hadn't registered back in March  Tanzania the Tanzanian Communications Regulatory Authority  decided to make a compulsory for bloggers and owners of other  online forums like YouTube channels to register with the  government and pay up to $900 for a license which is a lot  when you consider the per capita income in Tanzania is slightly  below $900 a year.  So a number of forums shut down on Monday anyone convicted of  defying the new regulations faces a fine of $2,200 in  imprisonment for a year or both.  So just another place where free speech is not encouraged.  And if you're in Canada, you might be a little concerned that  the random immigration lottery uses an Excel spreadsheet.  Which is not random because it's a pseudo random number  generator.  I think this is an example again Brianna Wu of how you can  explain to Congress what pseudo means.

In fact, the times has been so bad the programmers could  reverse engineer the results a team of cryptographers at the  University of Haifa were able to predict the numbers Excel  would generate by determining the initial values is working  with you could reverse engineer it.  So probably not the best thing for an immigration lottery.  That was yeah, I can you know, we can get you a good random  number generator Father Robert will build you one.  I'll be great.  Yeah.  Oh and here's some you know what people really bash the  president, but I have sometimes I think he's got things,  right Trump has ordered the government to stop work on the  y2k bug.

He is really pushed towards moving more government databases  onto the cloud.  Now, you know, it's a mix bag or Jared.  Maybe that's just continuity of policy Trump administration.  This is the one good thing I could say about that and you  know moving things to the cloud.  It does give it.  It's like one central location where it can be attacked but  you know, sometimes more modern systems.  Yeah, definitely.  Yeah, there's not really any government agency that is  responsible for code auditing and making sure that systems  are secure for many areas of the federal government.  So I think that's been a step forward and I think you said

Transcript:  Okay.  Bye Dan.  Thank you so much.  I appreciate it.  Thank you guys.  Take care.  Elizabeth Holmes Theranos, of course, we mentioned it briefly  earlier.  We had a great triangulation interview with the Wall Street  Journal reporter John Kerry Rue.  Was that last Friday with Megan Maroney about his really good  reporting that he did really blowing the lid off the Theranos  scam.  I think we could safely say that was a scam, scammed a lot  of money out of investors, but more importantly maybe out of  the US military, out of independent drug stores.  There's some serious fraud that went on and now criminal  charges have been filed against Elizabeth Holmes, the founder  and CEO and her number two executive Sonny Balwani.  Yeah.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I have to say, it's not our job to determine who is innocent  or guilty.  You know, that is up for a jury to decide.  But I can think of almost no one in America that needs to go  in front of a jury and answer for some of these allegations  as much as Elizabeth Holmes.  I mean, it's stunning everything from running blood tests  and having no quality control, lying to Safeway, lying to  drug stores, lying to the United States military, marketing  a glue robot as a blood test device.  I mean all this stuff.  If you read the book, it is it is it's just jaw dropping page  after page.  You cannot believe it and I am.  I don't understand her end game was.

Transcript:  I don't know.  What was her plan?  Like this is just kicking the can down the road.  How what did she think was going to happen?

Start time: 7415.72
End time: 7439.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think she believed she could keep putting off regulators  looking at the science until she actually had a product that  worked.  And I think she just came to believe all the things she was  selling to people.  I think it's you know, it's a something for a psychologist  to diagnose not me.  But it's I will say the allegations in the book bad blood

Start time: 7439.88
End time: 7445.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 7445.94
End time: 7454.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, it certainly seems to me that it was clear to her and  them very early on that this was not going to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But you always wonder that when you heard about Bernie Madoff.  Yeah, what did he think was going to happen?  Right.  Yeah, I mean, I guess that's how long he was kicking the can  down the road for years decades.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's a good point on artists be conning.  I guess I just thought I just it seems to me like there was  a pivot point where she decided no longer.  Am I even attempting to make this real?  I'm just trying to to survive the wool over.  Yeah, pull the wool over people's eyes as long as possible.  And I just don't understand.  I guess I guess at a certain point you feel cornered and you  just trying to survive but it is a incredible story that seems  unreal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I have to say this it it it is so insulting to me for  all the women in tech and engineering.  They're out there getting it done every day going unrecognized  game studios and major companies like Facebook really  talented women for her to come in and just so comport herself  with such recklessness and there's a part of bad blood where  she's really caught on the ropes.  The press is starting to go after Theranos and she tries to  come forward.  She proposes like talking about sexual assault in college as  a PR strategy to kind of shift the public narrative and claim  that these attacks on her are due to sexism and to attack  John Kerry you for being a sexist and that is it is such  an incredible disservice to women that are really struggling  with this to have a someone that from all accounts seems to  be a con artist to to weaponize that it's so offensive to me.

Transcript:  And just one last kind of a public service announcement.  I'm probably the last person who remembers Metafilter remember  Metafilter.  I do go there still around it was you know in the in the hay  day of the early days before Google.  It was a great site to go to and find out about stuff before  long before reddit or dig.  Unfortunately, they're losing money at $8,000 the rate of  $1,000 a month.  They've attempted to monetize through ads that did not work.  So if you are a Metafilter fan and I still am might be worth  checking it out and seeing what we can do to help maybe  sponsorships.  I don't know.  But yeah, it may just be the end of the end of an era these  things happen for Metafilter but it was it was it still is a  great place to go and and read stuff about the internet.  Thank you so much for being here Brianna Wu.  I put in a little bit towards your election in the in the  fall.  I hope that's not a conflict of interest.  I don't think so.  No, I mean I'm a fan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just going to be honest with you the overwhelming majority  of people that support me are tech people because we're talking  about the policies that they care about.  So, you know, that's it's very interesting because when I'm  running in the district I talk about wealth and equality and  health care costs and housing and affordability and mass  transportation which is broken but you know really any  politician has to find a base to fundraise from and for me  because we're raising on issues like privacy and net neutrality  and encryption and you know all these engineering issues.  I sleep so well at night Leo because this is this is stuff  that should have a place right.
