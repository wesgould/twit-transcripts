End time: 227.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  She's also the host of our new photography show, Mostly Photo.  But you crowd surfed last night at the Dignation party. I said I would never do it again.  And then Kevin, he's a little rabble rouser. He got them chanting, Leo, Leo.  We had to do it.  And so I'm standing there next to you and I said, hey, I'll do it if you'll do it.  And she said she would. Which is brave because women don't usually crowd surf.

Start time: 228.04
End time: 230.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, I thought it'd be a first, you know?

Start time: 230.82
End time: 267.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It was a first. We got the Universal database, record database for longest crowd surf,  first co-ed crowd surf, and biggest crowd crowd surf.  Because we had five people, Kevin and Alex, you and me, Brian Brushwood and David Prager.  That's like six people.  And by the way, there weren't enough people to hold us all.  It was a bumpy ride.  They kept you suspended, but I'm going up and down and up and down.  My pants almost came off. I'm sure Alex Albrecht lost his pants.  Oh my God.  Kind of crowd surfing you.  I'm never doing that again.  I thought naked next year, naked crowd surfing.

Transcript:  I was suggesting what Leo should do this year, up last year,  was to get a twit tattoo on his ass.  He wouldn't do it.  The crowd surfing.  I have no idea why he wouldn't do it.

Start time: 283.28

Transcript:  So, you know, there is news this week.  There's a lot of news this week.  There was a pop-up store selling the iPad, too.  I want to talk about that.  But as long as we've got Peter and Ryan here,  I think I really ought to put you guys on the spot.  Big story coming out of Engadget.  The editor-in-chief, Joshua Topolsky, who was on this show last week,  and his partner, Nile Patel, both quitting Engadget.  He's an editor-at-large like you are, Ryan.  What the hell does that mean?

Start time: 316.68
End time: 317.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's an honorary title.

Start time: 317.88
End time: 322.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah.  So did he leave in disgrace?  Apparently not.  What happened?

Start time: 323.18
End time: 341.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it looks like, you know, I mean, I'm not there anymore.  So I can't say for sure.  But you must have some insight.  Yeah, well, I mean, both of us at one point left Engadget, left AOL.  Yeah, I mean, it just looks like things weren't super amazing at AOL.  And, you know, he had to do his thing, and me, as well.

Start time: 341.48
End time: 355.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Two things happened that might have been triggering events.  One is they allowed Mike Errington to go unchallenged,  really slamming Engadget.  Mike, of course, runs TechCrunch, which is a sister blog on AOL.  And that's got to have stung a little bit.  Right, Peter?

Start time: 355.34
End time: 370.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not sure that had anything to do with it, to be honest.  You don't think so?  No, I mean, I think it might have been frustrating.  You know, I think that the sheer bureaucracy that there is at AOL,  I think that was probably the biggest factor rather than, you know,  TechCrunch or anything like that.

Start time: 370.70
End time: 372.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Or how about having to work for Ariana Huffington?

Start time: 372.88
End time: 374.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think that was a factor either.  That not either.

Start time: 374.84
End time: 378.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  When I asked Joshua last week, I said, how's it working for Ariana?  He was a little equivocal.

Start time: 379.22
End time: 394.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, technically, as of last week, it hadn't begun yet.  Yeah, she hasn't started working there yet.  Yeah, the deal didn't close until this last week.  So now officially, but I don't know.  I mean, I think Engadget is going to do fine under Ariana.  It doesn't hurt Engadget.  No, I don't think so.  Really?

Start time: 394.93
End time: 406.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  You agree, Jeff Jarvis?  Yeah, I do.  There's a lot of controversy about the AOL way,  which was a large PowerPoint that leaked to Business Insider that just  mechanized the whole thing.  We've heard about content farms.  This is the content factory.

Start time: 406.86
End time: 410.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It was AOL basically saying content doesn't matter, just search results.

Start time: 410.80
End time: 441.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Here's how many pieces you got to do.  Here's how long they have to be.  Here's how much traffic you have to get.  I interviewed Tim Armstrong at CUNY, my university, this week.  And I asked him about this.  I said, is the AOL way now the Ariana way?  And he stood by the AOL way.  And his argument was, I'll be curious to hear what you think of this,  his argument was basically that it's just trying to make everybody's job easier  because it's more efficient.  Everybody else has two more things.  And he's trying to systematize it more for their benefit.

Start time: 441.76
End time: 463.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, whatever you think about that document and the AOL way and what that  represents for content, I think it is worth noting that that does not apply to  Engadget.  That kind of thing has never applied to Engadget.  The way that we set it up when we brought Engadget to AOL was that AOL could never  touch Engadget editorially.  And that holds to today.  Yeah, AOL has been-  So there's crap to deal with, but not that.

Start time: 463.90
End time: 469.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  AOL has never interfered with editorial at all at Engadget.  And that's not why anyone left, really.

Start time: 471.62
End time: 481.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  But if it were just Joshua or Justinie Life, maybe I would credit that.  But them both leaving at the same time, that seems more significant.

Start time: 482.72
End time: 504.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No?  A startup?  I mean, I can't speak for them, ultimately.  And I think they said their piece on the matter.  But yeah, I mean, look, it's a grind.  Blogging like that is a grind.  It is-  Gina's nodding.  I can't even express.  I mean, you really have no life.  It's much harder than it looks.  Yeah.  I had no life until I quit Engadget.  And even now, I don't have that much of a life.

Start time: 504.70
End time: 513.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're actually, they left together.  So they're going to follow your model with the vowels this time.  So it will start EAE to match your GDGT.  That's possible.  That would be great.

Start time: 513.82
End time: 515.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We already know the trademark on that.

Start time: 515.48
End time: 520.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I was wondering if maybe they'd contacted you.  I mean, it sounded like they were going somewhere.

Start time: 521.96
End time: 528.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, we always talk.  But what we're doing and what Engadget does is very different.  We're not a news site.

Start time: 528.80
End time: 533.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You're not all about content.  You're about liking a gadget, reviewing a gadget that-

Start time: 533.33
End time: 536.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, we're a social web app around products.  Yeah.

Start time: 537.06
End time: 563.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  It's a pretty different experience.  Right.  Right.  Of course, it'd be great if you had a gadget blog  to go along with that.  The world has enough gadget blogs.  All right.  All right.  I don't know.  It's the kind of thing we all gossip about.  But it is an interesting shift after this big move  with the HuffPo and what AOL is doing.  It looks a little shaky for AOL to see two of the biggest  stars of their blog empire.

Start time: 564.02
End time: 583.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All these sites have turnover.  I mean, how many editors has Gizmodo gone through?  All right.  It's natural that it's a very high-intensity job,  being an editor of a top blog, whether it's a tech blog  or a non-tech blog, it can be a pretty hard job.  And people burn out.  I mean, that's pretty natural.  Well, yeah, people burn out.  Yeah.

Start time: 583.96
End time: 588.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  People burn out.  OK, people burn out.  I'm tired.  I'm out of here.  I like the main lately.

Start time: 588.36
End time: 589.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not everyone has Leo's stamina.

Start time: 589.98
End time: 590.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Right.  I burned them out.

Start time: 591.48
End time: 599.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  No, you didn't burn them out.  But you know, they're more in the,  he's more in the public eye than I think he used to be.  I mean, he's been on your show quite a lot.

Start time: 599.64
End time: 602.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  A lot of credit goes to the Engadget podcast,  which is a great podcast.  Yeah, that's true.

Start time: 603.40
End time: 616.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  I mean, no, I'm not diminishing that by any means  that he does amazing there.  But I think all of that together is kind of putting them more  in the public eye than when before they just left.  And it was no big deal.  Well, I don't know.

Start time: 616.52
End time: 621.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I think when Ryan and Peter left, people knew that they left.  That was a big story when they left, frankly.

Start time: 621.60
End time: 629.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it got covered, I guess.  But we didn't leave because we hated AOL.  I mean, AOL's an investor in our new company.  Yeah, it's time to move on.

Start time: 629.40
End time: 629.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  That's all.

Start time: 629.94
End time: 631.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So we left on really good terms.

Start time: 631.08
End time: 635.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Tina, when you left Lifehacker, was it like a sigh of relief?  Like, oh, god.

Start time: 635.98
End time: 662.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a tough job, just like these guys say.  And you get to a point where you're just like,  I love this job and I love this site,  but I just need to move on and do a different thing  and have a different lifestyle.  It really is a grind.  And I imagine I was pretty removed from this.  But I mean, I think it seems like Engadget kind of maintained  their small, scrappy startup even being within AOL.  And things happen.  And you just get to a point where you're like,  I want to do something new.  I wouldn't be surprised if that was the whole story  and not this other stuff.  I'm so disappointed.  All right.

Start time: 662.30
End time: 675.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Sorry.  We'll manufacture some dirt.  Moving on, iPad 2.  Show of hands, how many of you got in line at the pop-up store?  One?  Well, you have to.  No, I did not at the pop-up store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He's selling me on it.  Yeah.  No, I like it.  It's adorable.  Where'd you get the case?  Where'd you get the case?  Oh, just passed by.

Start time: 703.12
End time: 705.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So they actually sell cases for it.  It's not a magical case.

Start time: 705.78

Start time: 710.38
End time: 724.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  No, it doesn't matter.  Lisa Bettany, you have one.  With a magical revolutionary case.  You almost have to buy that.  It's kind of like, I think it's Steve Jobs' retirement plan,  like the $29 profit in that case.  Also, it's not a case.

Start time: 724.70
End time: 727.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's just a cover.  It's not even a case.  It's just a cover.  The back is totally closed.

Start time: 727.94
End time: 731.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't call it a case.  They call it a smart cover.  They do.  Also, he's doing this information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I believed her.  Someone close to Apple.  Someone close to Apple.  The story we'll read.  Leo publishes it on the new blog run by Topalocely.  She was standing right next to the store.

Start time: 781.04
End time: 791.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  She said there are only two stores  with this many iPad 2s, the Fifth Avenue store  and the Pop-Up store in South by.  And there was still a line this morning.  And every other store is sold out.  So I believe that.

Start time: 791.66
End time: 807.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Mid-morning, the last thing they had  was white 64 gig Wi-Fi only.  Who would buy that?  I think I sold that.  All the Apple guys were standing outside  with their hands in their pockets when I came by now.  Now what happens to a Pop-Up store

Start time: 807.92

Start time: 857.20
End time: 865.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I was surprised Apple did not put a great camera in this.  It seemed like they intentionally put a bad one.  It's not terrible.  It's so bad.  Why did they put such a crappy camera in there?  Because they could.

Start time: 865.96
End time: 867.32

Start time: 870.56
End time: 876.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_14

Start time: 877.58
End time: 892.43

Transcript:  It does feel like Apple didn't go as far as they could in this.  That they just went a little bit improved,  so that there's a little room to get.  It's like me crowd surfing.  You hold back just a little bit so that you  have something for next year.  Is that what happened?

Start time: 893.66
End time: 903.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I actually think that maybe they  made the first one a little thicker than it needed to be.  Yeah.  Just so they could make a second one.  Well, if you actually open up the first one,  there is a little bit of extra room in that case.

Transcript:  Here's what I've been saying.  I've been saying, if you have an iPad 1,  feel no need to upgrade unless you, for some reason,  you have to have a camera, a crappy camera.  Or thin this matters so much.

Start time: 921.94

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But you have to understand that a lot of people use  these devices, like families use them, to FaceTime each other  and to use it as, you know, and that's something that,  like a camera won't do.  I guess if you really wanted to FaceTime.  Yeah, or Skype.  I mean, that's something that I use all the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  See, I'm with you, Callie.  I don't believe people do it.  Not that many.  I just don't believe people do it.  But actually, it's more than I even would have thought.  I thought one person would raise their hand.  I use it once.  How many people use it?  Not Skype.  FaceTime.  When you travel.  And you use it instead of Skype?  Why instead of Skype?  It's easier to talk to your wife,  because she doesn't have to know how to use Skype.  It's on her phone.  It's just a phone call.  That's what they do.  Yeah, that makes sense.  That's what they do.  That's how they get you.  That's what they do.

Start time: 1032.14
End time: 1050.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think a lot of them are pretty excited.  They have a lot of the same consternation over whether  they should buy a new one if they already have one.  And we had one guy on the site who started a discussion.  He was just sort of like, my iPad's obsolete.  And I was like, well, you can still use it.  It still works.

Transcript:  I haven't seen too much on that.  All right.  There's always going to be a little of that.  It's pretty mind boggling.  Yeah.  I mean, there's definitely like, you're never going to  get something where it's manufactured, first run,  hundreds of thousands of units, and not a  single one has an issue.  How many do you think they sold?  How many have they sold?  It's got to be hundreds of thousands.  I mean, it's got to be millions.  What's that, a million?

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  You know, I saw some reports that they expect Apple to get  one million within a couple weeks, as opposed to the 28  days that it took last year to get to a million sold.  And I just find it funny, because last year we were all  like, it only took you 28 days to get to a million.  And now this year we're going to be, 28 days?

And if you use Gmail, I've never been particularly happy  using Gmail on the iPad.  No, it's the best.  Having to do it in the browser.  But Honeycomb was rushed out.

Transcript:  Yeah, I've got to tell you a little bit about GoToMeeting.  Our friends from Citrix are here.  Is Michael in the house?  Michael Guarneri, is he here?  I was sitting somewhere in the back.  They are such great people.  They've now, there's Michael.  There's Michael.  I was just going to tell him about GoToMeeting.  Works great on the iPad.  You got GoToMyPC.  You don't have to say anything.  Just stand there and look pretty.  Yeah, his mouth is full.  He's actually eating.  This is your ad, dude.  You paid for this ad, man.  GoToMeeting is, I use it actually.  We use it all the time in the office.  We don't have to do an ad for it because we  know how good it is.  We love it.  It saves time.  It saves money.  It saves you stress from business travel.  Look, if I had to fly to all my meetings, I would not be here.  I'd be flying somewhere right now.  Fortunately, GoToMeeting, especially on the iPad,  is truly awesome.  I can hold meetings online for sales presentations,  for product demos, or training sessions,  collaborating on documents.  It's about any kind of conference call.  From my friends at Citrix, I always  say your name when you eat something.  Just keep biting.  $49 a month, as many meetings as you want, as long as you want.  And it does include free voiceover, internet,  and telephone teleconferencing.  Now here's what you do.  Go to meeting.com and use the promo code TWIT.  And it's 30 days free, right, Mike?  That's right.  30 days free.  Go to meeting.com, promo code TWIT.  And one of the things I'm really happy about with our friends  at Citrix is they realize that the key  to getting an intelligent, geek audience to use the product  is to let you try it.  They're really willing to put their butt on the line  and say, all right, we're not going to sell you on anything.  Just try it free for 30 days.  If you like it, it's yours.  You buy it.  If not, no hard feelings.  That means they believe in their product,  and they believe in you.  That they're not trying to pull one over on you.  They believe in you.  And they know if you see something you like,  that you will buy it.  And so we just really thank them for all their support, Michael.  We really appreciate it.  Go to meeting.com, offer code TWIT.  Now you were all supposed to leave during that.  No, you don't have to go.  You can stay.  But you guys, if you want to go, you can go.  How long are we going?  We got more people.  Why don't you take off?  Thank you.  All right.  Thank you so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, we were talking about Tepolsky.  That's a big story, but apparently nothing to say here.  What about the Twitter?  We were talking about two Twitter decisions, the one  about the developers, where the folk are saying,  we're changing the API.

Transcript:  Twitter wants control back.

Start time: 1492.26
End time: 1497.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Let's start with that one.  Twitter's telling people, don't write third-party applications  anymore.  We want all of them.

Start time: 1497.96
End time: 1515.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A little strongly worded.  They want third-party applications,  but not that duplicate anything they already have.  Which is everything.  They're sort of pulling the rug out of them.  Well, they also don't want anything  that confuses these friends.  Well, Brian had a really good perspective on this,  because Brian's got an application that would take advantage  of Twitter that he wants to use.

Start time: 1515.44
End time: 1538.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  The whole afterlife.me project, the whole idea  of tweeting after you're dead, is going to rely very heavily  on our ability to access the Twitter API.  And if they're all of a sudden, now, granted,  they're not saying that they're going  to yank the plug on the type of thing we're doing.  But now that they have a history of changing all the rules out  of nowhere, it sort of has a chilling effect  on my interest on developing a new application,  taking advantage of the API.

Start time: 1538.48
End time: 1550.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think they're changing rules, though.  They're just saying to developers,  if you're going to start building a Twitter app,  just don't build a client that just  does what the standard Twitter client does,  which is good advice for the developer.  But wait a minute, how is that not changing rules?

Start time: 1554.38
End time: 1565.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Which we've already seen before.  So much of Twitter's success has been completely organic.  We were talking about during Tech News Today  how the at reply was not created by Twitter,  it was created by the right hands.  Right, right.  About the retweet was created by the right hands.

Start time: 1565.24
End time: 1570.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they want developers to innovate  in more creative ways than just a better client.  I feel like we've got to explore.

Start time: 1570.92
End time: 1585.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Twitter made its bones here at South by Southwest in 2007,  one of the things that made Twitter  was that they had a strong API.  Exactly.  And they encouraged people to develop  third party apps for Twitter when they couldn't.  So they're dumping them.  They're pulling up the ropes, they're saying.

Start time: 1586.22

Transcript:  The full disclosure is I have a nano investment  in Bill Gross's Uber Media, and he spooked him, I think,  by buying up 20% of Twitter traffic and clients.  But there are all kinds of new things  you can do with Twitter clients.  Wait a minute, wait a minute.

Start time: 1599.21

Start time: 1602.36
End time: 1614.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Of all the traffic through Twitter clients, yes.  What clients is that?  It's a tweet deck.  He's about to buy a tweet deck.  He has Echo Phone.  He has, I should know this, but I forget the other.  Well, that's interesting.

Start time: 1614.74
End time: 1616.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  So do you think that that's what this is in response to?

Start time: 1617.12
End time: 1632.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Well, that's why they cut off his clients  because they were in violation of all that.  But he's talking to them, he wants to work with them.  I don't speak for him or his company at all.  But no reason it can't be a friendly relationship.  But that may spook him a little bit, I don't know.  But there is innovation to be had even in the clients.

Start time: 1633.10
End time: 1638.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, definitely.  Twitter wants developers to do something new  that they're not doing.  And you can do that with a client.  Facebook did the opposite.

Start time: 1638.36
End time: 1658.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  When Facebook brought out its platform,  it killed its own apps like Courses,  which my son had been built.  And they said the public's going to do a better job,  developers will do a better job, and staff will.  Now Twitter, which grew through this kind of development,  is now turning around.  I just think it's a...  It's arrogant.

Start time: 1659.66
End time: 1708.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so here's another perspective.  One, I don't think they've completely turned around.  I think they've recognized the benefit.  They're trying to manage it.  They've got this big beast, they're huge now.  People are giving them millions of dollars.  They're doing award shows.  And from the perspective, so Twitter sells now.  They sell promoted accounts, they sell promoted trends,  they sell recommendations.  Not recommendations and algorithms,  but they sell products that someone buys  with the expectation they're going to reach a Twitter user.  And until very recently, that only worked on Twitter.com.  Now it works in the Twitter official mobile app for Android,  and for iPhone, and for iPad.  So the addressable audience,  if you buy something from Twitter, gets bigger.  And if you have some other client out there  that's not a part of the Twitter sanctioned client system,  they're not going to see the ad.  This goes to Dave Weiner's point.  It's like having another cable company  just sitting off to the side, not caring the ad.  This goes to Dave Weiner's point,

Start time: 1708.92
End time: 1717.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  that we're stuck with them,  and we should create a federated shadow to Twitter.  I agree.  Because we are...  They got us right here.  Yeah, because they're not selling your own...

Start time: 1718.16
End time: 1730.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're not cutting off all the developers.  They're saying the Tweetdex, the Seesmix,  they can keep going.  They're grandfathered in.  They're just saying, we have enough.  And they're starting to be too much confused.  You know what they're saying?  That's what they're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Well, I think they would love all those to go away.  I mean, I think really what they want it to do is,  just as you said, Baratunde,  if you don't have the promoted tweets,  if you don't have the dick bar,  if you don't have all the things we make money on,  we don't want you to stick around.

Transcript:  That's what supports them.  And if you think, if you're NBC,  and you buy a promoted tweet,  and 20% of Twitter users...  Don't see it.  ...and these other clients,  then what did you really buy?  And you need to get a discount.  This is the problem of not having your business model first.  That's really interesting.  So that's one.  And then the user interface,  having a uniform experience,  I think they actually do care about that.

Transcript:  Is this going to be the way startups work from now on,  where they grow, they scale based on the support  of the community,  but they don't have a Facebook kind of similar situation.  They grew because they made certain promises,  but then when it came time to make money,  they say, well, screw you,  we're going to do it our way,  because we need to make money.

Transcript:  That's the way everything has been.  That's the way television has been,  radio has been, anything in its infancy,  when there is no market,  when there is nobody following,  you do whatever you think is going to get you attention  and make you money,  which includes a lot of things  that we're doing right here on Twitter.  We play fast and loose with a lot of some of the small things  that technically are copyright violations.  Yeah, exactly.  But meanwhile, we're watching the entire face  of media change.  Hey, stop that.  See, exactly.  Stop that.  But we could do that now because we're young.  And when there's a point,  when there's a significant amount of money involved,  when there's a significant amount of monetary interest,  you have to restructure the rules.  And I'm not blaming them.  Now I will say that, unfortunately,  the Twitter thing seriously has a chilling effect,  I think, on developing new content.  I understand that they're doing kind of the Apple thing  of saying, look, don't duplicate functionality  that we already have with our apps.  That's essentially what they're doing right here.  But what I don't like is the precedent of them  having even once changed all the rules,  right from the beginning.  But Gina, you're okay with it.

Start time: 1850.72
End time: 1868.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm actually okay with it.  They didn't change the rules.  You wrote a Twitter app.  Yes, I wrote a Twitter app.  It's not a Twitter client, though.  It's an app that does other things with Twitter data,  which is what Twitter, the company, is trying to encourage.  And they're not killing existing third-party apps.  There's always gonna be the non-official Twitter app  that most of the people in this room are probably gonna use.  First they came for the Twitter clients.

Transcript:  I'll give you an example.  When I got the iPad 2, Andrew Stone, who writes Twitter later,  sent me a note saying, you gotta try it.  You can now tweet a video directly from Twitter later.  That's a nice feature.  Twitter doesn't have it in their client.  Is it okay for him to do that?  Because it's not a feature that they already have.  Yeah, I mean, I think that's something.

Start time: 1891.60
End time: 1929.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He's extending it.  That's an extra feature that you'd want.  Multiple accounts, that kind of thing.  But listen, most Twitter users,  mainstream Twitter users, are using their client,  their official client.  But I think the market for third-party apps  is for advanced users who want to manage six accounts  and that kind of thing.  And they're not killing those.  Ryan's email to the developer list,  it went out late on a Friday.  It seemed kind of shady.  But the way he worded it was,  and when a developer asks,  is a good thing to build for Twitter a client app,  the answer is no, right now.  Right now, starting to build a Twitter client  that just lets you tweet and get tweets.  This isn't some bad ideas.  It's obvious.

Transcript:  I think this is an example of a very young,  new way of doing business,  having its stumbling point, right?  It's not that the message is wrong.  If you're going to crowd source  and you're gonna do this,  eventually you're gonna mature  and you're gonna wanna consolidate.  You're gonna wanna say,  we want Retweet to work the same across everything.  We want less confusion.  We want to be able to sell the ads.  And there's a way to do that elegantly.  And Twitter is just stumbling a bit  in getting the message out.  It comes off inelegantly.  It comes off kind of churlish.

Transcript:  It's a classic case of channel conflict.  Right, and that's what all startups do go through,  is you think this is your world,  then you suddenly realize,  no, that's my world,  so I don't want anybody else in that.  Look at, you know, Amazon is big enough  that it can afford to publish books  competing with the publishers who now hate Amazon.  Right.  But they can do it.  But they could do it at the beginning.  Twitter is big enough that it can start to say,  no, no, no, no, that's ours.

When you were mine,  when no one knew about you,  when you were eating ramen,  when you smelled like bad things,  that's when you were the best.  Now that you have a house,  Tim Wu in his book,

It was free and open so it could reach critical mass.  But these things never stay free and open.  He said, just look at history time and time again.  Free and open, it's a cycle.  Open, closed, open, closed, open, closed.  He says the internet's gonna be closed.

Transcript:  That's our big issue.  It is not a public internet.  This is why I keep harping on the idea  that we have to have,  we the people of the internet,  sounds nice, doesn't it?  Ooh, a constitution.  We have to have principles  so that we can hold companies and governments  feet to the fire to say,  you're violating those principles.  And we aren't doing that.  We're just kind of going along,  and as Gina taught me,  hackers hack around and it's okay.  But then at some point, boom,  we're not gonna be able to do the things on the internet  that we wanna do.  And we're gonna have ourselves to blame too  because we didn't stand up  and determine what was right about the internet  and fight to keep it that way.

Transcript:  I think, Baratunde,  you said something half joking here.  You're gonna secede from the internet,  but isn't that the solution  is when the internet is closed,  you secede and you go to a different  data communication transfer way of transmitting  and you find a way to get the signal out around.  Well, and this is actually-  Gina says you're hackerriffing on it.

Start time: 2081.50
End time: 2112.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a hack thing.  This is one of those things where,  for much as Baratunde and I go back and forth,  obviously with you for more left leaning perspective  and me from a libertarian perspective,  it's like I want the greatest amount of freedom  for the greatest amount of people.  And I get in arguments with very intelligent people.  For example, my friend Andrew Main,  who's just not bothered by a bunch of  the encroaching government control of things  because he says technology will advance faster  than government regulation will advance.  So you will continue to get increased freedom  even though technically the letter of the law  is getting more and more red tape as far as you can see.

Transcript:  The Facebook, we mentioned Facebook earlier,  that back in the day, Facebook got a lot of popularity  in part because of the apps that people were making  on the platform and then they changed the rules  and upset people.  Facebook also has a history of buying companies  for the talent of companies that do good things  that they want to incorporate into their system.  I see Twitter doing the same thing.  Twitter's now in the business to make money.  People have been asking for years,  how is Twitter gonna make money?  Well, they've shown clearly  that they're intending to make money.  They don't want people competing with them  that are gonna take any money away from them.  And I see them buying companies and talent  that can help further their platform in a similar way.

Transcript:  Except that the network effect is really critical.  So the internet also supports monopolies  because if all your friends are on AIM  or all your friends are on Facebook  or all your friends are on Twitter,  it's very hard or all your searches are on Google,  it's very hard to move.  So there is a tendency to monopoly as well.

It's not insane there was a talk here at South By  about the idea that we don't have the right analogy yet.  Mark Davis from Microsoft was saying  we need a property analogy.  We don't own any of the internet.  We don't own anything on the internet.  We don't own our data, we don't own our servers.  Well, you do.  We don't own our pipes.  We don't own anything on the internet.  And so how do we get some piece of the internet that we own?  We take it back!

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter's very good at what they do  and they were very good at leveraging developers  into helping them figure out the stuff they did.  So this may be the weak cheek.  If developers get upset enough,  they may start to leave some of those things open  that they would have discovered for Twitter  and a competitor could move in and exploit them.  And I would also remind you, this idea,

Start time: 2368.28
End time: 2391.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  we have no, I don't think,  I'm not a complete student of history,  but I don't think we have any historical analogy  for something like this,  except for the fact that everything eventually dies.  Right, so the idea that Twitter's gonna be Twitter  and dominating this thing forever.  Either something else will come along  that is different and better than  and we'll look back at Twitter and be like,  what was that weird thing we did for four years?  And then we moved on to the next one.

You can either have the attitude of like,  we need to preserve and curate our Twitter  so that it's like the way we like it.  We need to be good stewards of our Twitter  because Twitter's the way it should be.  And then there's another group that's like,  hey man, internet change all the time.

Start time: 2420.60
End time: 2449.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well yeah, the other one was the justice  in the case about handing over information  ruled that because there was no content in the information  the government was asking Twitter to hand over  that they had no standing to challenge it.  Because when I go onto Twitter and I post  and I have a session time, I have no expectation of privacy.  And therefore the government doesn't need a warrant.  I can't remember the number,  but they only need that lesser level of standing  to request that information.  This is the wiretaps versus pen register issue.

Start time: 2451.28
End time: 2500.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  I've talked about this before.  In 2007 there were 2,000 wiretaps  because there's a high standard.  You have to get a court to approve a wiretap.  You can't do a phishing expedition.  You have to say this is what we're looking for.  But you can get a pen register  because there's no quote content.  A pen register means subject line to,  maybe not subject line, there's a debate there.  It means your GPS coordinates from your cell phone carrier.  That's not content.  And as a result, in 2007 when there were  2,000 wiretap requests,  there were eight million pen register requests.  All the wireless carriers have set up portals,  paid portals for law enforcement.  You pay a buck or two and I can say,  where was Tom Merritt the other night?  And it's free and there's no warrant.  There's no supervision.  There's no oversight.  And there's no transparency to Tom.  None at all.  In fact, there is.

Start time: 2501.16

Transcript:  Where were you the other night, Tom?  There is technical transparency

Start time: 2503.92
End time: 2524.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  because the Department of Justice by law  is supposed to report the number of pen registers  every single year.  They haven't done it in five years.  Wow. They just ignored the law.  So we don't even know how many there are.  There are at least, Sprint said there were eight million  in 2007, one carrier.  So this is something going on all the time.  And that's a very interesting precedent to say  there's no content in your tweet.

Start time: 2524.76
End time: 2537.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, we're saying this is a pen register request.  Since we're not asking for what was in the post,  we just wanna know when it was sent,  to whom it was sent, who's in the contact list.  We can get all the information we need out of that.  We don't need to know what they sent.  So is it like content?

Start time: 2538.60
End time: 2548.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I guess not.  Is it like a function or is it content?  I don't know.  It is a click.  But it is information.  But it is information.  It is information.  It should be our actions, our content.  But that's not the way the government's seeing it  because as always, they're not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's the other thing is they can go  then take all the information and figure out  what was in the post.  Because the posts are there in public.  They can use your client.  Right.  Does that apply to DMs as well?  Yeah.  Yeah, in other words, they can find out that DMs were sent  and to whom they were sent,  but not what was in the direct message.

Start time: 2576.60
End time: 2583.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_12

Transcript:  So Audible will give you two free audiobooks to try out,  two credits a month with a platinum plan.  This is nice because I tell you,  one of the things that happens with Audible,  as you already hear, is that you talk to somebody  who's an Audible fan, he says,  oh, you gotta listen to this,  and you gotta listen to this,  and pretty soon you gotta listen about,  as long as you're armed,  the books you gotta listen to. Absolutely.

Start time: 2769.52

Transcript:  Absolutely.  It's one of those things where it's infectious.  Each little piece of the puzzle,  once you get somebody else who's infected  with the Audible virus, I mean, it's just,  and what's great is that it's self-building,  because it's like something  that you're super passionate about.  You will just bring it up,  and instantly it'll remind somebody,  oh, but you gotta read this other book  in order to understand the context of the first book as well.  So what are you reading right now?  You know, I just finished  what might be the goofiest post-apocalyptic book  I've ever read. What's that?  The Hunger Games.  Anyone else read the Hunger Games?  Oh, no, all right.  One person apparently really likes it.  Right this way, Eileen's right here.  Right this way.  It is definitely filled with woman porn,  by which I mean, it's all about,  it's about a very, it's post-apocalyptic  about this girl who goes to a very rich society,  and half the passages are about how awesome the clothes are  and how great the food is.  But beyond that, I've now moved on  to Guns, Germs, and Steel.  So that's like a giant flip of the switch.

But I just find it, and by the way,  I've gotten a number of tweets from people saying,  isn't it seem a little self-indulgent  to gather in Austin and celebrate  the culture of the World Wide Web  when horrors are happening overseas in Japan?  And when you walk by that CNN bus,  CNN has a bus in the grill at CNN,  and all that's on their monitors is the tsunami.  Is the earthquake.

But unlike Haiti, this is a highly connected country  where they stayed connected.  And a few things happened.  One, I saw people on TV who said that as soon as it happened,  people were immediately on this,  because this is the way to tell the world  what's going on, your friends.  Not just the world, your friends.

Transcript:  And we also see that everyone has a TV camera.  Sure. Right?  So we've seen incredible documentation in this event.  Lots of video.  And a sense of what we never had.  You know, next, The Speed, Doc Searles wrote a great post  that basically, I'll paraphrase him,  that Twitter is to cable news as cable news was to TV.  Absolutely. Absolutely.  Cable news is now stale. Absolutely.  Stale as hell.  I get into the loop fatigue. Absolutely.  The same 12-hour-old video.  You don't know how old it is. Sure.  The current it is.  The other thing is, I think,  I've watched people on BBC being extremely,  I thought of Twitter.  I watched this guy on this BBC show called  World Have Your Say,  where the guys are just chatting the way we do.  Right.  It's changed this, I'm on TV now.  I'm gonna be stiff and inhuman.  No. You are, as you said, the future of TV.  And you see that.  Now, people are on there with their headsets  and they're telling them, this is what happened,  then that happened.  And it's very human.  We see a new TV.  So I think in the Japan story,  we see technology.  No, it didn't cause it.  You know, we'll go to that Twitter argument  about Iran and Egypt.  There were earthquakes before that,  but we see a huge impact of these connection tools  in how we learn about how people are using it,  all kinds of great things.

Start time: 3307.60
End time: 3331.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  How many of you first heard about it on TV or the radio?  Still some people.  Oh yeah.  It's clearly going, I mean,  that was 11 o'clock at night at California time  and I saw all of a sudden  a huge amount of traffic on Twitter.  I got a link to Al Jazeera so I could watch it live.  I got a link to NHK World so I could watch it live.  I was starting to see videos.  My wife ran into the bedroom to turn on CNN.  I stayed on my computer.

Start time: 3331.84
End time: 3348.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was talking about that on Tech News Today,  how I saw an All Things D post about it  when I was going through my RSS feeds  and that led me to immediately launch Al Jazeera English  to see what was happening in real time  and start looking at Twitter  to find out if there's anything I missed.  I never even thought about turning on the television  because I didn't need to.

Start time: 3348.74
End time: 3355.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  I think it's amazing that Al Jazeera English,  though you can't get it on TV,  is becoming not just Middle Eastern brand of news  but now for Japan you went to it.

Start time: 3355.86
End time: 3361.08

Start time: 3362.18
End time: 3383.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Exactly.  Out of habit, I had learned about the earthquake  and the impending tsunami on Twitter  and I turned on CNN because I wanted to see moving pictures  and after about half an hour I realized  I just want the CNN anchors to shut up  because they're getting the information from Twitter  and Al Jazeera and other sources online,  exactly how all of my friends on my Twitter stream are  and I just, I don't need their discussion.

Start time: 3383.56
End time: 3408.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, and so to take your analogy a bit farther,  it is true that Twitter is to cable news  as cable news was to network news  but that is not just referring  to the timeliness of the reports  and also I think speaks to the misinformation.  That was one of the things people dogged cable news about  is because it was up to the minute,  they're like, we're getting reports that this  and then they have to go back later and take back seats.  Same thing happens to a much bigger degree on Twitter.  You get a bunch of disinformation.

Start time: 3408.96
End time: 3439.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  But we expect that somewhat and again, I plugged on Twig,  I'm gonna mention it here.  I talked so fast, I got tons of tweets asking me  who the hell I said.  Andy Carvin, A-C-A-R-V-I-N from NPR  did incredible work with Tunisia and Egypt  and then he was finally kind of relaxing a little bit  because Libya was quiet for a day  and then boom, he wakes up and here's the earthquake.  And he zero to 60 in a half an hour,  he's been reporting spectacularly.  He's here in South Africa.  He's here in town.  On Twitter, on Twitter.  This is a new form of reporting

Start time: 3440.22
End time: 3445.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  which is to use Twitter to aggregate,  to curate, to report.  It's unbelievable.  And he adds journalistic value.

Start time: 3446.12
End time: 3480.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  He'll say, he'll find out people who are there  because I proposed something this week in my blog.  The hashtag doesn't work for these kinds of events.  I proposed a new convention of a witness tag  that you have, let's say, an exclamation point.  Japanese Quake versus hashtag Japanese Quake.  The hashtag is for discussion.  The exclamation point is for witnesses  so you know they're there.  I love it.  And how the hell it happens, I don't know.  But the point is you want to separate it up  because as soon as it happened,  it gets overloaded with people who,  with all good intention, are discussing it  like we all are and retweeting.  It's useless.  Just add the exclamation point at the end.

Start time: 3480.66
End time: 3482.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_14

End time: 3510.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  Oh yeah, yeah, both do.  But I think.  Hashbang on Twitter.  Hashbang. Hashbang, hashbang.  Don't get me started.  Andy adds value here because he also questions people.  He says, I don't know if this is true.  He gives caveats.  He does what a new kind of journalist does.  And it never ends in a story.  It's a constant flow of news.

Transcript:  You know what's interesting?  I mean, he's an NPR reporter.  Yes.  This has nothing to do really with NPR.  He has become a journalistic organ on his own.  Absolutely.  I talked to his boss yesterday, Kinsey Wilson,

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  We're working on that.  Well, and we've read so many science fiction stories  about people who in the future you follow a person  and their experiences live minute by minute.  And we're getting closer to that thanks to Twitter.  But for right now,  you're working within the established structure.  So he shouldn't quit.  I mean, not everybody needs to follow the Leo Laporte method  of creating your own network.  That's what I'm saying.  Not everyone needs to be so punk rock.

Transcript:  Part of what I'm looking at is,  how can my university bring some development talent,  we're talking soon,  about how to give him tools to improve what he does.  How can we examine what he's learned  about who's connected with whom  and how he learned to find the good person  who's really there because so-and-so knows it.  All these things.  And there's a new kind of journalism there  that I want to spread out elsewhere.  Because we think in journalism  that the atomic unit is the article.  Well, it's not necessarily.  It's not necessarily a story we tell.  Right.  It's adding value to the flow we see.

Transcript:  There's a certain laziness  to being a source-only reporter too,  that can creep in where you say,  all I have to do is state these five facts  and I have a story.  And you really don't.  You haven't done anything that helps anyone.  What Andy's doing is much more difficult,  which is I have to think and curate and weigh and decide,  that's a good source, I think that's true.  I'm gonna elevate that.  Listen.  And most importantly, it's living and breathing.

Start time: 3637.06

Transcript:  That'll be hot.  I'm drooling thinking about it.  I think my favorite story about Twitter and the earthquake  was I forget where this person was located,  but someone in the US heard about the earthquake on Twitter,  called their family in Japan,  before, you know, like just as it was starting to happen,  before the phone lines went down  and got to have this phone conversation with them,  before they became unable to be reached  while it was happening, literally five minutes into it.  Now, that was a great story.

Transcript:  Well, video is too.  I talked today, The Guardian had a session today,  and I was thinking about this.  There's a lot of talk.  Knight Foundation just gave a million dollars  to the Texas Tribune right here in Austin  and Bay Citizen in San Francisco to redo a CMS.  And the problem is news keeps on thinking internally,  that are reorganized internally.  We ought to be thinking externally  and give a dashboard to the public.  Here's what we know, here's what we don't know,  what do you want us to do, and so on and so forth.  So I think there are new tools to be invented here  if we rethink news enough.  Yeah, forget that.

Transcript:  I mean, from my standpoint, Japan and New Zealand  and Haiti, I mean, this thesis has, you know,  this ship has sailed a long time ago.  We can talk about the variables.  Right, we can talk about the individual story  about the phone call, but this story's gonna be repeated  over and over.  I mean, this ship has sailed.  This is the way it is now.  Every time there's a situation that's gonna look like this,  we'll all tell the individual stories about them,  but the top line thesis of the way the world reacts  and the infrastructure at low cost and speed  of how information is being shared  and the impact on helping people  and all those variables has sailed a long time ago,  going back to the first one or two events  that we were affected by.

Because what really matters now, but pay attention,  pay attention, because here's where I think  it's fascinating, Leo.  I think as our personalities and our true identities,  our social equity in our space is so important  and you wanna take, you wanna give,  and clearly everything we're doing,  one of my favorite things, listen,  I'm as much of a businessman as anybody, right?  I mean, that's where I come from, right?  That's where I come from.  But my favorite video I've ever made  isn't one of the thousand episodes of Wine Library TV  or the other hundreds of episodes  I've done on my personal blog.  It's one specific video,  which is that legacy is greater than currency.  What we're doing right now,  our great-great-grandchildren are gonna watch this.  Right this second.  Hey, little Johnny.  You know, like literally, we are documenting our lives  with our decisions and our supports  and the things that we're doing.  And I think people are starting to understand that  slowly but surely.  And we all have a way we wanna view ourselves.  And it's impacting us.  And it's a very, very big deal.  The collective betterness of human nature is coming out  because what the internet is doing  is taking away the shadows from society.  We live in public.  And that's happening.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I wanna disagree with the idea that the ship has sailed.  Little Stevie's about to think you're an idiot.  You say the ship has sailed as if, like,  this is a story that's three or four years old.  This is a story that's 50 years old.  This is not a case where something's happened  and everything's changed all at once.  We're seeing a progressive procedural refinement,  an increase in resolution of it.  The ship sailed in the 1950s when they were able to show us  footage of the war front or of the earthquakes.  And then that's-

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Why not the 1920s when they were-  Of course, everything is a continuum.  Everything is a continuum.  Yes, exactly, this is exactly.  What I'm saying is we're giving examples about Japan.  Nothing I've heard from a Japan story is any different  than I've heard from a Haiti or a Chile  or a New Zealand story.  Well, but the big difference, Brian,

Start time: 3952.14
End time: 3959.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_11
Transcript:  is that it's not from the,  we didn't have to wait for the journalists to get there.  That's right.  The witnesses can now tell the world  and that's a big difference.  Everybody has their Gutenberg press.

Start time: 3959.82

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Absolutely, but Gary seems to have this attitude  of your shoulder to shoulder, he's like,  ah, Christchurch, you know, Japan, what's the difference?  I say there is a difference because every tragedy  has its own unique story and it is important  that we recognize it and that we react independently to it.

End time: 3981.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  No, what I think you did was you misunderstood  what I was saying, which was all the nuances are different.  I'm agreeing with you.  I'm just saying the top line thesis  of how this is all happening is the same general thought.

Start time: 3981.48
End time: 3984.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_12

Start time: 3984.96
End time: 4008.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  You agree.  No, but really the point I think that Brian was making  is germane, which is it's coming into focus.  So you're right, this has been going on for a long time.  You're right, this is nothing new, but at the same time,  we're just starting to apprehend that it's happening.  Yes, it's been happening all along,  but we're starting to see it and understand it.  You're maybe ahead of us, you wrote the book,  The Thank You Economy, you understand it,  maybe a little better than others.  I think people that are at this conference,

Transcript:  Well, there's a dark side to this,  which is that it's also a rich country,  we care about more than Haiti  and some other countries where this has happened  and I think that's something we have to face up to.  Well, the New Zealand's a very new country,

Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  you know, if you're talking about legacy,  if you're talking about little Johnny,  if you don't have a website, you don't have anything,  it all starts with a presence on the net.  What a man. He's the pro.  He's the pro. That was beautiful.  If you don't have GaryVee.com,  if you don't have WineHybray.tv,  if you're cheating little Johnny,  where's he gonna find you?  If you don't have Afterlife.me,  if you don't have Schwud.com, you gotta have these.  Of course. That's why if you don't have  a domain name, here's a chance to get one.  10% off, as a matter of fact.  I'm talking about Hubber.com.

End time: 4179.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah, we've all been through this,  going to that other place where you have to click  100 times and get around all the dancing people  and things just to get a domain name.  That's why I like Hubber.com.  It's Canadian, that means it's better.  At least it's nicer, right?  It's nicer, it's more polite.  Hubber.com. You're better at comedy.  You can register your domain there.  Tell us about it.  No, they speak perfect English, it's amazing.  Automatically, you get the Who Is privacy that's built in.  They don't extra, no extra charge, no upsell on that.  They have a great feature, which I like.  No hold on customer service calls,  Monday through Friday during business hours.  You will never be put on hold.  You'll get a representative and you will talk  to that representative and they will not put you on hold.  You don't have to listen to the crappy music  or the weird ads.  And if you use Twit, right now is the offer code,  you'll get 10% off your domain.  I do want to mention, they also will take domain transfers.  They do a great thing.  They'll charge you $10 for the transfer,  but extend your domain name for another year.  So it's a $10 extra year and the transfer is all built in.  So it's just a really great service.  I am a big fan.  We are moving all of our sites over.  I invite you to try it.  If you're thinking of a new domain name  or you want to move your old domain name over.  You know, when the kids were born,  I don't know if you did this Gary Vee,  but I got abbylaporte.com and I got henrylaporte.com.  Yeah, I made the same play with Misha.  It might be old school, but it just feels like  maybe they won't need it.  It's not too late, Brian Brushwood.  I'm getting good right now.  twit.hover.com.  Do it today.  All right.

I can't put my finger on it,  but I see it everywhere.

It's huge.  We've all heard the stories.  They said last year was the biggest year  and this year is a third bigger.  And I found that more than ever,  I'm not running into all the peeps down on Sixth Street  the way that I have in years past.  I've got to go seek out my buddies  or even more so,  I have to go seek out people that I want to meet  because we're not all gonna be at the same party  because there's five of them.  And they all start at seven.  And then at 10, there's another thing.  And then Gary's got his cool, fun, underground party  and it's like, now I have to make choices.  And I'm not saying that that's a bad thing.  It's, I mean, what did you say?  Nothing.  I'm not saying it's a bad thing,  but you have to, it's like being at a big music venue  and there's six bands.  It's less clubby though.

Start time: 4326.76
End time: 4330.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's less clubby, but then you've got the CNN truck  and the CNN grill and it's like,  there's a certain aspect.  I'm not bagging on CNN at all,  but there is something about it that you sort of go,  oh wow, South by Southwest is starting to become  an every man type of event.  And it's just, it's not little anymore.  It's grown up.

Transcript:  But third, I am impressed that South by Southwest  or Interactive has kept growing.  There was a dot com bust, right?  And South by Southwest Interactive actually got bigger.  There was a recession and Interactive got bigger.  And we were all talking about the problems  of it getting bigger and it's less intimate  and you can't find people as much,  but I think it's a testament to something.  We were talking about this on TNT  that this isn't got a product.  This isn't CES where it's all about the latest gadgets.  This isn't even Comic Con where it's like finding out  the new movie announcements or what's happening  in the fantasy world.  It's hard to put your finger on what this is.  And in fact, I don't want to steal Brian's line  because I think he's got the finger on.

Transcript:  I will say this year,  maybe it's because I'm old and haven't shaved  and look young like Gary.  Because of separating us up into tribes,  I think they've hurt the hallway  and the hallway is the whole value,  which is what you're saying, Sarah.  Is that if I stood in the convention center,  my whole world passed.  My whole world, the whole tribe, right?  And now I'm in the, by the way,  tomorrow five o'clock, I'm in the Hyatt,  speaking about publicness.  It's halfway to Dallas, but please all come.  It's a long way.  It's over the river.  There's a shark there.  We're gonna jump over it and go see it.  Sorry for the plug.  But that's the point.  I was going from the Sheraton to the Hyatt.  And if I'm sitting in a bad session,  you used to see on Twitter,  there was a whole point is you go next door.  Now you gotta go 20 minutes.  You can't do it.  So the question becomes necessarily,  should there be a scarcity to South by?  You're right.  The good thing is it grows.  And the whole discussion of too big  is ludicrous.  It's really Brother Schnabe.  But there's a fundamental,  there's a practical question of the reason I'm here  is because of you, Goombas, right?  Is because of the tribe and the people  and the people I know and wanna meet new people  and all that.  And I wanna mix with people with different interests.  And now the interests are there's journalism  and there's social and there's technology.  And I regret that.

Transcript:  So what would that mean?  It would mean that you'd have to sell out.  It would mean that you'd have,  by sell out I mean small s, small o.  Have fewer sessions, have fewer seats  and just limit cap South by Southwest.  What do you think of that?  Maybe they stick a tip from IRC and spawn new conference.

Transcript:  This is my sixth year at South by Southwest.  And every year I swear that I'm not gonna come back  because it's too big and I'm a snob.  But then I come back to relearn the lesson  that I love learning in a tech conference  is that it's all about the people.  The internet is made of people.  Your relationships are more important than your iPad  and your apps and your startup.  And I love coming here and hanging out  with really creative, cool, fun folks.  Especially for someone who doesn't live  in San Francisco or New York.  It's really cool for me to come to South by  and actually be able to see my friends  checked in on Foursquare a couple blocks away  versus in another city.  So I'm really happy that you all here  and I'm thrilled to be here.

Transcript:  It's all about the people.  Gary Vaynerchuk.  I think I'm gonna piggyback off of Gina's phenomenal point  which is that I came here four years ago  and nobody really knew who I was.  I had a wine show on the internet  so there was a couple people that kinda knew.  And it was a big coming out party for me.  And I just remember trying to talk to some of the cool kids  and people kinda brushed me, not brushed me off,  but kinda brushed me off.  And I've really enjoyed this year  because more people recognize me.  But what I've been most impressed with is,  wow, there are some really smart, really passionate,  25 and under kids or maybe 45 and older people  that are trying to break through.  But it's true, Jeff.  You know, there's a big thing I always talk in my talks  which is that I try to change my seat  when I'm on flights and I fly a lot  and try to sit with a 90-year-old person  because I think they've played the game  that we've lived, right?  And none of them ever say they wanted more money  or other things, they wish they did more things they loved  or spent more time with their family.  And I'm always like, geez, these guys have played,  they all say the same thing.  They played the game.  So that's what you need to focus on.  I just, I think what's been really hitting me  is I've been going out of my way to have conversations  with dramatically, just new people, first year people  trying to give feedback or help  and just listening to a million pitches  about a bunch of different things.  And I've been very impressed with the collective wisdom,  young and old, and Gina's got it pegged  that this thing only is on the back  of the people in the room.

Transcript:  I learned the importance of registering  my daughter's domain name, pennybrushwood.com.  Now registered.  But also what we were talking about on Tech News today,  and I forget who tweeted it out originally  and I retweeted it live on the show,  is CES is to gadgets as South by Southwest  is to relationships.  There's an ineffable quality to having a beer with someone  and feeling a connection with them  that will yield dividends years down the road.  And you won't even remember how you met that person,  but all of a sudden you become a featured item  on their blog or whatever.  It's about those relationships and the connections.  And as far as it getting too big,  that is the perennial question.  Is there anyone here who lives in Austin,  hearing the audience make some noise?  Okay, we got a bunch of people.

Transcript:  For 17 years, I've been hearing about how Austin  has gotten too big.  And of course there's some growing pains,  but I think by and large Austin has acquitted itself  very, very well.  And I think what you guys are feeling  is the same type of growing pains  that the people who live here in Austin experience as well.  And I'm just thrilled you guys dig the town enough  to keep coming back.  Great town.

Transcript:  Well, this is only my second South by Southwest.  And I think just the impression from last year to this year  is just how successful you can be  and how you can start with literally nothing  and how so many people are doing this now.  Like, you know, I just made an app, you know?  And how literally there isn't one story,  like you say, of this South by.  Like, you know, it's not mobile.  It's that everyone can do this.  Everyone can just learn how to do it  and get an app out or start a startup.  And, you know, it's a really,  like there's a lot of positive energy.
