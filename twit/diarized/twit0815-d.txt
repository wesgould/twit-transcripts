Transcript:  Let me tell you my YouTube story real quick. Uncle Leo. Yes, sir.  So back in the day, you remember a long time ago when I first started out with  you, I was doing YouTube. I had like 10,000 subscribers.  I was getting my little $600 a month from YouTube. Life was good.  And then one day,  my YouTube locked me out when they switched from having a username to you had  to have a Google account. And for some reason I could not get into it.  I tried to contact people for years. I could never get back into this account.  And so it just disheartened me on the whole thing because I got money racking up  in a place that I can't get because they suspended it because I couldn't log in  to verify stuff. Long story short, 10 years later,  I'm at a client's house like a month ago and I log into YouTube to show them how  to do things. I log in. I'm like, why is my logo, um,  for your profile picture? Why does it have dollar signs on it?  He's like, why did you, he's like,  I thought you just put it there to remind me that that was you.  I log in and it attached my YouTube brand account to his email.  Oh my God.  He's been looking at my thing for 10 years and never thought to say a thing.  So I finally got my original YouTube account back.  I'm down to 3000 subscribers, but like Jordan says,  it's been starting from scratch because I started, I finally started over again.  I'm like, man, it's so much work starting over,  but that channel has like millions of views on it. And I'm like,  I finally get it back. So I think I'm going to switch over to the old account.  What is it? youtube.com slash. Oh, Dr. 79. Don't go to it.  Cause this old videos of me ranting and raving. I got to put new stuff up there,  but I, I'm just trying to take a look.

Do you know what a sub-a-thon is? Have you heard about this? Yeah.  You guys do cause you're with it. The idea is it's a marathon,  but instead of asking for money for a charity, as you might on a telethon, you,  you are asking for subscribers. So Ludwig,  Ogren who is already probably pretty successful on the Twitch did something  kind of dumb. Made it to the New York times, which means it's really dumb.  He said,  I will extend my sub-a-thon for 10 seconds for every new subscriber I get.  Do the math, Ludwig. You're never,  ever going to get to stop.

I woke up and I was at 70,000 viewers and 70,000 subs and do the math  because that's 10,000 new subscribers times 10 seconds.  He's never going to get to stop.

If you're feeling upset, these are the rules.  It's like dealing with a dangerous animal. You don't tweet, you don't talk,  you don't call, you don't write.

She had tweeted as a teenager,  she had tweeted a couple of things interpreted as racist.  For which by the way, she'd apologized already, but she,  when this came up, somebody brought it up. She resigned. She said, all right,  I'm going to voluntarily leave because it would be difficult for Connie Nast and  the folks at Teen Vogue. I'll, I'll read you the tweets.

For like, thank God,  I didn't have like, you know, the internet and I was like, not whatever,  live streaming my life. Like it would be horrific. I would be mortified. Um,  so I don't know.  I think that we have a right to be forgotten and I especially think that for  people that are under the age before your brain is fully cooked,  which is like 24, like you're going to, you're just,  your prefrontal cortex is the part that deals with consequences to actions is  not fully developed until about 24.  So we're going to do all kinds of horrific things. And let's just say it with  hormones, we become a little bit less intelligent when we're going through our  teen years.  Oh yeah.

Thanks a lot. Stupid Asian TA.  And then she says outdone by Asian now Googling how not to wake up with swollen  Asian eyes. Okay. They're racist. Oh, yeah. Those are, they're racist,  especially now we're very sensitive about, uh,  racism against Asian Americans. Um, however,  it was 10 years ago. She was in high school, obviously. I don't know.

And now you're doing this other thing. And he said, he's like, well, you know,  I'd rather grow as a person than just sort of be stuck, you know,  just in Amber as this like, you know, loud, obnoxious party person.  I think people, they grow 10 years from, from when, you know,  from when I was 18 till I was 21, I thought,  I was 21. I think there's this huge growth and I, you know, it doesn't,  those tweets are horrible and, and, and, you know,  she should be ashamed of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this is a tough one.  It's just tough when you're, yeah, it's tough cause you're a teenager.  Like if she was 21 and she had done that, I'm like, well, no,  but you're such an idiot when you're a teenager. It's, it's tough to, it's,  that's where, you know, education doesn't teach you, you know,  when I was in school, they didn't teach us about finance.  So we all screwed up on that. And now they're not really teaching,  other than bullying. They don't,  I don't think they really teach kids about the what happens in,  with social media because their parents might not get it. Cause they're like,  well, I'm not going to use Facebook or I'm not using Twitter.  So they're not getting the information from, from school.  They're not getting it from their parents. And so there's like, Oh,  I just put this thing out there. Twitter isn't real, which is,  you know, this thing that people have been saying forever, which is untrue.  And then it comes back to haunt them.  Oh, and what do you think?

Start time: 1583.76
End time: 1684.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So everybody knows I'll talk about it a million times. I have a teenager.  There have been kids at her school that have gone on Instagram,  Snapchat and said vulgar things about black kids, Asian kids.  And next thing you know, they're getting threatened by other kids to get beat up.  You know, they get suspended from school. Bad things happen.  I, the only line I draw between that kind of language is,  you know, comedians saying stuff cause they're trying to be funny and hyperbolic  and regular people, because these, even as a kid, not for nothing, she's black,  right? I think she's black. She's black.  So she should know better growing up in a household about racism and how cruel it  is to make fun of people. Telling me how old she is does not matter to me.  If she's old enough to have a phone and a device and make comments, does she,  as an African-American woman should definitely know not to talk about somebody  else's race. So I don't have a sympathy for the 12, 15, whatever,  cause I have a teenage daughter and Lord knows we talk about a lot of stuff and  maybe I'm raising my kid a little bit better, but there's a difference between,  you know, your ideology and what you think. And just because you,  you thought that at 10 doesn't mean you're not going to think that at 20.  I believe that racism kind of carries on.  That's why we got to wait for it to age out because racism back in the seventies  hasn't just changed his mind in the last 10 years because the rest of the world  woke. He grew up with it. He stayed with it and it hasn't changed.  Now you get caught and you apologize because you want to keep a cushy job,  but I'm not just going to expel the fact that you as a black woman,  we're making fun of another person because of their race.  I'm just out on that. I mean, if she, if she's got to change her name,  whatever she's got to do, cool.

She's working for other companies and businesses that have to have relationships  with other people. So that's a problem for her. Again,  I understand that people make mistakes.  I understand that people can change and they should have an opportunity to  change. But at the same time,  I'm not going to cry for her because she lost her opportunity because of a  mistake that she made when she was a child, which again,  in her specific circumstance, she should know better. Again,  that's just me and as a different form of opinion,  but hopefully she finds another way in life. There's other jobs in the world.  She go and have a very successful, happy, healthy life.  Maybe she changed her name. Maybe she moves to Europe.  I don't know what she does, but I'm not boohooing for her.

It's not, it's really messy.  But the thing is, is that if she had robbed a bank, it would have been expunged.  Right? If at this age she had done some sort of a crime,  we would not know about it. And she would have been absolved from this.

Start time: 1779.06

Transcript:  But now it is right.  Social media has created a format where, you know,  everything is going to follow you. And let's just say it,  like if everything that I ever said was like taped and sent out and all the  stupid things that I've done were taped and sent out to the world,  none of us would be able to do anything. Right? Like we all make mistakes.  We all do stupid things.  And I just think that we can sometimes grab our pitchforks and  torches so quickly and come out to kind of scorch the earth and everyone has to  be perfect. And I think that if people have made, like, okay, I'm a therapist.  So if you've made conscious actions to change and be a better person and try to  do better,  I think that we should be judging people on who they are today,  not who they were a decade ago. And I think that that makes a huge difference.  If not,  we're stuck being painted in a platform that we are no longer that person.  And I don't think that that is fair either.

Transcript:  I've always said, and I don't get, I can't take credit.  Somebody said this and I just remembered it,  that the problem with Twitter is it feels like it's hanging out around the  water cooler where you say stuff and it disappears. But in fact,  it's a mismatch because in fact it lasts forever as we can see.  And so even though you feel like it's just offhand comments, they're far from it.  It's like something you wrote in a book and published and put in a library so  that anybody can find it forever. So that's the, that's the problem.

Whenever I know I'm going to talk crazy, I always say,  this is an FYI podcast is FYI tweet.  Just so people know, so they can go back and look what FYI means.  But with my daughter,  she's had a phone since she was five years old. And basically, again,  cause I take the time and like you said earlier,  my parents don't know better,  but I progressed her along the lines of this is how you do this.  It's how you do that. And I slowly weaned her onto different things.  You know, here, you gotta post on Instagram every day so I can show her what to  do, how to do it. And Twitter now she's on Twitter going crazy,  but she has the benefit of me guiding her along as opposed to some of her  friends. And these kids are just saying stuff. And I'm like, yo,  you, you plan on getting a job? I can say whatever I want. I work for myself.  If I, if I want to not work tomorrow,  I can go do whatever I want.

Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. So, but you gotta know where you're at.  And a lot of athletes have to deal with this, you know, getting drafted.  It's very tough. I feel bad for the white kid that's just singing rap songs.  Like he grew up with athletes. They're rapping songs.  He didn't mean it that way. And I,  and I can read his text and know he didn't mean it that way.  But since he used the word, everybody just goes, Oh, we'll see. Yo.  So people don't even take context in anymore.  So it is very rough and hard to figure out. But I mean,  parents gotta do better. Kids gotta do better.  That's why it's hard with media literacy, right?

Start time: 2036.76
End time: 2091.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Like that's the thing is that media literacy is not taught. Like we were,  Renee and I were hired to do a talk to actually, um, for,  for one of the States, for all of the, um, you know,  leaders in the state to be able to talk about media savvy and how it works and,  you know,  what are all the tricks that kind of comes out of trying to divide us and make  us into different tribes and why, you know,  how they want to try to make us feel emotional, make us feel angry so that we,  we don't leave. Um,  which I thought was really awesome because they cared enough to be able to  teach all of the leaders that are in the state in order to help them keep their  constituents as media savvy as possible. But this isn't a class, right?  Like we're not taught this. So a lot of parents have no clue.  They don't even know their kids are on social media.  They don't know anything about it and they're not taught in the schools, right?  We go back to not learning finance, not learning, you know, mental health issues.  Like, I'm sorry, we can Google geography very efficiently,  but this kind of stuff is, could change your life.

Start time: 2092.56
End time: 2175.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Part of the problem also is we don't have any experience with a,  a weapon like, like social media. It's so doesn't,  it's nothing like anything we've seen before.  And so you can say teach media literacy, but who's going to teach it?  Because no one is like, Oh, I've been doing this. I know exactly.  I've been doing this my whole life. I mean, it's, it's, you know, we're,  everybody's making mistakes because this is all brand new.  One of the things I did note that it's really interesting since president  Trump was banned off Twitter, you, it really turns out in hindsight,  that was his platform. He still has plenty of ways to talk to people,  but it's surprisingly quiet from Mar-a-Lago because he doesn't have a  platform. So you really have to say, you know,  in the last four years,  Twitter might bear some responsibility for some of the heightened  invective because it gave him a platform. Now, interestingly,  Trump announced or a Trump spokesperson announced today on Fox that  president Trump is going to create his own social media platform.  They, his spokesman said that will completely redefine the game and attract tens  of millions of new users. Looking at the success of parlor,  I could see that perhaps is it going to be called Trump or I don't know,  what is it? What is he going to call it? I don't know. What will it look like?

And I mean, these are people who use Twitter all the time. They know better,  but it's, we can't, I think people, we just can't help ourselves.  I'm just angry and just like, don't tweet angry.

Transcript:  No, it shuts down your brain. Like really physically,  what happens inside of the brain when you're really upset is we go into fight  or flight.  We do not know the difference between a emotional attack and a physical attack.  So when someone says something that's against my ideology,  who I believe I am as a person or something that I believe in,  it's like I was attacked.  And so what happens is the brain goes into fight or flight,  sends an adrenaline and shuts off the working memory.  That bumpy part of your brain you're so proud of gone, gone.  You're like a three year old in a candy shop and that's it. So it feels good.  You want to get at them, but there's no getting at them.  There's just stages of loss.

You know,  I've gotten in fights with people that I really didn't want to get in fights  with all because of exactly that. I got angry and the rain turned off.

So I fired back and then I apologize. I'm sorry, John,  I love you. I didn't mean to say that. It were like brothers, et cetera, et cetera.  Too late because everybody jumped on it and loved it and amplified it.  And it was over. And so John and I still hate each other's guts.  No, no, no, I'm just kidding.  But it definitely damaged our relationship, but that's okay.

Transcript:  Roberta Baldwin. He's going to be, he's going to be part of the fam.  It's great to have you all three of you back.  Our show today brought to you by Uber for business. You know, Uber, of course,  rides, Uber eats, delivers food.  Uber for business is a great way to keep employees engaged,  to keep customers happy, especially nowadays,  when face to face interaction is limited.  If you're trying to find a way to stand out to your customers or make your  employees feel extra valued, you got to know about Uber for business.  Over 150,000 companies use Uber for business to improve customer and employee  satisfaction. If you're having a hard time getting people, let's say,  to show up at that, that zoom staff meeting,  or stay engaged in virtual team meetings or events,  you could use a voucher from Uber for business,  add 20 bucks to their personal Uber account.  So they can easily order meals through Uber eats before the meeting, say,  you know, something like, Hey, we're going to have a team meeting.  I'll buy you lunch and send them the voucher, or I'll buy you a coffee.  Send them a voucher. Want to make your customers love your business even more?  Offer them a voucher for a free meal or ride when they make their first  purchaser, spend a certain amount or say, Hey, we want you to come to our store.  Can I buy you a ride over here and a ride back with Uber for business  immediately start delivering extra value to the people who matter most to your  business right now. Vouchers are simple. It's you could either easy to send,  easy for your customer or a colleague to redeem.  Your business has total control over who gets them, when they expire,  what portion of the ride of the meal you want to cover vouchers.  You will send them typically via email or text,  and then they can be redeemed by your customer or your employee with a single  tap. And here's the best part.  You don't pay for anything until they take the ride or buy the meal.  You only pay for what they use right now for a limited time.  You'll get a $50 voucher when you create your first vouchers campaign and spend  All you have to do is go to uber.com slash Twitter to learn more great new way to  use Uber for meals or rides for colleagues, employees,  customers, uber.com slash twit.  Terms and conditions apply uber.com slash twit. It's a really good idea.  I know a lot of companies that use this.  And I think it's a really smart way to do it.  So this is part of the problem Owen, as you point out that Twitter,  even though they're doing all right, it's hard for them to make money,  partly because their CEO has so many other interests. He just bought title from  Jay Z. So now square just bought titles.  So now he's got a payment company, a music company, and Twitter.  He's trying to run. And meanwhile, he's out, you know,  meditating or something, growing his beard.  One of the things they floated, but have not yet implemented is some sort of  subscription. One of the things Jack Dorsey said is, what if we charged you,  what if we had a store,  everybody's looking at Apple and how well they're doing with the app store.  What if we had a store where you could buy,  a curated Twitter? Like you could say, I want a Twitter. That's,  you know, got a lot of philosophy on it or something like that.  And then you pay five bucks and we've got this special filter for you.  Is that the, what would you pay for Twitter for Owen besides deleting everything  you ever said?

Transcript:  So Twitter is one of the only platforms that doesn't have a  nudity clause. I, if I was Jack Dorsey,  I would turn on only fans Twitter and I'd only take a 10% and I would destroy  them because most of the people that are on only fans,  only fans has a thing where it tweets out a link because that again is the only  platform.  So Twitter is the publicity side. Yeah.  Exactly. Because Twitter is the only one that allows you to use nudity.  Tumblr doesn't do nudity anymore since it got bought by whoever you are.  I was against, I can't remember, but Twitter is one of the ways you can put  adult content on there. So if I was them, that's exactly what I do. I'd be like,  Hey, here's your own little only fans. You don't have to go outside of Twitter.  You don't have to go anywhere for it. You know,  we've got an explicit rating on it.  So only people that come in and subscribe to you could get to it.  Only people that have opted in would stay already have that.  You have to hit a button to be able to see that kind of content.  And I would only take a 10% VIG.  They would make billions of dollars in the next quarter because everyone would  like one stop shopping for that kind of content. And people trust Twitter.  A lot of people don't use only fans because you got to go give your credit  cards to some company that you don't know. And again, they're taking 20% VIG.  If you take 10%, you're in there like swimwear. Let's get that money printed.  That would be my move.

Transcript:  You know what? They have this other company called Square that can help process  your payment. And then your payment comes through as Twitter, whatever.  It doesn't come through as only fans or, or, or Pornhub or I don't know,  whatever porn thing out there.  So you get the option of seeing the naked people doing the naked things that  you like without the fear of someone else,  maybe in your family or finding out that you're looking at naked people doing  naked things.

It's not all just naked people, but there, there, there are a lot of people.  I know a lot of photographers that use it too and do like behind the scenes  shoots and all they're saying.  So just not to say it's not perhaps the best money generator.

Transcript:  I think that if you're going to have this,  you have to have a feature where your tweets and what you do on Twitter is you  have the chance to have it deleted. Again,  if someone else is copying your famous person, oh well,  but at least you could have it deleted forever, wiped clean off their servers,  off everything.

Transcript:  There is third party software that will do that.  I actually, when I left Twitter, took the trouble of going through  the process of deleting old tweets.  Wouldn't you pay if you already had it? If you already had it,

Start time: 2802.32
End time: 2826.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it was set up, especially if you end up having whatever nudity or something else  that's on there. But let's just say it, we have a right to be able to be forgotten.  I think that that should be one of our innate rights. And, you know,  if they had that,  I think that it would be something that I think a lot of people would find it  worth paying money for, especially when you watch people suddenly, you know,  have all of these horrible things happen for tweets that happened a decade or  longer ago.

Start time: 2826.80
End time: 2835.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Because the API is rate limited on Twitter.  I think I could only delete a chunk of tweets at a time. So I had to keep  running it and I don't think it deleted all the tweets.

Start time: 2836.36
End time: 2861.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  API, like Twitter, that should be a Twitter, like what Jordan was saying.  That should be a feature. I should be allowed to say after a month,  delete tweets. Everything that's before, you know, March of 2020,  get rid of it. I don't need it. I'm not going back to it.  I feel bad for all the publications that have embedded my tweets for whatever  reason, but I should have done a screen grab.

Start time: 2862.23
End time: 2865.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They should have paid you and had you do something.

Start time: 2865.18
End time: 2895.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think though, that's why Twitter doesn't do this because I think  philosophically they have some investment, you know,  not only they have this investment in the free speech wing of the free speech  party, which that's been tarnished a little bit.  But I think they also have this investment in the idea that it lasts forever.  It's like, it's a record of your life.  Although I see there's a company called Tweet Deleter,  which charges $3.99.  So there is money to be made in deleting your tweets.  Right?

Start time: 2896.78
End time: 2918.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, if they want to be the sort of the tech company of record,  then yeah, that's fine. But that should be up to the individual,  the individual account. You know, I shouldn't be held hostage by Twitter because,  you know, something, a bad joke I tweeted a long time ago.  I completely agree.  It's not offensive. It's just really, really bad.  Actually, I take it back. So look at this.

Start time: 2919.04
End time: 2936.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's $3.99 a month for up to 500 tweets a month,  $4.99 for 3,200 tweets and a thousand likes per month to delete,  or delete all your tweets and likes for a mere $6 a month.  That's nothing.  Yeah. It feels like you could use this for one month and you'd be done.

Start time: 2936.78
End time: 2939.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But yeah, I feel like, and then go back to the $3.99 one every, you know,

Start time: 2940.64
End time: 2953.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Every few months and delete the old stuff. I think it's not a bad idea.  Kids, you don't know, you know,  you might've said something a couple of years ago that was okay then,  maybe even be okay now that won't be okay in 10 years. Who knows? Right.

Transcript:  And side note, just for parents and kids,  like my daughter did recently tell me when she first like got into Twitter and  realized the power of Twitter,  she was contacting a lot of her like fan boy people that she liked on YouTube.  It's like that.  Like I was being like a simp and gushy and I wished that I could delete the  DMs that I was sending them because she can delete on her end,  but that doesn't mean anything because it's still on their end. So,  yeah.  Be careful. That's a good point. In fact,

Start time: 2983.16
End time: 2990.18

Transcript:  Yeah. And especially in private messages. That's what I mean.  Like in private messages, unless you're Mark Zuckerberg,  I know people have had conversations with him on Facebook and somehow he  deletes the whole record on your side and his side.

Like whenever I see tech people and they're like taping up their cameras and  I'm like, oh, okay. Well, if you know, Zuckerberg has tape on his cameras,  I'm like, okay, fair enough. Like he knows.

It's been frozen at two and a half million. Nobody seems to want it for more.  See, there you go.  Yeah.  Two and a half million.  How much, how much should I offer? Should I offer two point?  Yeah.

Start time: 3121.52
End time: 3161.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And NFTs aren't a problem.  If you have money and you find value in something, then it's valuable.  You know, if you,  if you go to the shore every year and collect rocks with your child and your  child dies at the age of six, those rocks are priceless to you.  Of course.  What would you pay to get one of those rocks?  If your house was broken into and they were stolen, you might pay anything.  So there's always value and relativity to it. And I fully am on board.  I'm actually secretly selling NFTs or some of my art friends,  but I don't like talking about it because as much as it's a scam,  it's reality because that's how art works. Why do you buy something at $50?  And then 20 years later, the guy's not Van Gogh. Why is it valued at 800,000?  I don't know. Cause some rich person thinks they want to buy it. You know,

Transcript:  The point. Yeah. Well, that's right. You can't drive it.  The point that New York times makes though is before the pandemic,  it was selling for 560,000. So it's doubled.  And that's because apparently there are a lot of wealthy people who haven't been  spending money on travel or dining out or whatever it is rich people buy.  So they've got all this income and they can't,  so they're buying things like this coffee table. That's a beautiful,  I mean, it's a gorgeous coffee table, but it's selling for,  let's see, $2.5 million.

My favorite con was you fell prey to this, Uncle Leo.  You're just rich enough to fall for this stuff. Four years ago,  I remember this great article that said, when you're wealthy,  acquiring items isn't the thing to do.  Yes.  Travel is the thing.  It's experiences. Yes.

You know, speaking of the last thing you did, March 2020,  we flew out to St. Louis, hugged a bunch of people, Worldwide Technology.  And I think about that every day.  No, I don't. But I think they're the greatest.  They have partnered with Dell Technologies to bring you an amazing thing.  Their Advanced Technology Center.  We went out and saw it in St. Louis.  It is it started with one building and it's expanded to many buildings,  rack after rack of the top of the line enterprise gear,  more than half a billion dollars in hardware and software from hundreds of technology companies.  Why would you care? Because you can use it yourself.  Of course, WWTs engineers use it to quickly spin up proofs of concept and pilots.  They use the ATCs to help customers confidently select the best solutions.  But you can also use the ATC as lab as a service, which is amazing.  It's a dedicated lab space within the Advanced Technology Center where customers,  you can perform programmatic testing of your own using that half billion dollar ecosystem.  Hundreds of on-demand and schedule labs, things like Dell's VX rail,  CyberRecover Solutions, PowerStore.  We saw the Dell PowerStore. Those are beautiful.  Man, they look great in the rack.  Unity, PowerMax, Data Protection Central, IDPA.  The newest advances in primary storage.  And you can try them yourselves.  Other labs at the ATC represent the latest advances in things like multi-cloud architecture,  security, networking automation, primary and secondary storage, data analytics,  AI, DevOps, everything any business might want to know about.  You can find out about at WWTs Advanced Technology Center.  And because it's virtual, you can use it anywhere in the world,  any time of the day or night. It's there for you.  WWTs engineers, we met a lot of the engineers and I said, you must love your job.  This is the best job in the world.  We get to play with the latest, greatest stuff.  They're in there every day.  Beta testing, new equipment, building reference architectures,  doing custom integrations for their customers so their customers can see results,  make decisions, figure out what's going to work without a big investment.  It's really kind of impressive.  WWTs ATC platform encompasses the entire lab ecosystem,  and it creates a multiplier effect of knowledge and speed and agility  available anytime, anywhere around the world for its customers and partners.  Not just labs, there's technical articles, there's demonstration videos, white papers.  Everything you need to stay up to date with the latest technology.  And while you're there exploring the ATC platform, do me a favor.  Make sure to check out WWTs events and communities  because there's lots of opportunities there too to learn about technology trends.  Hear about the latest research and insights from their experts.

I've been in that sort of like, you know, the punk band when I was in my early 20s,  where, you know, you cared about your feelings and you cared about like what everyone thought.  And you had a slow song and a bunch of fast songs.  And someone in the band would get angry because they came with the song and everyone else in the band is like, that sucks.  So I decided to like create these like sort of these tribute bands where we're just here to have fun.  That's it. That's the whole point of the band.  Perfect. Just have fun.

I've made new friends who are in my band, who are in other bands.  And, you know, once a week we go, we learn a bunch of songs.

Like, there's a whole bunch of companies now that have like access to your webcam, right?  Like that was another story.  And so they could watch if you were at the computer or not.  Like, isn't that an invasion of privacy?  I don't know.  Like, do they own you just because you're driving?  The company in the chat room is saying Amazon treats their workers like robots.

Start time: 4624.00
End time: 4664.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I think that that's maybe the underlying story here is that from Amazon management's point of view, the guys and gals working in the warehouse, the drivers, they're cogs in a giant machine.  They're not human beings.  So these camera systems, it's called Driver Eye, driver in the letter I, manufactured by a company called Netrodyne.  The cameras are always on.  They scan drivers body language, the speed of the vehicle, which Amazon, you know, by the way, they have every right to do this.  It's their vehicles.  Speed of the vehicle.  Yeah.  Drowsiness.  That seems sensible.  In fact, Roberto, right, the Cadillac and a number of other vehicles.  A lot of vehicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have drowsiness detectors, but they also, you know, most fleet management systems already have already tell you how fast the car is going, how efficient it is.  They don't need a camera inside the car to tell you how fast you're going.  They're already tracking the vehicle.  So adding another camera and saying, oh, it's because of speed and drowsiness.  That's BS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And who's watching all that?  I mean, I don't really.  Every driver, FedEx driver, UPS drivers, their device in itself will say if it's sedentary too long, if it hasn't moved, if it's moving too fast.  There's a geometry scope in there that tells me gives a whole lot of information on the driver.  You know what I mean?  So other than being on camera, but I'm like, who watches this thing?  And at the end of the day, the thing I see online all the time is like, oh, Jeff Bezos or 20 million dollars.  When is he going to become Iron Man or Batman?

Accelerating our integrity and privacy work to ensure the safest possible experience for teens  and building a version of Instagram that lets people under the age of 13 safely use Instagram  for the first time.  For the first time.  Actually, Instagram, like almost everything else, because of COPPA,  the Child Online Protection and Privacy Act, will not allow you to join if you're under 13.

Transcript:  At first, I thought they might be crypto punks.  You know what those are?  Speaking of NFTs, they were one of the first...  They're 8-bit kind of icon-sized drawings that are now...  You could have picked up for a song when they first came out some years ago.  They're now worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.  They're digital.  So the reason I bring that up, next week, Kevin Rose is going to be on.  He's just launched a new podcast called Modern Finance, mofi.net.  And the very first episode, they talked about this whole weird collectible thing.  And he's talking about like, I had 30 crypto punks, but I decided I wanted to sell them  and just really focus on one really valuable crypto punk.  So I got the smiling zombie, which is apparently worth like $100,000.  This is what they look like.  This is nuts.  You own it.  It's yours officially.  But there's nothing to hang on the wall.  I guess you could print it out, but so could anybody.  I mean, I could put these out, put it on the wall.  Interesting, isn't it?

Start time: 5995.86
End time: 5997.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then you sell them to others.

Start time: 5997.78
End time: 6033.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the theory, right?  He's talking about how a lot of times nowadays when people buy fine art, you know, van Gogh's or  Picasso's, they never even take them out of the airport.  They store them.  Because of taxes.  Yeah.  It's a taxing event.  They're not buying it to put it on the wall.  They're buying it as investment.  So they just keep it in special storage facilities at the airport.  So they never have to pay the customs or the taxes.  And it's still just as good as selling it.  I guess it's kind of the same as I've got money in the bank, but is there money anywhere?  There's no money in the bank.  It's just business.  It's crypto.

Start time: 6033.64
End time: 6060.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Crypto's solid enough that it's money.  I mean, again, I fully understand it.  And as much as it's a scam, it's a real thing because it's just like anything else.  Like we just said, fine art has a value because people put value on it.  Yeah.  It just is the way it is.  Crypto's a joke 10 years ago.  Now it's like, oh, everybody's clamoring to get it.  Okay, well, now it's got enough people that they're going to sell it to.  That back it to where you don't have to worry about it going to zero unless you're  Jason Calacanis and you think it's going to go to zero every day.

Oh, oh, oh, sensei.  Oh, Dr. Sensei.  Oh, great Georgia.  Teach me tonight.  A hacker got all my texts, writes Joseph Cox, for $16.  Now, he paid the hacker to do it, but this is,  if you ever needed a reason to say,  I will never again use SMS for two-factor authentication,  this is it.  What a chilling story this is.  He hired a hacker for his purposes of the story.  Effectively, to hack him.  Now, normally we talk about SIM swapping,  where a hacker will call your phone company and say,  hey, it's Leo.  I lost my phone.  Can you send me a new SIM?  Yeah, sure.  What's your address?  Well, I've moved.  I now live at Sing Sing.  That's in Austin, New York.  I'm in cell black 43.  Okay, we'll send that SIM right away to you.  And then they have your phone number and all the texts go to them.  And so your SMS authentication goes to them.  And you're done.  This is so much easier.  This is so much simpler.  So he hired a guy, Lucky225,  which by the way, if you're a hacker, that's a nice name.  He's a white hat, I guess, hacker.  Or we don't say white hat anymore, do we?  He's a good guy hacker.  Can I say that?

Transcript:  He's a security researcher.  What he did, he went to a company.  By the way, I'll mention the company's name,  but it's not really the company's fault.  There are lots of companies that do this.  He went to a company that helps businesses.  They're called Sakari.  Helps businesses send and receive text messages to customers.  S-A-K-A-R-I.  They have a trial plan for $16 a month.  And of course, you need to give them the number  that you want to send and receive messages from.  Because it basically goes to them,  and then they send it along to you.  How do you get this number?  You send them a letter of authorization saying,  yeah, I own this number.  Can be completely forged.  They even very kindly give you online  the letter of authorization to sign.  Apparently, they do no verification.  Lucky225 paid the $16,  and now he's getting all of Cox's texts.  Sent to him.  As well as, by the way, Cox never notices this,  because it's also being sent to his phone as usual.  All you need is this letter of authorization.  And that's it.

Transcript:  Wait, it should say that.  That's, there's no, there's no, who owns SMS?  It's up to the individual phone company.  This is why the SS7 exploit is such a big deal.  And that's the SS7 exploit was why Jack Dorsey got his  Twitter account hack.  And that's why they turned off SMS tweets  because Jack was hacked.  Right.  Not because it's been a problem for years.  That's why as soon as Jack tweets something,  or someone finds a tweet from 10 years ago,  and uses it to call him out,  that's where we're going to get the ability to delete tweets  that are over a month old.

Start time: 6311.90
End time: 6337.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the privilege of owning your own company.  I suppose Sikari is going to change how this works.  I hope these other companies,  apparently there are many that do this.  Unfortunately, you may not have a choice.  For instance, my bank, and I think most banks,  that's how they send the two-factor authentication.  They send it via SMS.  And you could beg and plead and say,  I'll never use you again,  but good luck finding a bank that doesn't have that.

You always have to take into account that  most of these attacks are targeted attacks.  If you're a CEO, if you're a journalist,  if you're human rights,  you're someone who protests human rights.

Transcript:  Okay. I hope I'm learning here.  You remember, it was actually in the middle of a show.  This happened during this week in Google last year.  All of a sudden, we're seeing tweets from Barack Obama,  Joe Biden, Jack Dorsey, Apple, saying,  I've decided to give back to my community.  So for the next 30 minutes,  if you send me any amount of Bitcoin,  I'll double it and send it back to you.  It kind of has to be an idiot to fall for that.  It was very obvious Twitter had been severely hacked.  We're saying, what's going on here?  I mean, first of all,  if you were able to post on anybody's account that you wanted to,  and that seemed like it was apparent,  Barack Obama, Elon Musk, Kanye West, Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos,  Mike Bloomberg, Warren Buffett, Floyd Mayweather, Kim Kardashian, Apple and Uber,  if you can do that, you got the nuclear option.  Go for it.  Do something.  I don't know what, but it seems like asking for Bitcoin is the least.  We thought either this is very a clever ploy to distract or this guy is a kid.  Turns out it was a kid.  A 17-year-old high school student who had basically got the hack by  convincing a Twitter employee that he was with Twitter IT,  and he got the guy to give him, we think, his Slack handle, his Slack login.  The kid logged into his Slack, and lo and behold, Twitter had posted, pinned it, in fact,  the credentials for the Twitter customer service portal,  which gave you access to all these people's accounts.  And the ability to tweet on their behalf.  That's what the kid did with it.  He was caught within a day.  I'm not going to say his name because, again, this is something he did as a Ute at 17.  He has been convicted now.  If he'd been tried as an adult, it would have been 10 years, minimum.  But he was tried as a Ute, and he is going to get three years in juvie, basically,  a prison designed for youthful offenders.  Like a boot camp, military-style boot camp.  So this great threat to our national security is no longer going to...  He's going to a second location, actually, is what's happening.

He talked about how his company, they do pen testing, which is they try to break in the  companies.  The companies pay them to try to break in.  And if it's just technology-based, sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't.  But he said if there's social engineering involved, and this is where you talk somebody  into giving you information, his company can get in 100% of the time.  Yeah.  He wrote the book on social engineering, actually.  Matt Honin's huge hack that happened back when we were both working at Wired,  that was all social engineering that the person did with Amazon and with Apple.  And you just keep trying and you create these scripts in order to get to these certain,  like get past individuals.  And it's really, if you can just talk people into doing something and sharing what feels  like information that's not that important with a third party, turns out that information is  very important and it's used, it's part of a puzzle to get into accounts.  And the fact that it was a kid as opposed to a nation state, a nation state could have put  something on there.  Imagine.  They could have gotten to Donald Trump's thing and said, we're nuking Russia or India or  started a war.

They decided to try him in a state court instead of a federal court because they had more  flexibility to try him as a juvenile.  So they actually, I think they were intentionally pretty nice to this kid.  And get this by the way, of course, he gave out a Bitcoin address and you can look at any  Bitcoin address and see how much money came in.  About $117,000.

I've been in Ferrari.  I've driven 200 miles an hour and usually, like you said, you have to work up to that  speed.  I don't know what's up with those Hellcats.  That car just screams at you.

Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  Follow them on the Twitter.  Our show today brought to you by ExtraHop.  Boy, oh boy, that solar winds attack, the sunburst attack.  Quite a wake-up call, I think, for a lot of sysadmins out there.  And then there's the exchange server.  I mean, it's just been a nightmare.  Cyber attacks are becoming more advanced, harder to detect.  And the real problem, especially with this exchange server flaw, these zero days, is  you can remediate the exploit, but do you know if the hackers  are already in your network or are they already reading all your email?  The most advanced threat actors, the most dangerous ones, are the ones in the environment.  They've been there for a long time without our knowledge.  The APTs, the advanced persistent threats.  When cyber criminals get past your defenses,  businesses need a plan for detection.  They need a plan for response.  The old model is just not enough.  The old protection and prevention alone is not enough.  They're in there.  Well, they might be.  That's why you need ExtraHop RevealX.  It's the only solution that shows you not just where intruders are going, but where they've been.  Where they've been so you can investigate incidents and prevent them from turning into  full-blown breaches.  When cyber attacks make the news, the first question everybody asks,  I know it's what I ask our IT department is, have we been compromised?  But how do you know?  ExtraHop RevealX makes it super simple to answer that question.  You get 90 days of record look back, complete network visibility across the data center,  cloud, even out to the device edge.  So security teams can get the real answers they need in seconds.  And in a post-compromise world, your greatest chance at stopping advanced threats  is with ExtraHop's Network Detection and Response, their NDR.  You know, the faster you respond, the faster you mitigate, the less damage is done.  Learn more about how ExtraHop stops breaches 84% faster.  They've got a great interactive demo.  I think you're going to enjoy it.  It's great.  I can't.  ExtraHop.com slash twip.  You'll love it.  ExtraHop.com slash twip.  We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because then you end up with the problem you have with Twitter where you have a lot of noise with  a little and at some point, especially if you're signing up for the same type of newsletter,  if you sign up for a tech newsletter, they're essentially all going to be the same in some  instance. I mean, Casey's an amazing writer, so you should totally sign up for whatever Casey is  doing. And get that really good view of what's going on in tech. But you really have to sort of  pick and choose what you're going to do. And I think what's going to happen is more and more  people as they start creating Substack. And now there's a bunch of copycats. Twitter has one.  Yeah, Review.  Probably has one. You're going to end up with the same issue that you have now where you go to a  lot of tech sites and the news role is the exact same thing on every site. And you kind of have to  there's signal and noise issue there.

Transcript:  Some real criticism of Substack right now, Anna Lee Newitz, who I know we interviewed her on  triangulation, is leaving Substack with her newsletter because she says, Substack is kind of,  she calls it a scam. It turns out there's this thing called Substack Pro, which is a group of  writers that they essentially pay an upfront sum enough to make it a salary. But what Substack  doesn't do is say who it is. And so there is this kind of part of the scam is, you know, there's  people making money, but you don't know if they're making money because they have so many subscribers  or because Substack is paying them. Substack says, we don't disclose the name of the writers with  whom we've done deals because it's their private information and it's up to them whether they want  it publicly known. But it also is an advantage to Substack because it gives people the impression,  oh, look at all the people making money when in fact maybe they're not. There's also a question  about who Substack is paying. And there's innuendo about that, that Substack has a political agenda  and is actually paying a certain kind of writer because they're really interested, particularly  writers like Glenn Greenwald who are against trans rights or ACLU lawyer Chase Strangio who  is directing harassment, a female New York Times reporter. It seems like there is an agenda.  Anyway, I just thought I'd bring this up. Annalise Post is very good  and she raises some interesting questions on two different fronts. So nothing to discuss there  unless you want to say something about it. Here's a happy story. Go ahead, Eryk Georgie.  Or I'm sorry, who is it wants to speak?  Oh, I'm sorry, that's probably me.

Transcript:  Roberto, you.  I feel like if you're, you have to, there should be some sort of transparency, especially when  you're paying.  You should tell people.  You should tell people.  Yeah.  If Substack is becoming a media company, then there has to be some sort of transparency  with who you're paying, what they're writing, and then allow people to make  their judgment on whether or not they want to be part of Substack or they want to subscribe  to Substack. If they're not transparent about what's going on on their system, then  and you know, why would I mean, I, when I look at these newsletters because of that,  I would not use Substack. I'm not going to create a Substack account. There's some other ones that  are out there that maybe they pay better, maybe they pay worse, but ethically, I don't feel  compelled to be part of something where, you know, it's so opaque.

Transcript:  There was a great story. I didn't report it because it's kind of geeky, but if you're a  gamer, you're probably familiar with how god-awful the load times are on Grand Theft Auto online.  In fact, it could be 15 minutes before you can play or even longer.  And there was a great write-up late last month by a guy who said, I'd just been driving me crazy.  He said, I picked up Grand Theft Auto again for the first time in seven years,  and I was shocked to discover it still loads just as slowly as ever.  He did an amazing thing. Now, remember, this is not an open source game, very much not so.  He reverse engineered the source code and figured out, profiled it, figured out what was going on  and fixed it. And he actually posted a patch on GitHub that you could apply to your Grand Theft  Auto so that he increased the load time by 70 percent. And it was a dopey mistake that's been  sitting there for seven years. Well, here's the happy ending. The folks at Rockstar,  they could have, you know, ignored him or yelled at him. They thanked him and they have actually  paid him $10,000 for a bug bounty and they're going to fix it after seven years. The official  patch is live as of March 16th. The players are reporting huge improvements. Pretty cool. TosterCX,  maybe they should have paid him a little more than $10,000, but I think he's happy just to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  get anything. $10,000 is a lot. I remember, I was reading an article last month about  a CEO laid off a thousand people and he gave everybody a $250 gift card. Oh my God. $200  million bonus. He literally could have gave every single person a $10 million and still got $10  million himself. That's $10 million. I was like, but you could have gave him like a hundred thousand  dollars and still made your hundred million dollar bonus. But so the fact that they gave  his guy 10 grand is great because companies usually just give you an attaboy and a gift car  for some free loot on the game and say, go on about your day. Well, and think about it. One of

Start time: 8086.22
End time: 8147.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the reasons he got a hundred million dollar bonus is because he's a cheapskate and saved the company  a lot of money by giving out $250 gift cards. Right? Yep. Exactly. That's what they reward you for.  Yes. Let's see. Is there anything else that I have missed that you guys wanted to talk about? I  thought we talked about a lot of the things, a lot of fun things. Roberto, is there any car news  that you think we should be thinking about? Oh gosh. You reported on the car and driver,  the story that we talked about, I think on Wednesday, that the National Highway Traffic  Safety Administration is getting chewed out by the NTSB, which they're both federal agencies,  but the NTSB, which investigates crashes is telling the NHTSA, which regulates self-driving,  you guys should do a better job regulating self-driving.

Start time: 8148.82
End time: 8269.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, and this is a long time sort of, I guess, clash within these government agencies. I went to  an NTSB hearing back in January of 2020 and they spent half the hearing sort of chewing out NHTSA.  That's a lot easier to say. NHTSA. That's what I'll say. They spent most of the time chewing on  NHTSA because they're saying it's not NHTSA's job to sell cars. It feels like NHTSA is, like I  just said, they don't want to stymie the development of autonomous and driver assistance features,  but there's no baseline. There's nothing to say whether or not this works well, this doesn't work  well. Without that, your average consumer doesn't know the difference between how well maybe  Mercedes-Benz adaptive cruise control works versus how well maybe Hyundai's adaptive cruise  control system works. They might be wildly different. Apparently mine is no better than  the 1995 Honda's, so I wish I'd known that. Owen. NHTSA could create a system that judges these,  that ranks them, that gives consumers the option to see how well those systems work.  Because if that's a very important feature for you, you should know how well it works compared  to the rest of the market. But also they've sort of just allowed autonomous vehicles to just be  tested on the road with other drivers. It's like the guy doing 150 miles an hour in his Lamborghini,  except now you see videos of people just driving around with their Teslas  you know, going over lines, not stopping at stoplights. It's sort of insane that  it's NHTSA's job to regulate this and they decided to have a very hands-off approach.  The NTSB is not happy about it. Yeah, I think that's right actually.

Transcript:  Maybe, I think it's a new administration, but it's not like this was something that was part  of the Trump administration. This is, you know, forever. Yeah, forever. NHTSA has sort of been  sort of hands-off with because every, and I think they were sort of sold on the tech world's,  you know, promise of a better world. We're making the world better. We're changing the world.  And then, you know, the unintended consequences of that is, you know, all the insanity we see on  Twitter, all the insanity we see on Facebook. So the unintended consequences of allowing these  automakers, and, you know, Tesla is sort of the prime example, to just beta test autonomous  features on the road. And they tell people, you know, you have to keep your hands on the  wheel and you have to keep your eyes on the road. But at the same time, you call it autopilot. You  call it full self-driving. Like, what is, you know, there's marketing and then there's reality. And  most people are listening to marketing. Fascinating story in the Apple world.

Transcript:  You might note that we have been hearing rumors Apple would have an event this Tuesday,  but no invitations have gone out. No word has gone out. A number of leakers said, oh yeah, March 23rd,  including Jon Prosser. Now Jon is saying in his latest video, Apple punked him and others.  They used a control leak, putting out that March 23rd date to the sources in Apple to capture  to catch them to out the leakers. Georgia knew that forever. Yeah, they're famous for that.  We're talking about that. When Steve Jobs was at Apple, he intentionally made up a fake project,  told a number of groups just to see who would leak it. It looks like they're doing it again.  So a number of leakers who said there would be an event March 23rd this Tuesday, we were all  prepared to do it. I guess there's not going to be an event. And it was all an attempt.

In fact, it would be stuff you don't care about. It'd  be Apple's air tags, which have been rumored for a year and still haven't come out. I'm still hoping.  I'm still hoping. Still want it. A new iPad Pro, which we're kind of due for with this new  mini LED screen we all want to see because Apple's going to go mini LED across this whole  product line, we think.

The second one we did, we decided to do it for charity to raise money for  UNICEF. I think we raised more than 80 or $90,000. I don't remember the full amount. But I said,  foolishly, I said, if we get to $25,000, I'll get a tattoo.  And then I doubled down. See, this is why I know Jon Prosser. I didn't even say it on Twitter.  If we get to $55,000, I think I said I'll shave my head. So both happened on...  You got a tattoo? Yeah. Yeah. And on New Year's Eve, there's video of it if you really care.

You should check it out. Secondly, Lisa, I was not joking. We are doing  Twitter after dark. Come and get me. I'm here waiting for you. Don't talk to Leo. He he's not  right. I know, I know who's captain. You know, who launches shows here and I know it's not going to  talk to you. Let's get that done. Thirdly, Georgia on record for public consumption. At some point,  one day in the future, near or far, we are going to be doing a show together. It's going to be so  much fun. You should follow one of us on Twitter and then tell that other one that we should do  the show sooner. Don't bother too much because she's super busy, but just tell her how much you  would love a show between her and I, Starsky and Hutch. The banter will be amazing. So just  bother her about that randomly. I appreciate you. And it's funny. The chat room was going,  was already doing that by the way. I know I'm egging them on. I want more of this. I like what the  chat room was doing and I'm pushing them forward. And lastly, I haven't been on the shows. It's like  before Christmas. I think they forgot about me. I'm in a black room. I don't know. I can't be seen,  but if you've made it so far this year and you still are paying your car note, you're still  paying your bills and your kids are still fed, give yourself a pat on the back. It has been a rough  12 months for every single person on the planet. So know that you're not alone. Know that everybody  else except for Jeff Bezos is going through the same kind of crap that you are. So give  yourself a pat on the back for going through it. And if you know anybody with kids or your kids,  make sure you show them articles like we were talking about earlier to keep them on the  straight and narrow on the internet. If you don't have kids and you're an uncle or an aunt, that is  your job and responsibility to show them those articles and keep these kids in line and give them  the help that they desperately deserve and need that they're not getting from schools.
