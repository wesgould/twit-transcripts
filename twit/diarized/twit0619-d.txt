Transcript:  Hey everybody, hey everybody.  Welcome to another episode of This Week in Tech.  I am your guest host sitting in for Leo Laporte.  I'm Jason Calacanis.  You can follow me on the Twitter at Jason.  To my right, the one, the only, my partner from Weblogs Inc.  And now the CEO of Clipisodes, Brian Alvey.  Welcome to the program.  Thanks.  To my left, the greatest gadget inventor of all time.  Who burned through over $100 million.  $205 million building the QCAT.  Dave Matthews, the founder of New Air and the Gadget Guide.  Dave, we're going to get into it.  But when you did see Amazon release the wand, your vision for the QCAT.  Which you burned basically $200 million on.

And now a venture capitalist.  He has sold out.  Two of the four people at this table have sold out and are now making investments.  Two still building companies.  And here it is everybody.  If you are watching instead of listening, here it is the QCAT.  Of course Leo Laporte has one of these in his museum of failed startups.  They had to unplug it from his laptop actually.  They did.  They're still using it.  When you see it, do you still have PTSD?  How many years of therapy does it take, Dave, to recover from a $200 million loss?  Let me just tell you.

End time: 242.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Transcript:  And you gave me points for it when we won launch with New Air.  I did.

Start time: 245.97
End time: 277.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I did.  It definitely is something that you can be proud of.  Thank you.  But it is one of those things, being ahead of the curve as a technology.  Timing is everything.  Timing is everything.  We've seen it over and over again.  But this week, there was huge news.  We all woke up this week to find out that Jeff Bezos and Amazon had bought  Whole Foods for over $13 billion.  We were wondering if he was dabbling in retail.  They opened a bookstore.  They opened this very interesting, I guess, cashier-less store for their-

Start time: 277.54
End time: 283.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's called the Go Store.  The Go Store.  You just grab things off the shelf so you don't need to scan barcodes even.

Start time: 284.10
End time: 293.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  And people were wondering, hey, is this, you know, these stores, is he just experimenting  or is this actually a takeover plan?  This is real business.  Peter, when you saw this announcement, what did you think?

Start time: 294.70
End time: 338.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, it was a bold move, right?  Because, like you said, we've seen Amazon make these sort of tentative steps into retail.  And I think a lot of us thought that their plan would be to roll out, you know,  these Amazon stores like the bookstores and things like that and start to do this more  at a slower pace.  Right.  They've dived right in with Whole Foods.  I think the speculation is that, and I tend to agree with, is that this gives them a big  footprint for being able to do groceries, right, for doing the rollout, but also to be able to  do logistics to all these very affluent neighborhoods.  It's like a last mile play in a way.  Yeah, exactly.

Start time: 338.76
End time: 345.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Because now they have hundreds of stores that are within, I don't know what percentage  of the population lives within driving distance of a Whole Foods.  Let's call it 30 miles.

Start time: 346.20
End time: 363.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's 431 Whole Foods in the US and abroad and very few are overseas.  So it's mainly in the US.  But these are very, you know, these are mainly in affluent neighborhoods,  which reach out to rich customers.  But it's also valuable real estate in and of itself.  And if they wanted to launch 431 logistics centers.

Start time: 366.17
End time: 371.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  How long would that take?  I mean, it would take years and cost them.  If they launched two or three a month, it would take forever.

Start time: 371.37
End time: 373.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  So they're diving right in.

Start time: 374.78
End time: 400.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Brian, when you look at this and you see Instacart, which is extremely popular here  in the Bay Area and a number of other places, Instacart has a multi-year deal.  Right.  Instacart is loved and they seem to have figured something out.  It was kind of terrible in the beginning.  They got everything wrong.  Over time, the shoppers have gotten better.  Is this the end of Instacart?  Is there any way Instacart comes out of this ahead in your mind?

Start time: 401.11
End time: 441.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely.  And it's because if you look at in Florida, right, Universal Studios had a deal with Marvel.  They had Marvel's Islands of Adventure.  Then Disney goes and buys Marvel.  Right.  They can't put Marvel rides in Disney World.  Oh.  So you go to Disney World in Florida and you can do everything but  Avengers, Iron Man, Superhero stuff.  You have to go to Universal for that because they have a multi-year deal.  Right.  So that's a weird situation, right?  But then it gives them the opportunity, Instacart, to go to everybody who isn't  Amazon and Whole Foods and lock them all up.  Right.  So I think that lights a fire under everybody else to start working with Instacart  and it gives them a big out to be whatever.  Let's say Amazon ends up, Whole Foods ends up 50% of the market,  50% of the rest, the other 50% is Instacart.

Start time: 442.32
End time: 451.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yes.  Yeah, that was my hot take on it as well, which is I think Instacart just got twice as valuable  Correct.  Now somebody has to buy them, Target, Walmart, obviously.  What do you think, Dave?

Start time: 452.12
End time: 482.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So this is a classic all ships rise with the tide.  Yeah.  For a while I was the in-house inventor at Radio Shack.  Right.  There were some rumors that Amazon would use Radio Shack stores while they were going  through bankruptcy as distribution centers.  Now if you think about what Whole Foods stores are like today, they're congested,  they're packed with merchandise, packed with product.  So I think this is only going to be part of Amazon's Fresh program.  Right.  Not going to have anything to do with any of the other supply chain stuff.  So you'll still be looking forward to your drone sending your next package down.

Start time: 483.22
End time: 492.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Now Radio Shack, it's interesting that you mentioned that.  So you worked at Radio Shack.  Was that also a company that you killed when you were there?  Like did you drive that one also straight to the ground?

Start time: 493.10
End time: 496.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I left in 2004, so about then.  Yeah, they closed that.

Start time: 497.08
End time: 497.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That's what it is.

Start time: 498.15
End time: 503.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  7,000 stores down to just hundreds now.  Are there still Radio Shack stores?  There are.  There are.  There's a handful.

Start time: 503.46
End time: 504.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  What do they do at Radio Shack stores now?

Start time: 504.80
End time: 505.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They sell Sprint phones now.

Start time: 506.94
End time: 509.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So basically they're just a place to sell phones.

Start time: 509.46
End time: 510.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, you can still buy Radio Shacky stuff.

Start time: 510.68
End time: 514.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Why didn't they make them into like hack a day, hacking maker spaces?  So we did that.  Wasn't that your plan?

Start time: 514.92
End time: 528.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So I was part of the editorial team on Make Magazine as well,  and I brought Make and Radio Shack together, but at that time there were no kits.  Arduino was just still lab stuff, and we finally got maker kits inside the stores.  But by then it was too late.

Start time: 529.16
End time: 535.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This experiential retail seems to be the thing people want to do,  and they just miss that timing again.

Start time: 536.54
End time: 539.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A great example of a store you've probably been to,  Peter, the LittleBit store in Manhattan.

Start time: 540.24
End time: 541.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't been to it, but I know where it is.

Start time: 541.54
End time: 542.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Explain to people what the LittleBit store is.

Start time: 542.86
End time: 567.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So LittleBits are magnetic computers that you stick the modules together,  so sensors and Wi-Fi modules, and it's great for kids because,  speaking of Father's Day, you can clip these together,  and because of the polarity of the magnets, you can never put voltage in the wrong way.  They've created an experiential store in New York, so you can go in and you can  essentially have birthday parties and field trips at this store  and learn how to program very rudimentary.

Start time: 568.44
End time: 584.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  When you see the wand come out, we were joking before that the wand is,  and I saw you were playing with it, so here it is, the first time I've actually ever held it.  It is just unbelievable to hold your invention, the QCAT, on the wand here.  When did you release the 1.0 of the QCAT?

Start time: 585.80
End time: 596.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The QCAT you're looking at now is called a PS2 wedge,  and back in the day there were PS2 connectors.  We started inventing this in 1997, so 20 years ago, about to the day when the wand came out.

Start time: 596.68
End time: 601.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  The device is essentially the same size, and the technology is,  it's got a barcode reader on the top.

Start time: 601.62
End time: 619.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This one uses a camera to read it, this one uses an optical sensor,  that's more like what the mouse would use, and when we invented this,  the optical mouse wasn't even invented yet, so we had to create a lot of new technologies.  Cloud computing wasn't around, so we literally bought Dell boxes and racked them up in server banks.  We had to build our own cloud.

Start time: 620.96
End time: 621.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Obviously not wireless.

Start time: 622.30
End time: 649.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not, but we did have a wireless, we partnered with Cross.  This has never been seen before.  This is a pen, a wireless pen.  Cross pen, on one end is a pen, on the other end is a ruby tipped roller scanner,  and you can scan and hold.  A barcode, you just run across the barcode.  And then we also had the key fob as well.  The key fob again, a portable one, and what's really clever about these  is they modulated their tips, the light, just like an IR protocol that was a modified protocol  to send the data down.

Start time: 650.04
End time: 655.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Now what is this device, the Amazon Wand, for?  You were playing with it, what do you think is the use case?

Start time: 656.12
End time: 669.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Instagram video, if you guys look at at ggdm, you can see the video of it working.  Exactly, so the button on it, and it's not connected to the wi-fi here,  but it is a nice guy, it has a decent speaker in it, surprisingly,  and you can push the button.

Start time: 669.64
End time: 673.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'll just call it order caviar, the most expensive you have,  a double order please, thank you.

Start time: 674.72
End time: 682.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So unfortunately for Jason, but fortunately for my bank account,  that will not go through because there's no wi-fi connected to it,  but that's essentially the use case.

Start time: 682.04
End time: 693.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I'll just call it order 20 pounds of foie gras.  There it is.  Nice.  But the poor thing is people are listening to Twitter right now.  I just said that it'll be right.  Just ordered 20 grams.  By the way, there's been a run on foie gras.

Start time: 693.74
End time: 719.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I've just been hacked because she said,  we'll restore the connection and then put the order through.  Fantastic.  When you go to the bathroom, we're going to order a ton of embarrassing products.  And then the scanner, the QCAT, you had to touch the optical surface,  and this scanner you can use a few inches away, and Red Bean comes out.  So it's $20, but it's subsidized with your first order with it.  So it's essentially free, and it's sold out now immediately, of course,  because it's net free.

Start time: 719.42
End time: 720.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Peter, what does that cost to make, you think?

Start time: 721.72
End time: 745.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it costs very little at this point.  I mean, you can buy these wi-fi chipsets,  and I don't think it requires very much to run.  Runs off two AAAs.  Yeah, to run a scale.  And so I would say that they're probably break even on them.  I think it'd probably cost them $15, $20, but they assume that they're going to sell  enough extra stuff by having these people's homes that it's totally worth the loss.

Start time: 745.88
End time: 771.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Are you going to get one, and do you think that this is a,  this combination of the wand and let's just call it Walmart Instacart,  because we'll assume that they'll keep the Instacart relationship,  and in other markets where they don't have Instacart,  they'll make their own Amazon Fresh delivery.  Do you think that this is going to be the standard for all homes in the United States  within whatever reach of a city, is that you'll never go to a grocery store unless you really want to?

Start time: 771.72
End time: 797.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think that as someone who's been an Instacart user since,  I mean, it was first introduced in New York when I lived in New York,  there is a convenience factor that is really hard to overlook, right,  when you have something like this.  There are definitely some things that you miss by not going to a grocery store,  and in fact, grocers are actually starting to notice that it's actually hard to upsell you  when you have a list of things that you always order all the time,  and then for a lot of new food brands.

Start time: 797.52
End time: 799.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  But that's their problem, not ours.

Start time: 799.14
End time: 801.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not exactly, but-  People magazine's problem and the checkout line.

Start time: 801.68
End time: 812.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you can imagine that if you are trying to introduce a new food brand right now,  you have a real challenge, because the end case was one of the ways that grocery stores  tried to promote new products, and in fact-

Start time: 813.96
End time: 816.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  When you say the end case, you're probably what that is, the end cap.

Start time: 816.56
End time: 824.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So yeah, at the end of the aisle, where, and companies will actually pay to rent that space  to promote their new product, whatever it is.

Start time: 824.50
End time: 830.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Which is why sometimes you go to the grocery store and you'll see your coffee brand in the  coffee aisle and also in the end cap.  Exactly.  You're paid for that opportunity.

Start time: 831.10
End time: 841.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And so it's a source of revenue that grocery stores will have to forego,  because it's less valuable real estate if people aren't coming in.  If most of the people walking down your aisles are Instacart shoppers, it's not as valuable.

Start time: 841.92
End time: 845.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Brian, you live in the East Bay here in the Bay Area.  Do you have Instacart?

Start time: 847.10
End time: 852.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I have a family and we load up the car and we bring it home.  But there are buildings in San Francisco.  And by the way, we're sorry.

Start time: 853.48
End time: 862.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  In a way, when you hear that he goes to the grocery store, do you feel pity for Brian?  I literally feel bad for you that you have to go there.  It gets me away from the pets.

Start time: 862.82
End time: 886.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Costco used to be exciting.  I find it torturous to go.  Now Costco is the worst place on earth.  No, you pick your times.  But in San Francisco, there are buildings that one of the selling points is,  they have a deal with Safeway.  Well, while you're at work, you put in your order.  And it's not even through an Instacart or an Amazon or anything like that.  It's just whatever, you know, a Peapod or whatever Safeway is using or what these grocery stores.  And they will just come and they have a key to your apartment.  They will unload it all into your cabinets and into your refrigerator and freezer.

Start time: 886.98
End time: 909.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you actually will see that buildings are being new buildings, apartment buildings,  are being designed to be able to take in groceries, right?  And they have special rooms that are, you know, cooled and things like that.  Or they'll have the apartments designed with special, you know,  containers just adjacent to the front door.  But also because of Amazon, apartment buildings are just generally having to redesign  their mail rooms and things like that to accommodate.  It's too many packages.

Start time: 909.28
End time: 931.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But what's new is old.  And just like the Amazon wand is just like my 20 year old invention,  my apartment in San Francisco from 1929 had an ice box.  It was a box that you would put ice in and it had two doors,  one door on the outside where the milkman would come with the milk in  and load it up with a cube of, you know, brick of ice.  And then the other door was on the inside of the house to let me retrieve that milk.

Start time: 931.92
End time: 938.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you know, package security is actually, I mean, I'm on Nextdoor  and half the posts are people complaining about their Amazon packages being stolen.

Transcript:  How do these people not have a ring doorbell or a butterfly or drop in?

Start time: 941.94
End time: 947.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's funny because ring is now what I think one of the biggest advertisers on Nextdoor.  It is. It's interesting. Yeah.  And I just had one installed last week.

Start time: 948.40
End time: 949.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  You had a ring doorbell.

Start time: 949.08
End time: 952.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, I had cameras before, but I figured it was just a lot simpler to have them all in one.

Start time: 952.16
End time: 956.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  How many cameras does everybody here have in their homes right now? Security cameras?

Start time: 957.52
End time: 968.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have eight or nine.  Yeah. Well, I did Slingbox. So I would put cameras literally everywhere,  like one on top of the Transamerica building, one on top of the Golden Grape Bridge toll pass through.  So I have cameras scattered about.

Start time: 968.80
End time: 974.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Yeah. I'm not talking about your work for the CIS. I'm talking just strictly about your home.  Just four.  How many do you have, Brian?

Start time: 977.64
End time: 990.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  I think I'm up to six or seven now, just everywhere on the property because the doors all have it.  Does anybody here worry with all of these cameras and also obviously microphones  about privacy and these things being hacked?

Start time: 990.36

Transcript:  Voice box. Yeah. You literally have NSA front doors that are sitting in your living rooms, right?  You're trusting that that wake up word means no data is being sent. But as soon as there's a  compromise, all that data, all that voice data gets to go to the cloud.

Transcript:  I think it's unlikely that either has been compromised. I think Amazon and Google have  very strong network security. I think that if you have a random webcam that you purchase on  Amazon from a Chinese OEM for 40 bucks, I think that the I would say it's pretty strong. I'm not  going to say it's 100 percent, but there's a chance it's capable of being hacked. Absolutely.  And I think that there's actually now a number of services. They're actually boxes you can now  connect to your network at home, which will monitor the traffic from those devices and see,  are they you know, is there suddenly a lot of outbound traffic going to some random server in

Transcript:  Nikki and I disagreed with about this at our old house about inside versus outside cameras.  She was firmly against the inside ones. I'm like, what about babysitters and nannies and stuff like  that? Don't you want to know? Right. She's like, I don't want to be spied on because the people who  install them and then the people downstream from that and then the other thing like I just don't  trust any of them. So we ended up with all outdoor cameras, nothing on the inside. And then every  now and then we'd be like, damn, I wish we could roll back in that argument we were just having and  show you what you say. Oh, yeah. No, I have one argument that way. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. No,

So we're still together.  All right. When we get back from this very brief pause for the cause, we're going to talk about  Apple's new Siri device. And if anybody here is going to pay $3,850 or whatever insane price  they're going to be $349. I'm sorry, only $349 for a device that's 50 or $99 from everybody else. We

Transcript:  Technology, you're great at branding. Let's leave it to Peter Rojas. He came up with the  name Gizmodo and an AI gadget as well.  That is true.  True.  So Apple, which was ahead of everybody with Siri, they were ahead of everybody with Siri.  Finally, announces at the WWDC that they're going to have a speaker that you can talk to with Siri.  Why did it take them so long, Peter?  Why does Siri seem to me to be so far behind?  It just doesn't seem to work as well. Am I right?  When using them, when I use my iPhone, I feel like Siri is constantly just sending me to the web  and it kind of answers my questions. It doesn't make any sense to me.

Start time: 1397.74
End time: 1444.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they acquired Siri. It was an acquisition. So that team came in via acquisition.  It was a product that was earlier along and Amazon continued to invest in their voice-based  assistants and their AI behind powering it and their speech recognition.  Amazon did.  Amazon did. Apple became, I think, a little bit complacent.  And then at the same time, Google recognized that this was going to be an important area  and has invested a tremendous amount of resources buying talent, making strategic acquisitions of  other companies, things like that. I think Apple has a lot of stuff going on and I think that  Siri kind of fell by the wayside. And now they're starting to catch up.  Now with the HomePod, it's not going to come out until later this year.  HomePod. Terrible name.

Start time: 1444.70
End time: 1447.92

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, iPad's a great name.  No, no, no. The iPad 3. We were talking about, and it shows past, the hardware of the iPad 3.  It was terrible hardware that Steve would have never let ship.  I don't think he would have let them name this as well.

Start time: 1463.00
End time: 1494.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  He would have said, who came up with that name? And then he would have said,  who wants that person's job? It's sort of what he did with, what was there in iCloud before iCloud?  It was MobileMe.  MobileMe.  And he's like, how is MobileMe supposed to work? And they explain.  He goes, why the F doesn't it work like that?  He's barred everybody. He's like, why isn't that in the movie?  That's got to be in the Steve Jobs 2.0 movie.  Why is it so expensive?  That's the other thing I don't understand.  I know Apple has a premium, but this seems wildly disproportionately priced compared to Amazon.

Start time: 1494.44

Transcript:  It's a higher quality speaker than you're going to get from the Echo or from the Google Home.  So it's bigger and has...  Better than a Sonos?

Start time: 1501.90
End time: 1523.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So the press was there listening to the Sonos Play 3 and the Amazon Echo.  And Echo sounded like AM radio.  And the Apple speaker, there's a four inch driver mounted centrally for bass.  And then seven tweeters around it.  And then it listens to its own heartbeat.  So it tunes to the space.

Start time: 1523.74
End time: 1530.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So you mean if the sound behind it, if it's on a bookshelf, if it hits the wall,  it knows don't send so much sound that way.

Start time: 1530.70
End time: 1533.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's been onkyo receivers and receivers for many, many years that would put a microphone  in the middle of your room and it would tune your home theater.  So it does make sense.  But what I found with the Trueplay, it's not only the pain and the ass factor, but...

Start time: 1557.86
End time: 1558.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  Trueplay is the Sonos standard.

Start time: 1559.00
End time: 1570.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trueplay is from Sonos.  And these are all licensed technologies that companies have been working on in the sound  space for years.  But I actually found I lost bass that I had before.  So I don't use Trueplay for that matter.

Start time: 1570.22
End time: 1573.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  So the reason it's so much more expensive is that it's really beautiful.

Start time: 1573.84
End time: 1580.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Beautiful and they have the M8 chip in it, which is the same chip that runs the iPhone 6.

Start time: 1582.56
End time: 1584.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  That costs a serious bang.  So it's basically an iPhone inside there.

Start time: 1585.26
End time: 1591.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's just like the Apple TV.  The latest generation Apple TV is essentially an iPhone as well with memory and processing  power.

Start time: 1591.42
End time: 1628.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think that they will have a cheaper version down the line.  I think that they want to position this first as...  I think they want to set expectations around what it's going to be.  For audio files, is there...  And I think it's actually one of the mistakes that they made with Siri was that when they  introduced Siri, they positioned as this sort of all-knowing how like assistant that could  answer your queries.  And it turns out it wasn't that.  It was actually really good at a very narrow set of tasks.  And so I think with the HomePod, what they're trying to do is reposition it as an audio,  as something for playing music first.  Right.  It's a Sonos killer in their mind.  Yeah.  The position is a Sonos killer and Sonos is worried, as they should be.

Start time: 1629.24
End time: 1630.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They knew this was coming at some point.  Yeah.

Start time: 1631.42
End time: 1638.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I think that the stuff that Apple's done around AirPlay in the past sort of hinted  that something like this was in the works.

Start time: 1639.60
End time: 1652.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  They also seem to play nice with Sonos in that they let Sonos be in the store.  You used to be able to buy a Sonos in the store.  So now that this is out, is there a policy to kick Sonos out of the store?  I don't think so.

Start time: 1652.74
End time: 1655.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's happened with some products.  I mean, it has happened here and there, but...

Start time: 1656.08
End time: 1657.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's never on day one.  Yeah.

Start time: 1657.34
End time: 1664.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It happens.  Ah.  I think there was like the spat with...  I think Fitbits originally sold in the store at some point.  And then they're like, yeah, no more watches.

Start time: 1664.14
End time: 1667.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_13

Transcript:  And then Fire TV, Amazon had a battle with Apple and now...  The latest announcement, they said that you can now watch Amazon video on Apple TVs now.

Start time: 1678.98
End time: 1719.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  This is interesting too, because I talked to somebody from...  How do I say this without...  I talked to an interested party, so I'll say.  I talked to an interested party and they said that Apple was demanding that Amazon pay them  to put them on the Apple TV.  And Amazon said, we're not going to pay you for the privilege of being on there.  And they held their ground.  Do you think people are paying to be on the Apple TV?  Because people do pay to be in the stores, essentially, by having to give a massive margin  to Apple.  That's when people don't know.  Apple negotiates with each of those people and makes them pay a very high margin,  is my understanding.  Is that your understanding as well?

Start time: 1719.90
End time: 1749.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So, I mean, it depends.  I mean, I'm sure that Apple and HBO, for example, have some sort of arrangement  that gives Apple a slice of maybe that recurring revenue.  For subscriptions that are generated from an Apple price.  Got it.  Maybe they get a bounty or something.  Yeah.  So that wouldn't surprise me.  I had heard something similar around Amazon holding firm and refusing to pay.  There's not a good model.  It doesn't establish a good precedent for Amazon.

Start time: 1750.46
End time: 1779.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It was dumb, I think, Brian, because when I had the Apple TV and I have Amazon Prime,  and all of a sudden Amazon Prime starts having Transparent and some other good shows.  Netflix is orange is the new black.  But Transparent was on Amazon.  And there was some good stuff on Amazon.  And I was like, OK, now I'm going to go use my Samsung smart hub, which is built in.  And then I was thinking about getting the Roku.  And I found myself looking at the Samsung smart hub and my family now,  they don't turn on the Apple TV.  They use the Samsung one because they just got used to it.  It's good enough.

Start time: 1779.68
End time: 1799.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Same thing with my LG.  I think that's actually one of the challenges for a lot of these connected devices,  is that all of them have the same services on them at some point.  They all kind of converge.  And so if you don't play, if Apple TV,  if Apple blocks popular services from being on their device,  it actually makes people not want to use it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We already did it just with the Apple TV.  But it gets really complicated because we find we're paying for showtime three different ways.  We're paying through the com guest cable we have.  We're paying for showtime because we needed it at one point for something we wanted to watch.  And then I think if you buy Hulu every month separately.  So it's a la cart stuff just kind of.  It's getting really confusing.  Get out of control and really complicated because I think we're paying for.  I love showtime.

Right.  Which is notice that I'm on the phone.  So you're back up to your 200 bucks with a cable company.  I think I'm at 100 and change.  Yeah.  Nice.  And the DirecTV was costing me 200 a month to have all the channels.

Start time: 1847.38

Transcript:  Hey speaking of Amazon which you know I think that this M&A  trend that we're seeing mergers and acquisition is in my mind just the beginning.  I think we're entering an era of big M&A that we haven't seen since time one or AOL.  And I think these are going to start becoming not just 10 billion dollar acquisitions but I think  we're starting to see some maybe 25 50 billion dollar acquisition maybe even 100 billion dollar  acquisition as companies like Amazon start to and Apple start to trend towards a trillion dollar  valuation.  One of those rumors is that Amazon wants to buy Slack for nine billion dollars and that Slack  is going to raise 500 million at five billion.  And that's on the table that seems very likely to me.  And the that Slack is at a billion dollar run right now a billion dollar run right.  Why is it not profitable billion dollar run rate?  Yeah that's fine.  Who's uninstalling Slack once you have it integrated it's impossible to

Transcript:  And Slack specifically has that massive integration suite where people are putting their  Trello or their you know schedule.  Your new inbox.  It's a new inbox there's so many things connected.  Why does Amazon if they are in fact interested and it seems like this is where they smoke this fire  Peter why do they want well because they don't do enterprise computing.  Why would they do this?

Start time: 1956.92
End time: 1975.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's actually first of all they have AWS right.  So they have a very strong tie in to enterprise.  But that's for developers.  Well this is a this is a but they also have time which is like it's for which is video  conferencing enterprise focused video conferencing.  They also have an email service for enterprise which people are not aware of.

Start time: 1978.70
End time: 2029.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No but they actually have like a like a like a outlook type competitor.  I have no idea.  And so unless I'm completely making that up.  So they think so.  So I so there is an enterprise kind of stealth enterprise strategy at Amazon where they feel  like they need to be competitive.  They need to have a service offering you know in this area.  And so they're I mean Amazon views everyone as its competitor Apple Google Microsoft Netflix.  Everyone is their competitor.  And so and so it is insane.  But if you're Jeff Bezos you see that you don't want to have any point of weakness in  your company which is a little crazy.  It is crazy.  But if you think of it from his perspective it's that since everyone is competitor he  casted he has to basically play offense with every single market.

Start time: 2032.44

Start time: 2077.33
End time: 2123.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure.  Then then they drop and I think they would be behind.  But in terms of the race to technically be a trillion dollar company.  They're you know fourth fifth on the list.  But they're on their way.  But I think they could be the first one to get there.  If Apple's only because there's sort of nothing they can't do.  So you look at something like Facebook's in the mix there.  They're number four out of the five.  And you say could Google build a Facebook killer.  And no they tried with Google Plus.  Could Apple build a Facebook killer.  Can they do social software.  Can they do things.  No they've tried that they failed.  Could Amazon.  And you just got to stop and go I don't know.  Like they have a lot of parts.  They have a lot of things that maybe they could.  Right.  There's nothing that you look at and say could Amazon do this.  And you can be certain and say no they can't do that.  So I think they can kind of do anything.  I don't think Apple also has that massive.

Transcript:  This to me seems like the stupidest misread of their most passionate users.  The most passionate users are going crazy that they can't put in the latest NVIDIA card  and swap out RAM easily.  So what do they do?  Instead of giving them an iMac tower.  Like literally you could give those super fans the iMac tower that was two towers ago  with just the new hardware in it.  Instead of doing that they make an iMac that's five thousand dollars where you can't change  anything.  I mean what a horrible investment.

Start time: 2208.28
End time: 2235.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It was beautiful but it was a mistake because you couldn't swap the stuff out.  Peter why did they make the iMac Pro?  Is this are they clueless to what their super fans want?  The creatives because I'm hearing creatives now want to move on and are buying Windows  machines for this reason and if software is all cloud based what's the difference between  using you know Premiere or Photoshop or whatever you use as a creative on Mac or PC?  I don't think it's that big of a deal.

Start time: 2246.88
End time: 2260.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well I think that some developers are moving over and finding that for the things they  want to do having the flexibility to put in a 1080 Ti or something like that into their  machine makes it-  The new Nvidia card which is ridiculous.

Start time: 2260.78
End time: 2263.16

End time: 2298.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well yeah that's exactly I mean that's one I mean I built my own PC because I wanted  something for VR right.  And so you know building you're going to always pay less than buying.  What's the premium now?

Start time: 2299.18
End time: 2304.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  It's literally double to buy a Mac right?  For five thousand dollars what you get from the iMac Pro for five thousand.

Start time: 2304.44
End time: 2310.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They marketed those.  What would it cost?  You're saving because the screen's built in.  Yeah.  Instead of a thousand dollar delta.

Start time: 2311.30
End time: 2322.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean I would say that if you were going to go and buy a super high quality 5k display  which is what the iMac Pro comes with you're probably I mean that would probably be cost  thousand dollars fifteen hundred bucks on its own.

End time: 2333.60

Transcript:  Yeah I have the LG it's gorgeous.  Yeah.  The white screen.  How much was that?  I think it's six or seven hundred.  The 5k one?  No I have the I don't have the 5k one.  So the 5k I think is like still like a thousand or something.

Start time: 2334.84

Start time: 2337.84
End time: 2361.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I do I mean I do think that there is there is a certain class of developer which is  that wants they don't want to they need something that feels future proofed in the sense that like  okay next year when Nvidia comes out with a new card I can just swap in the next one.  And certainly I would never consider buying a high end machine that I couldn't swap out  new components when when they're available.

Transcript:  Okay let's talk a little bit about the chances of these AR glasses.  Brian you're I know you have Oculus and Vive right?  Just the Vive.  Just the Vive.  Kids love it.  Yep.  What do you think the chances are Apple comes out with these VR the AR glasses.  So the next year or two because they came out with the AR kit right and people are doing  iPad videos now right.

Start time: 2386.24
End time: 2449.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No no so it's enabled the software let people get in there let them start building the apps  and then you know announce it all with the hardware.  I think they have to do it.  I think so listening to everybody here talk about Apple products.  No not this year.  I don't think they're anywhere near it.  I think if they they tease the software but don't tell you about a product like they tell  you about the speaker then it's not coming anytime soon.  So I think it's on their roadmap.  I think that could be a great thing for them by the time VR is hitting there in it or AR  is hitting there in it.  But I was just listing out different products.  I'm just not I have an Apple laptop.  I don't want to upgrade it.  I would seriously consider Windows.  Yeah I just got the surface.  It's incredible.  You know I was I was lumping in the HomePod with Siri which is just not exciting right.  It's you have to train Siri to do things you have to really think through what am I going  to tell Siri to send an email or a text right now.  I've never had to feel like that with an Alexa and I just lumped it with Maps on the watch.  Just like not exciting products not really well done products.  So the AR maybe that's the thing that comes out next where you say OK they didn't do a  TV into a car they didn't do this.  Maybe AR is going to be the next big thing.  So I'm excited for them.  But you know I'm just I'm holding my breath.  We'll wait we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They killed the second one.  They killed the second one.  Yeah.  They're well they did that mean they're going to skip right to.  They're going to skip a generation go.  Well not necessarily.  They're still focused on the enterprise component the enterprise market for this.  And I think for Microsoft it actually makes a lot of sense because they haven't.  I think they're conceding that maybe they're not going to win on consumer because they  don't have mobile.  Or any you know not anymore.

Start time: 2484.86

Transcript:  There's industrial right.  Which is you work in a factory or you're doing repairs or something like that.  You can actually have a schematic of the thing you're working on right in front of you.  The engine and it can be the and it can walk you step by step exactly.  You know go to tweak this and can actually you know in real time tell you you need to  turn that another don't cross those wires.  Stop across the wires.  Yeah.  Yeah.  You can do that.  So that's one I think medical is another.  They actually are you know surgeons are starting to use AR to be able to if they're doing you  know laparoscopy and surgery inside the body to be able to actually have a better idea  of what they're actually doing.  And then I think anything related to building architecture being able to you know walk into  a building site and be able to see exactly construction or even interior decorating.

Transcript:  It'd be fascinating when you think about surgery if you were a medic in the field or you were  in some you know region that didn't have a hospital close to you and somebody needs to  have their appendix taken out a local doctor who's never done it could put these glasses on.  And if they know how to use basic surgical techniques they could literally walk through  an obscure thing or like Ellie and Covenant where she gives herself.  Sure.  No no I think takes out the.

Transcript:  mean I I use tweetbot I why what do you like better about tweetbot you know it just it feels  slightly more power user I guess uh and um any specific feature you love uh so I I think that um  I just find the ui to be more intuitive and less kind of cluttered should twitter open up and just

Start time: 2933.80
End time: 2942.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  let any even with the new ui it's not do whatever they want it wasn't that the strength of twitter  is that they kind of just let people you know a thousand different flowers bloom so there is a

End time: 3012.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  path not taken right which is so twitter they hit a crossroads I can't this is maybe like seven  years ago where they had a path which is either to be essentially a metered api business right or an  advertising driven business and if they were going to be an ad driven business they had to kill the  third-party eco developer ecosystem because so they could control the uh where all the ads are  served right uh with all these third-party clients uh like tweet deck yeah uh and remember there was  a company that was going to acquire that was acquiring all these third-party clients right  and uh and they uh had an offer to buy tweet deck twitter realized because tweet deck had so much of  this traffic that they couldn't do this and actually the plan for this other company which  I can't remember what it is right now it's one of the guys from um ideal at bill gross's company  right one of his companies they were going to basically take all these third-party clients  and then introduce their own ad network no twitter like protocol because twitter was going down all  the time right and they were going to introduce it as here's a backup protocol so when twitter  goes down you can still get your messages as long as you're on one of these clients right and then  eventually they were going to try to wean people away right from twitter entirely it was kind of  gangster like how they were trying to like didn't work didn't work because is there room for somebody

Transcript:  think that people are too entrenched it's look I mean are you a mastodon right uh I I created an  account I you know set up I I didn't set up my own instance but if people aren't familiar with  mastodon but it's essentially like an open source federated version of twitter where everybody can  set up their own server right and sort of like having minecraft servers or or email frankly or  bit torrent it's an open standard nobody can control it and the the different instances you  know they can decide their own rules for what they accept in terms of speech and and federating to  other other instances and it's gotten a little bit of traction I think it maybe has like four  or five hundred thousand users but it isn't growing that quickly but um it it you know it would be it  has some of the um the nice things about early days of twitter it's very open developers can create  their own experiences around and things like that I would love to see somebody create a b corporation

Start time: 3069.06
End time: 3092.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_13
Transcript:  which is a benefit corporation not quite a non-profit but not a marauding company to create  literally a clone of instagram facebook and twitter literal clones that were  that had ads to support them but that were made to be privacy first and consumer first right  and literally just copy facebook because facebook has no problem copying everybody else

End time: 3168.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  good idea so remember so cool remember app.net yes um I had I paid for it I paid for it too but  they had the wrong model which was they should not have charged the users they should have charged  the developers right and it should have been for the first 10 000 50 000 calls to the api free of  course after that you pay but you want to put ads on your client you don't want ads in your client  whatever you want to do yeah and if twitter had taken that strategy and said here's what we're  going to be we're not going to be an ad platform because actually competing against facebook and  google at scale is unless you're at their scale is very difficult um they own the online ad no ad  businesses but if you had said look we're going to be this infrastructure play so to speak and  developers can just pay us by the pound for api calls I think twitter would have a probably a much

Transcript:  like that that um and I just want to point out that we did get 57 minutes into the program before  saying the word Trump I think we deserve a little bit of a golf club for that it was it was it was  pretty big accomplishment here is the undercurrent this is something I was hearing amongst industry  people and I don't want to sound like a conspiracy theorist but I'm going to I'm going to float for  you what was floated for me in a group discussion amongst people who are extremely respected  okay and then yes the chat room can take a drink because we did mention Trump and I did mention  inside connections and information okay but I haven't name dropped anybody yet um you hear  about this in your tesla I was actually on a phone call my tesla drink holy what yeah but I was in  the I was in the model s not the x got it oh so you have two three I was the serial number one  okay good now everybody's now the chat room can always drink they're just plastered they just  collapsed yeah here's the crazy this is the crazy theory is it theory ever okay we all saw Zuckerberg  going out and saying I'm going to meet everybody in 50 states contractor and he like shows up at  people's houses very weird right like why is he doing this he's got a company to run is he going  to run for president or whatever and I said you know what I don't think that he's running for  he might run for some office of course he talked about it secretly with Marc Andreessen that came  out in a lawsuit or a shareholder lawsuit because he wanted to take two years off or something and  Marc Andreessen was trying to figure out how to finagle that with his board but it turns out there  was this company the Analytica company Cambridge analytics that had spent a large yeah it's very  well known that a large amount of money went into that company to buy ads on Facebook right  somebody pointed out Facebook verifies every ad if you want to place an ad there's somebody  who looks at the ad they will never as this person pointed out to me ever allow you to put an  affiliate link in there it's against the terms of service if you put too much text I've seen this  happen on an image they don't let you put text on images because they can't read it baked in right  it's baked in so therefore they don't let you do that so there's like massive filters I've seen  maybe 10 or 20 percent of the ads we do at launch for launch festival whatever get kicked back  okay so they're verifying the ads Trump's buying the ads now this is where the theory gets  interesting they know that they're doing ads that are targeted to the people not to get people to  vote to to vote for Trump they know they're not going to get people to vote for Trump it's very  hard to get people to switch but there was a group of people who came out to vote for Obama who hadn't  previously voted in elections right there was massive turnout Obama had the best turnout ever  those people were targeted yeah yeah this is this is known yeah so they used Facebook  to target those people those people are African American in some cases and in these specific  sync states so there was a big controversy that Facebook was allowing targeting people by race  yeah and the color of their skin so now you have Zuckerberg potentially having to explain  how he allowed the platform let fake news now you had fake news to it a lot of these ads were fake  news so they were putting fake news on to get people to not vote for Hillary who were from  certain demographics okay this is a really bad picture now there's an investigation occurring  the investigation is going to be asked doing discovery the Facebook has not released the ads  that they approved the ads are going to come out what do the ads say nobody knows  except for Facebook and the people who did it then you add another layer and this is where it  becomes totally insane what if the Russians were stealing the names of these people and broke into  the voter registration logs there is a rumor yeah I'd heard that's been going around that the way  the Russians were able to help were that they had the list of the voters they had the Democrats list  of the voters because they hacked the DNC right well and they're yeah and that's why they're  trying to get into local voting servers so they weren't trying to switch the technology in the  voting but they were able to hack in and get lists of voters they got the list of voters they got  them to Cambrian Cambridge Cambridge Analytica they got Facebook to run fake news ads in this  theory Facebook approved the ads Facebook got people to not show up so and it's all going to  come out because of the crazy investigation going on now Mueller's you know he's interviewing um
