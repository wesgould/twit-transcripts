I have to  apologize for last week's show. What a stinker. Actually, I didn't get a lot of email, but now  that John C. Dvorak and Will Harris are back, we can relax and enjoy ourselves. Hello, John.  Hey there. Happy New Year. Haven't seen you since. No, yeah, you were in Egypt. Yes, I was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have to talk about that on this show. All right. Well, before we do that, let me say hello

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to Will Harris, who's in the UK. It's kind of the Egypt of Northern Atlantic. I'm not sure that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  true, but why not? You got Stonehenge. No, actually, no, I think it is too, because they have most of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Egypt's artifacts in their British Museum. Damn straight. It was, you know, those poor Egyptians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They were robbed. There's more of Egypt in London than there is in Egypt. You go to the Cairo Museum

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of Antiquities, and right in the front is the Rosetta Stone. Of course, the most important  artifact in all of Egypt, but it's a reproduction. It says, well, the real one's at the British Museum.  Sorry. Sorry. We don't have it. Joining us soon, I hope Molly Wood from Buzz Out Loud, she's  she's she stood me up a lot of times and she said, I won't do it again. So, you know, I think if she  does stand me up this time, she's going to have to grow a mullet. She has a mullet. Doesn't she have a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  mullet? She kind of does. I wasn't going to say anything. That's horrible. She's the only woman

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  in high tech that actually has a mullet. Which is also called a sholo, short and front long in the back.  It just bangs. On a woman, it's okay. It's a problem on a man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it depends on how it's cut. There is a cut that is distinctively a mullet  that women have and Molly has one. Does she really? No, she doesn't. Where is she to defend herself?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Egypt was really amazing. I mean, it was great to see all the, you know, the pyramids and all those,  you know, amazing things. Did you get to go to that nighttime light show? Yeah, I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, did you? I did. Is that famous? Oh, yeah. It's kind of cheesy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They shine big colored lights on the pyramids and then they have this big speakers and the guy goes,  the Nile. I have flooded every year for thousands of years. I bring life to the land of Kemet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am So Cyrus. I am the god. And you know, it's like that. It's a little cheesy. But you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's fun because you're sitting under the pyramids and the Sphinx is there too and you're  sitting under the pyramids and the Sphinx is there too and he lights up and the Sphinx talks  kind of funny because he doesn't have a nose. Do they have like the animatronic thing? No,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it doesn't move. It's like you should do like a Disney level. Hey, you know, they should do what

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Disney does where they project, you know, you take a solid object, then you project a face on it and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have the face talk. Oh yeah, that's how they do the haunted house. Right, they do it with the haunted

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  house. They should throw up, they should project a face onto the Sphinx and have the thing talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I am the Sphinx. My beard is in the British Museum. It is too, by the way. Oh, is that right? He

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  took his beard. Between the two of us, we'll have had the best holiday ever. And then, where'd you go?  Where'd you go? No, like I just go to the British Museum. You go to the British Museum. Then we  superimpose them together. I have to say though. You know, that's the ancient Egypt and then

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there's the modern Egypt, which is in crisis and the Egyptians constantly say, what happened?  You know, the population is growing 100,000 a month. They have nowhere to put these people. Cairo  is 16 million people. Yeah, that's bad. Third largest city in the world. And you know what?  We're in the hotel heart of downtown Cairo. You go two blocks, it's dirt roads and donkeys.  It's a big city, but it's not a modern city. Yeah. No streetlights. I mean, no traffic, well,  no streetlights, but no traffic lights. Everybody just goes. Did you rent the car?  No, I didn't drive. Are you kidding? Everybody says, and now I agree completely, if you haven't  been raised in Cairo, you should not attempt to drive in Cairo. It's crazy. Crazy. Anyway,  I quite enjoyed it. It was a wonderful thing. And we learned a lot about modern  Middle East politics and so forth. And that was fascinating. Oh, the Middle Easterners,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've been to the Middle East a couple of times. When you go there, they love to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do. You know, there's a little bit of a love hate thing in Egypt. It's a Muslim nation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, all the Middle Eastern countries except Israel are, but they still love to talk to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They like to argue. They like to argue. They're smart, warm, interesting people. The problem is,  they also, you know, this is the number two nation for US foreign aid, right after Israel. We sent  them 1.8 billion a year and they're a little dependent. I mean, everybody asks for money.  You take a picture, guy goes, okay, where's my money? You can't go to the bathroom. You're  going to the bathroom, the guy will hand you toilet paper and ask for money. And it's like,  if you don't give him money, you don't get any toilet paper. Is he in the stall with you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Practically. It's a little weird. Anyway, let's talk-  Would you like another sheet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do. They give you like two sheets. And it's, yeah, exactly. You know, you're going to need

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  more. Anyway. Wait, is that just the accent? Or do you mean?  No. Like the paper?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sheet of toilet paper. All right. Let's talk tech. John, I'm going to put John in charge  because I didn't know this, but now John does a daily news show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Tech5.podshow.com. If you want to check it out. Actually, you go to the blog. I posted  on the blog with a link to the player. You can just go to devorek.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do you, I mean, you're not notorious for, I don't know, being somebody who wants to do  a daily TV show. Let's put it that way. I don't want to. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I've done a daily TV show if you haven't noticed. And the, as a matter of fact, nobody did notice.  What was your daily TV show?  It was the Silicon Spin was daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was daily? I guess I only watched it once a week. No, you're right. Of course that was daily.  What was I thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And that was for four years. That was enough. And so I can do daily, but you know, I started  doing this daily five minute thing, which is just a wrap up. It's just mostly me making snide remarks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  about the news. I mean, it's not like, it's audio and you just record it at home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's all audio. I do it right here with the, through this mic. But the thing is, is that  I have to know now I have to download all the news for the day. And so it makes me keep up,  which is something, as you know, I don't like to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, let's start. Let's start with story. Number one, charter communications,  deleting 14,000 email. Yeah. That's funny. Just deleting them. Now, hopefully they have all that  stuff back. No, they don't. They say we have no backups. It's not our policy. It's your job to  back up your email. That stuff is gone. No. Yes. 14,000 everybody in the, everybody in their right

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  mind who is an ISP of any sort or email provider maintains Mark Perkel, the guy who does computer  time, see time.com, the guy where I get no spam guy. He backs up every four hours. And when  something blows up, the worst case scenario is you've lost four hours. And that's my, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's everybody assumes your internet service providers backing up. Charter says,  Oh, we can't for legal reasons. It's your property. This is all bogus. It's bogus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All you have to do is have in the license agreement. There's no legal thing. That's  bull. Obviously somebody should be fired. Oh, they said, and here's the other thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They said, well, it was a software. They always say it was a software glitch. What they apparently,  what they do is they allow each subscriber to have up to 10 email, free email accounts.  But they do periodically comb through them. And if they're inactive after a certain period of time,  they delete them. Well, these 14,000 accounts were active, but the software thought they were  inactive. I don't think it was software. I think it was something. Oh, that sounds like a bogus

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  argument. I think somebody should bring these guys to court and sue their pants off.  Head should roll. Absolutely. There's no, no excuse for not backing this stuff up.  I mean, what does a hard disk cost? You can buy terabytes for a hundred to a couple hundred bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  at Costco. I agree. And you know, I think everybody assumes that this stuff is backed up. That's why  you keep it on your internet service provider. You assume that they're going to, they're going

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  to take care of it. Right. Yeah. No, it's inexcusable. Your mail. You've got no mail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That must've been a horrible thing for those people. Okay. What's story number two, Mr. D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So I understand, you know, the WordPress guys are getting money now.  Venture capital money. That's a lot of money. 30 million. What? Is this for WordPress.com or?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a 49 million dollars as an investment into WordPress. It was 29 when I read it.  No, so it's, so I believe it's 49 and the majority of that went to buy out the co-founders.  So Matt Mullenweg is now a rich man. Well, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now I got it. Now that's not the way the story. I don't think so.  Here's the way I I've been trying to get the story and I haven't gotten ahold of Matt,  but there's a company called automatic, which is a spin off of WordPress.  That's the company that does the online stuff. Right. They do WordPress.com. Yep.  Right. And that's different than the WordPress that us users out here that just, you know,  use the code on our own servers. That's just an open source project.  Which is an open source project, which I understand will continue to exist as such.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, so Matt got 29 to 49. You know, I'm seeing numbers all over the place on the, on the internet.  33 million 30 29.5. So it's clearly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Welcome to the internet and it's high degree of accuracy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, which, which should I trust here? CNET news.com. That's the same company.  They have different numbers.  I love that.  Yeah. Well, anyway, roughly 29.5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  By the way, there's a good story we should discuss.  What's that?  You know, those guys in New York are trying to take over CNET.  Who? What guys?  Jenna.  Who's Jenna?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do I look it up? Jenna partners.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They.  Is it a hostile takeover?  Well, it's like right now they're trying to, to, to oust the board or at least put some of their  own people in. They believe that the CNET stock, which is selling for around seven to eight dollars,  is underperformed considering they invented the space.  And there's one guy in particular who's a protege of Carl Icahn has decided that this is  crap because they apparently have a huge investment in CNET and.  It says they have, they have about 10.5%.  Right. And then they, which is a lot. And then they have some other pals.  But not a voting majority.  No, that's the problem. But they think, they think they can put enough pressure on the board  to add some people because they think the company has been poorly, you know, has underperformed  to an extreme. And I was thinking about it and I think that they're probably right. And a lot of  it has to do with.  I agree. It's underperformed. Absolutely.  You know, they, I mean, it's a good company. They, they do everything. I mean, they're exactly  where they should be in the business. They invented the banner ad for all practical purposes.  You worked for them in the early days.  And back then, and they also invented that big ad in the middle that everyone uses now.  So why are they at seven bucks or whatever?  Anyway, something's going to.  I worked in the very earliest days of CNET. Halsey Miner called it the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I worked in the very earliest days of CNET. Halsey Miner called me.  And I was doing a talk radio show. He said, we need to talk because we want to do a television  network around technology. This is nobody had ever heard of such a thing. This is 1993, I think.  92 or four. Yeah, three or four. Very early. Which is Halsey, Shelby.  And I think they had one woman working for him and they were in New York City still.  We met. He was all excited. You know how, you know, you know how he can get.  Yeah, I met him too.  Halsey gets real excited. He was very enthusiastic.  And then something went wrong in our relationship. Like one weekend, he, he, he hired me.  He said, I'm going to give you equity in the company. He made me vice president programming.  And in fact, I know you know this because we did a pilot, Gastly pilot produced by your friend,  Marty Higgins. And you were in it and you were there and you and you and you were there.  And no, it was Fred Davis. I think you, Gina Smith, Stewart Alsop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't remember who was on the thing. I just remember you doing it and me in it.  I have a copy of it someplace. It was the earliest. It was like Silicon

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Spin. It was a McLaughlin group roundtable. And then, okay. And then.  You were wearing a vest as I recall. It was awful. My hair was gelled back. It was, I looked,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know what I, it was crazy. John, you've got to find this and put it on YouTube.  You should. You should. It would be highly embarrassing for all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I agree with you a hundred percent. It would be a huge hit on YouTube, except for one  thing. You have no idea how difficult it would be for me to find that. I mean, you have,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have been archiving. If you're ever stumbling through the garage late at night and you find it.  I'm telling you, you have no idea. Just send it to me. I'll digit and we'll put it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And it, you know, a lot of this, I have all the stuff from CNET that I did. I may have that one  too on old, what was that format? That big giant cassette. Oh yeah. You Matic.  You Matic. You have it on you. I have everything I ever did on CNET on you Matic.  And I did this at Silicon spin too. And because this is the way this, these companies work. And  I remember Milton Berle always complaining about the fact that they threw everything of his out.  And they always want to throw this stuff out. They never reuse the tapes or give them to a school  or anything like that. They just throw them out. And so I always keep tabs on when they're going  to throw them out and I grab them. I say, you throwing this stuff out? He said, yeah,  I'm taking it home. So I have all the stuff from CNET that I did. And then one time it was.  You have no filing system.  No, of course not. And then they have labels on them. Anyway, so then Silicon spin, when we're  doing that show, and I did that for four years, one day about a year or two into it, they, there's  somebody called them. Yeah. I said, what do they do with all the tapes? Oh, that's interesting.  You'd ask because they're going to, they have all the last year and a half. They're going to  throw them away. So I went over there with my car and loaded them up and took them home. I took,  I kept taking them home until the four years later, the, when I have all of them four years later,  which are, you know, they're not indexed four years later. Then they went to when, just as I was  ousted, they changed from recording this stuff on digital to doing it all on hard discs and then  just erasing it immediately. You couldn't get copies. No, that's right. Yeah. They moved it

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  to hard drives. Well, that's funny because I talked to the internet guys at G four. They said we have  everything, but I guess that doesn't mean all the, all the shows. They haven't got my stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So anyway, I don't think you know what I think that by the way, that's gotta be a lie  because I know for a fact they were throwing everything out. I think it's not true. They

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  might mean all the internet collateral, but not the television shows. That's yeah, that's long gone.  You know what? Who would want to watch it now anyway? Well, I want, I only want to, the problem

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is I'd have to get a researcher to do this for me, but I haven't, you know, who the heck wants to  watch these old shows, but I have documented all kinds of stuff where I had the guys from web van

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  come on. That's why it was interesting. It was historic. That's what I was thinking. I thought

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it was historic. And I got the guy from lab, you would get a bunch of guys to come turning up in  your garage with offering to do that for free. Yeah. I'm working on it. We interviewed Doug

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Engelbart and he brought the original mouse. I mean, we interviewed so many interesting people  and at the time I'm thinking you have Douglas Adams. You have a great interview with Douglas

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Adams. I had Doug on the show. So yeah, a couple of times he was on it when he was in town. He'd  come by. So, but the thing is I've got, what I'm more interested in and unfortunately to get a  researcher to document this, they'd have to really, really break the shows down is where I have a guy  like web van guy and then a, and a bunch of, you know, internet, the new economy mavens saying to  me flat out, I'm saying, I'm saying on the show, that's only just to kind of prove that I wasn't  wrong. I'm saying, how do you expect it with milk trucks already out of business? How are you going  to make him? This doesn't make any sense at all. I go on and on and on in my, one of my rants and  everybody on the panel would say, oh, you don't get it. It's the new economy and this is all going  to be high, highly successful. Bricks and mortars are dead. I have all this stuff. Same thing they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  saying now. Well, they do the same thing and you do those interviews again and then this time put

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  them on YouTube. Yeah. Well, I'm telling you, I got, I got evidence. I got evidence. I got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's getting dusty in the basement. Yeah. So we made that pilot and then I never heard from  Halsey again. It was like, nothing. I thought, what did I do? Did I do something? And then he hired-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He could have called you to tell you that you didn't like what you did or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing. And then like three months later it was Christmas time. He hires a real programmer,  obviously to take that job. And the guy calls me and said, yeah, the pilot. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.  You know, I think he said something like, they didn't really do you justice. Yeah. And then,  and then another couple of months go by and I get a call from Halsey, come see our new facility.  This is when they, remember they were in a train car. I thought it was cool. Yeah, it was really  cool. They were in a train car and they had beautiful, beautiful facility, obviously spending  a lot of money. And I think even by then they kind of knew that they weren't going to do a  television network. You just couldn't do it. I did a lot of due diligence and it costs at that time,  even half a billion dollars to do it, to build a new network. Yeah. Yeah. You're going to have to  work weekends. And so he called me in and it was the weirdest interview. Basically all I did is  said, I got this memo from ZD. They're looking to do TV. Maybe you'd be interested in calling them,  which I did. And I got a job there and that was it with me and CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, at least that was that. You got that. Yeah, I did. I got another job.  And, but then I don't know what the deal was. They never explained it to me either. CNET did very,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  very well because they didn't do a network. They became web focused and they used the television  to promote the web. And that was a very smart strategy. As you remember when Halsey, who later

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  billed himself as the next Steve Jobs and something of a genius, when Halsey first  presented this concept to a few of us, it was not about the web. It was not about the internet. It  was about interactive TV. And he believed that interactive TV, which was something that never  has gone anywhere with the little buttons at the bottom of your regular television set and the  remote control was going to be the future. And the whole, you know, and that was what the whole  impetus was, which is one of the reasons, by the way, cause I only reluctantly went to work for  them because I had no confidence in them, which was actually a mistake on my part, but it's because  they didn't have confidence in the original vision, which was crazy. It was only when Kevin Wendell  came along. Kevin Wendell, that's the guy. That was the LA guy. Yeah, Kevin Wendell came along  where they, you know, they started to change their emphasis and then they kind of fell into  the internet thing by accident from what I, you know, from my witnessing the whole thing from the

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  beginning. And then didn't Kevin Wendell leave in disgrace later? No, he never left in disgrace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He left rich. Oh yeah, that's right. But Kevin, I always liked the guy. He was,  he cleaned up, I can say that, and he moved down back down to LA, but he, I guess on a day to day  basis, he was very hard to work for. That's my equity. That was my equity. Guys, I hate to be

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the bull here, but I don't think it's 15 years ago in tech. All right, all right. Macbook Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think, John? Did you see it? Did you play with it? 15 years ago. I'm trying to get,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the way I was machinating over the 15 years in tech, wait a minute. I was trying to get the joke.  Yeah, I play with it. And? It's nice. It's a gorgeous piece of gear. I think it's pretty useless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think it's going to be successful. You summed it up. Gorgeous, but useless. How about you,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will? Are you slathering over one? Yeah. So I played with it whenever it was,  whenever the Macworld thing was. Were you at Macworld? No, so I didn't come out, but  Apple does this really weird thing where they beam Steve Jobs' keynote via satellite to BBC  Television Centre in London. And you can go along and you watch the keynote on this cinema-sized  screens. You've got cinema-sized jobs right in front of you. And then they let you play with  the stuff afterwards. That's pretty cool. It's pretty cool. But the weirdest thing is that the  British people are all so polite that whenever all the people in San Francisco clap and we get it over  the PA, everyone starts clapping as well in the auditorium. It's like, guys, he can't hear you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a two-way thing. It is ludicrous. It's bad journalism, if you ask me. What are you

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  important for? Well, they invite their select partners as well, so it's all like they're resellers  and local mavens. It's kind of like that. Yeah, exactly. But I mean, I was always taught as a  journalist never to clap. No, you don't clap. No, you should never clap. Never, ever. No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you could, but you are allowed to lick it. Yes, apparently. Did you see the Today Show?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's stretching journalism a bit farther. That's not journalism.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple have done it again. This time it's not an iPod or an iPhone. This is Meredith Viera.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a laptop called the MacBook Air. And let's just say you can look at it. Thinness can be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, they had an ad. They're running the ad. That's right. That's right.  Then Meredith Viera picks it up. It does not have a remote.  And licks it. And let's imagine they're toys that would basically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Since we're doing a lot about going green this week on the show, it's also environmentally friendly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How do they get this kind of publicity? I don't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, maybe they put some on the thing for her to lick off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe the frog juice. It's like a dog. Frog juice.  It is lickable. It's an amazing machine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She licked it? I didn't see that. That's disgusting.  She licks it. Maybe she licks shiny objects.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. It was a very strange move. I don't really understand it.  It's beautiful. You know what you look at it. I don't know if I don't want to lick it,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  but it is beautiful. How beautiful can it be? It's a laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's underpowered. It's overpriced. You can't remove the battery.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, for the most people that are going to be buying it, email and office.  Nobody's going to be buying it. The thing is not going to sell 10.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The few fanboys will buy it. The thing doesn't have a prayer.  If you're serious, you go buy an R500 from Toshiba.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're introducing basically a laptop for the product crowd as the country dives into deep  depression. Who's that? This is like fiddling while running.  The depression is a couple years away. No, I think it's hitting us. Don't you  think it's happening now? Recession? This is what I love.  Apple announces the best quarter in history. It sold the Max sales.  There's a depression for you. Listen, Max sales are up 50%.  iPod sold 21.5 million. I mean, just rosy. They do give a little warning that maybe it's  not going to continue that way. Apple stock tumbles after announcing the best quarter in history.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's because they all looked at that MacBook Air.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There. They just didn't lick it. If they had licked it, they would have known.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I grew to call them in this last week's Market Watch trying to explain this tumble.  But there was profit taking. There was a lot of issues here that caused the stock to all of a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  sudden take a dive. Is it buy on the rumor, sell on the news?  Is that because it went up right before Macworld? Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you've got to bear in mind that it's not so much a tumble as just a readjustment.  Apple stock has been getting absolutely bonkers for the past six to nine months, possibly beyond  what it should have been. Dropping from $200 to $135,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is not a readjustment. I mean, as a radical tumble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, okay. It's not a $135 already. When I checked, it was like $160.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I was like, wow. No, no, it hit $135 on that downturn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was ridiculous. That's a pretty hefty drop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. You would have made a lot of money on the short side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But who would short Apple after its biggest quarter ever?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, it was already, it was overpriced. Actually, I wrote a column called,  is it time to short Apple? Although I was premature. I said it wasn't time, but that was  when it was a $135 going to $200. But since then, I've been very, you know,  it's always looked like a good short to me. Meanwhile, Microsoft.  I don't trade these stocks, by the way. Nope. None of us do. Nobody on this show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  trades any of those stocks, right? Right. I don't trade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have been in derivatives like Dow Jones and that, which include those stocks or different  stocks, but I'm not trading stocks. We don't applaud at Keynotes and we don't.  Although I have, you know, I've gotten into some minor companies that have nothing to do  with anything we talk about. So anyway, Microsoft, now Microsoft announces huge results  and their stock goes up 10%. Microsoft doesn't move because, and I've been thinking about this  as next week's column. What is the problem with Microsoft? And I finally concluded it's got to be  the EU because they're worried about the lawsuits in the EU. They're apparently, according to the  latest, one of the latest reports off the BBC, that woman that runs the competitive council or  whatever the heck it is, they're going to bring another one even bigger against Microsoft.  So I think this is going to never end. Wow. Well, I mean, you know, with the mistake that was Vista,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you know, now they're talking about Windows 7 already next year.  Yeah, I know. It's funny. I mean, it sounds to me like Microsoft's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  scrambling to get something out. I guess Vista is the ME of our generation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure feels like it. I didn't think it was that bad. I thought this is fine. But boy,  people really don't like it. And I get so many calls from people who are unhappy with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So here's a new story that I don't know if you covered this last week. By the way,  I'm sorry I missed that show. I wanted to go there and I just couldn't get there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We didn't cover anything last week. We covered plug-in hybrids.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What about Sun buying MySQL?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I tried to bring that up last week and nobody wanted to talk about it. And I said,  if John were here, he would have something to say. One billion dollars for an open source company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm still baffled by the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they must think there's money in it. It seems like, I mean, there is revenue. MySQL is  one of the few open source companies that maybe like Mozilla would be the other one,  that's really structured to make money. They make about 70 or 80 million a year, they say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think their revenues were 60 million or something, which is ridiculous. But  I'm, my thinking was, and I wrote this somewhere, I'm not sure,  be honest about where I put it, but the, that Oracle's behind the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's an anti-Oracle move.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't, see, here's the deal.  Sun can't really afford this kind of a one billion dollar deal. Oracle hates MySQL for a lot of  different reasons. And Oracle and Sun have always been in bed together. So what happens if they do  a behind the scenes deal? Say, look, why don't you, we'll give you the money, we'll get you the money,  you don't have to worry about it. Buy these guys and then sink the product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Sun could do it. That's interesting.  They've done it before.  They've done it before. That's interesting. So you don't think they're putting together  a portfolio with Java and MySQL and I don't know, Star Office, I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh yeah, there's another winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe not. I like that. That's a good theory. It's all, you're good at the conspiracy theories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm getting old.  Do they ever pan out?  They all do.  Oh, they all do. Oh, good. They all pan out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'm glad to hear that. What other stories do you have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I don't know. Let's see. There's another thing with Microsoft and Logitech.  That's kind of a weird thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's a rumor that they want to buy Logitech. That would actually make sense. I mean,  Logitech has some great products that fit in well with Microsoft's product line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you see the really cool comparison that was done of the Microsoft  marketing for Windows users and Mac users on its hardware line?  No. Where was that?  No.  It was on, I believe it was Gizmodo, but I could be wrong. But it was basically,  they took the wireless notebook mouse that Microsoft has and this is actual Microsoft  packaging. And the packaging for the Windows users that they put in the PC stores was like  the bright red packaging. Microsoft laser mouse, 5,000 super notebook extended, all these little  flash outs all over the box, Windows Vista compatible, Windows XP compatible, 5,000 DPI,  all this kind of stuff. And the Mac version was just plain white packaging instead of Microsoft  notebook mouse. And that was it. And it was like, if they think that Mac users like clean,  well-designed packaging, why do they think that Windows users like things that are clean and

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, think about it. What would the answer be? Anybody who buys Windows likes stuff with  things hanging off the edge. They like more, you know, more stuff.  More crap.  More crap.  More crap everywhere.  Although I have to say, you know, in the early days, Mac was much more of a kind of clean lines  thing. I think Apple, as with any operating system, as it gets old, I think Apple, there's  enough crap on the OS X side to say, make that not true exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know, there's a lot of, you know, the thing that gets me, because I use a Mac,  and not as a primary machine, but I use it at Pod Show. And every time I'm using and I'm  doing something, I see these little niceties that are just well thought out. It's like somebody  actually-  Yeah, somebody pays attention.  ... use it. I mean, I get the feeling that Bill Gates doesn't even use a computer anymore.  But I get the feeling that Steve Jobs does. And you go to some things and you click on it,  and you just say, oh, what a great idea to do that. You never get that with Windows.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It always feels like a committee design Windows. Maybe that's the difference. Did you see Bill  Gates' speech at Davos where he said, rich people ought to worry more about poor people?  No, I didn't see that.  He's a newer, kinder, gentler Bill Gates, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he was calling for a revision of capitalism, wasn't he?  Yeah, he was saying, yeah.  It's all very well revising it after you've already made.  Yeah, right. I am the richest man in the world. And now, let's change the game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me see if I can find some quotes.  It's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What?  They used to, when he was building his house on Lake Washington, they had to put bulletproof  glass in the front of it because these guys, these hicks from Washington state would be  boating past it when they were building it. And they would say, look, there's Bill Gates' house.  And then they'd take a shot at it.  What do you think? It's a stop sign?  So, that's exactly... So, apparently the thing was riddled with bullets as a gag.  And so they put the bulletproof glass in and that, you know, apparently I'm sure that they're  still dense here and there, but I can see where you, if you're like exposed like that,  why you would take this new, you know, I'm for the people kind of approach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he's retired, right? And now he's made his packet.  He's saying rich people ought to think a little bit more.  About poor people gave a 30 minute speech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Rich people. That's great. I missed that somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you see, you've got to watch the Robert Scoble streaming camera phone video from Davos.  Have you been watching that?  God, no.  I don't know. I can't, you know, when Scoble is invited to Davos, that's when I feel like  something's going on in the world. Here we are at the World Economic Forum.  The leaders of the world economy have gathered and here's Robert Scoble.  He's using a little Nokia N95 phone and he walks up to people, you know, like  Shimon Perez and says, you're on the internet right now and starts talking to him.  I must, there must have been a little bit of a whiplash going on there.  Kind of funny. Yeah. He's got this, there's a service, qik.com that allows you to stream  right from your cell phone, stream and have a chat room going on and the whole thing.  And so he's streamed a ton of stuff from Davos. He's like sneaking up. He says, there's Bono.  And he sneaks up and starts taking, starts shooting Bono.  It was a little weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, this has got to like cheapen the event.  I mean, having some guy with his cell phone film and everything when it's not the idea,  has got to make these guys complain to the promoters. Like what is this all about?  I don't come to these things. I have somebody ambush me with a cell phone  and then stream it on the net.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Basically, that's how almost everybody he ambushed was greeted was completely nonplussed.  It was like, you're doing what? This is where?  They didn't get it.  It's really a collection of baffled looks. It was pretty funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They probably thought he was criminally insane and they were just humoring him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scopel's entire output from Davos is baffled looks.  It basically is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who is this maniac?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's kind of fun to watch because it's like, huh?  Because he always says, yeah, we're live on the internet right now.  And now he did this to me at Macworld. So I got a little preview of this.  He walks up to you with, he has a Nokia N95 cell phone.  So it's tiny and he's holding it up and he comes up to you and says,  we're live on the internet right now. We're streaming.  And then I guess there's a chat room going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's cool.  Is it like performance art or something?  Yeah, I think it's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On the one hand, but on the other hand, there's a liability issue here that's not being addressed,  which is the fact that you can't just broadcast people without worrying about getting your ass sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I wonder, is this a public, I mean, if it's public, you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not a public event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think Davos, the World Economic Forum is exactly considered a public event.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So you can get your, as they would say, a tit in the ring are doing this kind of thing,  but I admire him for doing it because he has naive aspirations, which I think are cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He couldn't get Zuckerberg, Mark Zuckerberg of Facebook, he couldn't get him on camera,  but he does write a post about walking around town, walking around Davos with Zuckerberg.  And then the guy who founded Linden Labs, Philip Rosedale walks up and they're chatting.  God, now see that I would have liked to have seen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that'd been funny.  Stream that.  I think he should have walked up and sucker punched him.  Zucker punched him?  Zucker punched him.  You gotta zucker punched him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's see. He's sitting next to Mike Arrington at the YouTube booth. Bono shows up.  I mean, it's just like name drop after name drop. It's pretty funny.  He interviewed Eric Hippo, our old boss from Ziff Davos, who is now a managing partner  of SoftBank Capital. Talk about getting rewarded for failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, actually, it wasn't failure at all. It was actually extreme success for the original  investors who had to get out.  That's true.  He's interviewing Markov. Markov is at least smart enough to know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the way he starts these videos is he points his camera phone at the badge so you know  who he's talking to.  They don't believe it's live. We're here with John Markov and David Kirkpatrick of Fortune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  David's doing all sorts of stuff here at the World Economic Forum.  So we're just talking about all this media stuff.  I was just saying that a DLD would be just the best.  All right. I've had enough. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So yeah, it's just dull. But you know, I had the opportunity to, well,  Davos is presented as something that as a journalist you can get to if you want to.  Really?  But the problem is, is that you don't really get the amount of mingling.  I talked to Markov about this extensively and it sounds like you're just some schmuck  in the peanut gallery. It doesn't sound like any fun at all.  Well, who goes to Davos? Why is it important?  Well, the guys are going, it's a drinking club. Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's a sense I get. It's just a bunch of rich people sitting around drinking.  And then Bill Gates says, and by the way, we really should be thinking about poor people more.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, essentially it's a giant drinking club. They go there, nothing comes of it.  I mean, everyone, you know, just, you can read Foreign Affairs magazine and get more for your  money. It's cool to say, oh yeah, I'm going to Davos.  But you get to rub elbows. If you're in the elite, in other words, not a member of the media where  you're just basically a schmuck who gets to like, you know, kiss ass if you want to.  If you're a member of the people who actually give the talks and whatever  and get to hang out with each other without being cordoned off in this free speech zone,  it's got to be okay. So, you know, so you can see some of your pals because you don't get to mix  that much with these people. But for the most part, just like another waste of time, it seems to me,  I don't understand. It's not even covered that much anymore.  Interesting.  I mean, Dan Gilmore went to it. Now they got, if they invite Scoble, then you know, it's like,  you know, it's not no offense to to to Robert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like Scoble jumping the shark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is that the minute Scoble's broadcasting streaming live video from from a cell phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, come on. I mean, Robert's I like the guy's a great guy. He's been on Cranky Geeks  a few times. He's been on the show. He's an old friend.  He's one of the nicest guys there is. I mean, he's never said anything bad about anybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's working for Fast Company now. That's his new gig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  OK, but still walking around the cell phone, taking pictures of people and streaming it  against you before they know it, before asking for permission. And the whole that whole thing  seems to me to just to be, you know, it is to be it is jumping the shark.  Yeah, it's close.  I think Davos jumped the shark a few years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Rupert Murdoch's at Davos announces the Wall Street Journal is going to stay a pay  per view newspaper site. What a surprise.  Probably the only one making money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're not making as much as they used to.  Oh, really? That's interesting.  Big surprise. That's what everyone says. I could be wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think it's a surprise, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, it just seems like Murdoch of anybody knows that, you know, you have to  give this stuff away to make the money on the advertising. It just seems like he must have  like the Wall Street Journal must have like a secret trick up its sleeve because I can't  see on its current model now why you wouldn't just give it away like the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I could tell you why. People will pay for something that makes them money. I mean,  you get New York Times is news Wall Street Journal. You're getting something of value,  aren't you? That helps you make money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, you know, I would argue the point and I don't want to get too carried away since I  actually work for them.  You do?  Well, Market Watch is known by Dow Jones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's right. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But it seems to me that the Journal has gotten soft and most of this content in there is not  really that kind of hard hitting stuff like you'd get in the Financial Times necessarily,  even in Market Watch. So I'm not so sure that they're going to people are going to be flocking.  That's interesting.  Although now I'll take that back one step for the archived material. Say I'm doing due  diligence on some corporation. I can see where I'd have to pay money to get that information.  Like, you know, these are like 10 articles that were written in this in the 1980s about somebody  who's now going to be a CEO someplace else. I'll pay for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does the Financial Chimes charge for access to its content?  I don't think they do. I think they're free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, the New York Times recently just went free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's why I think the archives are still costing money at the New York Times.  I might not.  No, I think they dropped that. They dropped that. I believe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Definitely the archives are still things. I tried to pick some stuff up the other day.  They dropped the Time Select thing. They dropped the Time Select thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I guess the archives are still, huh? Let me try it. I'm going to search for an old one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't see why the whole thing shouldn't be free if it's going to be free at all. But  I mean, it's advertising opportunities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I think it's free. I just pulled up a 2004 article, full article. Let's see if I can find

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  something. You have to do it when you do it via a search. I think I did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And New York Times archive search, the full thing shows up. I think they're all free now. Yeah.  That's why people are saying to Rupert Murdoch, when you stop charging for the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, New York Times is the competitor for the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to say I like the Journal now because it is soft. They have great people stories.  I love the drinking column on Saturday. Do you ever read that?  No. It's on drinks. It's about booze. It's great. But you're right. I think it probably isn't the

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  financial newspaper of record it used to be. It'll be interesting to see which direction it takes when  Murdoch actually makes some changes. A lot of people are worried sick over there, I can tell  you that. Oh, that's too bad. Because everybody makes the average guy over there. I'll get some  email on this. But from my understanding, the typical guy working there has been there for more  than a few minutes, is getting $110,000 a year right off the top. Well, it's the Wall Street Journal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, let me ask Will about what Facebook announced because I don't fully understand it,  but it sounds like they're opening up their platform a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. It's basically making Facebook widgets just web compatible.  So I can put it on my site. Yeah. So you can take any of your favorite  vampire biting widget-y kind of things and put them all over the web, which frankly is a pretty

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  dire idea. That's a scary thought. That's bad enough that I get vampire bites all over my Facebook  page. Now I'm going to have it on the web as well. Absolutely. Oh, geez. Now you can become a fan of  whatever it is. Henry Blodgett wrote an article on Silicon Alley Insider, which he says is brilliant.  The overall strategy is brilliant. The big drawback of Facebook for those who weren't  born and raised on it is the need to visit the site to interact with friends, apps, etc. The walled  garden. This requirement makes Facebook a non-starter or at least annoying for those reared on standard  email, IM, and web-based apps. So by extending to the web, Facebook encourages even more third-party  developers to build applications and more easily fend off open social. So it is probably a response  to Google's open social. That makes sense. What do you think the prognosis is for Facebook? John,

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  are you a page? I'm not a big... I think I have a page on there that I use just so I can look at  other stuff. I use it all the time. I'm not a big Facebook user and I'm somewhat semi-baffled by  the people who are. There's all kinds of other things. There's a lot of social ways of going  about interaction on the internet. You can create a phony baloney of Second Life. You can  do blogging. You can do MySpace. LiveJournal was there for a long time. You say some interesting

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  things. So blogging is an open thing that everybody could see. You have to join Second Life. You have  to join Facebook. That's kind of where the schism occurs is between open and closed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's Twitter. How many of these things can we actually absorb? Why is one more popular than the  other? What does it take to derail one? We already made the transition from LiveJournal to MySpace  to Facebook. Is that ending? I don't think so. Unless I don't see why. It's not that...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. It's wherever your friends gather, that's where you're going to end up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm getting mixed feelings about it. It would be nice to be a part owner, but I'm not. So I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  care. I am now over 4,000 friends on Facebook. I understand the limit. You gotta hit the limit.  The limit is 5,000, reached by Scoble and Justine. I'm trying to get up there in there with them.  How many of these people do you actually know? None. Well, some. So what's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They're my new friends. You're my new imaginary friend. You might as well be six.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had imaginary friends when I was six. You know why I did this? Jason Calacanis convinced me.  What I realized is these are what the broadcast people call the P1 fans, the hardcore fans.  You want to keep a connection to them, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Do you think they really are? What is the core? You have, let's see, on this podcast,  I would say conservatively, you have 500. I can tell you for a fact that there's people all over  the world that listen to this thing, because I'm always soliciting stuff if you haven't noticed.  And you get free crap, don't you? I always get a ton of responses. I get free clothes.  If I went on the road and went to Europe, or China, or anywhere, and just said I was going  to go somewhere, I'd like to meet up with a few people and I want you to buy me  free drinks and wine. Anywhere in the world. Yeah, anywhere in the world.  It's basically Twitch, a drinking club. So anyway, and there's a core audience in there,  amongst those 500,000 listeners. I don't think the 4,000, the 4,000 are probably psychos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I can't get rid of them. If you're a psycho and you're listening, hurry,  because I'm pretty soon I'm going to get to 5,000 and I won't be able to add any more psychos.  Come on. Come on. There is a number 5,000, though. That's a kind of magic number. I have 5,000 Twitter  followers, 5,000 followers and pounds. There's something about 5,000. Maybe that's all. That's

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  it right there. That's my thoughts. I have no idea what the deal is. But it sounds like 5,000 stalkers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. And I try to give them something every day. You know, Molly, I was,  Molly was supposed to join us. Molly Wood, Tom Merritt and Jason Howell and I are writing a

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  novel on Twitter. I think Molly's having her mullet trimmed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's going to get it for not showing up. That's really the case.  So it's 140 novel, 140 novel and we're taking turns. So they were, so everybody writes a sentence  and then the next person writes a sentence and it's, it's pretty awful. I bet it is. It's pretty bad.  Because what happens is, you know, you have an idea of what you want, what you, you know, you have an idea  and you try to telegraph it to the next guy, but the next guy completely takes it in a different  direction. So it doesn't work too well. Don't try this at home, kids. I think there's a way of doing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  a group novel. I'm not sure what that method is, but I'm sure there is a way and it could probably  be discovered if somebody really wanted to try it. You want to, you want to hear our novel so far?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do I want to hear it? Yeah, it's only a few sentences. We've only, we haven't, we just started it.  Roddy had a headache. I think Tom started us off here. No, Molly did. Roddy had a headache.  He'd been getting them for weeks now, each worse than the last, but he thought this one might rip  his head off. He tried to sit down, but missed the couch. He barely felt his tailbone bounce off the  floor. His head was killing him. Sadly, none of this mattered to the 38 people who are watching  his live feed on the internet. What made the situation even worse was not 30 minutes before  Roddy took a monster swig from an anonymous elixir. Could it be? No. Roddy felt certain.  No, the no is Molly saying no. Molly says Roddy felt certain his headache was something different.  It was accompanied by a monstrous roar inside his head like chatter. He heard a voice ask him  for help, but he couldn't tell if it was inside his head or out. He probed the implant in his molar  with his tongue gingerly. It had a gunmetal tang and felt slightly warm. This was all Sandor's fault.

Transcript:  And it goes on. Hey, you should enter that contest for the bad first sentence contest.  I like it. I think it's fun. Yeah, it is fun. I'm sure you had nothing else to do with your time,  apparently. So by the way, let me just give you a quote from Stephen King. Just for the,  the three of you should note this. Yes. The adverb is not your friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm the one who's using all the adverbs sadly and gingerly. That's me.  You're right. It's a good, good advice. I'll cut the adverbs out.  So, uh, let's see. What else is new? Oh, I had a story. Go ahead. I'm very happy about the Amazon  MB3 store. Let's talk about that. Cause you can't get it right now in the UK. Nope. You can't get it  in the UK. Now that Sony, now the music and you can't buy any of it. Now that Sony, uh, uh,  BMG is on there. I think all the major labels now offer, uh, DRM free music through Amazon.  I was able to download the latest dream theater and system X CDs and it's 256 kilobit MP3 with no  DRM. So you're looking forward to this. This will be a good thing for, uh, for you and all your,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah. Well, I mean over here, I mean, the trouble is there are so many things that, um,  give me a band. I mean, get missed out on it. I mean, for example, um, you know, the whole  Mack will think about the iTunes video store and Apple TV, none of it's outside America.  I know. I'm Canadian friends are always bitching at me for that. Yeah. You know,  we sat and watched that in our little, uh, you know, not applauding auditorium.

Transcript:  you those DVDs of QI. I know my friend is working on the production of them. I want Steven Fry on

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you don't pay the BBC tax every year. Why is that? Why is it BBC? I can't play your

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  shows in. Can I download programs from outside the UK? The BBC uses G-O-I-P technology to identify

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  where you are. This is something out of. What if you go through a proxy in England? Yeah,  you could probably do that. Yeah. And then you get that. But it'd be a little slow. All right.  Let's do it. Somebody out there who's listening to the show, get us a proxy that we can go through  and then we'll be able to look at this stuff. Okay, Will. As a public service. You're a young

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Jay-Z. I think for.  Really seriously.  Jay-Z or Jay-YZ or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jay-Y-Z. Right? Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Let's see. Oh yeah. I got Jay-Z. I got Jay-Z and Snoop.  I got Jay-Z and Linkin Park. Let's play Big Pimpin. This is just, this is just going to tease. This is  just a tease, Will.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I can just see those Brits singing along. Are you pimping? I'm drinking my 45s.  You know what a 45, hey, Will, don't say anything though. You know what a 45 is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it like a massive thing of drink? Yeah. That's pretty close.  See? See? I already know that because Kevin Rose will be at the hands of drinking his liquor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  In the hood.  Malt liquor.  There are a slew of the, 880 by the way would be the better of the references, but in the hood,  as it were, and I hate to use that term in this regard, but in the ghetto, which we used when I  was a kid, there is a bunch of malt liquors that are only sold into the black community that are  loaded with alcohol and Colt 45 is one of the more famous ones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what, if anybody's listening, someone just needs to take those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm sorry, the car just went by with it was playing, playing all the big sounds there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sorry about that.  It was Big Pimpin outside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I wonder how many were these crazy references that are in these songs that the international

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  audience has no idea what they're saying. Oh, I probably shouldn't get into that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  If you want to get into that old English 880, that's the one that you want to refer to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the malt liquor of choice. Absolutely. Do they drink 45s on Dignation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think it's the broken maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They drink Corona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They drink whatever somebody puts in front of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know that's true, but I think as far as I know, those two guys really like Corona.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now you watch Dignation, Will, what happened? Did they go sober?  Because I saw a drink-free Dignation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, so I think they're both trying to detox for January.  I said they didn't drink in January.  It's not permanent.  No, I think it's soon as February. The first February episode is going to be complete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because they'll have lost their immunity.  Yeah, absolutely.  That's so pathetic.  I actually had a conversation with Kevin. I said, Kevin, kids watch you. You're a role model.  People look at Dignation and look at that and feel like this is the way to behave.  Kevin's very sincere and I think really thinks about these things. He said,  yeah, I know we shouldn't drink so much. He said, we'll stop next year.  Is what he told me. We'll stop next year. I could stop anytime I want to.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think kids are that influenced by somebody drinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My son watches Dignation and he says, well, at least I'm not that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there you go. They're a bad example that you can hold up as a bad example that you won't get  there.  At least I'm not that bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they'd love that, the idea that they're just like the absolute rock bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not that drunk.  The rock bottom.  This is a touchy subject. I don't want to get sued and I don't want to get a snake in the mailbox,  but what's going on with the Church of Scientology and this group Anonymous?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just loads of people who are fed up, I think, of Scientology and trying to knock them off the  web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I had somebody post, I had one of my bloggers put that on. I took it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The Tom Cruise video?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Tom Cruise we left on, that was funny. Actually, the parody of the Tom Cruise video  was funny too, but there's this anonymous video that is just, I thought it was lame and stupid.  It was just some anti-Scientology thing from someone. I don't even know who did it or why.  What was the agenda? It didn't make any sense to me.  This is all started by Cruise in that crackpot video that he did. I think the Scientologists  should, they should be, I mean, except I'm sure he contributes more than a few dollars, but  I think somebody should take him aside and say, hey, why don't you just back off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How did that, was it something he made privately?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Obviously it wasn't that private.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was pulled off YouTube, but you haven't gotten any cease and desist order from?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, we just linked to the site that has it posted now.  The famous guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Tom Cruise on, Tom Cruise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't have it on our site.  Scientologist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they have the Mission Impossible music.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a privilege to call yourself a Scientologist and it's something that you have to earn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is making me queasy because, you know, I feel like this is his private thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he was, this is overproduced for something that's private, so I'm not convinced of that,  but the thing is that there's a parody done by a writer's guild actor.  That's very funny. It's unfunny or die.  Yeah.  That is hilarious.  Was the guy from Slider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was the guy where?  But then the rest of it, you know, I don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Very, yeah, what's the face of Slider?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does the, he does the Tom Cruise laugh.  I got to play this part though.  Do what I can and I do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  This is crazy.  I do everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, geez.  Oh God.  And then the parody is great because he just basically does that laugh, that crazy laugh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'll tell you the parody, when I first saw it, when the guy did that laugh,  I started, I cracked up.  I thought it was the funniest thing I've seen for a long time.  The laugh is a laugh of a crazed maniac and I don't know.  I would hope that this thing dies down because I've never personally had  problems with the Scientology community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I don't understand really.  So is there something about Scientology and the internet?  I mean, is there some, it's odd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's a lot of people out there that feel the Scientologists are,  they don't like them, let's put it that way.  And they don't like their tactics of like, you know,  suing everybody who goes after them.  But if you look back on the history of a religion in the United States,  especially, you know, would sketchier or offshoot religions or whatever you want to call them that  are just non-mainstream, let's say, like the Mormons.  And they have a history of being pretty much put upon by the society as a whole,  to the point where they try to kill them all.  And I can see why you'd be a little defensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I think the real problem is Tom Cruise at this point.  They should really, they should maybe want to downplay the relationship  because he's coming across as a nut.  Don't you think?  I mean, yeah, it's not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's something going on.  What's interesting is that the public reacts to that.  His last few movies have been box office flops.  Oh, have they?  Tom Cruise has really lost his star power in terms of the getting people into the cinema.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he's still loaded and he runs a production company that makes more money than it will ever  make. But the thing is, is that what I find disappointing is that if you look at his career  as a whole, Tom Cruise is actually kind of destined to be like one of the great actors  in history. And he essentially sidetracked himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was great in Magnolia. He was incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, look at Magnolia, look at Rain Man.  I mean, he's in a lot of his movies.  I mean, the guy is a tremendous actor that is just essentially become a kind of a, you know,  Terry Maguire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he's done some great movies.  You're right.  And of course, Risky Business was fantastic.  His debut.  So I have my OLPC.  Did you guys get your OLPC?  Huh?  Huh?  The give one, get one.  Apparently, there's some people who are irate because they still haven't received their  XO laptop.  You know, those laptops for one child, one laptop per child.  You bought one?  Yeah.  Well, I donated.  So I got one.  Give one, got one.  But I got mine when I got, you know, like a couple of weeks ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's cute.  I should show you.  Have you seen it?  It's really cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I'd like to see it.  I'll come by when you take me out to lunch at that restaurant.  You can't promise me.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Damn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  God, I always open the door for that, don't I?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wait, the next time.  What's the name of that place again?  I keep forgetting.  Cyrus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cyrus.  C-Y-R-U-S.  It's in, it's in, where is it?  Healdsburg.  Healdsburg, yeah.  Really good.  I'll tell you.  I heard that.  They have a caviar plate thing.  It's like 500 bucks, but it's amazing.  You get a little Stoli, get the caviar.  It's great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm in.  Did you get your check, by the way, this year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  What's that got to do with this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Did you get your check, Will?  I did.  That was awesome.  It wasn't postage due, was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, you got it here sorted.  Thank you.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was a little afraid I didn't get the right amount of money, so I just put like,  you know, you put like 100 stamps on just because you figure, well, that's got to be enough.  You just keep putting them on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty, that was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Going all the way to England.  That's got to be enough.  I have no idea what I'm supposed to pay.  Is there a place you can go?  Would there be a place you could like on your computer use to figure out how much?  Yeah, post office website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That would help.  I need that.  So back to the news.  Yes.  What else?  Does anyone have a clue about this half million missing iPhones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, you know, there's this discrepancy between the number of iPhones  Apple's claiming were sold and the number of iPhones AT&T's claiming were sold.  A huge discrepancy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is that why the stock fell, you think?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is the difference like Apple sells them to AT&T and then AT&T like sells them on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Steve Jobs says, or said actually at the keynote, that Apple had sold 4 million.  AT&T says it has registered 2 million.  So either there are 2 million hacked iPhones or Apple's quoting, you know,  supply chain numbers, not out the door numbers.  I've heard some people say that this is anecdotal, but that many AT&T stores have  like a bunch of iPhones just sitting on the shelves.  Like they can't sell them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, it's infinitely possible that it's supply chain given that, you know,  in the world there could be 2 million iPhones sat in stock rooms, right?  But I think the more interesting thing is that, you know, what was  when Jobs' original goal for the iPhone was what sell 10 million iPhones in a year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple's standing by that and their earnings call, they said, no, we just...  Then they went near it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know where they...  They're not going to get in a million years.  They've done 4 million past Christmas, which is the busiest time of the year  in the first six months.  And it's slow in Europe.  Even if they had another Christmas, they'd still only hit 8 million.  And if there's 2 million stuck in supply chain, they've only, you know,  they'll only do 6 million.  There won't be another Christmas.  They might do 5 million.  So they're not going to, you know, they might get half the original target,  which I'm not sure is going to be a great success for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So an analyst, Sakonagi from Bernstein, Tony Sakonagi, did some math.  3.7 million iPhones sold through December 31st.  That leaves 1.7 million not registered through AT&T.  Okay.  350,000 sold in Europe.  So 1.35 million.  Maybe 20% unlocked.  So the rest would be inventory at AT&T and in Europe.  That means there are somewhere, he says, between 150 and 200 phones  in inventory for every non-Apple retailer.  So that's not good.  Maybe that is why this stock went down, because this was in Barron's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's an interesting situation that, you know, we'll figure out eventually.  According to Digi-  And that-

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just to finish this up, according to DigiTimes, the Taiwan, you know,  that's the Taiwan electronics industry newspaper that actually was the first to say,  they're making the iPhones and say how many.  Apple has lowered its iPhone shipment projection, the number it's buying  from manufacturers in Taiwan.  So maybe it's not selling that well.  According to DigiTimes, the projected shipments of iPhones is down from 2 million to 1 million  for Q2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's predictable.  But then more bad news for the cell phone business or mobile phone industry,  as they would say elsewhere.  Palm's closing all its retail stores and is paying out trio owners.  Oh, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We keep hearing bad news about Palm.  It's getting worse and worse, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's never a good news to Palm, is it?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's a nice piece of equipment, but, you know, I mean, essentially it's a BlackBerry competitor.  And we never hear bad news about BlackBerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  BlackBerry is doing really well.  That's why.  RIM is selling, has had its best year ever with BlackBerry.  They're selling like crazy, but I'm using a BlackBerry.  I have an iPhone and I use a BlackBerry.  There's just great stuff in the BlackBerry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have resisted the BlackBerry to an extreme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  You've never used one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I mean, played with them, but I've never had one to use.  And actually, RIM offered me one once, but I told them that, you know,  I didn't, I really am reluctant to use something that I see people addicted to.  Not that I can't, you know, control myself, but I don't know.  I mean, it's obvious they're onto something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You feel like you don't trust yourself with a CrackBerry?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just see, you know, people looking at the thing all the time  and it's like something to fiddle with.  Oh, I walk into walls.  I mean, it's bad.  Yeah.  That's what I'm saying.  And so I mean, yeah, I like the idea that I can get my email and make quick responses and stuff,  but you know, my email, I hit the email thing on my computer at the desk, you know,  five or six times a day or more, sometimes, you know, 10.  I don't see that I need to be on the email more than that because nothing's that important  in my life that people are going to be emailing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, and if you've got a cell phone with you to pick up your email,  if it's that important, surely people can just call you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  Or send me an SMS message, which I use a lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I prefer they email me than call me.  SMS is fine, but it's limited.  I like getting emails on myself.  I have my, you know, what I do is I have it automatically set up.  If I add you to my address book, that your mail will then come to my BlackBerry.  So it's kind of controls who gets sent to the BlackBerry.  And look, well, you're in it.  Both of you guys are in it.  You'd never know it.  Well, I don't respond.  I just, I look at it.  You don't send me that much email.  Oh, for good reason.  Pirate Bay now is claiming 10 million users.  They say they have one, what is it?  One million torrents online.  I love that these guys just love shaking their savers.  Although I understand that the Swedish government is now taking them to court.  So they may, they may be premature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, these things are short-lived.  And the thing is I wouldn't, you know, I don't do this kind of downloading.  I don't anymore.  I think you're asking for trouble.  You're, they're going to, you know, they get all the IP addresses are out there  and it's just, they're going to just track you down  and you're going to get a summons or something.  And you're going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just feel, you know, it's funny.  I said on Twitter, I just bought this CD and somebody said, well, you know, you could go to the,  you know, download it from Torrent for free.  And I said, well, yeah, but I want to support the, the artist here.  I don't.  Then, then another friend of mine said, well, you really want to support the artist.  Go see the concert where they actually make some money off of it.  This is true.  But I do, I just feel I don't want to steal it.  I just want to buy it.  It's 8.99.  Come on.  How cheap.  Yeah, no, it's finally gotten.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  It's finally gotten reasonable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was different when you couldn't get this stuff online.  But now that everything is online without DRM, I think it's,  we should probably respond and encourage your record companies to continue this trend  by buying a few albums once in a while.  What do you think, Will?  Is that a good idea?  How do you get your music?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have to say I'm a complete sucker for just iTunes.  Oh, iTunes.  They're good.  See?  But I mean, because it's just so like, like I'm usually sort of person, like if I want a new album,  I want it to do something like I'm going on a car journey and I want to listen to something new.  You want it now.  Yeah.  So I don't have time to wait for a Torrent or try and track it down somewhere.  I just go to iTunes, I click the button and I get it.  And I'm also like, I know that I'm, it's like that thing.  Like I know that I'm suckering myself into the DRM.  Like I know it's bad for me, but all I ever do is play it on my laptop.  Right.  So you don't mind.  So I don't, I sort of don't, even though I object to it, I sort of don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's only 10 bucks for a CD or in your case, a couple of shillings.  And so that's a good deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.  It costs very, it costs very little really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really not expensive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I do also have the nice little hack around.  I tend to buy a lot of stuff from the US store.  You'll only cost like five quid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'll like Amazon.  I'm telling you, you're going to love that.  I hope they put everything on there for you, for you people.  That's going to be nice.  You bad spellers across the pond.  Any other, any other?  P-O-N-D-E.  P-O-N-D-E, pond D.  Any other big stories, Mr. D, anything else on your tech five list that we should cover?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think that's it.  There's news from last week ago, but I think that's, I think we covered the good stuff.  We covered the good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Tech5, T-E-C-H, the number five dot pod show dot com.  The most important five minutes of your day, of course, crankygeeks.tv and dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Which everything is there.  I mean, you can always go to Dvorak.  Although, you know, I have to say we had to do some, since we put all these new menus,  we're using a new template from a few months ago and I, it's harder to find.  Because I was looking for it.  Where's my MarketWatch link?  You know, it's like buried over on the left.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do too much stuff now.  You can't find it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, it's because of these widgets, you know, and I actually marked them out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got recent entries, recent comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, and the widget thing is so easy to do.  You know, I mean, you could just load up the blog with all kinds of crap.  I got to go in there and clean out some of those widgets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I had that problem on my blog too.  You just tend to just keep adding stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right.  When you should be taking stuff away.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Put all those things on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, I will make one mention about the blog though.  I had a contest that I started like sometime in November about redesigning  the dvorak.org slash home dot htm page, which is my little homepage that I use.  And so I had a, I had about six or seven guys or actually out of,  maybe got about 12 entries to redesign this page.  One of them is really a killer by the way.  And I'm going to post all those things this week for people to vote on.  So I can see what the public likes in terms of.  Oh, good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the one that's there right now is not dvorak.org slash home dot htm is your old design.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. It's my old design.  I did it like when I was working for tech TV.  I mean, this thing is older than the hills.  Yeah, I remember.  And I mean, the links are good.  They're all new, but the, but the design is like crap.  And you know, I finally got sick of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I redesigned.  Have you been to Leoville lately?  Not for about a month.  Totally redesigned.  A whole new look.  It's a WordPress template that looks more like a magazine or a news template.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, where'd you get it?  Because I've been working with one of those with Gardner, the guy who does a lot of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brian Gardner.  It's a revolution.  That's what I'm using.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I talked to, I talked to Brian.  The guy is really great.  He does a, he has, you can buy these templates are like 50 bucks for three of them, I think,  or a hundred.  They're not very expensive, but they're extremely modern.  And they're, and they're what I call a neo blog, which is a new style of blog.  It doesn't look like a blog.  It looks more like a magazine, a newspaper or whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, he's done a really good, it really transforms WordPress.  And so my front page now is much more like a magazine, but what's neat is you can use  categories.  I've redesigned it so that when I post to the news category, it goes in the lower left.  When I post to the radio category goes in the middle.  When I post the blog post, it goes there.  So it's really, I like it.  It's great.  And I put drop down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And I talked to the guy.  He's a really nice guy.  And he started this because he needed to do one for himself.  And then he, it became a business.  He had to actually quit his job because he's become very popular as this kind of neo blog  designer.  He's self-taught too, which I really admire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Nice guy.  Yeah.  It's a Brian Gardner.  I think if you Google revolution WordPress theme, you'll find his site pretty quickly.  Let's see.

Transcript:  This episode, of course, before we get onto the piggy piggy snack snack,  this episode is brought to you by audible.com audible.com slash twit.  You know, I was looking for you, Will, for the, the, the Jay-Z biography.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I tell you what I have been listening to that's on audio, which is on audible.  What?  Which is a new book by Louie Theroux.  Do you guys get Louie Theroux?  No, who's that?  He's like, he's like, he's very strange English.  He makes sort of hokey documentaries about weird things.  So his book is called the call of the weird travels and American subcultures.  Oh, that sounds great.  So it's a Brit looking at it.  Yeah.  So you guys interviews, the sort of UFO cultists and crazy sort of white supremacy,  teenage girls and all these sort of really, really strange people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds fantastic.  Let me play a little bit of it for, for the folks here.  This is Louie Theroux.  The call of the weird travels in American subcultures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I continued to be curious about long after the interviews were over,  a UFO believer named Thor Templer, who claimed to have killed 10 aliens.  A pimp named Melo T, who was pursuing a career as a gangster rapper.  A young porn performer who worked under the name JJ Michaels.  As I had with Jerry from time to time.  I gotta listen to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That sounds hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's absolutely brilliant.  I mean, it's all based on it.  The book is basically like a sequel to the documentaries he made a few years ago.  It's not like Ali G.  I mean, he, it's not.  No, no, no, no.  He's actually, he's a real journalist basically.  And I met him once a few years ago and he's just the most interesting guy.  It's so funny.  Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cause Alastair Cook used to do his letter from America, which was very serious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, this is yeah, this is just kooky.  So I just finished reading it.  I heartily recommend it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Good, but nearly great.  Do you know what time it is?  Yes, that's right.  It's time for piggy piggy snack snacks.  And on the menu today, oh, look, one of them just dropped down on the floor.  It's a white Malteser.  I love the normal ones.  So let's check out this one.  A piggy piggy snack snack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh God, too British.  I love it.  You know what?  You do something really smart, Will.  It plays the minute you go to the page.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People will.  The funny thing is though, hardly anybody visits the page.  People will watch it like on iTunes or other people's pages.  But they sample.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now see, they sample, they go, they hear about channel flip.  They sample, they go, oh, I like this.  And then they subscribe.  Yeah, I guess that's true.  That's really important.  Which is, yeah, we're going to start doing that.  We're actually going to start playing all 12 podcasts at once when you go to twit.tv.  So you get to really hear them all.  Yeah.  It's going to be great.  It's my new idea.  And it'll be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, actually, yeah, I mean, there was actually, I mean, just to tangent for a second,  that story that about the new advertising company that plays you,  their new form of ads is a five second audio ad every time you load a page.  Oh, interesting.  It goes like, hi, check out the new, but no way to disable it.  No way to stop it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's super annoying.  No, I don't like that.  I'm not going to do that.  I actually was thinking, now tell me if people would hate this.  I was thinking when you go to twit, we have a problem with twit is that we have 12 shows.  They're all great.  There's funny stuff in all of them.  What I'd like to do is a radio style promo, you know, where if you didn't listen to twit  this week, here's what you missed.  And yes, you know, a bunch of funny little bits.  And then I was thinking, you know, that's so that's a traditional radio promo.  But how do you get people to listen to it?  So I was thinking maybe when you went to the twit site, it would just play.  Would that drive you crazy?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wouldn't bother me.  I think it's one of me.  It's one.  I just need to get people to kind of get the idea that it would bother me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think it's going to bother anybody.  For one thing, you know, whoever's going to go to the twit site, you might as well do  something for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I don't see it's a they don't get much when they go there.  So you're not much there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's listings.  Give them something.  Going to TV guide.  Give them something for their money.  All right.  You should have a little video in there with that same thing or so.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think Mr. Piggy would do a video for us like a promo video?  Hello.  Yeah, cool.  I'm piggy piggy Snack Snack and I want to tell you why to listen to Twitter.  It might be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe maybe he does DVD reviews.  So maybe he can do podcast reviews as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And he could recommend a snack to each for each twit snack.  I think we should have a snack today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Should be for this show.  Malt liquor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's got to be the five.  Call 45 or maybe an 80 80.  I don't know.  All right, ladies and gentlemen, thank you very much.  Channel flip.com for Mr. Will Harris for John C. Dvorak.  Dvorak.org blog for Mollywood mullet.com.  We thank you very much.  We'll see you next time.  Another twit is in the camera.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  I should have paid attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know what I'm going to do.  Too much work.  The problem is there's no limit.  My server is completely collapsed.  So here's the deal.  I'm just trying to get the thing up, but I have a hell of a time.  What what what blue screens like?  Forget it.  I'm killing you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey, hey, hey, hey.
