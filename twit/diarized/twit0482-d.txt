I think all of those of us who are old timers and you know my Yahoo was my  start page for a long time on the internet and you know Yahoo was my first  search engine. You never forget your first search. You never forget your first  search engine. So I don't I think I sometimes feel like some people in tech  press and the public are rooting against Yahoo.

Start time: 317.44
End time: 424.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  good. I like it. That's why I keep one of the reasons I keep doing the radio shows  because it keeps you in touch with what normal people are worried about as  opposed to what we in the tech bubble are worried about. But this show is a tech  bubble show. I don't mind I don't mind saying this show is fine for the  audience because it saves us a lot of time. Well the internet see is this  interconnection of computers all over the world. We don't have to say that. We  can assume take it as written that you you all know what. So I guess what is the  big story. There were a lot of big stories this week. I do apologize we had  booked Kara Swisher for this show. I really wanted to get her on this week and  unfortunately her schedule changed she had a fly out of town so we didn't have  her on but I was going to ask her about the Kim Kardashian interview at Recode  which I thought was interesting and then she wrote an article and I wasn't  going to cover this story without her here but I'm just going to mention it  but I don't think it's a tech story for us. I think it's a story more of a social  story but Tim Cook coming out. Oh yeah. And I wasn't gonna actually really talk  about it because it's not it doesn't have anything to do with technology but it  had but she wrote and I think she's right it has a lot to do with somebody  in a huge position of power very public person coming out is a really great  signal to young gay men and women who might be worried about how the world's  going to receive them and they're saying here's a guy who is running the most  valuable company in the world and he says I'm glad he says a gift from God.  Kara wrote a good article about it I was gonna ask her about it but yeah there it  is. It's good for him. Yeah good for him. She says it's the Tim Cook moment but  that's all we'll do because we want to talk about actual technologies as  opposed to the kind of the gossipy social angle although not that I'm against

Start time: 424.68
End time: 433.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  gossip. Right this isn't that Tim Cook coming out isn't gossip it is like a  huge it's just a huge step forward for humanity if you ask me. I agree. Yeah I agree.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well and I also think it humanizes Apple more and I think that's something Tim's  been doing since he's come in he's gotten the Steve Jobs monkey off his  back. Well that's clear isn't it? Yeah and they're talking about things like the  environment much more than they had before I mean they always had sort of  the green push initiative but Tim Cook really means it and talking about social  issues trying to do something about labor issues in China and I think this  is where he kind of steps up and he walks the walk and says and in addition  to that this is who I am he humanizes himself he humanizes the company and I  think he kind of puts this whole CEO as a superhero but with a touch of evil in

Transcript:  know there's always there was that trend it was sort of the the Ellison's and the  Balmers and Steve Jobs and and these CEOs that were brilliant but you know  sort of people you wouldn't want to meet on the street because they'd kill you  and where I think with Tim Cook he's more of a the kind of a guy who has a  real life and you say yeah this this is an individual who's willing to talk  about himself and not be that guy as tough as he may be in business but to  actually show that he's a human being. He's talking here at the Wall Street

Transcript:  a story on how to punish stores that don't that have turned off Apple Pay if  you're really mad at them just a silly thing do you think people are gonna do  punish them yeah and the way you punish them is to use a credit card with the  highest possible charge American Express yeah right let's use your Amex from now  on at all right eight stores well I don't will people's I think people are  gonna be pissed I don't think it's a non-starter what currency yeah it's just  insane because I mean not to sound like a fanboy but I'm already bored by Apple  Pay because it is just so unbelievably easy it actually works it's so such a  non-event to use it right so Chris didn't you say that I think somebody

Start time: 747.60
End time: 798.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah I think it's yeah I think it's a really great system the take I have on  this story is that Apple Pay is great for us as consumers it's great for the  credit card companies because they're gonna make more money because people  can use the thing more it's good for the banks but it's not so good for the  retailers because they're trying to get out from under credit cards you know you  kind of like so you understand why they're doing this right but you're right  it's a terrible implementation it's consumer hostile and so I think it is  kind of a non-starter where people are gonna go in and just say you know I'll  go to Walgreens instead because they're gonna accept Apple Pay and you are not  and I think that's too bad because I would like to see the retailers get  something out of this but I'm it's not gonna be that way it's gonna have to be  some other method where they're gonna get a break somehow on credit card  payments or something happening so that they want to they want to be part of it

Start time: 798.62
End time: 833.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  it is ironic and I almost wonder maybe if they've been targeted by discredited  Apple Pay lovers because they aren't even public they're still in a pilot  program and they had to send out an email to their pilot users saying an  unauthorized third party had obtained email addresses they said don't worry a  lot of the addresses are dummy accounts used for testing purposes that's not a  reassurance if it's if you're not a dummy account the currency app itself  was not affected so don't worry and yes we take their secure security very  seriously we're not any good at it but we take right and there are just dummies

Start time: 833.50
End time: 837.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  who are using the dummy accounts dummy account oh sorry okay please was some of

Start time: 837.92

Start time: 847.86
End time: 877.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  rolls out if it ever rolls out they'll this will have been forgotten but by  then Apple Pay will be people will be so accustomed to using it at Whole Foods  and Walgreens that they'll go to a store and they don't have Apple Pay and I have  to use this other system that wants my socials like no thanks right so it's dumb  very very if you make a customer happy because a transaction is easy they will  come back and buy more stuff if the transaction has a lot of friction you're

Start time: 877.46
End time: 897.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  gonna lose money but you can still use cash in a credit card at any one of these  stores right so yeah if Walgreens is right there maybe you'll use Walgreens  but if it's another mile down the road it just seems to me people are gonna do  what's convenient I don't think Apple Pay by itself maybe it does does it make  you want to shop somewhere because they have Apple Pay that's cuz I'm a nerd yeah

Start time: 898.26
End time: 928.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but I think I think it's Apple Pay has been out now what for a month not even  two weeks no couple weeks okay two weeks and it's already boring and reliable  yeah so and it's it's only just come out but what is left that Apple can do this  you think this is it that Apple is just gonna roll out Apple Pay and that's it  where are the coupons where are the loyalty programs where are all the  little things you do with plastic cards that you are now gonna be able to do  with Apple Pay point this is just the beginning of how Apple is gonna make

Transcript:  retail better or try to anyway and as I think it was Philip Elmer DeWitt last  week pointed out on Twitter one benefit of Apple Pay is the lines move faster  and that would get me to go somewhere if I knew that the line was twice as fast  at Walgreens I might go across the street just because I could get out  faster that's a benefit we I think we mentioned I don't know if we mentioned  this last week they're talking with China about Ali pay Alibaba has its own  pay solution and if they put Ali pay in China I mean Apple Pay in China through

Transcript:  last week well yeah I mean this is the whole getting into China thing is is  huge to the point where you know you think of Apple as being a technology  company and they're selling lots of iPhones but and I've been talking about  the iPhone as as money forever and I think a lot of us have and now that it  is and think of what because they get what point oh two five percent or  something per transaction and I or maybe it's point two five percent that turns  out if in the US alone we spend two trillion dollars on credit card purchases  so if all that was going to Apple Pay that would be three billion dollars a

Transcript:  card company so now expand that to worldwide and say okay well that's  ridiculous of course Apple's not going to get all that let's say they get a  third of that over time that's still an enormous amount of money and in using a  system that people are encouraged to buy with where I did first I mean I think  when Tim was talking the sales pitch about we already have a million people  of course they do because they sold a ton of iPhone 6s and people were  interested in the novelty of it so sure people signed up in droves but I think  it's more people see that in action and we have more and more devices that do  that they're going to get more people thinking of you know not only because of  the security problems with their credit cards like I just had to renew my credit  card for a third time in the last two years right but the but Apple's selling  privacy is a feature now and so the ability to be able to have a unique  transaction with every Apple Pay purchase is enormously powerful so you  can put that kind of stuff behind you be encouraged to use it more and then again  on the other side you've got the the merchants they will now use this it's  it's less secure we need more information from you and you want that  no because you're not gonna they're not gonna kick back the the money they're  saving for the stuff like you get it right right yeah and and that could be a  feature for them if they make this less intrusive and say look we're not paying  credit card fees anymore so we're gonna give you that 2% or that 3% maybe that's  attractive but they got they have to scale down the onerousness of the other

Transcript:  is at the carriers that's why he so he says well counterintuitive Hiroshi  Lachheimer said it sounds like I'm making it up Hiroshi Lachheimer said he  believes the more traditional price tag will actually spur sales Google has  traditionally promoted the Play Store as the primary source to purchase Nexus  devices and in fact that's where it was sold out in 20 seconds but working with  carriers they'll be able to sell it subsidized 200 bucks with a two-year  contract and people are what's the word I don't know what were you looking for  dumb they think that that means the phone cost 200 bucks but of course you  have to have a two-year contract and it gets amortized baked into the cost of  a higher cost of service so Nexus fans says Hiroshi Lachheimer I'm gonna keep  saying his name understand the price a pricing model of an unlocked device but  outside of that paying 350 upfront was a foreign concept let alone you know more  650 so it is it's a nice phone I'm sorry that I didn't get one we're starting to  learn about lollipop the features of the new Android 5 many of which are kind of  taken from Motorola that's another thing that happened this week Motorola the  transition to Lenovo happened so Motorola is no longer a Google company  but Google stripped all the good ideas out of it before they let them go to  Lenovo lollipop which is Android 5 will have the Moto X kind of always the  notifications that's the kind of P active active display they call it this  is a good article from the verge the 12 lollipop features also it has the always

Transcript:  do the real I think the benefit to do Verizon even if they don't use it is  that they could sell they know a lot of personal information about you because  you had to give them your social security number your name address they  know all that stuff as a customer now well the ad networks have the UIDH what  if maybe we did a thing where you tell us the UIDH and we'll tell you the guy's  name and for a buck it's just a buck so that you could see where this nexus  could be very bad FCC though is gonna jump right in and protect us right FCC  is considering actually what might be a good I think on the face of it now I  have not delved deep into it which means I haven't listened to all the smart  people like Cory Doctorow and others but the FCC is considering what they call a  hybrid regulatory approach to net neutrality remember the FCC has been  trying to find a way through this we've talked an awful lot about it some people  say the FCC should adopt title 3 regulation of internet service providers  call them common carriers and then they would have the right to regulate them  others say well that is gonna just kill a title 2 not title 3 it's of the  Communications Act 1934 it's gonna kill you know having this kind of heavy duty  government oversight is just gonna kill the internet and by the way there's not  even any agreement on places like the EFF where there's a lot of debate should  who is who should protect us we agree that we need net neutrality but should we  expect lawmakers to do that they are we know not particularly sophisticated  sometimes ham-handed they might do a worse job than no regulation at all so  the chairman of the FCC Tom Wheeler who is I've never considered our friend  considering he comes from the cable and wireless industries before he was  made chairman of the FCC has actually come up with something interesting a  split-the-baby approach to net neutrality a hybrid approach in which  they would use title 2 they were for wholesale transactions so this is  complicated to explain but remember the Netflix kerfuffle where Netflix was  basically slowed down by Comcast because Comcast just didn't spend money  on their interconnect they let the connection between Netflix and Comcast  become congested and eventually got Netflix to give them some money well we  need the money for a better router can you just give us a few million dollars  for the better router a month and they gave him the money and now all of a  sudden there's no congestion anymore so that's the that's like the interconnect  that's the wholesale internet business and then of course there's the retail  business between me and Comcast so what the FCC is considering is regulating the  wholesale transaction but not regulating the retail transaction keep an eye on  these interconnects to make sure there are no toll lanes on the internet which  is the one of the key concerns I think we all have but not get government  regulation into how the internet service provider works with the consumer
