Transcript:  Yes, I'm blonde and I'm a chick.  So it was sort of an earnings orama this week.  And while I'm not really interested in the earnings for the numbers,  it's not like we're advising anyone on what stock to buy.  I think you learn a lot because they companies have to tell the truth.  This is not marketing. This is how you're going to start the show.

Transcript:  Did you see the front page of Today's Sunday New York Times?  No. Holy mackerel.  They had this big story.  There's a big blowout story about how Apple's not paying enough taxes.  And this guy's going for a Pulitzer with this thing.  But the thing that's weird about they took the entire front page and they ran a graph up the left hand side.  Unfortunately, you have to look at the paper to see this.  And it took up the whole thing. It makes the paper look really thin and narrow.  It's like a complete I thought it was a design nightmare, a disaster.  So well, but there but the Times has given it to them.  Really? They've turned on Apple.  Well, they've got a ton of money offshore, right?

Start time: 364.62
End time: 374.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't they have a ton of their money offshore?  Well, the thing that every time they do every time they do their earnings,  they talk about cash and they say like seventy nine billion of it is offshore.

Start time: 374.80
End time: 400.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, all I know is that this operation they set up is in Nevada.  So they don't pay California taxes on all this.  In other words, one hundred and ten billion dollars is being run through the investment operation in Nevada.  And this is what's a big scandal.  Now, somebody in the chat room just said it's not that big of a deal.  And I'm kind of the same way.  If I was Apple and I could hide all my money somehow without having to pay all these extra taxes,  I think it's the share. I have to do this for the shareholders.

Start time: 401.18
End time: 431.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I mean, just when you think about the pure scope of the money that they're bringing in,  they announced thirty nine billion dollars in revenue this quarter.  This is for quarter Q1, which is when traditionally hardware consumer electronics not the other way down.  Yeah, normally this is 59 percent growth over same quarter last year.  Here's the thing that blew me out of the water.  Eleven point six billion dollars in profit.  Google's total revenue, ten point seven billion.  So they're profiting more than Google's making total revenue.

Start time: 431.98
End time: 434.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google has no real hardware to sell. Right.

Start time: 434.88
End time: 439.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's the thing is that when you're a service company, you're not going to be.  You only got the phone.

Start time: 440.06
End time: 443.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, even if you had a phone.

Start time: 444.22
End time: 447.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I got a phone says Google, I know somebody's selling a bunch of phones.

Start time: 447.78
End time: 457.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But that's a licensing thing. They're not making I mean, it's not like Apple where they're selling.  You know, they are actually selling the hardware and making a profit off.  No, no, this is true. It's not the same.

Start time: 457.50
End time: 459.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it was Google who sent me the phone.

Start time: 460.56
End time: 492.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  What I'm curious about is when when does public opinion start to shift on on Apple?  I think our warm and fuzzies are still like net positive with them right now.  But at some point, you know, Steve is going to be a memory and only that a memory.  And at what point do numbers like this and whether it's legal or ethical or some weird gray area  will stop to matter start to matter less and public opinion will really move in and shift  the direction of the company? When when does that happen?  18 months, 36 months, five years.

Start time: 494.28
End time: 530.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's not about it's not about public opinion.  I mean, it's about the product. It's always going to be I think for Apple.  Somebody asked, when does Apple start to fall?  They asked me that question.  I said, when they start to deliver bad products thus far, they haven't done that.  And, you know, I think one point, I think you're right that when the the sort of Steve era  truly ends, meaning that his influence over future products ends in, say, 18 months,  then I think you you have a bigger question because it's going to be what is the end product?  What are they delivering? And is it still as good?  Is it still as magical?

Start time: 530.56
End time: 544.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  That's kind of what I'm driving at, though, that that, you know, we can take the bubble  of in the aura of Steve Jobs only so far.  When does when do we start going?  Well, this product just stinks.  And no amount of Steve magic can sway that.

Start time: 544.66
End time: 564.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think the other thing, there was a great story in adage this week about Apple's  first misstep post jobs may be exactly around this public opinion sentiment.  It was the Samuel Jackson, Zoe Deschanel ads for Siri.  Did you see these?  Yeah, I saw it.  Where he's asking Siri, where do I find organic?

Start time: 564.92
End time: 566.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Where do I find organic mushrooms?

Start time: 567.30
End time: 570.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Where do I? You know, Samuel Jackson doesn't get enough work.

Start time: 571.70
End time: 579.31
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you expect them to start yelling at some point at Siri?  Just like start screaming, like, what does Marcellus Wallace look like or any of this stuff?  Because it was in the makeshift plane.

Start time: 580.76
End time: 605.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  There's a great episode of South Park a couple of years ago about smug and smug  rising from Silicon Valley, and they used the Prius as their product example,  that all the Prius owners, the smug was rising from the valley.  Now you can replace the Prius in that humorous South Park example with iPhone or I whatever.  And I think things like the Zoe Deschanel ad will just contribute to it.  The people go, oh, this is just too much cute, man.

Start time: 605.52
End time: 612.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it is. It does also go back to the money.  I mean, the money is unbelievable.  And I think this happened to Microsoft when they just got so huge.

Start time: 613.18
End time: 626.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And you can't ignore that unemployment is still near nine percent.  And when when you have rich movie stars talking about organic mushrooms in an Apple ad,  I mean, that could still with earnings like this, it could spell bad things for them.

Start time: 627.38
End time: 662.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is Apple getting disconnected?  Is Apple is Apple disconnected from people in the real world?  That's a fair question.  But, you know, I really believe the reason that we started to see these series ads  is because something I started to wonder myself, had people forgotten about Siri?  Is Siri I wanted to write something called Is Siri lonely?  Because after the initial sort of excitement about Siri and all the games we were playing with her,  I started to notice I didn't see people using it anymore.  And people stopped talking about it.  And there were fewer articles about it.  So Apple needs to remind people, hey, we put this poor woman inside your phone.  Don't forget about her.

Start time: 662.48
End time: 690.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and if this was the one marketing ploy that they had for the four s,  you know, I agree with you.  It seems like Siri has kind of fallen off the radar.  But then you look at the numbers for the phones.  Thirty five point one million iPhones sold in Q1.  The iPhone four is like an old man who's stumbling around,  waiting to be replaced by the iPhone five or the new iPhone or the next iPhone.  And they're still selling  an insane amount of phones.  That's twice what they sold in Q1 2011.

Start time: 693.82
End time: 694.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, they're kicking ass.

Start time: 695.22
End time: 701.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then the other thing that blew me out of the water was the China numbers.  It used to be two percent of their overall revenue.  Now, 20 percent.

Start time: 702.14
End time: 744.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We just got on board with I think this is China Telecom.  They're not even on the number one Chinese mobile carrier yet.  And they're selling tons of phones because even the third largest has  like millions and millions of subscribers.  The thing about Apple's phone, which is which I think is surprising.  Every time we take a look at mobile carriers, numbers, their revenue numbers,  they always go, oh, our numbers are up because we have the iPhone  and the data prices are up because AT&T had a good quarter for this.  Verizon had a good quarter because they had a lot more money  because people want to pay a lot more for data.  And I think a lot of it is just to do with even though these ads  are a bit disconnected, I think Apple's always been disconnected.  They're not a focus group team thing.  They're like, we're going to tell you what it looks like.  This is what you're going to watch.  This is what you're going to like.

Start time: 744.16
End time: 799.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, well, here's the problem is Steve always had a good second sense about these things.  That's why he had those crazy ads with John Hodgman and the other guy  and all and all the ads they had before then.  The Ellen Fice, I think, is my all time favorite,  the girl who's had the dog eat the paper. Anyway,  this idea is a complete violet.  You know, the one basic rule of of marketing is you do not start marketing stuff.  That's not hot.  So if something goes off, you know, kind of falls off the table, you don't say, well,  geez, if we just put some more money behind it, that might do well.  They should. You always take the money and you push it toward the thing that's selling well.  And I think Siri, the decision to start to promote, repromote Siri,  I think may be the chink in the armor.  We might start beginning to witness that we'll start to show up more and more  where they're making mistakes. This is basically this is like a Microsoft ad.  It's a complete waste of money.  Microsoft puts more money behind ads that don't work than any company ever.  No money to waste.

Start time: 800.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But there's a carrier partner.  Isn't there a carrier partner on this commercial that it's not just Apple?

Start time: 804.94
End time: 806.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No good. Two people get to lose out.

Start time: 807.60
End time: 828.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I just thought that was because I wonder if it's getting pushed a little bit from  there. I was going to ask, though, you know, that I do wonder a little bit  if the iPad knew with the retina display is a little bit of a problem for Apple  in that the retina displays the only new thing about it really that matters.  And there isn't a lot to do with it.

Start time: 828.52
End time: 835.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, 11.8 million iPads during the March quarter compared to 4.7  million a year ago. So.

Start time: 836.88
End time: 861.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they're going to sell. I mean, look, they put out something new.  They're absolutely going to sell it.  But the question I'm asking is, you know, because I think the iPad still remains  the best tablet on the market.  But my question is, is this a fundamentally better tablet than the one before?  They simply still filling the market that they have.  And, you know, maybe people are realizing this is just as good as the other one,  but not particularly that different.

Start time: 861.40
End time: 900.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that presupposes a relativity in the purchasing that one of the things I  read this week is that a rising number of people, their first Apple product is an  iPad. It's not an iPhone.  It's not an iPod. It's that the iPad is the device that they're bringing into  transition into a tablet mobile based world.  So I don't know.  I think we make the presupposition that people are choosing between many  iterations or between many different products.  But really, a lot of people, this is their first foray.  And if they're getting the iPad 3 as their first Apple product, they're loving it.  They don't know that it's only a slight iterative advancement from the iPad to.

Start time: 901.52
End time: 906.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 906.68
End time: 910.60

Transcript:  And so, Professor Dvorak, do you believe that that assertion gets me an A?

Start time: 910.90
End time: 912.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 913.32

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. I'm going to take that.

Start time: 916.14
End time: 927.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, what you what you what you said in a long roundabout way was that the market  is not saturated and these newbies that start filling that we haven't seen what  happens when the market gets saturated with these products.  Then what will Apple do?

Start time: 928.18

Start time: 930.44
End time: 941.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You know, it wouldn't surprise me if it got to that, actually.  Yeah, it's not.  But at this point, it's been nuts.  I think it's going to be one of the greatest shorts in the history of the stock market.

Start time: 942.90
End time: 945.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At some point, you'd have to have a pair to go with that now.

Start time: 945.46

Transcript:  The WWDC, the Worldwide Developers Conference, is June 11th at Moscone Center.  This is the Google one?  No, the Apple. Oh, the Apple one.  Yeah. And they put the tickets on sale at five thirty a.m.  Pacific, only sixteen hundred tickets.

Start time: 965.44
End time: 969.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Transcript:  So all the East Coasters will be coming over and all the West Coasters will be SOL.

Start time: 973.22
End time: 1001.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Pretty much. They charged one sixteen hundred bucks a ticket.  They have this. You couldn't buy multiple tickets, I think.  And they were canceling certain companies orders because they were paid.  They were paid by one credit card.  So they to people who are in that situation have to contact Apple to get their  tickets back because they're not reissuing them unless you say something.  So I don't know how people are going to get in in the first place.  I mean, but hopefully people will go in and be like, oh, wow, IOS and OS 10 will be there.  And I don't know what else.  Why didn't they get just take over that?

Start time: 1001.74
End time: 1024.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  You could have probably made it.  Moscone holds a lot of people.  There's no and that there's one auditorium down in the lower part.  That is, if you open up all the walls, because I've seen Oracle uses it.  You could put it in like three or four.  Why didn't they just bring in five thousand people at that price and really go for it?  What was the reason for having a cutoff when there's such a demand?  Makes no sense.  Apple likes to do things.

Start time: 1025.26
End time: 1045.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And maybe Apple, Apple likes Apple likes to sort of control these situations.  I mean, it wants to make it like this really special thing.  You know, and and they succeed.  You know, they'll maybe they'll open up some more seats later.  You know, they'll do something special and keep the interest high and the hype high.  You know, this is just it's their playbook.

Transcript:  A little bit more on the iPhone.  Just keeping with the Apple theme.  Half of all Verizon smartphone activations in Q1 were iPhones.  Seventy eight percent of all smartphone activations on AT&T were iPhones.  And Sprint posts an eight hundred and sixty three million dollar loss.

Transcript:  Sprint going to make it not going to make it.

Start time: 1071.12
End time: 1127.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They'll make it.  I mean, the way they're doing wholesale stuff with their network,  instead of just going with I mean, obviously you want to get consumers,  you want to get the actual people in to buy your phone each time.  And they have the iPhone. They went ahead with that.  And then moving to LTE.  But the fact that they're wholesaling their network to other companies  and they run a lot of like they figured out with WiMAX,  what are they going to do with that?  They're letting their other subsidiaries use it.  I think I think it's a boost and Virgin will be using the WiMAX thing  while that's being phased out.  So it's just kind of at least get some money out of the old technology  have sitting around.  They seem to be at least aggressive enough that they're making moves  because you watch T-Mobile and they're like, look,  we changed our spokesmodels dress and now she's wearing leather.  So that's going to save the company.  And they keep asking for the iPhone, but they can't get it  because Apple won't put in that band in that phone.  So, I mean, Sprint, I think, is at least trying.  They're not like I don't I think  I'm probably on the death watch.  It's T-Mobile. That's what I'm looking at.

Transcript:  And if they were, I mean, that may be part of the problem that they were hosed  institutionally a long time ago when iPhone was introduced, it was the death of Nokia  because institutionally, they were not prepared to adjust to a marketplace  that did adjust incredibly fast.  Well, you know, as a ready for it, they put out junk products that over,

Transcript:  I think I was going to just say that, you know, with Nokia, they were  they were the leader in feature phones.  And I think that position put them at risk  because as the rise of the smartphones happened, they just didn't seem prepared  to make the change and they were doing far too well for too long.  And I guess that's what made them, you know, sort of put them at greater  risk than everyone else, because they really were so baked into that market.  And they're still selling.  I mean, they're still selling these Symbian phones in other parts of the world.  But what we're watching right now is Nokia attempting to rebuild.  And, you know, I don't think it's found its bottom yet.  You know, Microsoft phones are taking off.  Windows phones are taking off slowly, but it's a long race.  If they can stick with it, I think they have the money.  I think they have the time.  I don't think it's a bad idea that they've really hitched their wagon to Windows phones.  I think that it's a good platform.  Just a question of if they can accelerate and get back on track.

But I don't I mean, as guys like you that complain about,  I've had a couple of different Android phones and I don't care.

He said, look, this space is here and the potholes have been filled.  We're good. We're cool.  And I kind of wonder if we're there with the new with with the mobile space as well.  Are are the potholes filled?  Are we all the room for innovation has occurred?  We've had major innovation.  Now it's time for minor refinements.  And I wonder if that kind of speaks to John's point about, you know,  the interface can be beautiful, but it really matters what's under the hood.

Start time: 1594.56
End time: 1611.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think you're getting to the point  where you're making a decision between ecosystems, not between hardware,  not between operating systems.  And this goes to John's point where when Microsoft can integrate this  into something that's not called Zune and is more SkyDrive oriented,  I think then it's going to be a more elegant interface.

Transcript:  I think that it has it has a value play.  Certainly people are looking at it as the best value option right now  compared to all the other options for cloud storage.  We'll get to that in a little bit.  But I'm just saying when you look at a ninety nine dollar smartphone  and you're trying to pick something that's,  you know, I really think it's going to be the bottom line.  This is kind of a tangent, but it's when the data data plans start to be tiered  in the same way that the hardware is tiered right now.  I actually don't think it's as much about ecosystems as it is about a consumer play,  the reason why the barrier to entry for people right now on smartphones is not  hardware, it's not, oh, operating system.  It's that the data plans are too expensive.  And until that changes, I don't think it matters.  That's what I think.  But there's also some social issues involved here.

That's the whole thing that they've been pushing for years is that this is  about how this performs and not necessarily what what,  you know, if we can put on a chart and graph out of this.  And when it comes down to performance, part of performance is like,  can I afford this? Can I afford to buy in?

Transcript:  And and I'm going to use that as a segue into the next story, which is Amazon  and the Kindle Fire taking number two spot in tablets.  Fifty six percent of all Android based tablets are Kindle Fire's  the tab 15 percent of Android tablets.  I'm pretty amazed at the speed at which the Kindle Fire has taken off.  And I think it's purely a price play.  I don't know if it's just the price.

Start time: 1733.02

Start time: 1735.54
End time: 1763.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. Do you notice, by the way, it's a com score report and com score left out.  I mean, they didn't actually even consider it, which I find very interesting.  The Barnes and Noble Nook tablet.  They consider that a reader, even though it is fundamentally the same.  It even runs the same version of Android as the Kindle Fire  and has the nearest thing to sort of ecosystem that Amazon's has.  There are some caveats there, but they didn't even look.  So I'm a little I kind of look sideways at these numbers.

Start time: 1764.30

Start time: 1767.90
End time: 1792.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and the other stat that came around around this is that the the seven inch  tablets have much less media consumption than the 10 inch tablets.  And I think that's it's hard to know chicken and egg on this.  Is that because the tablets smaller, the screen is smaller,  therefore people don't enjoy consuming media as much.  Or if you get a smaller tablet, fundamentally, you're just using it  as a reader, which is smaller consumption anyways of of media.

Start time: 1792.82
End time: 1812.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the study for that number was actually looking at browser pages.  How many times you look through a page.  And I know with the seven inch readers, at least something like a Kindle,  the resolution isn't high enough, so you still have to like pinch and zoom.  You might as well be using a phone at that point.  But the 10 inch tablets, at least you can see it all in one pass.  And you can like maybe that make it clear you have a seven inch Kindle.  I've used a seven inch Kindle.

Start time: 1828.74
End time: 1853.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Those are Android two point three devices.  And when I tested both of them, I found with Kindle fire  that a lot of the interface stuff and web pages by default  almost ended up too small and unread.  So you don't have a great resolution.  Everything's kind of small and you have to, you know, as I said,  sort of this pinch and zoom stuff, which is really not what you want.  If you use your iPad, obviously, you're just looking at web pages.  You're rarely doing that.  Everything's kind of sized right.

What what is relatively interesting is they're posting their first loss  since they went public.  They were expected to sell more than 15 million weas.  They sold less than 10 million.

Do you remember when they first came out with the PS3 or the PS2 or whatever it was  when it was an HD and then Microsoft had their one of their products was  and there was all the Wii is a loser.  It was going to be just in the tank.  It was never going to know was going to buy it.  Their company was out of business.  And that was in like 99.  And so here they are again.  Same 10 year cycle.  They're they're got some problems.  I predict that Nintendo will come out of this fine,  mainly because of this happened and happened and happened.

They've got their their butts handed to them by Microsoft and the Kinect.  And so did Sony.  I mean, Sony said, yeah, we'll still do it.  And he talked about in the same sense.  But, you know, basically, I don't know that Wii U is going to we  you is is a is a tablet sort of interface  and an augmented reality experience for the Wii,  but it doesn't fundamentally change the Wii.  So I feel like I agree with you.

Whatever you do, don't call it a tablet.  But I just don't think it's going to be innovative enough  to move the needle for Nintendo alone, unless they have something  really big up their sleeve.

And the thing is, we internally is the GameCube.  So this they're always making money on the hardware.  So if they're making the Wii U and they're at the up in the resolution  and they actually get inside of homes, they're making money on the hardware  the way they're supposed to be.  Their software sales is just crap nowadays.  They need to move and realize, look, you can't you cannot bank  on a handheld portable gaming system alone,  because that used to be the bread and butter.  This is the thing that's going away.  It's like the PDA of the MP3 player.  This thing cannot survive.  Even Sony put in, I think, 3G in their Vita.  You have to have something else in the mobile space.

Transcript:  Thank you, Becky.  And we'll be back with a great panel and more great tweet action coming up.  It's a gauge match coming up in just a little bit.  But first, I wanted to tell you a little bit about Ford.  And they make me do this because I'm the guy who drives a Ford and loves it.  It's my 2010 Ford Mustang with Ford Sink.  And you've heard me talk about this all the time.  I mean, it's sink.  The whole idea of sink is that you control the car with your voice, music,  songs, destinations, even things like gas prices, movie times, horoscopes,  all by without taking your hands off the wheel or taking your eyes off the road.  And that means you're connected, but you're connected safely.  It really solves the driver distraction problem.  That's a big problem and growing all the time.  In fact, you know, I can promise you when my kids get their cars,  they're going to have Ford's because I want them to keep their hands on the wheels.  Actually, my son says not ten and two, Dad.  The new thing is nine and three or eight and four.  Kids today.  Anyway, at least I'll have Ford Sink.  So hands on the wheel, eyes on the road,  and then you press the button on the steering wheel or sometimes it's on the blinker.  And the car basically says, what do you want?  Now, here's a neat thing.  They've got this new thing called App Link that is an API for Ford Sink.  You'll find it in most of Ford 2012 and 2013 Ford vehicles.  App Link means that an app developer can write his app or her app to go with Sink  to be controlled by voice.  See, when you get, you know, in your car, you connect all Ford Sink  vehicles have a USB port like that.  So you connect in your phone, Android, iPhone, Windows phone that way or via Bluetooth.  And now you can talk to the phone.  Pandora is a good example.  It supports Pandora.  So you can say play this station or that you can say thumbs up to that song,  that kind of thing.  They've also got NPR has an app now so you can listen to breaking news  and play your favorite NPR programs.  I heart radio's thumb play service is supported.  That means you can say play KFI or whatever station you want.  The stations hundreds of them all over the country,  as well as the kind of the artist radio now, the Pandora style artist radio.  That means they even support things like thumbs up, thumbs down,  skip to the next song.  All of this without taking your hands off the wheel.  You don't pick up your phone.  You don't look down at the screen.  You don't twiddle knobs.  Open Beak will read you tweets.  Stitcher Slacker Radio will let you listen to podcasts and radio shows.  There's even a Sink Destinations.  So if you didn't get the big screen in your car, and by the way,  it's one way you can save money on Sink.  It's turn by turn directions by voice.  You don't have to have that big GPS screen.  Or if you've got a smartphone and Sink Destinations,  you can use the maps and the turn by turn directions from the phone.  This is really clever.  If you're a developer, check out Ford Sink's mobile application  developer network for help from Ford on how to get your app work with Sink.  There's lots more to come.  If you're a driver, a user, go to your Ford dealer, please.  Just say, I want to try out App Link.  I've got my smartphone and they'll get you in the right car to test it out.  They'll set it up for you.  You can also go to the website, Ford.com slash technology to learn more.  But enough about that.  Let's get back to the gang.  A great twit going on.  Becky Worley, take it away.  Thank you.

Transcript:  It was week two in Google versus Oracle, Oracle versus Google.  If you've been under a rock for week one, basically the deal here is Oracle suing  Google saying that Google should have taken out a license in order to include Java in  the Android operating system.  Week one was that both Larry's on the stand testifying.  I equate this whole thing to the BAFTA awards.  You know what the BAFTAs are, John?

Start time: 2517.76
End time: 2525.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yes, I do.  The Bay Area is at the Bay Area after that.  Is that the is that Leaser shoot Larry?  Is that a games awards BAFTA?

Start time: 2525.64
End time: 2588.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think I think the BAFTAs are the the British, the British, which is, you know,  us Americans, we don't know anything about the films.  We're just interested in what stars show up and what they wear.  And so that's my theory about this this trial is that week one was kind of boring and week  two has actually gotten interesting, though.  It's shocking me.  Not only do we have we have the Larry's weren't there this week, right?  They were not there this week, but we had Andy Rubin there from Google.  This week, I think, too.  Got it. And the big developments, Andy Rubin, despite the fact that he sent supposedly  the smoking gun email saying, hey, we should get that license from from, you know, the  Java license from Sun.  He said, no, I didn't really think so.  And then the interesting thing is a crazy, crazy story is that the copyrights are a mess  now, the actual process.  So I as when they pulled up the files that supposedly showed.  What what was copyrighted, what was on the disks?

Start time: 2588.50
End time: 2605.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently, the records from the Copyright Office said that no disk was submitted.  That's the first thing, which is a problem, because you're trying to go ahead and  copyright something. You got to submit something.  Oracle says it has records, though.  So the thing is, Google's trying to say, look, you want to say this is all copyrighted.  You didn't submit anything.  So how could you possibly do this?

Start time: 2605.50
End time: 2609.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So, I mean, this is a little specious because you don't need to submit anything  anymore for copyright.

Start time: 2609.78
End time: 2636.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. That's the thing.  Like, I'm thinking there's probably there's a lot of ways to get around this.  The headlines read like, oh, they're going to win a technicality because of this.  It's like Oracle's probably got a lawyer smart enough to figure out, like  authentication and figure out the documentation.  It should be pretty easy to figure out.  But I think the more fun stuff was like the verge going into all of the  everything that's in discovery.  So we found out a bunch of stuff with the Google phone 2006 subsidized plans for  ten bucks that Google wanted to do with a discovery is great.

Start time: 2637.04
End time: 2642.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  That's why these companies don't like to do these lawsuits, because discovery just  reveals all kinds of cool stuff.

Start time: 2642.36
End time: 2689.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And Judge also said in the beginning, like, look, unless unless it's the recipe  for Coca-Cola, this stuff's going to be public.  So whatever your plans were, whatever your little, you know, mudslinging is,  we're going to show it publicly.  Don't ask where to be hidden.  So the Google phone thing to me 2006 was interesting.  But then there was another phone where it looks like a Sony Ericsson  phone was supposed to be the flagship Android phone.  The Xperia phone, right?  It wasn't supposed to look like that.  It looks like apparently it would be a look like a PlayStation go.  That's a mock up you're seeing these days.  And you'd slide up the screen and there'd be a QWERTY keyboard that could slide up  and you'd have a game pad.  And then Google decided to go to the Nexus S instead.  And so this could have been a huge break for Sony.  Actually, if you think about Sony Ericsson at that time, they still existed.  Sony bought out Ericsson, I think it was at this year.

Start time: 2689.70
End time: 2691.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, late last year.

Start time: 2692.12
End time: 2697.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they bought out their partner.  And so like this could have been a total shift for Sony.  I mean, who knows what they could have done with.

Start time: 2698.08
End time: 2702.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_09

Start time: 2702.94
End time: 2718.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's the other thing.  And the 2006 Google Android phone looked a lot more like a BlackBerry.  There's no touch screen.  There's no emphasis towards multi-touch gestures, any of that stuff.  So a lot of people are screaming like, oh, they did steal from Apple.

Start time: 2718.48
End time: 2725.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  What do you make of the of the of the T-Mobile revelation?  Basically, what they said is we want to subsidize the data plan  and make nine ninety nine the data plan price.

Kind of to your point about about, you know, maybe are we leaving  certain people completely out?  Like, what about the people who only have feature phones?

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Hmm. They are. Yeah.  And I mean, I don't want to be a jerk at all.  But I mean, we can we can laugh about those,  quote unquote, six people who only have feature phones.  I think there are a lot of hard up people and a lot of economically  marginalized people who still do have feature phones.  There are a lot of people throughout this country who just don't need a smartphone.  And I wonder, you know, are we talking past them or around them or not to them?  You know, should we include them in our discussions?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what is it? 50 percent penetration on smartphones in the U.S.  It's the second fastest adoption since radio of any technology.  And I think the only inhibitor is that data plan.  I mean, I know a cost.  I mean, I know a lot of people who, you know, they have,  you know, they have old sidekicks and stuff that they're just they have actually  lost some connectivity from T-Mobile because they don't want to pay the data plan.  You're kind of host.  You know, if you don't want to pay the data plan, you're host.  But this is my rant.

Start time: 2885.24
End time: 2891.62

Start time: 2899.00
End time: 2937.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I think I think people I would just say that I do think that people,  based on some of the growth numbers you're talking about, that even people  who you might think couldn't afford a smartphone are considering it a necessity,  whether or not that's the right call, I think they are.  And they're finding a way to put that ahead of other needs.  So the people who are buying phones and by the way, when they look,  they're seeing fewer and fewer feature phone choices.  So they're kind of steered in that direction anyway.  But I think that more people are simply saying, well, this is just something  I have to have, you know, it doesn't know one way or the other.  This has got to happen.

Start time: 2938.16
End time: 2949.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So basically what you're saying is that people are just going to go straight  from having a feature phone to having the Google glasses.  That's just the natural.  That's the natural jump, right?  Because those will be out, you know, a couple of months.

I mean, when you start wearing these things and look at how his eyes  focus somewhere in the middle distance or something like they know,  he's talking to Charlie Rose.  He's no longer looking at Charlie Rose.  I would think that can be incredibly off putting.  So you're going to have people who you think even, you know,  they're walking towards you and you think, oh, they're kind of looking at me.  Wait a minute. Are they?  Oh, why is he about to walk into me?  Because he's looking at his Google overlay world  and he's not actually paying attention to you.  I'm I'm I'm fascinated by the technology.  I think it's really brilliant stuff.  I like the head gestures and all that.  But I also think that maybe we're heading down a bit of a dark path.

I don't think that, you know, tens of thousands of years of human evolution  and how we read people's faces and their their expressions is going to  suddenly be changed when we're like, oh, he must be wearing the Google glasses.  So I'm going to excuse that crazy behavior.  It's like, no, he has Tourette's.  Oh, yeah.  So you wouldn't get a pair of John's what you're saying.

So he says, oh, no, these things, this is what you want.  And then he goes into this long explanation about all how useful it would be  because you could look people up while you're talking to them.  You could, you know, you could be doing all kinds of crazy things.  You can be checking out.  You can be doing searches and all these things in the background  while you're doing something else.  And I'm thinking, really?  And he's he is totally convinced that these are going to be the hottest thing  ever for this group of anyone under about twenty seven, I guess, or thirty.

I'm not going to use office anymore.  I'm going to use it just like Dropbox and it's going to integrate into Chrome OS.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Google just says it's going to go into Chrome OS.  I don't know if people are going to go into this one  any more than they did with Dropbox or SkyDrive or any like at this point.  Like I'm just collecting these.  Like I just have a bunch of these.  And I have Google Drive. I have this drive.  I can separate my stuff out, but at least I have about like,  I don't know, almost 50 gigabytes of stuff in storage like on the cloud  because there's so many free services at this point.

Start time: 3288.42
End time: 3309.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Yeah, you take five here at five there.  I want to suggest for someone who wants to code this,  I know that there's actually some it's a violation of some of the terms of service,  but I think it's doable.  And call me, we'll help. I'll help you promote it.  You a piece of software code that finds all these free five  gigabyte things and coordinates it as one virtual drive.

Start time: 3311.08
End time: 3330.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  So you take I got, you know, and now I have, like you said, you got 50 gigs.  Why isn't that one 50 gig unit see as at least your computer  sees as one 50 gig drive and you just deal with it that way  and use all these things.  So every free one that comes out, you get all and you can use  your email box to what Google gives you.  That's why I was thinking you're jailbreaking your cloud storage.

Transcript:  That's what with the clients, at least you can you can do a search  on your own operating system.  That's the only saving grace I have right now because Dropbox and I have  Google Drive and SkyDrive.  So I have all three of them, but at least Finder can look for a spotlight can  or I can use windows for that.  But until there's a web version of that, which would be great.  And like a web file manager, that's like, yeah, I'm aware that you have files  everywhere that be really nice.

Transcript:  ... into the APIs of Google Drive, you know, that it could show just like it  shares a shared folder, it could additionally show and talk with a Dropbox  folder, a Boxnut net folder.  I don't think that would be too terrible.  Well, then they say they're going to have apps that are going to come out for

Transcript:  How many years ago I put everything up into the cloud, into Dropbox.  I use Jungle Disk with Amazon.  I put Dropbox as my top level folder and moved everything under that and I paid  the whatever like 200 bucks a year or whatever for the tons of storage option.  Now, obviously I keep local copies and I keep backups of those local copies, but  it actually works incredibly well, particularly, you know, I run a podcast  network, I need to be able to share with other people media files and setting  that Dropbox, paying 200 bucks and setting it as the top level folder has  worked out incredibly well because of the things that it does that are very  similar to Google Drive and that it just syncs and I don't have to worry about it.  So I think Jungle what?

Start time: 3426.80
End time: 3463.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yes, that's what he used.  Jungle Disk.  I was curious, why didn't Google just build this as an extension in Chrome as  opposed to an actual install?  How often does Google have besides Chrome browser, something that you actually have  to install on your computer?  I mean, everything happens in the cloud with them.  It's always extensions.  So it just seems a little bit odd that they did it in this way that they couldn't  figure out a way to just say, OK, well, your Chrome browser is also your folder,  file folder container exactly like it is, by the way, in the Chrome OS.  So why would you need to actually install anything?

Start time: 3463.74
End time: 3512.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think that part of the answer to that question is on this week in Google,  Denise Howell was saying, if you're up in Redmond, you're asking how come Google  gets away with this level of co-coursing might be a strong word, but putting their  product in out in a format that forces you to embrace a lot of their product.  And you're asking how is that not anti-competitive when Microsoft was doing  very similar things and got their hands slapped for it.  So you've got an operating system, a browser, a document system, a storage  system, a search engine, an email client.  How how is that not tying all these things together in a way that's anti-competitive?

Start time: 3512.84
End time: 3546.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It is anti-competitive.  No one's using Chrome OS as their operating system.  Yet?  I mean, right now, yet.  But how long has it been out and what's the percentage of penetration?  So, you know, you have to actually own a significant chunk of the market in any  market to be looked at or considered a monopoly, and they simply don't have that.  They don't even have, I mean, Chrome as a browser is certainly moving up, although  I wouldn't say they have, you know, overwhelming market share, but the  operating system, talk to anyone.  No one's using it.

Start time: 3546.81

Transcript:  So in in in looking at this, is this something that's going to get people off of  Microsoft Office?  Is this going to change people's perspective in terms of Google Drive?  Is it going to make Google Docs any more appealing?  Not to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, the weird thing is they rebranded Docs into Drive and like, I guess it's good  to have offline offline versions of your documents now.  But like this, this would be like if Office became SkyDrive.  SkyDrive.  And that's not like it's kind of this weird combination of things because it's a  creator of content and it's a storage area.  So that's where people started freaking out with terms of service.  Like, do you own this?  Are you going to be able to copy this?  What's going on there?  Dropbox on the other hand is like, look, you own your stuff.  We don't even care what kind of stuff you have, but you're not creating it in  Dropbox, you're not creating it in Microsoft.  But in Google, you are, you are, you're creating it in Drive.  You're creating your spreadsheets in there and then you're syncing it.  There's a weird, it's a weird combination of things in this.  It's making me slightly uncomfortable with this idea of why are my docs now with my  Drive?  Like they don't have to be that way.

Start time: 3618.30
End time: 3650.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And do you think, I was going to say, do you think that Google has a tremendous  naming problem?  Yes.  They just finally decided to call folders, folders.  They were collections.  Now they're folders.  They're trying to call their creation platform Drive.  They seem to be all over the map when it comes to, in fact, I just don't think  they're very good at it, naming products.  And there's sometimes so they'll name the same, their operating system is the same  name as their browser.  Is this confusing to you?  I'm sorry.  It's just how we like to do things.

Start time: 3658.26
End time: 3668.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also creating confusion.  And I think the hiccup is mostly over with the terms of service that got people  really up in arms.  This was the line, particularly, it's the same terms that we're in Google Docs.

Start time: 3669.10
End time: 3671.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  But it's their omnibus terms of service.

Start time: 3671.46
End time: 3695.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know, but this is the part that's creepy is that when you upload or otherwise  submit content to our services, you give Google a worldwide license to use,  host, store, reproduce, modify, create derivative works.  And then this is the part that gets really weird.  Communicate, publish, publicly perform, publicly display and distribute such content.

Start time: 3696.48
End time: 3724.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We were talking about that on Tech News today.  I mean, that's basically like every time you create a piece of content, you are,  you get a bunch of copyrights and to write that just means, look, we should be able  to do with this stuff what we can.  Like if, if let's say we were sharing a document and you wanted to translate it  to Spanish, that's a derivative work.  And if they don't write that in the terms of service, you can't, they  couldn't do anything, you'd be locked out and they, you could, I guess,  theoretically sue them for copyright infringement because they made a  derivative work of, well, this, this spreadsheet, like maybe the lineup today,  that kind of thing.

Start time: 3724.76
End time: 3727.58

Transcript:  So publicly perform though, what does that mean legally?

Start time: 3727.64
End time: 3760.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  This is like some piece of boilerplate that got in there.  And it just reminds me of the day years and years ago.  I remember when Xerox was in the desktop publishing, they got into the desktop  publishing business with a page maker kind of clone, I forgot the name of it.  And I asked to see a copy.  So they, I had to sign this crazy document that went on and on about liability for  somebody getting injured by the product.  Cause apparently it was just boilerplate from a copying machine.  They took copying machine, the license and gave it to, and put it on software  as if this is going to kill somebody.

Transcript:  I blame the lawyers.  Yeah, the lawyers are just sloppy.  Honorous language, nothing clear.  And they think they're doing their jobs by protecting their clients from all kinds  of liability and giving them, it's the what if, so write it as if anything could  happen and you're protected and you have the rights and abilities.  I don't think that Google is intending to dive into people's personal information  that they put up on Drive and then just pull it and pull it, put it out there to  the world, but it's sloppy at best.  I mean, the TOS is a full of sloppy and ridiculous and unenforceable information.

Transcript:  Leo.  Thank you, Becky Warley.  We'll get back to more tech news in just a bit, but I wanted to tell you a little bit about,  the best thing that ever happened to me as a small business owner, fresh books.com.  When I was young and naive and I was doing my own invoices, I didn't get paid a lot  because I would forget or probably more likely put it off.  And then I, you know, you don't invoice, you don't get paid.  Sometimes I'd wait eight or nine months.  By that time, nobody wants to pay you.  Then Amber MacArthur was Amber that told me about freshbooks.com and my world changed.  Fresh books is the easy online invoicing app for any small business.  It'll save you time.  It gets you paid faster.  They'll even print out invoices.  There are still some clients that want to pay for invoice.  No problem.  For a small additional fee, they'll print it, stamp it, and mail it.  But most of the time, what you want is the invoice online, the email invoice,  because Ana is a button that your clients can pay you with.  They press the button and they get, I think there's something like 11 different online  payment services like PayPal, Authorize.net, and so forth.  And so you actually get paid faster because it's easier for your client.  You can even set up auto pay and auto bill if you want.  If you do time and hours, a lot of us, you know, bill for the amount of time we spend  on a project.  They've got an iPhone app that'll actually time it and then import that data into the invoice.  They also have a web based app if that's easier for you.  This is such a good service.  I want you to try freshbooks.  I've been using them since they started in 2004 and now three and a half million people  have used freshbooks for their invoices.  Try it free for 30 days of unlimited use.  Use everything you need, everything you want to do free for 30 days.  As many clients as you want.  They've got automated late payment reminders.  So, you know, if you don't get paid right away, they'll handle that.  It's just fantastic.  Freshbooks.com, 30 days free.  All I ask is if they ask you, where did you hear about this?  You just say Becky Worley told me.  Give Becky some credit and tweet.  You can mention that too.  Freshbooks.com.  Look, you really, you got to try this today.

Transcript:  Let's do a little let's do a little meat and potatoes right now.  CISPA, the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act.  IAS size.  There's nothing like policy that gets people excited.  Let me see if I can do this some justice.  OK, this has been passed in the House on Thursday.  And basically it's intended to safeguard the United States against cyber threats.  Summarizing as best I can.  It allows technology companies who have information they feel is in the best  interests of national security.  If they want to share that information with the national government, with the  national security director, they may.  It's voluntary.  Without the risk of being sued.  Is that the closest to a short summary?  No.  OK, let's hear it.

Start time: 4124.28
End time: 4126.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, I don't have a short summary because I don't think there is one.

Start time: 4127.39
End time: 4192.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I do.  And I spoke with a colleague of mine who covers the House of Representatives.  I covered the presidential campaign and occasionally the White House.  He knows the House very well.  And you can listen to all of this as a mini report that I did in the same show with  Gina.  Essentially, Becky, you did a pretty good job.  I would add to that indemnification and clarity of routing of information in that  it appears to be something that that we need to understand what's happening with  this bill and not hyperbolically freak out because the biggest risk of CISPA is  that little portions of this could slip in.  It is intentionally designed to be dismantled and that portions of it could slip  into the legislation while we are all distracted with this campaign that's going  to happen over the summer.  What we need to watch for is indemnification and routing of information, meaning like  who is responsible for what types of information and where did this come from?  Where where does this go?  Because information can pop up like blips, be reported to certain places and then  disappear.  OK, does that make sense?

Start time: 4192.96
End time: 4245.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. And the big issue, I think, right now is that as it stands, if a technology  company and many of them are behind this bill, Facebook, the CTIA, I think forty one  of the hundred and twenty companies that are represented by an industry technology  group, Microsoft is apparently backing away from it.  But if one of those companies shares information with the government about what they  perceive as a threat, either to someone, a physical threat, child pornography,  terrorism, national security, if they share that information and the government uses it  incorrectly, the government can be sued.  The company cannot.  And my understanding from what the EFF is saying and some of the other organizations  that are against it is that the companies should be liable if they incorrectly share  information. Yes.

Start time: 4245.22
End time: 4287.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that some actionable components of this can come down to individuals or departments  within technology companies.  So generally, when we look at things like accountability, we're worried about, oh,  this group or this company, just like you said, Facebook or Google is responsible.  But now an individual actor or a group of actors within a company can report something  and step outside of typical protocol.  And that would then default to the government to be responsible for instead of, again,  like Facebook or Google.  And in this case, the biggest and most scary thing, well, not the biggest, but a big,  scary component of the bill is that the government has a ton of precedent and prior  legislation that indemnifies them all over the place from being sued.

Start time: 4288.26
End time: 4328.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. The other part of this that freaks people out is one section that specifically  says that companies may share information, use, I'm quoting now, cyber security systems  to identify and obtain cyber threat information to protect the rights and property of a  self-protected entity.  And I think people are nervous that this could be misappropriated to protect intellectual  property, protect file.  This could be used in a how to share file information about file shares.  I as you had the really good point that in constitutional law, very few words are written  and much is interpreted.  Right.

Start time: 4331.50
End time: 4370.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not figuring out whether you're trying to defend this piece of crap or what, because  this is like one of the most onerous things when you start looking in, especially the  amendments that have been dropped in here.  This is just another attempt to spy on the American public.  It's just that simple.  And if you look at the people that are against it now, you know why Microsoft's backing  off off is you look at the people that are against it and read what they have to say.  And I think that they pretty much summarize what the problem is.  This is an onerous piece of legislation that should be fought against.  And luckily, the Republicans have pushed and pushed it so hard in the House of Representatives  that the Democrats just as a knee jerk reaction will probably reject it in the Senate.

Start time: 4370.52
End time: 4393.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  So I'm not that worried about it, but it will be rejected in the Senate and the and  POTUS, the White House has has vowed to to veto this.  A lot of that could change in the campaign year and a ton of it, like you said, Becky,  will come down to constitutional interpretation, how this particular Supreme Court chooses  to to interpret many of the the properties of this law, not the entire thing, but again,  properties of it.

Start time: 4393.52
End time: 4424.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I want to get back to that.  But but one thing, two important distinctions.  One, this will go to the Senate, not next week because they're on hiatus.  But it looks like there's a different competing bill, the Lieberman bill, which basically  the same smell, but has some some subtleties.  And as far as the Oval Office, they what I heard is that advisors are going to suggest  that it's vetoed.  It has not been clearly stated that it will be vetoed.  But but go back to what you're saying about the interpretation, I guess, because I think  that's that's interesting.

Start time: 4424.78
End time: 4490.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yes. The thing is, you could a lot of people complain that there's a lack of  definitions of this. There's there's some vague things about this.  And there is there are real problems with this bill, that there are there's a lack of  definitions. But when you get to somebody trying to add an amendment, they added in  some clarity to what this covers.  And then there was another vague term in there like national security.  Like, what does that mean?  And if you can you can go ahead and you can write a law that's extraordinarily tight,  let's say the tax code.  I studied this and this regulations, six volumes of this stuff that gets litigated as  often as the Constitution does.  And the Constitution is like one sheet.  It's pretty simple. It's simple, right?  All your rights are on there.  It's there's really no perfect law that can be written anyway.  So let's get that out of the way.  But the thing is, this could be written better.  It could be tighter. But it you don't necessarily want this to go to a court.  And then you have to have like this huge problem first.  Right. It gets passed.  Something goes wrong.  It's got to get litigated up to the Supreme Court for interpretation to a certain point.  If you write the law better in the first place, you don't have to get there.  But you still have interpretation for a very long time.

Start time: 4491.32

Transcript:  Don't get me started.  You just said so we we.  So at this point, this information has been decided by Facebook that they think it should  be shared. Now there's a liability issue.  Now they have to run it through the lawyers.  The lawyers are going to tell them unless this is a sure thing, horrible terrorist action  going on, very obvious clear case, they're going to say, don't share this.  We are will be in such liability.  This is a huge big deal.  That information dies.  It can only be accessed if a warrant, if they get a warrant.  And how is the government going to know that they need to get a warrant to ask Facebook  these questions? So I'm not saying it's right.  Let's just take a look at what the possibility.

Transcript:  Yeah, I understand what you're saying.  But what happens if Facebook decides to do something like you just described?  And then over time, it turns out that in discovery and some other issue, a whole bunch  of instances of similar things that took place that Facebook never took any action on.  You talk about putting yourself in a bind to get really sued.  It's like, how come you called this guy out, but you didn't call this guy out?  And how come? And here's a more onerous situation that you never even brought up.  Are they now liable for some sort of violation of this law?  Can they get really some bad action happening?  I mean, this thing, it opens up a can of worms that is it's frightening for any company  and to be backing it, which Facebook is they're voluntarily saying this is great, which  is mysterious to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It may add more liability in all kinds of other ways in situations that they're unaware  of, I think, to even support such a thing.  And why would somebody be able to do something and be legally exonerated in advance?  I think that's that's like a complete violation of the way the system works.  If you do something, you should be responsible for your actions.  So if you're like busting somebody, you can't go too bad because this law protects me.  I can say whatever I want.  I'm not buying into that being a good thing in any way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, if you're if you're liable for something, it's because you did something wrong.  I mean, if you're all of a sudden making accusations of on people that you don't you  don't have a got a clue, maybe they did something wrong, maybe they didn't.  If you if you think they did something wrong, go up and stand up like a man and say,  yeah, I think they did something wrong, Mr. Policeman.  Not like I think they may have done something wrong.  Why don't you go look into it?  And I'm all scot free.  You can't that's not the way to do business in this country.

We're going to tell you everything we can because we think that's good.  No, that's a horrible thing.  That's what I'm saying. Like it lets them off.  There's no liability.  They're like, OK, we're a company.  We can say as much as we want.  And if you make a mistake with it, then it's your own new government.

But I mean, going back to your point, John, I see a parallel just to advocate  for the other side is that it's like the Good Samaritan law.  You may not be a doctor, but if you see somebody choking and you go  and give them the Heimlich and break their their their rib,

And they'll say to children or they'll just give it up  and slip it into some military spending bill at the bottom and say,  this is here. We got it anyway.  There's something like this is going to happen.  It's just that there's no reason for us to to kind of roll over  every time they come up with one.

You're going to go into the store, you're going to wander around  and you're going to end up buying other stuff.  That's the other thing.  Like if you have like a wad of cash in your pocket, you're like,  Oh, I'm only here to spend the fifty eight dollars I spent on, you know,  this this particular DVD player or something.  You'd be like, huh, they do have booze over there.  I'm going to go get that, too.  And while I'm here, I'll get a gun because they do have guns.  You want some clothes? You want to pay for anything?  You'll buy other stuff and that's going to get more and more money.  That's that's their job, right?

I'm sure a percentage of their audience is going to default on this  or not be able to follow through.  And it shows also that a company like Walmart to say, well, we can  we can save enough money in credit card processing fees to acquire this marginal,  this this fractional audience, but we're still willing to do it.  That's the business.

If you're an eBay seller or an Amazon seller, it's so cool.  It even does international postage.  In fact, it will fill out the forms for you.  So, you know, you don't need to go to the post office anymore.  Even for big packages, the mail carrier comes and gets it.  You can even schedule a free pickup. It's absolutely free.  The post office loves stamps dot com.  You will love stamps dot com.  Try it right now.  I've got a no risk trial offer worth one hundred ten dollars for you.  So you go to stamps dot com.

Transcript:  It makes me a little nervous because I don't want people to think that  your clout score has anything to do with like, let's say you're applying for a job  and you say, well, you know, and I use social media  and I can bring those skills to the job.  What's your clout score, lady?  Yeah, like that makes me nervous.  Somebody else should quantify that.

Start time: 5762.76
End time: 5777.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, right. Right.  And the fact that I mean, this is a company that doesn't reveal their methods,  claims to quantify something that absolutely we need transparency on.  And then when their service stumbles, they send them free Nokia phones and cars.  I mean, come on. Yeah. What? Yeah.

Start time: 5777.80
End time: 5793.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5808.30
End time: 5822.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now the other thing that's a little nerve wracking about clout is that people  can identify what your area of expertise is.  So clout bombing is when you go in and start writing areas of expertise  for people that has absolutely nothing to do with anything.

Start time: 5823.24

End time: 5896.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  And by the way, the reason I don't like this.  Oh, well, here's the here's what bothers me.  It doesn't if you do a lot of retweeting, which I do,  because I believe that one of the things that you do on Twitter is retweet  because it's something interesting and you don't want to just create a note.  You want to give a guy credit credit for the post and you just retweet it.  It's of interest to your listeners or viewers or followers.  So how is this bad?
