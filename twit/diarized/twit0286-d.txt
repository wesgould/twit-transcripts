Transcript:  And also with us, Larry Magid from CBS and Larry's World.  Hey, Larry, good to talk to you.  Good to talk to you, guys.  The big story, and we'll start with the big story this week,  unlike most weeks, the big story this week is,  for the first time in living memory,  and since the internet's fairly new,  I think this probably covers the whole gamut,  the internet was, a country disconnected itself  from the global net.  Egypt, on Thursday, basically turned off the internet  by rerouting its routers,  a change of the border gateway protocol,  so that no traffic could come or go into Egypt.  This in the wake of widespread protests  on the streets of Cairo, Suez, and Alexandria.  On the line with us, to talk a little bit about it,  a Syrian who is helping cover the story  for a citizens website called globalvoices.org,  Anas Katesh.  Anas, thank you for joining us on this week.  My pleasure, Leo.  So, Anas is in Boston, by the way, not in Cairo,  but let's talk specifically about,  we actually asked Jeanne Jardin to come on the show,  she couldn't, but she suggested you,  because Boing Boing's been covering this heavily.  Is this the first time a country has disconnected itself  from the internet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm kind of busy on the details of Burma,  but I think first Egypt disconnected itself  and then from the internet, there were people who said  that actually Burma was the first country  where I don't know the exact details about Burma.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty dramatic if you look at the graph  from Arbor Networks of internet traffic to and from Egypt.  This is January 27th.  You're going along in the morning at a terabyte,  two terabytes by 6 a.m. by 2 p.m.,  nearly three terabytes of traffic into and out of Egypt.  At 5.20 p.m., it's like a cliff.  It drops to nothing.  Can I comment on this chart?  Yeah.

Start time: 300.86
End time: 311.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everybody brings this chart up.  I've seen it on CNN, Fox News, and every place else,  and it's a chart that everyone says,  oh, it drops off the cliff.  Yes, because they turned off the internet.  Why is this a shock to anybody?

Start time: 311.50
End time: 315.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's dramatic to see the sudden drop of internet traffic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  there's no water.  Visualizing it.  Yeah, I think it makes it more and more,  just makes it easier to get your head around it.

Start time: 325.58
End time: 341.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  By the way, it's gigabytes, not terabytes.  I've got the scale wrong again.  So it goes from one to three gigabits  and then drops off to zero.  But that's a lot of internet traffic.  First, let's start on us by asking,  how was the internet being used by protesters?

Start time: 343.20
End time: 405.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, Egypt had a very active internet community,  activists and bloggers.  So people were live tweeting the protests.  They were live streaming the protest video  from their phones via different services.  Photos were being produced, blog posts.  So everything was just output of any,  on every social media platform there is, Facebook groups.  So it was, and the agents tried to stop it.  On the 25th, the first day of protest, they blocked Twitter.  On the 26th, they blocked Facebook.  But people were getting proxies as a convention software.  So even that did not work.  So by the 28th, they just took entire country off the grid.  And even they disabled texting from cell phones  just to go one extra step.  Yes, can I make a comment?  And even Blackberry Messenger Services.

Start time: 405.60
End time: 406.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure, Larry Magid, go ahead.

Start time: 407.18
End time: 439.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it's true that they essentially  cut off the internet, but sort of like cracks  in a sidewalk where a little bit of grass goes through.  We have never seen it.  We still haven't seen a hundred percent block out.  People were getting through.  They were dialing into modems, using analog modems  to dial into other countries.  They've been using satellite phones.  They've been using ham radio connection to the internet.  So even though they tried, they never 100% stopped traffic.  And if you talk to the folks at Facebook or other services,  they will say there was some, though not much traffic  coming from Egypt the entire time.

Start time: 441.12
End time: 472.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's correct.  And actually there have been reports  that actually one ISP left in Egypt  that still has working lines.  It's called Nour, I believe, and it serves around 8% or less  of the entire user base in Egypt.  So there are some users who are still having  an internet connection.  There are people who are still delivering the news,  who are uploading video.  But as you said, it's just a tiny fraction  of the average daily user base.

Start time: 473.56
End time: 479.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anas, was the internet, was Twitter,  were text messaging being used to organize protests as well?

Start time: 480.74
End time: 523.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  What I've seen, social networking was a big part of it.  Like before the protest, there was a group on Facebook  calling for the protest on the 25th,  and it got around 90,000 participants.  So Facebook was a huge part of it.  Twitter comes in hand because it's just an instant way  into exchanging news where the police are,  what's going on, where are the locations of dangers,  where is looting going on, et cetera.  So I think Facebook was a better platform to organize,  but in terms of sharing news instantly  and to an international crowd or just a large crowd,  Twitter was the champion, I would say.

Start time: 526.60
End time: 535.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is one thing I haven't heard a lot talked about.  Who are these protesters and what exactly do they want?

Start time: 537.73
End time: 561.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Basically, protesters represent  the entire Egyptian population.  They come from different political, religious backgrounds,  and their sole demand currently is for Mubarak  to step down, the president to step down,  and for the whole regime to be taken down  and replaced with a democratic government.

Start time: 562.02
End time: 569.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So it is not a fundamentalist revolution?  No, no, no, not at all.  It is pro-democracy revolution?

Start time: 571.02
End time: 572.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Absolutely.  Yet.

Start time: 572.76
End time: 577.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yet.  Well, that's a question.  The Muslim Brotherhood has not been heard from,  is that right?

Start time: 577.64
End time: 579.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, they've been heard from.  They have?  Yeah.

Start time: 580.39
End time: 600.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They joined up.  They have, but just judging by the dialogue  of the people participating,  when one person starts to steer the chance  towards something religious, other people usually,  just tell them that this is a political protest  and those are demands, just don't divert  from the course demands.

Start time: 602.50
End time: 606.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Until they lost their press credentials earlier this morning,  I've been watching Al Jazeera English.

Start time: 607.34
End time: 612.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, they're no longer broadcasting?  Because that was really the only good source.  Yeah, they're kind of underground.

Start time: 612.32
End time: 640.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They've actually been, their license has been taken away,  they were kicked off.  They're not supposed to be broadcasting, but they are,  and that's another point as well.  They're doing it by phone.  I don't think they have as much live coverage  in the streets, but I've been watching that  and I've been very impressed with a lot of the folks  that they've interviewed, young women  that are extremely articulate talking about this movement.  I'm not saying there aren't fundamentalists  that may be part of it, but I'm not seeing them represented  certainly in the coverage from Al Jazeera.

Start time: 641.12
End time: 657.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we should give a plug to your publication too, Anas,  which is of course the Global Voices,  globalvoicesonline.com, which is kind of a citizens,  journalistic enterprise, blogs, and citizen media  from around the world, and there's quite a bit  of Egyptian coverage there as well.

Start time: 658.50
End time: 685.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yes, Egypt is exploding and we've been receiving  huge traffic over the Egypt coverage.  And globalvoices.org, online.org,  just to quickly correct the...  I'm sorry, yeah.  Globalvoicesonline.org, thank you.  And the way that we provide the content  translated into around 15 languages,  so that also gives us an international exposure.

Start time: 687.60
End time: 731.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And actually, it's a good thing that we can see  some translations from the Arabic  of what's being said in Egypt as well, I think.  Absolutely. Yeah, very valuable  to get the actual discussion there.  I wondered, I was in Cairo two years ago  and I learned that the population explosion  going on in Egypt, I think I remember  in Cairo every quarter.  What were you doing there then?  I was not helping the population explosion.  Oh, I'm sorry.  I was visiting the pyramids.  But I wonder, I mean, how much of this  is just pure population pressure  and economic unrest as well?  I mean, I know, of course, Mubarak's been in power  for 30 years and has promised democratic elections  and not delivered, but you have to think  that at some point, just the pure population pressure alone  must be a real problem.

Start time: 733.75
End time: 762.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely.  The economic sector is a big part  of what's going on currently in Egypt.  When you have an authoritarian regime like Mubarak's,  definitely nepotism and corruption is in play  and that just really cuts into the livelihoods  of the average citizen.  I think maybe 40% of Egypt's population  is below poverty line, if I remember correctly,  but I'll have to double check that number.

Start time: 763.42
End time: 815.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also, I was very impressed by a country like ours,  when you might argue this, where the rule of law  is what really applies.  It's so different in a country like Egypt  where it's who you know, it's what Bakshis you can pay,  it's, as you said, nepotism.  And really that's demoralizing in an interesting way.  If there's at least a sense that there's a rule of law  and there's some sense of fairness, that's one thing.  But if there's no sense of fairness,  it's extremely difficult.  And I really felt that when I was there.  Anas, go ahead.  No, no, go ahead.  What do you think is gonna happen?  You know, we saw the Green Revolt in Iran,  basically, you know, we saw it on the internet,  we saw it on Twitter, but nothing really came of it.  Will something happen here?

Start time: 816.50
End time: 867.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think so.  The regime is currently stalling,  they're trying just to basically cause chaos  and looting in Egypt,  just so people would eventually give up and go home,  but I don't see that happening.  The difference between Egypt and Iran is that,  in Egypt for the past few days,  the police have disappeared for a couple of days  and now they're starting to come back,  but police lost control and now they're trying  to lose control and now the army is actually totaled.  They're stationed in Cairo and other major cities  and they're making sure that looting  and crime does not spread.  So I think the average citizen in Egypt  highly respects the army and the custom much more  than police forces that used to be,  that are known to be like the right arm of the regime.

Start time: 867.88
End time: 883.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a question for Anas, if you don't mind.  Sure.  What do you think of the stories we're hearing  that the police are actually out there looting themselves  and some rumors that the police may have been the ones  to open the doors at the prison,  there's apparently thousands of prisoners that escaped.

Start time: 884.46
End time: 921.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that's reasonable and very likely  because they want to start the escalators,  they want to start that here,  they want citizens to want to end these protests  so peace would be reinstated.  So it's a tricky play, it's an old tactic  and now it's being used in Egypt  and I bet it's been used countless times before.  I think a few thugs were looting and attacking people,  they were caught and they found police IDs with them.  Very interesting.  So, it's an unfortunate situation.

Start time: 923.00
End time: 952.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thank you for joining us and giving us your perspective on it  from globalvoicesonline.org.  Thank you.  Excellent source for citizen journalism.  Thank you, Anas.  I think this is important from a technical point of view  because of the cutting off of the internet,  of course it's a big political story,  but I think from a technical point of view it's interesting,  especially since Joe Lieberman of Connecticut  and Susan Collins from Florida proposed this internet kill switch.

Transcript:  No, it was last Congress,  but they say they're going to bring it back in this Congress.  It's still floating around.  Yeah.  And it really, she's from Maine, that's right.  And it really does, this is a very dramatic example  of why such legislation might be a really bad idea.

Start time: 973.86
End time: 1015.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's a bad idea from the get-go,  but it's funny to watch the chat room go on and on about,  ah, it's not possible.  The fact of the matter is with this government  and the kind of rules they've got in play when it comes to...  It's a lot easier if you're totalitarian.  Well, yeah, but at the same time, let's put it this way,  they put out the word, and by the way,  there's a lot of black boxes on a lot of these major ISPs nowadays,  especially like AT&T's got one over in San Francisco  at that CIA headquarters and that crazy building on 2nd Street.  Anyway, say you're a CEO of one of the big companies  and you have like a, you know, somebody calls you from Homeland Security  and says shut down the...  What are you going to do?  What are you going to do?  No, and then end up in Gitmo?  I mean, they throw you in jail.

Start time: 1015.62
End time: 1027.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But this internet kill switch would, I presume,  effectively put a kill switch in each of these places  and you wouldn't have to ask, you just say.  It would be the president without a court order or Congress...

Start time: 1027.40
End time: 1034.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sure that at some point there would be a box on the network  and they just push the button.  And they would go to these boxes  and it would essentially just shut down the machines.

Start time: 1034.76
End time: 1038.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm pretty hard pressed to think of a compelling security reason  why you would want to do that.

Start time: 1038.80
End time: 1047.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they're talking about that.  It's interesting that they bring it up right now, of course,  like what horrible timing.  Why would they bring this up? It's such a bad...  It's like the worst possible time that they could bring it up.

Start time: 1047.36
End time: 1049.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You and Mubarak, together at last, yeah.

Start time: 1050.64
End time: 1066.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I mean, they're talking about how the details of this,  that they would use it for things like  if there was some kind of terrorist incident  and they needed to shut down,  like people were attacking the thing that keeps the Hoover Dam  up and running and stuff.  They would need to shut down the network.

Start time: 1066.30
End time: 1072.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, they definitely don't want Leo Laporte on Comcast  if somebody's attacking the Hoover Dam  because, boy, that could be trouble.

Start time: 1072.34
End time: 1082.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I agree with that theory, by the way.  There could be some massive worm coming in.  Like a bug, a stuxnet, kind of a...  Something ruining the country  and they had to reboot everything.

Start time: 1083.46
End time: 1086.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think our internet reboot switch is a great idea.

Start time: 1087.06
End time: 1122.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the oldest excuse in the world,  that there's going to be some terrorist attacks  so we have to shut down this, shut down that,  break into people's homes to steal information.  This has been going on since the beginning of time.  And as much as I am concerned about terrorism,  I would rather we put our energy  into shoring up the Hoover Dam  so it's extremely difficult to make it happen  than shutting down the entire net.  And, you know, a terrorist will have won.  It's better to be safe than sorry, Larry.  Better to be safe than sorry.  Gee, we're trying to disrupt American business.  Let's just shut down the internet.  Who's going to win that battle?

Start time: 1126.26
End time: 1144.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The ARS technical article on this was pretty good, though.  All the technical details of how, potentially,  they actually did this in Egypt,  going into all the nuts and bolts of it.  But they bring up the point at the end  that how much more difficult it would be, actually,  to do this in the United States,  simply because it's such a bigger country space-wise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right, right.  Everything in European countries and in Egypt, too,  is run through the capital city for the internet,  it sounds like, whereas in the United States,  it's all the different wires coming in from overseas,  that they have a bunch of different hubs  that would have to basically do this all to at once.  It would take a lot more effort.

Start time: 1162.10
End time: 1175.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I remember when I was in Egypt,  I believe that they said that there is basically  one undersea cable going from the Mediterranean  to Alexandria that connects the entire country.  So it isn't so difficult.  It's nowhere near the complexity it would be in the US.

Start time: 1175.68
End time: 1194.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The interesting thing is,  when the internet was first created,  the reason they did this distributed processing  was to avoid, we were worried about the Soviets  cutting out our communication.  The whole concept of the internet is to avoid the ability  for one country to basically cut it.  Yet, obviously, it can be done within that country.  We saw that this week.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's a lot more centralized than it used to be.  There are only a few backbones.  There's a few interconnects.  I don't know.  I mean, this is a great article, you're right, MG,  a really good article in the law and disorder column  of Ars Technica, speaking about how they do this.  I don't think it's quite as easy here.  However, doesn't mean people aren't gonna debate  the need for a kill switch.  It just seems like a terrible idea.  Larry, you said that people are finding ways to get online.  You actually have an article on Larry's World about this.

But if people are tweeting them from the ground,  there's one blogger,  let me see if I can get his name, Wael Abbas.  Maybe he's W-A-E-L-A-B-B-A-S.  And he's blogging from the ground sending pictures.  And he was dark for a while, but he's back up.  So there are people doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It may in fact, you know, they do bandwidth shaping.  They admit it, they don't hide it.  And it may in fact be that's ironically  why they did so well.  Because they were doing bandwidth shaping  and making sure Netflix got enough bandwidth to do the job.  Rogers peaked out at three megabits pretty consistently.  Now so that was part of the test was you have to deliver,  the high, this surprised me,  the highest quality Netflix stream  was almost five megabits for HD, wasn't it?  Was something like that.  Yeah.  And three megabits was the best sustained throughput  anybody did and that was Rogers.

Start time: 2037.04
End time: 2097.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well no, the issue I was trying to remember  what the bandwidth caps are on Rogers.  Cause I think you can get three megabits sustained  but you can only watch for two hours.  No, I'm sure it's, but I think it's like 25 gigabytes.  Chat room, is there a bandwidth cap on Rogers?  60 gigabytes.  That's a lot.  So, but that's the issue, right?  You can get 250 on Comcast.  It wouldn't be too hard to go blow through.  If you watched a movie a night at three megabits,  wouldn't be too hard to blow through 60 gigabytes.  And then they throttle you.  Rocklaw says he's got 125 gigs a month,  but I think there's, so there's different plans, I guess.  60 gigs is two gigs a night.  That's about one movie.  Something like that.  Shaw, the cap is 135.  So they have more caps there.  Anything else to say about that?  No, I think this topic just dropped dead there.  Any other conclusions?  With my brain freeze?

Start time: 2097.36

Yeah, that's amazing, isn't it?  Total internet traffic.  I thought it was more than that.  It's insane.  It probably is more than that.  And like, if that's, you know, if they keep doing that,  obviously the ISPs are gonna get involved  and try and do something to make them pay  or to make us pay more for that.

You know, so you kind of have to,  there's no answer, in other words, John,  and you have to ask, what do you want to watch?  If you want to watch iTunes, you have to have Apple TV.  If you want to watch, to me, if you watch Netflix  and you watch Amazon and you want to watch Twit,  I think the Rokus are nothing better than Rokus.  I agree with you, Leo.

For a while there, I had a Windows PC hooked up to the TV  and it's true, I could watch a lot more,  but the aspect ratio was never right,  the hassles were just too much.  The Google TV, again, it's not quite ready for prime time.  I've got the review box from Logitech.  I think that the Roku, for right now, is a good solution.

Google TV's the first column, Roku's the second column,  and just the capabilities, the things it can do  and can't do, the gaps, what kind of video codecs.  I can't imagine a consumer ever,  well, if they do look at this just being frozen,  and, oh my God, what should I do?  I mean, it's just not clear.  But I have to say, I mean, the easiest thing to do  is just say, get a Roku box.  If you want to watch Apple TV, get an Apple TV.

Start time: 2443.12
End time: 2471.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  20 megabits, it's not sustained.  This has to be sustained.  So that's what you're really looking at.  And you see some of these, like ClearWire,  up and down and up and down and up and down.  They can't sustain it.  So what you're looking for is something  that's got it fairly consistent.  I'd say if you had two megabytes consistently,  as this is Verizon in the middle there,  that would be more than adequate, I think,  for high-def content.  What also was an interesting revelation  is that Netflix will use quite a bit more  if it's available, just that nobody makes it available.

Transcript:  I do every once in a while, but not that often,  mostly because it hasn't been really available  on any of the set-top boxes.  Of course, it's coming out now with the Hulu Plus stuff,  but it sounds like from that article  that they're totally trying to pivot what they're doing  and they're going to become a cable provider,  but just online version, and you'll pay a monthly fee.  It's really interesting that when Hulu first launched,  going to be an iTunes killer or a YouTube killer,  but now it's something totally different  that Netflix is their main competition.  And at the time, Netflix was just doing DVDs by mail,  so no one saw that coming,  but now that's their main competition,  so they totally have to change their structure.  And they're getting so much pushback from the networks  who own big chunks of the thing,  and they're still giving their content to iTunes  and to Netflix, so it's like,  there's really a lot going on there.

But yeah, the only one not doing anything with them  has been CBS, and they've stood on the sidelines,  and it seems like maybe that was the right play now,  considering how tumultuous.

Transcript:  They all are partners, in order to get the content, guys,  they're partners, but that's the problem,  is that there's no controlling partner,  so there's this battle going on.  But if Hulu turns into a cable channel,  they've lost me.  I pay for Hulu Plus right now, and it's really marginal.  What are you paying?  I think it was $10 a month, and I think it's now $8 a month.

It was a streaming music box that was actually very cool,  but only geeks would really care about it.  It was a way of getting the music on your computer  over to your stereo system via Wi-Fi.  And I think the thing they did right is they said,  we need to make a simple box.  Here's the premise,  I gotta connect my TV to the internet.  Everybody's doing complicated stuff.  We need to make a simple box.  It's gotta be under 100 bucks, 99.99, as it turned out.  That's for the high-end one, though.  They have them 50 bucks.  But initially it was $99.  They only had one, now they've branched out.  It's gotta be able to get, hook up to the TV,  hook up to the internet,  and it's gotta be dead simple to use.  And I think that-  It is idiot-proof.

No, I wanna talk a little bit about GoToMeeting,  if you don't mind.  And then we'll continue on.  I'm gonna go away for a minute.  Yeah, you can go away and anybody wants to take a break.  But when we come back, I'm gonna tell you  why it is the end times.  And it has to do with Kim Kardashian.  I think you nailed it.  It is the end times.  But first I wanna talk a little bit about our friends  at Citrix who do that great GoToMeeting program  you've heard me talk so often about.  We don't do conference calls here  at the Twit Cottage anymore.  We do GoToMeetings.  Everybody, I think everybody these days  is working with people around the country,  maybe around the world, a developer in New Mexico  or an agency in New York or a project manager in London,  some development group in Bangalore.  And those conference calls, obviously in-person meetings  are just not affordable, not economical.  And so you do a lot of conference calls.  So those conference calls aren't that great either.  Because people lose their attention, they wander off.  Exactly what's just happened.  So that's why GoToMeeting, it galvanizes them,  it grabs them, it keeps their attention.  You can set up your online meetings in advance  or start them on the fly.  Everyone in the meeting just logs on to GoToMeeting.com.  And this is important, if they don't have the software.  So they don't have to already be set up.  You just send them a link and it's already there.  They're already going.  GoToMeeting.com, in fact you can get going right now.  GoToMeeting, I'm gonna type it in here.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  That's a special URL that'll get you set up  for 30 days absolutely free.  So you can really get a sense of what GoToMeeting  can do for you.  Did I do it wrong?  GoToMeeting.com.  Oh, there you go, I typed it wrong.  GoToMeeting is $49, normally $49 a month,  but you can get it free for the first 30 days.  And that will include, by the way,  free voiceover IP and free teleconferencing.  Let me put it up here.  GoToMeeting.com slash twit, 30 days free.  Give it a try, I know you're gonna like it.  Do more and travel less with GoToMeeting.com.  We are talking about the end times.  MG Siegler is here from TechCrunch.  It's great to have you, MG.  Do you have a beer in front of you right now?  I don't, just water.  Oh, sorry.  Later.  Unplug your headset and plug it in again.  You're getting that weird Cylon effect.  I do that.  We find it happens exactly one hour into the show.  I don't know what that is.  I think it's a memory problem with the...

Justin Bieber, Britney Spears,  then the President of the United States.  But what's really scaring, Kim Kardashian coming on strong.  Kim and Ashton Kutcher.  In some time, I think that we should have a clock  watching this.  At some time in the next week,  based on the graphs, based on growth,  both Kim Kardashian and Ashton Kutcher  will have more Twitter followers  than the President of the United States.  John C.

I'm always bragging, oh, I got an email from...  I get text messages from him.  Everybody gets that.  Yeah, you do.  But the fact is that I do think it's interesting.

She was in Alaska magazine and I was looking at her,  just her bio and her background and everything.  Never heard her speak.  If I had heard her speak, it would have been  a different story because I think, I can't stand listening.  The accents a little much.  The accents a little much.  And as soon as I saw her, I said,  holy crap, this woman's got so many creds,  why don't they run her for vice president?  Interesting.

Ted Koppel said, nobody knows my politics  so they project upon me,  just as they project upon Vanna White a personality.  They project upon me, my politics,  and people tend to like you better  if they don't know much about you.  Because they project upon you something that they like.  Especially if you're vague.  So in fact, it could very well be  that it's a mistake to be too public.  And after all, I think the president,  probably good if the president kind of retreated  to the Oval Office and didn't,  you know, we would just presume  that he was thinking deep thoughts.

But I mean, you know, in general,  I think it's good to be public and open.  But maybe it's this particular president.  I think all the presidents from now on are going to do this.  Tell them how to operate.  You think everybody from now on will tweet.  Yeah.  Well, I remember, you know,  they made a big deal, Jimmy Carter sent the first email.  You know, and then-  The first president, you mean?  First, yeah, he didn't send the first email.  He was the first president to use email.  Actually, I don't think he even used it.  He sent an email.  Yeah. Yeah.  I don't know.  I bet maybe George Bush was, I don't know,  was the first president.  George Bush didn't like-  He didn't do anything.  Nobody.

They wanted to control both the hardware and the software,  the more ground this MeeGo stuff.  And they're doing all this other kind of stuff.  But that does definitely leave the door open.  But I think that was a Business Insider article  that suggested it would be Android.  Because that's kind of the logical step for it.  Because of course it's open source,  they could use it for free.  And more importantly, they could manipulate it  the way they want.  But it's still, I wouldn't rule out them  going with Windows Phone.  Of course, it's from Microsoft.  He has still a good relationship with them, of course.  That's been talked a little bit about.  And the fact that Windows Phone is not doing that great.  The hardware itself gets a lot of praise in the software.  But it's still not selling great.  They need to do something to shake up the market.  And a partnership with Nokia would be huge, obviously.

Transcript:  It's all about an ecosystem.  And that's why Android is useful.  That's why iPhone is useful.  If Nokia could help create that ecosystem,  especially in the developing world  where it's got such a strong base,  then it almost doesn't matter what it chooses.  But it's better to choose something  that's out there already.  I would vote for Android.  But maybe Windows 7 would be an adequate choice as well.

Transcript:  Yeah, but will ELOP really,  that would be like spitting in Microsoft's face  if they do that.  The Android came along and killed Windows Mobile.  So I mean, this would be ELOP.

Transcript:  Actually, if you go to MarketWatch,  I wrote a column about this last Friday, exact issue.  And I concluded that because he came from Microsoft,  he knows that if he picks Android,  it would probably be the death knell  for the Microsoft Windows Phone 7.  So he has to pick them both.  Because Nokia can do this.  And they can bring out both phones.  And they'll just bring out a limited version  of the Microsoft phones.  If they take off, then fine.  If they don't take off, he can say,  hey, I tried.  And he can drop them later.  But there's no way they're gonna ignore  the Android operating system because of the apps.  And they can't throw all their eggs  into the Microsoft basket.  It's not possible.  So they have to pick both.  They can't pick one because they'll lose out  if they pick Microsoft.  If they pick Android, then they'll sink Microsoft.  And he can't do that.  He's not that kind of a person.  So I think you watch, it'll be both.

Transcript:  But they could do something temporarily.  It seems like they're still obviously pouring resources  into what they actually wanna do.  But it's at least a year out, maybe a couple years out.  So maybe they do something temporarily.  And maybe they see if they can help  float Windows Phone for a while.  Since it has gotten a lot of praise.  It's just they've come so late to the game  that they just don't have the hardware.

Start time: 4251.94
End time: 4259.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly, it's coming so late, too little, too late.  It's just really kind of pathetic.  Because everybody likes it.  I like it.  Yeah, everybody likes it.

Transcript:  So MG, what about the fact that Nokia  is so strong in the developing world?  I mean, does that say anything about their strategy?  That most of the people who buy their handsets  are not gonna spend $200 for a handset.

Start time: 4269.26
End time: 4296.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's very true.  I think that for sure they still use Symbian  in their so-called dumb phones,  the non-smartphone variety, the feature phones.  But even that's declining just because overall  the entire market is shifting towards these smartphones.  And soon there will be really, really cheap Android phones  that can also take off in the developing world.  Maybe that's a year out, maybe that's two years out.  But eventually those will be able to compete in price  with the feature phones that we see now.

Start time: 4297.64
End time: 4309.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's why I think Android would be  the best choice for them.  I think that's what they can get into India,  Africa and the other areas where I think  their enormous installed base and growth potential  is really terrific for smartphones if they're cheap.

End time: 4364.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, yeah, I'm sure they do.  It's obvious from the context that you mean  that it means that he will love Windows Phone 7.  No, he also says that I don't think ELOP will have the guts  to do that to his old company, which is interesting.  No, they use guts

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He said, you say I will be stunned if ELOP goes full out  for Windows Phone 7.  That would tell Nokia shareholders  that all they got with him was a Microsoft stooge.  That's a very good point.  Don't you think a CEO coming from a company like Microsoft,  might even be at great pains to pick Android  just because he wants to prove that he's not?

Start time: 4386.84
End time: 4393.44

Transcript:  I don't think it has a snow-boss chance  because it's too little, too late,  and it doesn't have any buzz.  There's zero buzz.  And a point I make in this column I also make elsewhere,  which is the fact that.  Is buzz that important?  Is, well, yeah, I think it is,  but the other thing is their advertising  is actually unselling the product  because what they're saying is look at all these phones.  These people are preoccupied.  They love their phones to the point where they don't want to.  Here's a phone you won't love.  And here's a phone that you won't be like.  You don't care.  You won't care about this phone.  It doesn't make sense.  It's the dumbest ads ever.  I mean, I think they're cute and funny,  but I don't think they sell anything.  Oh, I like the one where he drops the phone in the urine.  I like that.  I also like it when.  The kid throws the ball at dad's head.  I like the ball.  I like the kid hitting the dad.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, you guys are talking about it, it's funny.  I didn't go, I had a pass to go,  but some other meetings and stuff took place.  But the main reason I didn't go  is exactly what you guys are talking about.  It's like Apple's not there anymore.  I know it's just gonna be a bunch of stands  for the iPad and stuff.

Transcript:  That's actually the thing that saddens me the most.  In fact, I, you know, look.  Where was Wacom?  Where was Adobe?  I love the Macintosh computer, I really do.  It's a great computer.  And I just think Apple's giving a short shrift.  There, only 10% of the booths were Mac booths.  Apple's now moved to the apps, this app store,  which is just, basically,  they're turning the Macintosh into iOS.

Start time: 5022.38
End time: 5040.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's sad to me.  Because the Macintosh has certain characteristics  that nothing else can compete with it.  It's Unix.  The video editing, there's nothing else you can do like that.  What's the name of the video editor again?  Final Cut.  Final Cut Pro.

Start time: 5040.42
End time: 5082.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, the Final Cut and iMovie is a free one.  Sure, these iMovies are pretty darn good.  Not bad.  Hey, you know, I did a column for Huffington Post  a couple weeks ago, which most people disagreed with,  but I said that the iPad or tablets in general  are a threat to our creativity.  That having these devices,  which so far don't have decent keyboards,  don't have software that allows you to be highly creative,  except in a few areas,  is actually not a good thing for our children.  Now, 90% of the comments that I would pull up right now.  Think of the children, Larry.  Think of the children.  I think about teachers replacing computers  in the schools with tablets.  And I'm not sure that's a good thing.  I'm not sure we want to dumb down our kids  to the point where they're just punching,  yeah, maybe kids will learn to type on glass.  That's a possibility.

Start time: 5082.22

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, you know, I think a MacBook Air  is the perfect school computer.  The 999 MacBook Air with Google Apps  or some sort of cloud system is a great.  We have three developers in here  from a company called DigiCation  that make a plugin for,  there actually was a standalone education app  that they're now turning into a plugin for Google Docs.  I think that that's a very natural place  for a school to be.  Get the computers out of the schools.  Well, sometimes I think reliance on computers  is probably a bad thing for pedagogy.  I want kids to be a program computer.  I think it's an abnegation of pedagogy.

Start time: 5130.42
End time: 5148.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't want kids to,  kids already know how to use computers.  I want them to know how to program computers.  I want them to be, you know,  where is the next Steve Wozniak gonna come from?  And design computers.  I don't wanna create a nation  that all we can do is consume technology.  We've already done that.  Nobody can tune up their cars anymore.  You know what, actually I think,

Transcript:  Why?  You know what he's doing?  He's teaching TV production  at the Academy of Art in San Francisco.  And I said, Richard, that must be really cool  to get to work with young people  who love and understand technology.  He said, no, you're kidding.  They don't know anything.  Yeah, that's a problem.  The kids today, they don't know how to format.  Today's kids.  They don't know what a file system is  because they never needed to.  It's just part of their, you know, but after,  you know, and he said that,  and I kind of gave me that same feeling, Larry,  of oh my God, well, who's gonna create  the next generation of innovation?  But there is.  The Chinese.  And then, well, no, you go to hacker spaces,  you go to Maker Faire.  If you look around, there are still,  I think it's always been a small percentage of people.  Yeah, you're probably right.  Who really get it, really know it, really love it,  and nothing's gonna stop them from creating.  And those people exist.  In fact, those are the people who listen to our shows.  Those people exist.  That is the problem.

Transcript:  I just think that we have to figure out something  that people can do in this country since.  I agree.  There are no manufacturing jobs left.  I agree.  I mean, if we can't be creative,  we can't produce something, we're in serious trouble.  I'm not saying you can't do that on an iPad.  I'm not.  Look, you don't want to.

Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think that just computing in general  is changing.  We're thinking of computing as the way that it's been  up until now, which is computers.  But all these mobile phones are actually computers.  The iPad's actually a computer.  And people are just learning different things to do.  They're making native apps,  but then they're making also making web apps.  And that's all part of the same thing.  It's just evolving.

Transcript:  Except for you underestimate a lot of,  there are a lot of trucks.  You get outside of Silicon Valley  and there are a ton of pickup trucks.  Cause a lot of people.  I think you're being a little literal minded here, Larry.  Well, he was being,  I thought the metaphor was very interesting.  It was a good metaphor.

Start time: 5285.86
End time: 5291.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 5301.28
End time: 5302.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, where's the flying car?

Start time: 5302.44
End time: 5345.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we fully expected  that there would be this great,  I did deep understanding of technology  in the generation that grew up with the internet  and grew up with technology.  And in fact, that's not the case  because it's a utility for them.  And so there's always been a thin percentage of people  who create, who innovate, who invent.  The Steve Wozniak's have always been a rare commodity.  I don't think they're gonna go away.  I just, I think there are plenty of them.  I think they're just still a rare commodity.  That's an unusual skill.  Yeah.  And so anyway, I'm more bullish than you perhaps, Larry.  I agree with you that the iPad is a consumption device.  I've always said that.  And then every time I say it, people say,  well, no, look at all the things that I can create.

Start time: 5345.66
End time: 5364.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I agree with you 100%.  In fact, I've written it up a couple of times.  It's a total consumption device.  And people, that's why they won  because everyone also did the pad.  They thought of it as an input device  with the handwriting recognition  and the voice ray and all this.  And it was not an input device.  It's an output device.  And that's one that does the Steve Jobs genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we'll see what happens when the iPad itself  and when these other Android tablets  actually get much more powerful.  Right now, they're pretty limited in terms of power.  They run one application at a time,  or if they do two, things start to really slow down.  I don't think it's that, MG.

Start time: 5377.10
End time: 5387.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's really that the iPad is the TV of the future.  It's a very personal consumption device.  It's by its very nature.

Start time: 5387.98
End time: 5407.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think there will be some interesting things  that people will be able to do with video editing  like on the fly.  Certainly, I don't know if you've tried  iMovie on the iPhone.  It's hard because it's on a small screen.  But what they can do with that is pretty amazing.  It's amazing considering that it's done on a phone.  But if you think about if they make these devices  much faster, there's some really cool things to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I will say that, that I've done keynotes.  Normally, I'll do a keynote.  That's the Apple presentation manager on the MacBook.  But I've ported it over to the iPad.  And actually, it's kind of fun to physically handle  these things and size them.  There are some things it touches better for  in terms of creation, I agree.

Start time: 5426.90
End time: 5449.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There are some great music apps for all the iOS devices.  And that's the one thing I did see at Macworld  that I liked were some of the music applications  using the iPad as a keyboard or as a composing device  for DJs.  So it's not totally without its creative advantages.  I'm not trying to say completely.  But in general, I think John and I agree  that it's primarily a consumption device,  at least for now.  The three of us agree.

Now this event that you talked about, John,  News Corp's gonna have this event at the museum  in New York City to announce daily.  Jobs was scheduled to do it in San Francisco,  obviously Steve.  And by the way, there's another example.  Are there other Steve Jobs out there?  Are there more, not just Wozniaks,  but do we need more Steve Jobs?  Is there some?  I'm in a duplicate.  No, I think the clones are in the vat still.  But as soon as they're done, we'll bring them out.  So Eddie Q, do you know the name?

Start time: 5487.10

Transcript:  Well, I think they're going through the roster  and seeing who's good at getting up on stage besides Jobs.  Like you said, they wanted it to be Jobs, obviously,  but he can't do that.  So who's the guy who knows most about this?  It's Eddie Q.

Start time: 5540.18
End time: 5550.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that part of what Apple has to do right now  is to show they've got a roster, that they've got a bench.  And obviously, Tim Cook is part of that bench,  but I think bringing out some of their brighter stars.  Bring him off the bench,

I haven't been over to the house,  but the point is that Facebook was afraid of that movie,  and when that movie came out,  it was the best thing that ever happened to Facebook,  and I think that they're riding it right now.

So remember he was kind of ragging on  Joshua Topolski and Gadget.  I mean, saying terrible things.  This is the number one money making blog for AOL,  which also owns TechCrunch.  And the latest thing is, he says,  I hate those takeover ads, the interstitial ads  when you go to a website.  And he says, there's one on TechCrunch.  I'm gonna get to the bottom of this.  I don't know who sold this, our guys or AOL's guys,  but I hate these.  The real blogs don't have interstitial ads.  He says, I'll probably have to go to a six hour meeting  with a PowerPoint deck.  That's how much pain I'm gonna go through on this,  but I'm gonna fight it.  I thought that was pretty fun.  Actually, I admire him for saying that  because I completely agree with him.

Transcript:  I've seen ads on your show.  In fact, let's take a break.  I'm just giving you a chance, you see,  for all of you to take a little break.  You can go to the bathroom or whatever and relax.  While I talk about backup.  With carbonite.com.  Actually, I'm a big fan of carbonite.com.  Carbonite is the way to back up everything  on your PC or your Mac.  Unlimited backup for the personal stuff  on your internal drive.  They don't back up the operating system,  but who needs to do that, right?  They back up your data.  Now, there's something I rarely talk about  and I should really promote.  We all are big fans of cloud storage.  One of the things that carbonite does  that I think people don't think about,  when that backup's complete,  you can log onto your carbonite account from any computer.  You don't have to wait till a disaster, anytime,  or from their smartphone apps,  their free carbonite smartphone apps,  and there's your data.  So it's a way of actually making your data available  everywhere you go.  Now, that's pretty slick.  And this costs 15 cents a day.  $55 a year for unlimited backup PC or Mac.  I think that's a pretty good deal,  but I want you to try it before you buy it.  So go to carbonite.com right now and use the offer code TWIT.  Carbonite.com, offer code TWIT.  You get two free weeks, and if you decide to buy,  continue to use the offer code TWIT  because that'll get you two months additional.  Absolutely free.  It is backup done.  Right.  Carbonite.  I think I have frozen up the TriCaster here.  Let me see.  Yeah, that's all right.  I can still switch.  We're gonna have a carbonite ad here forever.  No, there it goes.  Okay.  Everybody's left.  Oh no, wait a minute.  Larry's still here.  Thank you for not giving up on us, Larry.  Oh, I know what I did.  I turned off your microphone.  There we go.  Now you may speak.  Carbonite.  Well.  Have you seen this Roy Castillo thing?  Did you see that, MG?  Did you get that on your Facebook?  Do you know what I'm talking about?  That weird thing?  Roy Castillo, it's weird.  It's just a weird, it's like a hack.  First, first Zuck's page gets hacked.  Yeah, I saw that.  That was wild.  I saw this other thing.  And then there's this, yeah,  then there's this mysterious Roy Castillo.  So, I don't know if it's a hack.  It's gotta be a hack.  It's a ghost friend, a man's name,  but it's actually a picture  of a teenage girl wearing sunglasses with WTF on it.  And what happens is you'll be wandering along on Facebook  and all of a sudden in your newsfeed,  you'll see Roy Castillo saying,  off to the now city.  And you can't delete it,  and you can't delete him  because he's not in your friends list.  It's just a weird.  Now, Thursday it disappeared.  But now there's a Roy Castillo WTF fan page on Facebook.  Of course.  Of course, of course.  So you too can share the Roy Castillo WTF fun.  And I believe there's even a Twitter.  I just love the internet.  What would we do without it?  I think we should shut it down.

And I asked him about IPv4, v6,  because of course, where it's going to happen  is internet service providers.  It's not you that's going to run out of addresses.  It's the ISPs that are going to run out of addresses.  And he said he's of the opinion it'll never happen.  Not that it won't ever run out,  but that we'll ever get to IPv6  because it's such a huge technical hurdle.

Start time: 6266.82
End time: 6275.84

Yeah, there's going to be some patches  and it's going to happen  because there's too much money involved.  I mean, the kind of money that Cisco  will be making to some of these other companies,  if we can switch over to IPv6.  It's huge.
