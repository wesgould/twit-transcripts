Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Episode 2  for April 24th, 2005.  Put down your 40s, gentlemen, we're about to pinecat.  So what'd you, Patrick, you saw that Wall Street Journal article about Corey Greenberg.  You said you worked with Corey?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I used to read his stuff in Stereo File and a friend of mine, a guy I worked with for a short period of time at  Windows Sources who became a friend of mine,  was his editor for a while, a couple different magazines.  I also, somebody was telling me that at least one of our former coworkers is  making a fair amount of money. I know who that former coworker is actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you why. I saw her at PMA, the photo show, and she looked like she was doing TV.  And she's up on a stage and she's doing the thing with the gadgets and it looked like it was for,  and so I said, what you doing? She said, oh, it's a satellite media tour.  I said, what do you mean? She said, well,  what happens is we feed this to local news stations. I can't remember who was paying her, Panasonic or somebody.  And I show them all the products and it's never identified as being paid for by a company.  It's very lucrative.  It is very lucrative. I don't blame her for doing it.  But I get offers to do these a lot.  I mean, I've had several offers to do these and I always say no.  And this is the thing that bugs me. Just for people who didn't read the article,  Wall Street Journal kind of outed a number of tech journalists saying that they're getting paid by the companies.  They're plugging on these.  And then the one they singled out was Corey Greenberg, who's the Today Show's gadget guy and apparently does.  Now, what they, it wasn't clear and maybe you got a better sense than I did, Patrick.  It didn't look like he'd been paid specifically for the Today Show appearances,  but that those companies had paid him in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, one of the things it was, one of the things that basically it was,  one of the things it was, boy, there's a sentence in here just yearning to breathe free.  Basically, he was never, he maintained that he was never paid to promote products he was discussing on NBC.  However, he had been promoted to do the tours by companies who, ironically enough,  whose products he was demoing on NBC.  Yeah, so you got to wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And there was no disclosure of that.  That's the big thing.  It makes me mad too that NBC didn't say anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, they basically, they said in a couple of the follow-up articles they were at,  they said they've adjusted their policy for this,  but they also didn't get rid of the guy who got nailed for it publicly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We had this problem on Call for Help.  Remember Gadget Girl?  Yeah.  Gadget Girl, Gadget Girl.  We found out that her flights were being paid for by one of the companies.  And we said, sorry, you can't come back.  We're not.  So, but the thing that bugs me is I think that people read this and assume that you and I and everybody else are all in the same basket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, there was also, I mean, there was, I mean, one of my favorite, one of my favorite, you know,  because I tend not to read the threads because they make me cry.  But one of my favorite threads of all time was somebody who's like, man,  Leo and Pat are totally owned by Intel because Intel advertises them.  And it was on a day where you and I just completely ripped Intel a new elite expletive because, you know,  it's like Intel, it's another processor.  It's a little bit faster than the last one.  It's a lot more expensive than AMD.  So why buy it?  You know?  Right.  And it was on the same day.  It was like, those guys were so owned by Intel, it's like Intel pays for their ads.  And we don't even know, we're sitting in the studio.  We have no idea what commercials are running.  Yeah, we have no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I remember ripping, remember the Pentium 3, they had the, that ID encoded into it so they would know, you know, unique identifier.  And I said, you know, unequivocally on, this is on Call for Help, don't buy this chip.  This is terrible.  Intel should be, you know, spanked.  Please don't buy a Pentium 3.  And immediately, like, we'll be right back.  And then, doon, doon, doon, doon, Intel presents.  And I thought, you know, I didn't know this either.  And people sent me a note saying, you're going to get fired, dude.  But to the credit of our bosses, we never heard heat from that.  I've never taken money for that kind of thing.  But I do, and I feel guilty about this.  I do have advertisers on the radio show.  I mean, they pay me to do their ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So, you know, are you going to fund it out of your own pocket?  Oh, wait, you have to feed your children and have a house.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, you know, I kind of feel like radio, it's kind of accepted.  I mean, you look at, you know, Paul Harvey is doing ads for Bose.  You know, Charles Osgood is doing ads.  It seems like on radio, it's kind of an old timey medium where, you know, the hosts read the ads.  So it's kind of more accepted.  I just, you know, I feel bad because I think that it's now difficult for people to tell who's on the up and up and who's not.  And it makes it hard for me to say things like, gosh, I really love Mac OS X because then I think people say, well, of course he does.  Apple's paying him or something like that, which they're not.  Oh, Kevin, how do you feel about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, you know, I don't really see a problem with accepting goods or services as long as you let people know that upfront.  You have to tell them.  You have to tell the people that are giving it to you because I've accepted free software in the past.  And but I say, you know, I'm not going to give you a plug for this.  I'm not going to rent and rave about it.  Well, that's part of the review process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, we all get stuff in the mail, right?  That's different from getting paid tens, tens of thousands of dollars to do fake television news.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes, it's not that fake.  I mean, how much television news is actually gone, you know, delivered once you take out like fires and plane crashes and car crashes and covering a court event.  I mean, how much television news actually involves people going out and digging and researching and doing it.  I mean, there's some good consumer reporters out there, but there's also a lot of a lot of press release.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, if you see if you see a drug company, if you see a drug report on local television news, guarantee you it's produced by the drug company.  I mean, inevitably, these VNRs.  Hey, you were going to say something about OS 10, Patrick.  I'm sorry, I cut you off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I was going to say apparently OS 10 was shipped early.  Yeah, just a deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, not just dealers and users got FedEx.  Somebody in my chat room said FedEx came yesterday with OS 10 Tiger.  Nice.  That's great.  MacMall is issue.  You know, MacMall sent a bunch of them out and then they issued a recall.  Please send it back.  How many people do you think sent it back?  None.  I'm calling it OS 10 Liger.  Do you guys have Napoleon Dynamite fans?  Have you seen Napoleon Dynamite?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not a big fan.  Oh, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I loved watching it.  I'll probably never watch it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I feel the same way.  I'm with you, Pat.  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a big, you know, I guess I can't.  Now, Rain of Fire.  I could watch over and over again.  What's Rain of Fire?  Tell me about that.  The movie with the dragons.  Oh, that's supposed to be really good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's well, it's like a 50s horror movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I was thinking of the Kung Fu this year's.  What was that?  Kung Fu.  Oh, I can't remember.  I'm bad with that.  Have you been playing with Tiger at all, Leo?  No, I keep trying to download it from BitTorrent.  And this is the problem I have with BitTorrent.  By the way, I will buy it when it comes out, but I'm just trying.  I was trying to get a copy ahead of time.  And the problem I have with BitTorrent is unless there's a lot of seeds,  everybody has the first half of the file and nobody has a second half.  So you get stalled out, right?  You know, it really pisses me off because I can't get anything unless  there's a bunch of good seeds that have the full file.  And this is what's happened with Tiger.  There's a Gold Master Tiger supposedly on the Torrents, but I never know  because I only get halfway through and it just dies.  I've been having some issues with it.  Yeah.  With Torrent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, with Tiger.  Have you really?  Yeah, there's some problems with it.  Like what?  Well, I have some friends that aren't running Tiger.  They're running the last version and I can't connect via iChat with them properly.  There's just some issues.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I'd like to next week try it.  I'll be in line Friday at 6 to get my copy and maybe we can try next Sunday  doing this with the iChat.  That'd be kind of fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I want to get the iSight set up and try that out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, let's try.  Well, at least try it.  We can feed both video and audio.  There's no reason to have to just feed one or the other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm real curious to see what the H.264 looks like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the new HD codec that's supposedly highly scalable.  Steve showed it at the keynote and he would take a window,  you know, a small window on the screen and then stretch it to full high def.  And while the thing's playing, it looked great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we're going to be compressing some more videos with that just to try it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think you'll do system as a 364 or whatever, 264?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, we'll do it quick time and Windows Media and probably kick out a DivX as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a shame we have to do all these different codecs.  I know.  It's not that hard, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, not too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You don't have to.  Just people get upset if you don't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I was surprised.  You know, once this podcast was Slash dotted, until then, everybody was fine with MP3.  All of a sudden, we got all these requests for August for this versions.  Slash dot crowd wants for this.  So I'll do a for this, but watch, you know, it'll be 1% of the total downloads.  We got to come up.  Very vocal 1%.  Yeah, they are.  I got a cease and desist letter from G4 saying you can't use the name, the screen, the bleep.  So somebody suggested that we should call this the revenge of these green saviors.  What do you think?  No, no.  Okay.  Nah, nah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Brought to you by Simple Green.  These green savers have to clean up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's another thing I want to raise.  We should really get some product placement in here, guys.  You know, this is a chance.  Kevin, are you drinking Red Bull and vodka while we're doing this?  Something, you know, we got to.  Yeah, we could do something like that.  Brought to you by Red Bull.  In Canada, there's a whole big issue with people drinking Red Bull and vodka.  And they don't, Red Bull is kind of hard to get because of it.  Really?  What's the deal?  I don't know.  They're like, you know, Canadian health.  It's all going to the people drinking it.  Well, you know, well, you know, first of all, it's probably not a good combination  because it's a stimulant and a depressant and it's like a speedball.  Very cheap speedball.  Yeah, yeah, exactly.  And you, and you, and you drink three of them, you're going to have a heart attack.  And there's a ton of caffeine and I don't know.  I guess there goes the Red Bull product placement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I don't think, I don't think the whole Red Bull killing people has been a major problem.  I don't think it has as much coffee as caffeine, as coffee has in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but nobody's drinking vodka and black coffee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or are they?  No, no.  See here in San Francisco, they call it an Irish coffee and it's coffee and whiskey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes.  So anyway, I got this letter.  So what are we going to call this darn thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'd say we send it to the users.  Let them come up with the name.  All right.  Should have a contest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  We'll have a contest and what will the prize be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The glory of having named us.  I will send them a box of stuff.  I'm clearing out of my garage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I like it.  It's a surprise package.  What's in Patrick's garage?  Find out for yourself.  All right.  So let's set up a Gmail account and we can just use an existing one.  You want to do that?  I've got one already, a generic one.  We'll call it Leo's program at gmail.com.  L-E-O-S program.  P-R-O-G-R-A-M.  I created that because I didn't know what the name of the program was.  At gmail.com.  Send us your submissions.  In the subject line.  In the subject line.  Good thinking, Kevin.  You've done this before.  For the name of this dang show and anything else you want to say.  And we will consider it and a box of Patrick's old crap will go to the winner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Old computer parts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Vintage computer parts.  Will you sign a few of those, Pat?  Hey, I'll sign them all.  I'll help.  Kevin and I will help defray the shipping.  Don't put anything too, no sledgehammers.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know if that's a good prize or not.  There could be some real crap in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what are you?  Should we throw in something else?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I don't know, Pat.  What are you talking about?  What are you actually going to be giving people?  Is it just busted up broken computer parts?  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Everything will be usable.  It'll just be very vintage.  How about some like, you know, 96's Intel Pentium board?  There you go.  Who's looking for some ISA modem cards?  There you go.  I found two boxes of computer parts have been hauling around.  I'll tell you what.  Basically, I hauled...  They were state of the art when I left Jersey in 97.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow.  My web host, VisaWeb, is willing to give away some...  I think they're year-long accounts, a plan for...  They have these Site Builder Express accounts  worth 10 bucks a month.  It'll be $120 value.  So let's pick...  I'll give one to the five finalists.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Okay.  Hold on.  I got something for you then too.  All right.  We're going to find another prize here.  Here we go.  My buddies run Jinx.  So I'll give away five t-shirts for the five finalists,  any Jinx shirt that they want on the site.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So here's the deal, gang.  Cool.  Email leosprogram at gmail.com with your favorite name for this show, this podcast.  Put it in the subject line.  Kevin, Patrick, I, and whoever else.  Robert Heron's out of town today, but when he gets back, he can be involved.  Yoshi's going to join us.  He was supposed to join us anytime now.  He'll be involved.  We'll vote on the top five.  All top five will receive a year web hosting from VISA web and a Jinx t-shirt.  What is it going to say?  Do you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Whatever they want.  There's just a bunch of different hackers and gamer t-shirts.  All right.  You name it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You pick your shirt.  And then the winner gets a box of Patrick's crap.  I like it.  You get the t-shirt and the year-long membership at VISA web and this box of crap.  All right.  I think that's a contest, gang.  And see, we didn't have to go to lawyers or anything.  That's awesome.  I wonder if we do.  I wonder if there is any liability here.  Ah, screw it.  What else is attracting you?  I'm sure there is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What else is it?  Well, in California, one in every six lawyers in the United States is here in California  where somebody can figure out some pretense to sue us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Hey, I owe an apology to Canada.  I'd like to apologize to the entire nation of Canada  for saying that my TV show didn't count because it was in Canada.  That was a joke, gang.  But I got some nasty mail.  People were hurt and I didn't mean to hurt their feelings.  I'm grateful to Canada.  I love going up to Canada.  Kevin, you're coming in a couple of weeks.  Patrick, we've got to get you up there.  I will eventually get there.  Toronto is great, especially once the sun comes out.  It's just a beautiful city.  Did you read some of the comments?  People are really very happy with this podcast.  God knows why.  That's awesome.  Puts the pressure on though.  We've got to come up with something good every week now.  Yeah.  So, Patrick, you had some other things you wanted to talk about.  I forgot.  I have your email here somewhere.  What else is on your mind these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, man.  Wait a minute.  Let me look.  I'll tell you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll remind you.  64-bit Windows tomorrow?  I mean, Monday?  Yeah, tomorrow.  You excited?  I can't even.  Is there any?  We really care.  People have been using the beta for a while.  I don't know if you see anything.  Is the FX64 from Athlon?  Would that benefit from running 64-bit Windows or no?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, it's strange for running.  There's no 64-bit applications, right?  Except for what's out there.  So 64-bit Linux, which people have been running.  Right.  Streaming.  It's kind of interesting that they're finally actually shipping the 64-bit code.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right.  Now that everybody's demanding it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm pretty interested.  I'm interested because I have a 64-bit chip, you know.  So I'd like to install and test it out.  But tell me, is it completely backwards compatible?  Are there going to be any problems with old applications?  Tons of problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why do you say that?  Well, just from what I've heard, a lot of applications don't run on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Really?  Yeah.  Because I know you have to get special drivers.  You have to go re-download the 64-bit version of your drivers that you want for your video card  and whatnot.  So I don't know.  I'm going to hold off for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Running the beta has been a problem.  You know, I have to think some of this is a response to Intel.  I'll never forget doing an interview with Andy Grove some years ago.  And on camera, of course, he's judicious and careful and won't say anything bad about Microsoft.  But off camera, he was furious about Microsoft.  And the reason is Intel will come up with, at this time, they'd come up with a 32-bit chip  and Microsoft was still shipping a 16-bit operating system and it's lagging way behind.  And it's the same situation here where the hardware is 64-bit.  But Microsoft, you know, is still a 32-bit OS until just now.  I think some of it is just that, is to keep the chip makers from biting their heads off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  My question, Leo, my question to you is this, though.  I mean, with 64-bit chips, we see different barriers being broken with the amount of memory  that you can have on a system and whatnot.  But I mean, we've seen this in OS X now for a while with the 64-bit version of the OS.  But I can still open Word pretty much the same amount that I can on a PC.  I mean, what real advantages?  There's no advantage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no advantage.  You hit the nail on the head.  The only advantage is you get more memory.  Right.  That's it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I mean, if you're one of those people who's working with 32-gigabyte databases,  or ginormous video files, it's great.  But yeah, I mean, like the classic is like I run, you know, OpenOffice and Mozilla.  And I want it to be faster.  Should I buy a 3.6-gighertz processor?  And it's like, how fast do you search and replace words in your novel?  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I guess, you know, as we start operating on bigger chunks of data within coding,  theoretically, having a big 64-bit register will make it easier to, you know,  make MP3s or encode MPEG 2 or whatever.  But I don't know.  I mean, I think that that's the whole point of, you know, these Altevac and the SIMD stuff,  the SSX stuff where it's multiple, you know, single instruction, multiple data,  where you can operate one instruction over a bunch of data.  I guess 64-bit would give you an advantage there.  Certainly, that's what, Aftlon 64 looks pretty good, right?  And, you know, things like ripping.  We need Robert Herrom to introduce this.  I think it's a little processor of choice.  Yeah, that's what I've...  Well, it's interesting.  What's interesting?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, just looking at the performance of the new dual-core opterons, which seem to be,  from what I was reading, like Extreme Tech just did a pretty big,  pretty hard look at the dual-core CPUs from AMD and found the opteron outperforming the Intel.  Yeah.  So it's kind of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a hot ship, I think, in more ways than one.  Yeah.  Did you see the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What?  I was going to say pricewatch.com.  Oh, yeah. Let's check the prices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Somebody asked me on the radio show, I didn't really have a good answer for them.  If you were going to build a gaming machine, would you get a dual Xeon?  Not a gaming machine, but...  No.  You wouldn't.  Or even for video editing, a dual Xeon, or would you get...  Is hyper-threading worth it, or would you just get the Athlon 64 FX64?  Which is not hyper-threading.  I'd get an Athlon FX64.  Yeah, so far.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Xeons have never really impressed me that much for the amount of money they cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's all about the cash, baby.  It's all... And I mean, the cash with a CHE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a...  I was just going to say I have a dual Xeon box, but it's my web server.  Do you really?  Right.  Yeah.  In your house?  No, at the host.  It's in the rack.  Yeah.  I suppose.  But you know, that's what they're best for.  I mean, I'm running Linux on it.  It's great.  Yeah, it's a server.  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you see this?  There we go.  Opturon 275 dual core, 2.2 gigahertz.  That's $1,300.  The dual core, 1.8 gigahertz.  The Opturon 265 is running $857.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Now, see, that's good.  That's about the same as an FX, right?  So which would you rather have?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably an Athlon 64.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Actually, I mean, because I started looking at somebody,  and I'm going to buy...  I've got a 500...  One of the original $500 gaming PCs here, and I'm going to buy a 6600 GT graphics card,  which is going to be like $100, $135.  Give me a massive graphics boost.  And I've got, you know, 750 megabytes of RAM in a 2.6 processor.  And really...  That's enough.  Unless I want to update the motherboard.  Not going to get that much more performance out of a major processor upgrade  without spending another $500.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll be honest with you.  I don't feel a lot of...  I have a 2.4 gigahertz Pentium 4.  I don't see a lot of pressure.  I don't feel a lot of pressure to upgrade that even.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, I just recently bought a brand new 64 3500 plus.  Did you?  I didn't want to go FX.  I was just like, yeah, that's fine.  That's fast enough.  It runs Half Life 2 just fine.  I'm happy.  That's a nice chip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What are you playing these days?  Are you doing any...  Remember, we used to always play on the set.  We'd do the LAN parties.  You guys do that?  I mean, not just the...  I know you do LAN parties, but are you guys behind the scenes playing online like we used to?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Not really.  I don't play a whole lot of games there.  That's too bad.  Bretano is off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Bretano doesn't do that anymore?  No, not anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Now that he's a big shot?  That's right.  Well, they move...  The part of the problem is that we used to have a place for the gaming rigs  and they wouldn't move them and now they take them off set.  Oh, that sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They break them apart.  Yeah.  People don't realize...  I mean, this was actually starting to be a problem on the screensaver set  even in commercial breaks, everybody would start sitting down playing Halo 2  or Halo 1, I guess it was.  We weren't paying attention to anything.  We're just playing the game and then the TV show was just in the way.  That's right.  That was so much fun.  It was a pain in the butt.  You were getting good there for a while.  No, never.  Brentano was just...  You and Bretano are the kings.  You were the kings.  That was fun, though.  Patrick, you and I would sit down and we'd just get wiped up with those guys.  So depressing.  Hey, did you see this?  The Canadian judge is holding a teenager's PlayStation hostage  until he serves his time and does his counseling.  I think this is appropriate punishment.  They said you can't have the PlayStation until you're done with your community service.  What did the child do?  I don't know.  He's only 14.  How bad could it be?  But I guess if you go in front of a judge...  The last time you lights your little sister on the fire.  It must have been something, right?  I mean, you know, the judge doesn't get involved unless you did something bad.  What else?  I'm just trying to think what else we can talk about.  You know, I want to put some content in this  so it's not just a bunch of guys sitting around BSing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that hopeless?  I want the Apple camera connector to work on non-photo iPods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  How's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There you go, ladies and gentlemen.  Just to do the camera connector, Apple's camera connector, which is like $29.  Isn't that great?  Plugged into dock connector iPods.  But you have a photo.  Except that it only works on the photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, why do you think?  Obviously they could make it work on the other ones, but...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody said there was some USB logic in the photos, but I'm not sure I'm buying into that.  Well, that might be.  I'm kind of excited.  It's actually I now have someone who answers my phone calls at Apple.  It's a very exciting develop for me as somebody who's reviewing a lot of Apple products.  Because you're with iPod Extreme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or Extreme iPod, yeah.  Hey, what's about those rumors that we're going to see a new iPod this summer?  Is that...  Do you think that's true?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There should be something coming out in June.  What it's going to be is anybody's guess.  Although some people are suggesting that there's going to be wireless headphones.  Like basically the wireless iPod coming out, which I think it's a little early for that yet.  And I think the available technologies used for wireless headphones would be a little cumbersome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Are we talking like Bluetooth?  Is that what they're thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think they'd want to use.  I think Bluetooth is just too big and takes too much power.  It's too low-fi too, isn't it?  Yeah.  And that's where it gets kind of interesting.  Because it could be proprietary wireless technology.  What about just FM modulation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's easy enough to put an FM modulator in the thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  FM modulators sound horrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm glad to hear you say that.  Because they always sounded like they were a little crunchy, little compressed to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They always sound crunchy and compressed.  I mean, I've actually reviewed the word Extreme iPod.com.  Not that I'm going to say that.  You mean Extreme iPod.com?  More times.  The Extreme iPod.com.  But we did like the, I looked at DELO's Transpod and the i-Trip from Griffin and Monsters.  And they're all pretty much equal.  They all kind of hit a target product.  Like the Griffin i-Trip, it's very, it matches the shape and the color of the iPod.  That's the one I use.  It's got a cable.  The DELO's got a basically is this giant iPod on a stick that you plug into your lighter socket  and has the radio built in.  And it amazes me like if it's raining, if it's not raining, which side of a hill you're on,  whether or not you have a good or a bad FM radio, where the antenna is located,  all has a dramatic impact.  And at their best, they can all sound pretty good.  And then you can basically turn a corner and be next to a transformer and have giant static  going through your signal.  And I was actually outside of Laramie, Wyoming.  It had like the 19th time in a thousand mile trip that the channel I was on got stomped  on by a local radio station.  That's the problem.  There's all these great little radio stations like coming across Nevada.  And they'll change.  And there's not enough power in the FM transmitters that are used for portable electronics to  really give you any kind of power or signal quality that's comparable.  It's something the more time I spend with them, the kind of the more frustrating it gets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  I just use a little cassette adapter.  I mean, that's if, of course, many cars don't have cassettes anymore, but that works.  It's getting hard to find cars with cassettes.  When are they going to start putting, when are they going to start putting an audio jack  in the dashboard so I could plug in my device?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's totally, it's totally varying on which Jensen does it.  Sony, it depends on the jack.  Some of them have jacks in the front.  A lot of them actually will have AP inputs, AV inputs, regular RCA jacks in the back of  the head unit.  But Sony does it.  JVC does it on some models.  Jensen does it on some models.  Pioneer doesn't do it on any models.  So you could get an aftermarket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can get an aftermarket that'll have it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How about a USB plug?  What's going to be big this year with iPod is everybody's coming out with their, oh,  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I just would like a USB jack I could plug my shuffle into.  Wouldn't that be cool?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It would be cool, but it's interesting.  It's like the shuffle came out right about the time all the manufacturers finished their  connector compatible designs.  The first one was out was from, oh, I can't remember the name of the company.  It starts with an A, Alpine.  Monster's coming out.  Everybody's coming out with CD changer adapters for the iPods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can really see that there's a development cycle because how long has the iPod been out  and they're just now getting around to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think a lot of it's just concerned with whether or not they're going to change the  dock connector.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I can see that.  You wouldn't want to really be beholden to Apple and on all that.  That's why it should just be a mini jack.  Just give me a mini jack.  That's all I want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's just it.  There's very few head units that actually offer mini jacks on there.  Basically, the more low cost the head unit is, it seems like the more likely it is to  actually have an 8-inch phono jack on front of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  That's funny.  That's true.  I saw some Iowa.  Yeah, I was saying, Pat, I saw some Iowa head units like that that were like  $100 a head lining in the front.  But then I'm like, do I really want an Iowa head unit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Depends on how loud your car is.  I was sitting there.  I was listening to this really good ska band from Virginia called the Pie Tasters.  I used to go see all the time back east.  They had a live concert that was taped that they did for XM radio.  So I got a free trial of XM radio online so I could listen to the satellite broadcast  over the internet on my computer of a band from Virginia, which is just surreal enough  as it is.  I was sitting there.  I was like, this is great.  I love these guys.  They've written all these wonderful songs.  The new stuff sounds good.  And I'm just kind of jamming away on it.  As long as I'm jamming away on it, I don't really notice how really grainy and sound  like an over compressed MP3 from 1998, the audio quality sounds like on the satellite.  The louder your vehicle is, the less you notice it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You mean like this podcast?  Yes.  Yes, exactly.  Speaking of which, we're going to have to wrap this up pretty quick because we're trying  to make this exactly the length of Rob from Sunnyvale's commute.  And he tells me it's 34.5 minutes.  So we can't go any longer than that.  No, I think that's one of the things that's happening, by the way.  That's one of the things people are doing with podcasts.  It's for commutes.  And the more people spend time in cars, the more this is going to be a popular medium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's an interesting thought.  iPotter.org has like over 5,000 podcasts it's tracking now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  5,001 with this one.  How's the system going?  Are you still working on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it's going great.  Hopefully next weekend we should have, well, I'm not going to say an exact date,  but hopefully within the next week, week and a half, we'll have something out and ready to  release.  Two videos, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're doing two at once.  It's like the Lord of the Rings thing.  You're just going to do it all simultaneously and ship them.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'll have some device to talk about that we have actually invented for system for one of  the segments.  It's going to be a world's first.  So we'll talk about that here as well.  Am I afraid?  Oh yeah, be very afraid.  We're talking custom circuit creation and everything.  It's pretty crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anyway, guys, I thank you for your time.  This concludes another edition of the Revenge of the Bleep.  Or is it the Return of the Bleep or the Bleep of the Bleep?  Bleep Bleep.
