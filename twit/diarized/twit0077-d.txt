Transcript:  This is Tweet.  Bandwidth for This Week in Tech is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com slash podcasting.  This is Tweet.  This Week in Tech, episode 77 for November 19, 2006.  Kiss my ring.  This Week in Tech is brought to you by Dell.  Visit Leo's Picks for some great deals on Dell desktops and laptops at twit.tv slash  Dell.  A Sunday afternoon.  And what does that mean?  It means it's time to twit and with the grace of God and the wind in our sails we have a  panel of four starting with John C. Dvorak dot org slash blog who is...somehow somebody  sent me a note.  What was it?  Oh shoot now I can't remember about you and Flog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So it wasn't plugging the blog enough?  I think it was something like that.  Yeah, I've been getting complaints on cranky geeks because I'm supposed to...I guess there's  a drinking contest I think out there.  That's what it is.  They're a little annoyed by the fact that I'm not saying Dvorak dot org slash blog enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sorry, the wild turkey went down the wrong way.  Hold on.  Will Harris is here from bit-tech dot net to correct me and I'm glad to have you on  Will.  Hey, how's it going?  Whenever I say something about Intel I hear from Will.  And Bill McCrone who is kindly sent to join the panel hasn't been on since and I can tell  this because there's a new entry in Wikipedia about us.  You haven't been on since episode 69 it says here.  That's kind of scary.  You were on 4860 and 69.  Well you know this is weird.  The entry is...and Will Harris brought this to our attention.  This Week in Tech panelists and Wikipedia.  Everybody who's ever appeared on This Week in Tech along with the episode number including  obscure people like the captain on the cruise ship who was just basically an incidental  appearance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Boy, somebody's got way too much stuff on their hands.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wikipedia is really scaring me these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know Wikipedia is now banned in China again and I think it has something to do with  this entry.  That's all I can say.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sorry but that brings me to a story that we're going to probably cover eventually but  my blog has been banned apparently in the UAE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's about time.  Is that because you show the faces of women without veils?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think we're trying to figure out exactly what triggered it and we also need to get  it confirmed.  It's only that we have a fan in the UAE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the United Arab Emirates by the way.  Is it like a government filter that's blocking it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what this guy says.  He says this is a real problem in the UAE.  There's a filter mechanism somewhere.  He says you can't do anything about it.  You don't know who to complain to and once it's in place...because he's got other sites  that apparently have been cut off.  People always moan and groan about China but nobody ever talks about this.  Once I get it confirmed I'll start looking into it.  I think it was because we did some stories on the protests of certain Muslim women that  they're protesting these hoodooed rape laws that somebody was trying to get them...there's  a bunch of these weird laws in some of these Muslim countries that they're...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't think it's about sex?  No we don't really...  It's not the first time you've been blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  We've been blocked once before but we don't do any sex.  We've never had bare breasts on the show...or the show on the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've had them on the show.  We've never had them on the blog.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're very effective on podcasts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're very good on podcasts.  We don't do a lot of dirty jokes or anything like that but our bloggers they do a lot of  political stuff in this.  We had a run on Muslim related stuff and I think somebody didn't like it.  Interesting.  But we need somebody...if there's a listener out there in the UAE I would like to get some  confirmation on this if they can help me out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Presuming that the podcast has not been blocked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think you would have heard by now because your podcast...  We have listeners all over.  I know we have.  Yeah and they're all nuts.  I'm sorry I didn't use the right word.  They're all fanatics.  Fanatics.  There would be the word, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you would have heard.  We have the twin fundamentalists out there and obviously whoever compiled this Wikipedia  entry is one of them.  So the big story and people have been bugging me because we didn't cover it last week and  I really...we will cover it in greater depth.  In fact we've asked Eben Moghlin to come back on Floss, our open source podcast to talk  about it.  He's the lawyer for the Free Software Foundation and the guy responsible for GPL 2 and 3.  But the deal is that apparently there was a deal...apparently it's public knowledge...there  was a deal between Novell and Microsoft over Linux.  Novell publishes the very popular SUSE Linux and Microsoft made a deal with them that oddly  enough, SUSE says now indemnifies users of our Linux against lawsuit.  The agreements are in place until 2012.  It's a money deal, although we don't know how much and Microsoft also will buy 70,000  copies of Novell's Linux Enterprise server.  I don't know what Microsoft's going to do with that.  And they're going to do a joint research facility that focuses on interoperability but I think  the key to it really is this key to indemnify SUSE customers.  And now the other shoe dropped this week when Steve Ballmer said he believes that Linux  infringes on Microsoft's patents.  Is that possible?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well this is really interesting because I think at the root of this is the fact that  Microsoft has its new sort of virtualization technology coming up in Windows' Longhorn  server and it wants to be able to offer its own customers the ability to run virtual Linux  within the Windows server environment.  So that is basically I think the premise of the deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah but I think also Microsoft owns or was supporting the SCO lawsuits.  I think this goes back to the SCO lawsuits is what this is.  This is basically that SCO lawsuit rearing its ugly head again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah but I'm sorry but one of the problems they have here is they're going to butt up  against IBM with this tactic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well it depends where the code is.  Nobody's saying you know Ballmer is saying well you know there's an infringing code but  not showing you where the code is.  Novell says in its FAQ on its website on the agreement, Novell makes no admission that  its Linux and open source offerings infringe on any other party's patents.  However, Microsoft General Counsel Brad Smith says we address the proprietary issues through  the net upfront payment, the open source we address through the percentage of revenue.  In other words, it's a settlement.  That's weird.  It's a settlement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well it is in terms but what's interesting is it almost goes the other way.  All the reports which are coming out from people who have seen the deal and some of  the legal professors that have worked on it saying that Microsoft has paid up to $350  million to make this happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft?  Well that…

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Microsoft has paid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because I thought the money was going the other direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Well that's the interesting…  Isn't Novell giving Microsoft a percentage of revenue to prevent Microsoft from suing

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Asusa customers?  Isn't that what's happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well it's about Novell and Microsoft entering this wide ranging agreement and under the  agreement it's basically they want to work together, distribute Linux to Microsoft customers,  all these different things and part of that is Microsoft will say that we're not going  to sue Novell for any infringements that may be in the code there.  Now for which Novell is paying a paltry sort of $30 or $40 million for that part of the  bargain but the overall deal is about $400 million in the other direction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The main flow is that way.  Yeah.  It's hard to believe that Bomber says Linux users owe Microsoft money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey wait a minute.  It will?  Yeah.  Is your accent getting worse?  Sorry.  I just wondered.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is John's way of deflecting what he considers a boring subject.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no.  I'm just wondering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft apparently made a similar offer to Red Hat which said no.  Good for them.  You know we're going to talk to Eben Mowgli and the reason is this looks like if Novell  pays a royalty to Microsoft to cover patent infringement it would be a violation of the  GPL and that's a big deal because if SUSE is suddenly in violation of the GPL, well  I don't know what happens but it's not good.  This is one of the top, if not the top Linux's out there.  Well a lot of developers will drop it.  Absolutely.  In fact they probably already are considering it.  My real question is and it's something that we can't address and I think one of the reasons  we didn't address it last week is it's so complicated and Will you've just pointed  Which way is the money going?  We need more study on this.  Eben would not come on.  I tried to get Eben on and he wouldn't come on until he says I have to read this in greater  detail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a quote from him on Tech News World actually.  I think yesterday it was put up which was saying that, where's the quote?  Moglen made the case that Novell may give up his right to distribute SUSE Linux covered  under the GPL license if the company limits in any way the subsequent distribution of  GPL software by users.  Oh it's really, really complicated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does anybody perhaps suspect that this is just Microsoft trying to, a lot of people  believe that they were trying to confuse things earlier.  Just to make enough people out there who have to make a decision, worry about it.  It's FUD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  FUD.  Well and this is, Microsoft apparently supported, now this is, we talked about this in Twit  3 or something.  I mean Microsoft gave money to SCO for its lawsuits and now Steve Ballmer is saying Linux,  I'm quoting him, uses our patented intellectual property and our shareholders expect us to  protect or license to get economic benefit.  So this is what we're doing.  We want SUSE Linux to, now here's a great one.  This is Steve Ballmer.  I don't know if he's throwing chairs and jumping up and down at the time when he said this  but we want SUSE Linux to have the highest percentage share of that because only a customer  who had, only a customer, my emphasis, who has SUSE Linux actually has paid properly  for the use of intellectual property from Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm appalled.  But there is, wow, but there's this argument that licensing patented, licensing patented  software may violate the GPL.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the question is, Ballmer is asserting that there's proprietary Microsoft stuff in  Linux.  Probably the DOS prompt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's an odds on possibility that the software patents won't hold up too.  There have been so many bogus software patents granted over the last five to seven years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe Microsoft Novell is the new NTP rim.  Terrifying to think about.  Isn't that what we all want?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I mean, SCO looked like that for a long time.  I don't even know what happened that just kind of dwindled away that SCO lawsuit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I think they were intimidated by IBM's lawyers into non-existence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, where's IBM in all this?  I mean, why isn't IBM saying something about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Because they're saying we've got AIX and we've got more lawyers than you two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We don't care.  That's right.  Exactly.  Yeah.  Well, again, it's one of those things where there's something going on.  It's hard to say exactly what is going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It bears watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.  Only time.  The traditional closeout for a reporter who has no idea what he's talking about.  Only time will tell.  Stay tuned.  Stay tuned.  I love that.  You'll see it all the time in local.  Time will tell.  Only time will tell.  Right.  The Queen of England has, I don't know if it's a knight.  What do you call it?  He's honored Jonathan Ives, who was a British subject for his design of the iPod and the  iMac.  She's given him the CBE.  C-E-B-E.  What does that mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a common one.  That's a low end.  He's commander of the British Empire.  Yeah, you're not a knight.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're not a knight or anything like that.  It's not Sir.  He's not Sir Jonathan.  No, no.  It's rather below that, but it's good for people who do quite good works.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Quite good work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So good for John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it a prelude?  I mean, is it like a lieutenant so he could be promoted up or is it just something?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, sometimes you go, I think it's C-B-E, then M-B-E is master, then O-B-E is something,  and then O-B-E is one below Sir.  I think if Elton John can be a Sir, Jonathan Ives can be a Sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Bill Gates is a knight.  He's an honorary Sir.  You can't call him Sir Bill, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The difference is how much income you bring in and how much taxes you pay.  That's a good point.  So you get Sir Paul McCartney because he's worth half a billion dollars, and then I guess  his wife will be a Sir next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who, Bill or Paul?  Well, Paul.  They got divorced.  He dumped her.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know, but she's going to still pay taxes.  Yeah, that's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She does get a lot of the function, doesn't she?  So the Zune came out this week to a resounding snore.  We talked about it last week and pretty much concluded that anybody who bought it would be insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, so I saw one.  We played with it on the Cranky Geeks show.  It's nice.  And I like it.  I like how it feels.  I like the whole thing except for the brown color, but even that doesn't bother me that much.  You know, if it's brown, flush it.  I mean, it's the thing you always think of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I agree with you.  I'm with you on the user interface, the form factor.  I think it's a nice device.  The video looks better on it.  It's the copy protection that's scaring people away.  And the stupid point system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  I heard that.  Well, I mean, I don't have one, obviously, because they're not going to send me one.  But my understanding is that if you transfer, if I have a real MP3 file that I happen to do myself, rip myself,  and I send it to you on your Zune, it adds copy protection to it.  Right.  In violation of our license.  What is that all about?  It's just being safe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Nike can only play it three times, apparently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you can't use the Wi-Fi to like buy it if you want to buy it.  You can't use the Wi-Fi for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think one of the interesting things that came out this week,  now people have actually got their hands on it, is that the battery life for video is worse than the iPod.  Which is silly because it's a bigger device.  The iPod's one isn't great either, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, and it's a huge device.  What are we getting in that big box if we're not getting a bigger battery?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I wonder if somebody's going to crack that thing sooner than later  and be able to get rid of some of that DRM that's in there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why isn't there a Smash My Zune site?  There's a Smash My PS3 site.  Right, I saw that.  I don't see anybody taking a sledgehammer to the Zune.  Maybe because it's so common.  Nothing special about doing that.  It's crazy to smash a PS3, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That is crazy, but it was good theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, maybe it's just me, but I cringe when I look at that video.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And all of those people who had waited on line 18 hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh yeah, they did it in the parking lot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, right in front of the Best Buy line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of my favorite stories about that, of course, everybody that was interviewed that was standing in line for these PlayStation 3s  were there for the same reason, so they could resell the things on eBay.  Nobody's keeping it, yeah.  Nobody's keeping it, which is not a good thing.  But the story I heard is about back East is a guy who hired a bunch of homeless people.  The dentist.  Carted them in and then put a hundred of them in line and got as many of these things as he could, fed them, and gave them each a hundred bucks.  Good deal.  He's doing good works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know if that was the dentist.  There was a dentist who put, I think his whole dental office was waiting in line for him.  His employees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, this guy, this is some sharp operator that just grabbed a bunch of people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody was waiting in line for the Zune.  That's the good news.  You can just walk right up and get one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The interesting thing was that all of the mail I've gotten this week is about personal audio players says simply,  does the new little shuffle sound as good as the old shuffle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does too, doesn't it?  I mean, that's one of the things you've done that I really like is you've tested the audio on these.  And I know you like the old iPods.  The shuffle is good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The shuffle is superb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The first shuffle was the best of all of them, right?  Yes, absolutely.  And the new one is as good?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Interesting.  That's the amazing, well, they're using the same technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, so shrinking it didn't...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Shrinking it helps because they can't put the evil capacitors in there that they put in the regular iPods.  And no one, no audio engineer, no electronic designer that I've spoken with can figure out why Apple took the low road on the other iPods.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What does the capacitor do?  Well, the capacitors are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're coupling capacitors and basically the signal that comes out charges the capacitor and your headphones discharge the capacitor.  And that's how the sound gets from the transistors inside to your ears.  And if you make those capacitors too small, they discharge too quickly on the bass notes.  And that's just simple electronic physics.  So it sounds like a... instead of a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.  Was that again?  Instead of a...  I think that's going down in history, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's going on Wikipedia next.  Well, it should.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I think I forgot to introduce you, Bill McCrone.  I can't believe this.  We got sidetracked with Will Harris.  Who is this guy?  That's Bill McCrone.  He has... well, actually I did say something.  You've been on it before, but who are you?  Who are you, Bill McCrone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's just a guy who calls in once in a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Bill was the guy who started the original Ziff Davis television back in 94 and hired me.  In fact, if it weren't for John C. Dvorak and Bill McCrone, I don't know what I'd be doing.  I'd be a DJ in...  Probably what you're doing now.  Denver.  I don't know.  You guys gave me a big head start in life.  Thank you.  We gave you a big...  What you say?  We gave you a big head?  A big head, yeah.  No, I was born with that, baby.  So Bill... and then Bill, for many years the editor-in-chief of a PC magazine.  And what are you doing these days?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm freelancing.  I'm doing all kinds of white papers and technical dissertations for a large variety of high-tech  companies.  And I'm still writing my column for PC Magazine.  And I also have a sub-specialty, a fun side business, which is modifying Fender amplifiers.  To do what?  Sound better.  Oh, wow.  So I take the raw material, Fender Blues Junior, and do a bunch of mods that I've designed  over the years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You've always been a polymath, a renaissance guy.  I mean, you've always had a broad range.  I still have my...  We always call them a crackpot.  That's another word for it.  Works for me.  I still have my ZD editorial award that you designed.  Oh, yeah.  I love that.  Is it titanium?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is titanium.  And it had to be cut by a water jet that operates at 40 or 50,000 pounds per square inch.  And when the water hits the titanium at that pressure and speed, it actually sparks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wow.  It's a work of art.  It's a beautiful thing.  It's the Chairman's Circle Award from 1997, back when there was a chairman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's good to have an award that can withstand reentry to the Earth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This thing is a lethal weapon.  Are you kidding?  Although that seems to be the trend because Miami Award has points so sharp you could  poke a hole in somebody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was wondering when you were going to plug your Emmy Award.  I can't find it.  I can't find it.  I had a countdown thing here.  I was doing a check.  I know he's going to plug the f*** you watch.  And boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I haven't said it.  This is the first time.  I've been checking Wikipedia in 77 episodes.  It'll be on there tomorrow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is going to be a new Wikipedia entry.  How many minutes until Leo mentions it?  It's like the whole show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's a bunch of people plugging.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've got a new drinking game.  No, actually the reason I mentioned it is I lost.  I don't know where it is.  It's in my garage somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You lost your Emmy?  I lost Miami.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's embarrassing.  Next thing you know, we'll see it on eBay.  Leo's Emmy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So Bill Gates talking at Stanford University just a few days ago, right after the launch  of the Zune, calls the iPod, the iPod, quote, phenomenal, unbelievable, fantastic, and then  says the Zune is more modest.  His goals are more modest than total domination of the poor.  That's good because guess what?  He got his wish.  He got his wish for sure.  He says the company wants to quote, excite people about the concept of sharing music  and video wirelessly.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So he can play it all of three times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you think that Bill kind of was reading the writing on the wall, realized that Zune  was going to be a flop and it started spinning already?  Or does he legitimately think it's just modest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can't believe that Bill Gates would want to do anything less than spectacular, would  he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The original, you know, hype out of Redmond was the Zune was going to kill the iPod.  This is the greatest thing ever.  And I think as the reviews have started to come in, it's become clear this is going to  that maybe Michael Rogers of MP3.com is right.  He said it was going to be the flop of 2007.  He said he'd be surprised if they sold more than 50,000 units.  And he was right.  He was talking about the DRM and that's what's wrong with the Zune, not the form factor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Somebody's going to hack it.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think if the Zune gets hacked, it may actually be an easy hack.  Sometimes these people put stuff in play and then they're all flabbergasted when it gets  hacked even though it was maybe designed to be hacked.  Right.  You know what I mean?  It's like, well, we did our part.  We put this in.  These punk kids, they're always ruining it for everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like DVD decrypter.  I mean, everybody knows where to get it and download it.  And everybody who needs to excerpt something under quote unquote fair use from a DVD uses  it and edits stuff with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but that was not a secret plan of the movie industry.  I could tell you that right now.  Oh, no.  No, but...  But everybody knows.  I think we probably should have a pool how long before somebody puts Linux on the Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why would you want to put Linux on the Zune?  Well, to crack it.  Because you can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, they put Linux on everything.  You can put Linux on a PSP.  Yeah, you can.  The PSP, you know, that's the thing that saved the PlayStation Portable was it was so hackable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Saved it?  Is it still doing well at all?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it saved it exactly.  So what are your bets?  I mean, let's compare.  Look, we've got some new products just came out.  We've got the Zune.  We've got the PlayStation 3.  We've got the Nintendo Wii comes out today.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have the Nintendo Wii.  Of the three, what's the winner?  Everybody says the Wii.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Who's the winner?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  PS3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  PS3.  Oh, a little contrarian view from Bill McCrone.  Why do you think?  I mean, did you get a PS3, Bill?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, not yet.  But because John said Wii, I've got to say PS3.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The cell chip was very promising.  But I tell you, I've talked to a number of people who got in line, waited two nights,  slept overnight in the parking lot, got PS3s.  show yesterday who said he played with it for a few hours and he's ready to sell it  now because it's terrible.  He said, first of all, first thing that happens, it's an hour of firmware updating before you  can even use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is one of the things we have one at the San Francisco office, the Davis office here  in San Francisco.  We were playing with it the other day.  And the first thing the guy, one of the guys, the tech says the first thing that happens  when you boot it up, it says you got to go on the internet to get updated.  For an hour.  And it's like, wait a minute, what if you don't have, what if you bought this for your  kids, you don't really have an internet connection or don't want one, you can't even use the  thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It won't play.  And there is, by the way, no PlayStation Live is there.  I mean, this is not, it's not like Xbox Live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, it is.  The update that you get that when you first turn it on is to upgrade the firmware from,  I think from 1.0 to 1.1.  And 1.1 adds this kind of PlayStation network functionality, which is the PlayStation version  of Xbox Live.  Ah, okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So why wasn't it in the shipping PlayStation 3?  No one will know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They just needed to respect their retail deadlines.  I guess so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No rumble, no rumble in the controllers.  They didn't want to pay immersion for the license fee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right, even the Wii has rumble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's a great quote from somebody that said the PlayStation pad is cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kids love the rumble.  I like the rumble.  I'm a rumble boy.  You know, I mean, I don't care one way or the other, Bill, but the fact is the kids  love the rumble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it works in the Wii because it gives you, especially with the Wiimote where it's  up in the air, it gives you some tactile feedback about what's going on on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's fun, I guess.  I mean, you sound like an old fart.  I am an old fart.  And I've had my share of tactile controllers and things with all the G-forces and gyro  things built into them, and they don't help you play the game any better.  And, geez, rumble, what are you going to do after you get tired of it?  What are you going to do, sit on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think graphics would be the, you know, the high-def would be the thing that PlayStation  3 would be promoting.  You know, well, we support 720p, 1080i.  We've got a Blu-ray HD DVD built in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I have to say it looks good.  Yes.  Which games were you playing?  The basketball game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I've talked to other people who say, yeah, it's good, but it's not much better  than the Xbox 360, which has been out for a year.  No, it's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, how could it be?  I mean, the Xbox is HD as well, and it really set the bar that the PS3 has to leap over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Especially this week with Gears of War that came out on the 360 this week.  Have you played Gears of War yet?  That was spectacular.  Everybody's talking about Gears of War.  Have you played it?  Yeah, I just got it, and it really does look pretty unbelievable.  I can't wait to play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm excited.  So of the three, we're not talking about the Xbox.  I think the Xbox is the one to get, but of the three, the Zune, the PlayStation 3, and  the Wii, what do you think is the winner?  What are the losers this week, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I think everybody is mental about the Wii.  Everybody is hyped it up now to the point where it almost can't possibly deliver what  everybody thinks it can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, but it's only 250 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's true.  It doesn't have to deliver as much, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny because that seemed like a lot for a console a few years ago, but now that  seems like nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there was a great strip on Penny Arcade, if you read that.  I love Penny Arcade.  Where they had, they were taking the mic out of the fact that the Wii controller is designed,  you're playing golf, you stand up and you swing it like a golf club, or you're playing  tennis and you run around like a tennis racket.  And they were saying that you actually can just sit on the couch and just flick your  wrist a little bit.  Yeah, but that's like that has exactly the same effect.  And that was the point was that one of them was standing up and flinging around and the  guy was sitting on the couch and the guy was like, yeah, but you just look like a tool.  Like the gag line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Speaking of a DVD copying, this just fries my gizzard.  The Motion Picture Association of America has added, again, there's a DVD ripping service  in Boston called Load and Go, a couple of years old.  It's actually a great idea.  They sell DVDs, DVD movies, they sell iPods, and they sell a service.  If you buy a DVD and an iPod, they'll put the contents of the DVD on the iPod and then  send you all three.  So you've got the iPod with the videos and the DVD that you legally bought.  Now of course, technically that's illegal, a violation of the DMCA because it's a copy  protected disc.  The MPAA is suing.  They're saying that's illegal.  We want to put you out of business.  Now the thing that gripes me about this is now it's very clear what their motivation  is.  It's not about piracy.  You buy the DVD.  What it's about is greed.  They want an additional $10 so you can put it on your iPod.  They don't want you putting it on your iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Sell a fresh copy in every single format.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every format.  That's pure greed.  I paid $10 to see the movie in the theater.  I paid $20 for the DVD and now they want $10 or $15 for the movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well by your logic, Leo, that means you can go to the theater.  Once you see it on the theater, you should have all these different copies.  I'm not going to take their side on this because I think the real problem here is the fact  that they're overcharging for the secondary services.  I think if it says it's pretty clear, I think I would take their side on this.  Well it's legal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody's denying that the DMCA is very clear.  You're not allowed to do this.  It seems to me if I buy a DVD, I should be able to put it on whatever the hell I want  to put it on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well then I take it back to the other argument.  If you went to see it in the theater, does that mean you have a right to a free copy?  No, no, no, no.  Not at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where do you draw the line?  I think that's different though because a movie is a sort of public showing.  A DVD is a personal copy which you own.  I got it.  I bought it so I could launch it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  I don't mind paying the movie theater and for the DVD, but I do absolutely resent the  fact that they seem to think it's somehow illegal for me.  Same thing goes with a CD.  The RIAA is going back and forth about whether there's such a thing as a fair use of a CD,  but it seems like ultimately if there were such a service with a CD, they'd go after  them.  They don't want you to rip CDs.  Do you think that's a problem, John?  I could buy a CD and put it on my iPod and that's illegal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That goes back to the record rental days when people used to, with vinyl, there was a bunch  of stores that cropped up in Berkeley and they started renting vinyl.  What would people do?  You'd take it home and you'd record it on a reel-to-reel or whatever mechanism you had  and then you'd have the thing.  I mean, that's what people were doing, but that wasn't designed for that.  It was designed where there was something...  But we're not talking about rental.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're buying.  This is purchasing.  I understand that.  I know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm just saying these laws go back.  I don't know how wrong it is, but these laws go kind of back to what was going on then  and I think now they're thinking, well, and then I think the software businesses have  affected this.  The software guys are the ones who came up with the idea that you're buying a license  instead of you're not really buying it.  You don't even own the software.  You're just licensing it.  That means you're subject to all these rules and regulations that come with the license.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No home user wants this.  This is not what people want.  I guess the question is, can they put it over on us?  Are we cattle sufficiently cowed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's great.  You know why?  Why?  Because it makes people more technically adept.  It's stealing stuff.  Absolutely.  I agree with you.  This is the 55 mile an hour speed limit all over again.  Prohibition.  Car and drivers, excellent vote with your foot campaign.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, there's also the radar detectors is probably where you're headed with that kind  of argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Prohibition taught a lot of people how to make bathtub gin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  My favorite radar detectors are ones that send a signal back saying you're only doing  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're kidding.  Oh, that's brilliant.  Yes.  You could buy that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's probably illegal in every state, right?  Those are totally illegal, but they work great.  They do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you go, and the cop goes, wow, that doesn't look like 35, but that's what the gun said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Having worked in the defense industry, once upon a time, I can tell you that these things  do work.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right.  Well, I want your technical expertise here, Bill McCrone, because I am baffled about the  Optimus keyboard.  Have you been following the Art Lebedev?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the OLED keyboard.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  I'll be honest with you.  It's been a year and a half that they've been hyping this.  A keyboard that has OLED keys that are programmable.  And now they're going to take pre-orders in a month.  Is it real or is it a scam?  I think it's a performance art piece.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I guess.  I don't need one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does anybody?  No.  I was skeptical about this thing, but there's issues with OLEDs.  That people just don't want to talk about, which is that they fade.  They're not very stable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Would they take the abuse of a keyboard, pounding on them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would that be it?  I don't think it's an abuse issue.  I think it's just that these things are not that ... I mean, if OLEDs worked as well as  everybody wants ... I mean, they work on phones, but they're only good for about a year or  so.  That's interesting.  It's a chemical situation we're dealing with here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The idea of this keyboard is very cool.  It's a QWERTY keyboard until you start running Photoshop.  Then all of a sudden, magically, the Q turns into a Photoshop icon, the W into a photo.  You actually have these Photoshop tools.  Then you start playing Quake and it turns into icons.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does this remind you ... Bill will remember this.  There's all these guys.  This has been attempted in various forms for 20 years, which is these little templates  that you dropped on top of the keyboard that would do all this stuff.  Nobody cares.  Most people who are professionals using Photoshop, they know all these ...  Your fingers know the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you learn the finger macros.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let me ask you, Bill, is it technically doable, do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  There's no reason why you can't do it, but I agree with John that OLED could be a little  bit scary.  It's still a fairly young technology.  Although, I do know of one forthcoming major manufacturer laptop that has a supplemental  display on it that has a OLED ... It's an OLED display.  That's the concept here, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You don't have to ... Doesn't have to be just a keyboard.  It could be just a little keypad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is just a status display.  It doesn't ... You can't push it to do anything.  Could you make touch OLEDs?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess it's not touch.  It's just a switch, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, this is just ... It's actually built into the key itself.  It's an interesting idea and maybe good for when you're learning Photoshop or whatever,  but just another thing to look down at.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I want to just mention this to the listeners out there.  If anybody wants to really do some interesting understanding of how radio works, try to figure  the segue here where Leo changed the subject from MPAA and its onerous attempts to stiff  the public to this topic because I'm still kind of scratching my head over it.  But it was smooth, wasn't it?  It was great.  It was outstanding.  In fact, if you hadn't called attention to it, I don't think anybody would have noticed.  Well, no.  I think, unfortunately, here's what happened that drew my attention to it was that I don't  think we ever resolved the other issue.  I know that listeners out there, when they get into a topic ...  What's the resolution?  I don't know.  I think that's probably why you ...  The resolution ...  There is a resolution.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're pointing out that the MPAA is suing over something stupid.  You think it's not stupid.  You think that we ought to pay for every version.  No, I didn't.  I didn't say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So there's two ... The resolution here is this.  There are two US laws.  One is the DMCA, which says you can't make copies of stuff if it's copy-protected.  The other is the variously enshrined versions of fair use law, which say that you can copy  the first for your personal use and you're not making profit off it, et cetera.  These two laws appear to sit in complete opposite ...  This has been the issue all along, yes.  There is no resolution to that in US law until there is ...  Until it's a court case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Until somebody goes to court and tries to resolve it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Until that happens and maybe this will go to court and maybe this will resolve it, then  it is an undecided situation.  Hey, hey, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He went to law school, John.  I didn't say that.  He didn't go to law school.  He's got a wig and everything.  I don't think this is it.  Would you have been a barrister or a solicitor?  What the hell's the difference?  Yeah, really.  Well, in England you have two schools.  No, I don't really want to know.  I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I would have been a solicitor.  Solicitor, I like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A solicitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's not the same kind of solicitor.  I'm not a solicitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm a solicitor.  I'm a solicitor.  I'm a solicitor.  I'm a solicitor.  I'm a solicitor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm a solicitor.  I'm a solicitor.  That's the thing, I think that's the thing.  It's the thing.  Yeah.  I'm not sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think there will be a Halo 3 beta forthcoming, which is quite exciting if you're  a Halo fan boy.  Not that forthcoming.  Yeah.  By the way, when he said beta just for translation.  What is that?  It's beta.  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's what I- When I go to England and give talks, I always  have to say bito, or I don't know what I'm talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have a car that's a beta, but I don't think that's the same thing.  I think it's a beta-up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Bita-upper.  Anyway, does anyone know how we're going to be able to upgrade those Xbox 360s to the  HD DVD?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Plug it in.  In January, 200 bucks.  Is it going to be internal?  No, it's like a bag that hangs off the side.  Boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's horrible.  No, you just plug it in over USB.  It's literally just a 5.25 inch.  But it clips on, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it kind of clips on, doesn't it?  Or no?  No.  Oh, it doesn't.  It's a standalone unit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's basically like, if you think on your PC, you've just got an external CD-ROM drive.  It's just like that.  And what people- There are actually some good hacks that I saw this week of, A, people pulling  the unit apart when you look inside it is literally just maybe like an IDE drive, and  they've just got a USB enclosure on it.  So you can rip the drive out, stick it in your PC, download some firmware, and you've  got an HD DVD drive on the cheap for your PC.  I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it works with Macs.  That's going to look good on my 30 inch display.  There you go.  But let me- But see, that's really interesting because if you're looking at the first HD  DVD players, it was a whole computer with Linux, and it had to boot.  What happened?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, those two- Well, those were the standalone ones, weren't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  They were just- They were slow, and they were big, and they were $800, $1,000.  This is $200, and it's just a bare bones drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, and all it does, I mean, it just hooks up and uses all the processing power from  the 360.  It must be a lot of-  All those processors in the 360 are doing the decaying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's got three power PC chips in it, right?  Is that- Does that remind you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the ATI graphics chip as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I see.  I'm thinking, why buy a PlayStation 3?  Get an Xbox 360.  You can walk in the door.  They've got a whole rack of them.  They've already had the six months of not working, and that's out of the way.  We're hearing, by the way, that people are already having trouble with their PlayStation  Blue screen of death after 30 minutes of play, that's already happening.  You don't want to be the first to buy one of these.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Version 1 software is version 1 software, no matter who cranks it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think the consoles seem actually worse, at least in the last few years.  Their record has been worse in terms of-

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, definitely, as they've got more and more like PCs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it's because Microsoft, I credit Microsoft with this.  Microsoft came into the game with the normal upgrade cycles in mind, which is every 18  months or so.  to crank it up a little bit, whereas Sony and even Nintendo, to a lesser degree, were  used to these long upgrade cycles for their consoles.  I think they were pushed a little bit.  In the case of Sony, I don't think this thing just probably should have been two years from  now, but they-  It's already a year late.  What are you going to do?  Well, that just proves that they can't handle this type of turnaround.  Same thing with the Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  is beta, because whatever, because- I'm sorry, it's hard to say that with straight face.  It's kind of beta color.  It's a beta.  It's beta brown, because all the functionality, they keep saying, oh, well, the Wi-Fi will  do more later.  Oh, the copy protection will work differently later.  It sounds like they're planning on massive firmware upgrades for this thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it seems like it's the same strategy that Sony has taken with, for example, the  which has had a firmware update practically every month for the last two years it's been

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  out for whatever.  Well, that's to fight pirates, because every time somebody figures out a hack, which is  incomprehensible since the only reason anybody still buys a PSP is to hack it.  What is Sony doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're really providing a development platform and they don't know.  They're in the wrong business once again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They really are.  It's crazy.  Seriously, that's the reason people buy PSPs now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, just to hack and load Linux on and have fun with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had somebody on the show this week, on the TV show this week, who showed us, it's  from PSPhacks.com, I think.  They showed us how you can trick the PSP into thinking it has firmware one point, no, I  guess you put the newest firmware, 2.7 on, but it only looks that way.  It really has 1.5, so you could still hack it.  But the games that are looking for 2.7, because that's how they're getting people to do this,  games won't work on the hackable ROMs.  You have to upgrade the firmware just to play the latest games.  So it's a hack that makes it look like it's got the newest ROMs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well this is the whole thing with virtualization.  Did any of you happen to catch Joanna Rutkowski's hack of the new operating systems?  Blue Pill.  Yeah, Blue Pill.  Did you guys discuss that already?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We talked, not on this show, we talked a little bit about it on Security Now.  It's a little terrifying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's, well, what she said is basically virtualization is three years too early, that somebody should  have sat around and developed some security for it before the operating system companies  and Intel and AMD introduced it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's basically a root kit on steroids, a completely indetectable hack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, switching the entire operating system into a virtual machine in a millisecond and  then you have total control over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that nice?  I love it.  And then there are the experts, it's funny because the experts are saying, well no, no,  you could always tell if you're in hypervisor mode because certain instructions take longer.  So then John says, well, true, but you could change the operating system's reporting on  how long things are taking.  Exactly.  And then they go, well, you've got the world clock.  Well, you can always ignore atomic clock and modify that.  If you have ultimate control of the operating system, you can make it say anything you want.  Absolutely.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  That's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But the other cool thing that's, you know, you mentioned before the, having the ATI chip  in there and one of the things I think is in the Xbox and this whole GPGPU movement.  This is really interesting.  What's that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, give it a shot.  Well, it's the idea of using a graphics card to do a task which are not graphics rendering.  Well, they're good processors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, these are very high end DSP processors.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So if you've got, you know, a graphics card that's got 44 pipelines, which you would normally  use for rendering graphics.  But if you think about it, they're just like say 44 or 48 parallel processors.  So if you've got a data set that fits that kind of processing, then you can just absolutely  churn through it at rates that CPUs could only dream of.  How are people using this?  And so, well, for example, do you know the sort of folding at home project?  Yeah.  Which is the idea of getting...  Protein folding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  It's to solve medical problems with massive distributed computing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So the guys at Stanford just released a client for that that works on ATI GPUs.  That's great.  Oh, that's brilliant.  And you can literally get 15x performance over a dual core core two.  It's really mind boggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We basically have supercomputers on our desks here.  I mean, just over the top power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can have a teraflop if you want it.  You can put enough ATI cards in it in a server.  So what AMD is doing now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But these aren't as good as a general purpose processor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, what AMD is doing now it owns ATI is it's selling these as a supplement to processors  for industries that need them.  So if you get a server, you can buy a server now racked with ATI graphics cards that are  branded AMD stream processors.  And so you've got your CPUs for general sort of processing and then for your specific tasks  that need this kind of massively parallel data set stuff, you can buy these stream GPUs  to go in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was that what AMD was thinking when it bought?  And now that makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know, I disagree a little bit about some of this.  I mean, they were...  AMD really did buy ATI for the purposes of making a system that incorporated graphics  because Intel did.  I mean, and they're using it.  I just saw the latest versions of their kind of combo.  In fact, I wrote about this in writing or the next insight track talks about this a  little bit.  But because when they were showing, they were doing a dog and pony show recently and they're  in the city with their quad, you know, two dual core systems that they're pushing now  that are coming out like soon.  They were loaded up with Nvidia cards.  So I mean, they weren't using the even they weren't even used.  They still think the ATI 800 is the super card for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's really I mean, that's really funny because this whole the four by four the quad  platform was originally put in place with Nvidia stuff.  I think before the ATI deal went there and all the electronics for that to go in, I  think we're all set up before any of this was destined to go through.  And so now what's really funny on a personal level is that you've got loads of ATI employees  now or ex ATI employees standing up promoting this four by four and saying that Nvidia is  the best thing since sliced bread.  And I think it's making for some interesting personal dynamics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I tried to get Kevin Creewell on the show from Nvidia because I wanted him  to talk a little bit about this and he hasn't responded back.  We will get him on down the road.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, there's some politicking going on of some sort.  And but there is if you go to the Dvorak and censored Dvorak dot org slash blog and type  in GPU into the search, you'll see some we've already covered some of the stories.  Well, I think back to the originals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You could either, you know, solve the world's AIDS crisis or you could run Vista Arrow.  So you kind of have a choice.  What do you say? Yeah, one of the two.  And you know, that's a real advantage of these GPUs.  They're really multipurpose devices.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I like it because I mean, WordStar boots so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, it doesn't run with Vista.  Zune, the Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, no, that, you know, we I think that that's going to be fixed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's another firmware. OK, yeah.  Firmware 2.0. That's not a problem.  Yeah, we'll be we'll be updating that.  It's funny though. A little later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's just but talking about snafus of the week.  What about the sort of two high will high profile personnel departures  on the interweb this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now there are a number.  Are you going to talk about Valley Wag?  Is that one of them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, number one is value.  And number two is Netscape, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All right. Maybe we should start with the one that people actually care about.  I thought I'd leave that to you guys.  Crickets, crickets.  I'm not going to I'm not going to say, you know, the one I, you know,  the one everybody cares about.  All right, let's talk about Netscape. I'll choose Netscape.  Who left Netscape? You mean Jason Calacanis and Ted Leone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leon, Leon says, too. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I didn't know. I didn't even know this.  Well, I know that Leon says quit.  Well, he was pushed and know he was pushed and pushed under the bus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And they brought in an NBC executive to replace.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. Yeah, I remember that part of it.  I don't know about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Was replacing Jason's mentor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is guys that don't know what they bring these guys in these  guys outside the industry.  I mean, they should have given the whole business.  I think Leon says would have done a great job just managing the whole thing.  I don't know why he didn't push him up.  He's, you know, pretty smart guy's been in the business for a long time.  He knows what he's talking about.  The Nick Denton thing with over at Valleywag pushing out  Nick Douglas, which is very confusing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Is now playing for Nick Douglas.  Nick Denton.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Douglas is a nice guy.  And I thought he was doing a good job.  He's also we're going to have a nickel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Join us on a night tonight to talk about what I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thing.  Really job that I wouldn't do in a million years.  And he was doing, I thought, a pretty hang up job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  On the other hand, I'm looking at the new Valleywag.  It's certainly content rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Don't you? Well, they're going off the tech crunch, though, aren't they?  They said they're going to go less off the gossip and more off the deals.  I think the problem I like the tech crunch makes the problem with.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's a lot of I think gossip is risky.  I think they were worried about getting sued.  I think there's some lawsuit action that takes place when you start  doing that sort of thing. And I think that's what happened.  I think that's why they had to, you know, throw them under the bus.  Interesting.  I mean, I'm just guessing.  I have no idea when we get him on the show.  He actually probably won't because of non disclosures and stuff.  It may be a year or two before we found out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He says he won't talk about it.  But Amber's cohost of the show and I think she can get him to say anything.  So never bat her eyes.  Well, it is audio, but I'm sure she can.  I'm sure she can.  I have to say I've been reading the new Valleywag and it's just very different.  I like it. It's like 800 posts a day.  It's it's just a different thing.  There is a kind of confluence between the Calacanis leaving  and the Douglas and they kind of go together somehow  because the Calacanis leaving is full of gossip.  I mean, it's just one of those Jason is Jason is a master  getting press for for absolutely nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there's not that much gossip, is there?  I mean, it's mostly Leonsis leaves.  He was Jason's mentor.  Was it Leonsis?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason was this other guy.  What's his name?  John Miller.  So Miller was the CEO at AOL, OK,  and brought in Calacanis.  Miller gets replaced by this NBC executive.  And, you know, within a few days, Calacanis is gone.  No one knows how or why.  In fact, I don't even know if it's confirmed that he's gone.  He hasn't said it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, yes. No, John Miller. Sorry. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, not Leonsis.  But but but I don't think that Calacanis is it is it.  Well, wait a minute. Yes, here it is.  He says, yes, it's true. I'm leaving AOL. OK, so it's true.  I don't care.  Jason was the most hated guest.  If you go back to the Wikipedia,  there's a there's a little gold star next to his name,  the most hated guest we've ever had.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. I wasn't on that show, was I?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was the one we did live from the Apple Store.  Yes, you were.  It was at the Vlogger Con.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you think it was Cali.  I don't remember being on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Cali can I know Calacanis.  It was it because we couldn't hear each other.  You couldn't hear anybody.  You had no idea what anybody was saying.  Yeah, we had Drew from Andrew Baron from a rocket boom on the on the left.  Calacanis on the right.  They were screaming at each other. Right. Right. Right.  All we needed was Wozniak showing off his lasers.  It would have been the worst tweet of all time. But yeah, I remember vaguely

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because you couldn't hear anything. You couldn't hear anything.  It was just a lot of noise.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Scoble was there too.  Scoble was there.  And Dave Weiner, the guy who really made podcasting happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I run into Weiner yesterday.  Oh, really? He's just shops in the same grocery store I shop at.  I didn't even know he lived around here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's back in town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, he lives in Berkeley.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he came back.  You remember he went to Harvard for a while and he came back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Did you talk to him? Did you say hi?  Yeah, I said hi, you know, and he chatted for a while.  He says, I did he try to try to come on the show.  He'll come. He'll come.  I'd love to.  Now he says, you know, he can do the show.  He wants to do some of these shows.  So he wants to cranky geeks is what he wants to do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He doesn't want to. He did want to do cranky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says, you can get back at me, he says.  I said, I don't care.  You know what? He thinks he got a scoop.  I guess he did. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He thought he he was a burn.  I burned Dvorak.  It's like nobody cared.  I was. Yeah, I defy.  I defy anybody to tell me what it was.  What was the scoop?  We'll give you a prize.  The day I'll send you a tweet mug.  Well, now I'm in trouble because I want a tweet mug.  I want a tweet mug.  All right. All right.  I'll have to make some tweet mugs first.  I don't want a tweet mug.  Oh, you sure?  So anyway, I got this great titanium thing.  I get that titanium.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. OK, I'll go for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I was anyway at the grocery store, you know, he leaves, you know, after,  you know, he checks out, he was right in front of me and I check her there.  And I said, well, you know who that guy was?  I guess a famous guy.  She says, yeah.  And I said, yeah, he invented blogging.  And she says, yeah, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Burn. You burned him right back.  That's funny.  And a whole lot more people heard that burn than read the burn.  I could tell you that right now.  That's what she said.  Yeah, whatever.  Well, that was a good. That's how the real that, by the way,  I just want everybody to know.  That's how the real world feels about podcasting, blogging, Web 2.0, Web 3.0.  The whole world's going, yeah, whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, very depressing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's true. You're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it is true.  The the other father of podcasting, Adam Curry, yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, my God, this is amazing.  Where did you meet him?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Podcast Con UK.  Oh, really? They had a podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like a UK version of the portable media.  Right. And with emphasis on the word con.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was the in joke. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So tell me about it. What happened to podcast?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, he turns up because apparently he's moved to England.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I didn't. Yeah, that's right.  He was in Belgium or somewhere.  And now he's back in the street.  No, he's in Amsterdam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He turns up because is it Pod Show?  Yes. It's his company.  His company has now got a sort of UK version, which is BT Pod Show,  British Telecom Pod Show, who sort of bought the concept.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He is a he is a mad dealmaker.  That man, I can't believe he turns up.  He's got you know how much you know much, how much venture funding  he got for Pod Show in half a million.  Oh, it's over 15. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Fifteen million.  Wikipedia says eight and a half million.  Oh, it's behind the times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's behind the times.  But both numbers are ridiculous.  Both numbers are ridiculous.  Where is the show me the money?  So what is it? So tell me he shows up in what you said.  Is he wearing an outfit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  An outrageous pink jumper with pink sunglasses.  No, it's raining outside and we're in the middle of grey London.  Right. You know, you could take you've got the pink sunglasses.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Take the boy out of MTV, but you can't take the MTV out of the boy.  That's all I can say. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And he was really interesting.  Even though he's like what he's like 63 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's still got the long blonde hair and the pink jumper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And he sat in the corner and basically just chatting to people  who are coming up and looks like Grandpa Munster.  And he was really old.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And he was just over a few questions about what ever happened to graceful

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  aging gracefully, that's all I ask.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And throwing throwing some quips out.  What was it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So he was kind of like the bad boy in the corner.  Is that what he was doing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. And people were just like saying hello and he was throwing it.  I think when the did you have to kiss his ring when he comes

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  when you come up to him or.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has got quite a big ring, isn't he?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He does. I've kissed it.  Well, kissing is you kissed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not exactly kissing, but anyway, jokes are somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. He was just throwing quotes out like, you know, how  Dig was never going to be worth anything.  And it was just like a passing.  You know, you know what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You want to know the sad thing on that dig story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wait, when did he get brain damage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, because he has eight and a half million, he knows.  Well, yeah, digs never going to be worth anything.  Kiss my ring. I've got a pink jumper.  You so you don't like Adam, I take it.  No, I'm just teasing him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't. He said he he said, right, this is the best quote from him all day.  I said, it's nice to meet you, Adam.  I actually do a podcast.  I'm on the by a friend of mine, Leo Laporte.  I do this week in tech.  He said, oh, yes, I know this week in tech.  Oh, yeah.  He knows.  I don't know.  He said, generally, I all I do is I check the website to see if Dvorak's on.  If Dvorak's on, I'll download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, interesting. Well, he's got good taste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a smart guy. I've always liked the man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So obviously, Adam Curry is your biggest fan, John.  Yeah, I really don't think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, Adam's a great guy and really would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There would be no podcast.  You know, he used to be seen that in the early days and they got rid of him  for some unknown reason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was he was quite the visionary.  I mean, when he was at MTV, he left and started an ISP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, you know, he's a sharp operator.  I'm surprised.  You know, I think I remember I was in Europe  in the late 90s before the dot com bus and I was reading one of these.  I think it was a Dutch paper talking about him, how he's worth one hundred  million dollars and he was very good at promoting himself.  And I couldn't figure out what I think.  And wow, you know, because he owned all this stuff.  And then I don't know what happened.  And then next thing you know, he's he's doing a bunch of other stuff.  And so I think he's he's become a mysterious person  in so far as what is what he's worth, what money he's actually well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I got I'll tell you what, I've got twenty dollars right here for you, Adam.  U.S. cash on the table.  If you want to be on Twitter, just come on by.  Twenty dollars waiting for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He probably uses Skype, I bet.  I bet he's heard of Skype.  Yeah, it'd be fun to talk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So was podcast content fun?  Contcast UK con con podcast fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah.  Was it interesting?  No, it was like maybe 150 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My my sense is that while we have global listeners to podcasting,  there's not that a lot of, you know, not a lot of podcasts produced outside the U.S.  I mean, I've talked to Danish podcasters and I asked them, well, how many are there?  They said, oh, you know, a dozen of friends.  There's a dozen.  They're not a lot of maybe UK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, there were quite a lot.  Yeah. Basically everybody there was a podcaster.  So there's about 150 people, you said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, that's it. Yeah, that's the total.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's terrible. Well, you know, there were 2500 people at Podcast Expo in the U.S.  and I think every one of them were podcasters.  I would not hesitate to doubt that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But what was it was it was it was pretty funny that,  you know, there was this there was this, you know, somebody made a flippant remark  like we need to get podcasting to the to the to the, you know, to the mainstream,  to the mass audiences.  How do we do that? And they said, you know, the trouble is that we all know what  podcasting is, but nobody else does.  And I thought, really, does everybody know, you know, in this room, know what  podcasting is, given that some people think that podcasting is just like a  flat distribution medium for audio.  Some people want to attach like a bunch of social norms to it, like podcasting is  about independent media and sticking it to the man.  Yeah.  You know, podcasting is not about advertising or podcasting is exactly about  advertising. It's a commercial, you know, tool.  And it reminds me, by the way, this podcast is brought to you by Dell

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  computers, if you would like to check out.  Smooth.  And that's a segue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That wasn't smooth at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's so unsmooth.  It was so cool. I just can't get over it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Change my underwear.  You did such a great job about it.  But once you give Dell their due, I think you are overdue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I need to say something about that, because without their financial support,  why we wouldn't be able to buy John's underwear.  So if you would like to check out the latest Leo's picks, they're there at  Twit.tv slash Dell.  Campaign's been going very well, by the way, and we thank the folks at Dell  for their support and thank you.  More importantly, the Twitter listeners for using that link when you go to Dell  to buy a computer and a lot of people getting those Vista ready computers.  You get your Vista Express upgrade from Dell and you got a very inexpensive  upgrade to Vista when the operating system comes up in January.  January 30th, I think, is the day.  But your Dell is waiting for you today.  Twit dot TV slash Dell.  We were talking about amazing.  What you like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, now let's let's let's trash Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, my attitude is if you have to run Windows,  you got to you should run it on a daily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Most people that are running Vista, they're liking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's pretty. That's why it's pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Actually, the Vista has a lot of cool stuff in it.  But I think that a lot of people don't understand the difference  between Vista capable and Vista premium ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you won't get aero glass if you only get Vista capable.  If you want the visuals, you have to get premium ready, right?  What's the difference?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the difference.  Well, no, is there a difference in the hardware?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, you can make Vista run on an older, slower machine,  but it's not going to do all of its stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's all cosmetic, though.  I mean, it's not like it's not like it's cosmetics are important.  What specifically?  I'll give the specifics.  Five, 12 megs RAM for for Vista ready or Vista capable, I should say.  A gig for Vista.  What is it? Premium ready?  No problem there.  We all got that.  You've got to have both of them have to be direct X nine video cards,  but you need to have one that does hardware pixel shading to point out.  And frankly, you need enough video RAM.  If you want to run a megapixel screen, it's 64 megabytes of video RAM.  If you want a two megapixel screen,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  these high end Nvidia cards do all that stuff.  Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All cards do it. That's not the issue.  Its motherboard video may not, you know, only only the GM 950.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know. You know, that new AMD motherboard video is pretty hot.  Yeah, yeah. No, no, absolutely. That was seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's really nice. Got Nvidia on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or I know that's a T.I.  A T.I. A T.I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So so what do you think?  Is it worth upgrading your video card for?  Stop. Stop. Is that it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's no, that's not it.  The real difference is on laptops and the real difference is is on these hybrid  disk drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, fine. But what does that got to do with cosmetics?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've talked about hybrid before.  I want to know what this is. What is a hybrid disk drive?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I can tell you what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We all know what it is.  Well, I don't know.  OK, Bill, you tell me what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, it's flash memory built into your your hard disk.  Oh, I knew that.  It stores all of your most popular sectors.  It's a cache. It's a fast cache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we talked about this last week. I remember now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but it's a permanent cache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're not Vista Premium ready if you don't have a hybrid hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You can't even run Vista Premium on on a I'm not sure you can run Vista at all  on an older laptop that doesn't have a hybrid drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Vista itself won't run.  I'm not sure that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry. You can you can run it.  It's just aero glass. You lose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, no, I don't think it has anything to do with that.  I just think it runs crummy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It runs it runs really poorly.  It's it's designed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You how about if I have a big, you know, an eight meg  RAM cache, is that enough?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, actually, you know, a huge, huge cache.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Vista is talking specifically through a series of now  is the ice to that disk drives flash memory now.  Is that only on laptops, not desktops?  What desktop?  You want to use it on a desktop, too.  That's my understanding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, there are some new I think Samsung has a got one.  Yeah, an ATA flash drive that you just plug it into the ATA socket.  Oh, it adds up.  And it acts like, oh, I just have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I understand that, Bill, there's a at least somebody was telling me  this the other day, and I was thinking, well, that's pretty cool if it works.  So a lot of the newer thumb drives, if you stick them in,  your USB port, it all of a sudden says, well, we'll just use this.  No, yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does it have to be a U3 or is what it would?  No, no, it's not U3. It's just a something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just a fact. It's got to be fast.  And the trick is they're not that fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not as fast as a hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are they? They're pretty fast.  Yeah. And the thing is that hard drives are a lot slower than we think they are  when they're when they're doing random reads.  And basically, they're all random.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're saying a USB 2.0  flash thumb drive is faster than my hard drive for sequential reads?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Wow. Because what what Vista will do is line up all of your most popular  sectors, the things that you, you know, load when you start up your machine  or when you come out of sleep mode and it will just stream them serially  onto interest into memory and execute them.  And that is wicked fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So the real issue is that the architecture of Vista requires this kind of support.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it's it's really doesn't require it.  It wants it. It wants it in order to run.  Wants it bad. Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right. It wants it bad. It's like a it's like a nymphomaniac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if an infomaniac really liked hybrid hard drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, maybe John remembers the last time we said in PC magazine,  don't upgrade, buy new to support the operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is the case, it sounds like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And and I think we're at that juncture again.  And it's been a long, long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And don't buy Vista capable, buy Vista premium ready.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's my story. Right.  The difference in price is probably not enough to make it worth the pain and suffering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Don't people don't doesn't doesn't the industry understand how confusing this is?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's totally confusing. It's it's pathetically confusing.  A customer goes in. Is there anything we missed?  Will's been following this pretty closely.  I want to know if we've missed anything in this discussion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, go ahead. I don't think so.  I think the hybrid hard drive stuff is really interesting.  The fact that you can just grab a USB stick and shove it in the side  and get a performance boost. That's amazing.  It's quite crazy. I don't get that at all.  But there are. But even while there's two, there's two different technologies.  One is Vista ready drive and one is Vista ready boost.  And you can make your USB key do two different things, depending on the configuration.  You're going to rebel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Consumers are going to walk away from the store.  They're going to say, wait a minute, this is Vista capable, Vista premium ready,  Vista super premium booster capable. What the hell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, they're not going to do that, Leo.  What they're going to do is there's going to be some guy on the floor  who's been paid off. Who will lie.  Buy this or buy that or buy this or buy that.  And they're just going to do that.  And they'll be pleased as punch when they finally get the machine home.  And maybe they may or may not have the best thing going.  And that's you know, that's why you need to read PC magazine.  I mean, that's why you need to keep up.  That's why I need to listen to these podcasts.  So you can you know, if you're going to be competing to the  with the guy next to you in the cubicle, you better learn something.  But if you don't want to let simplify it, what do I need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do I need? Tell me what I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bill, if you have a laptop machine,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  if you need it, first of all, buy new, buy new is the first advice.  Don't upgrade to Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you buy a Vista ready laptop,  it's going to have a hybrid hard disk in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Vista premium ready. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Not Vista capable.  Actually, I do not believe that there is such a thing as a Vista capable  laptop. I believe that Microsoft is requiring  the hybrid hard disk in all Vista certified laptop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think so, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so Vista premium ready  laptop would be able to do all this and would have the right video card, too.  Right. So I could do a glass.  It would be and it would it would perform at a decent clip.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They will not sell any low capability laptops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's not going to cost that much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think the prices won't change all that much.  I think you're looking at maybe a delta of 100 bucks.  Because the flash is pretty astounding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  About 100 bucks. Yeah.  All right. And they will perform very well.  They won't just be, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  these are going to be really surprising machines come out of sleep mode in a second.  Oh, I like that. You mean just like a Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but they don't blow up. That's the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, come on. Put a Sony battery in.  Any computer will blow up.  You got me. Nice to have that option.  So I might as well take my spanking now on 64 bit versus 32 bit.  We talked on the security now last week about 64 bit  Vista being the only really secure Vista.  But of course, because of the driver issues, you got all new drivers.  A lot of hardware is not going to work.  And I was mistaken in what processors I thought I needed to buy a Xeon.  But I don't. Right.  Well, I know a core two is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely. All the latest core two stuff comes with 64 bit capability.  At this point, we're not going to every DCPU that you can buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. We're not going to say go out and get Vista 64, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, unless you want security, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But for security, it's great, but it won't run anything.  If I were running, if I were buying a Vista, being on a Mac, can you buy?  Well, is there a Vista premium ready 64 capable

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  sticker? You've managed to confuse us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because that's what I want.  There's not necessarily a sticker, but if you go out, if you go and buy,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  let me get this right, because I want one that has all the right hardware  so the drivers work and everything. Right.  I'm almost completely sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No sticker, but there's a stickler. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can you can get the latest high end laptop from Dell.  And I am 90% sure that'll be Vista premium.  Capable, ready, awesome, 64 bit, 64 bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I want 64 bit.  Yeah, OK. That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The new core two duo or the the AMD based will run Vista 64.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, so I'm going to put that in one of my Leo's picks because  I know I want to cut through.  I want to be the guy on the on the showroom floor.  In effect, the virtual the Web 2.0 showroom floor where you go to  and I say just buy this and forget it.  And we'll put that in the Leo's picks page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's Web 3, Leo, but that's usability.  That was the New York Times thing.  That's right. John Markoff making the technology disappear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Your buddy, John C.  Devorek, your buddy, John Markoff, announced what Web 3.0 was.  I can't believe that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So can you summarize it here, John?  No, I can't because there's no such thing as Web 3.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He was talking. He says Web 2.0 is social interaction, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is Web 3.0? That's not what it is. That's bull.  It's like one of many things.  If you look at the site and look.  Well, yeah, Ajax is part of it.  And that's what's that got to do with social interaction.  If you go to O'Reilly site, you can see what it is.  It's basically Web point one that's been upgraded.  And it's an item by item thing.  It's like this has been upgraded to that.  And this, you know, all these different things that used to be in Web 1.0  during the dot com thing have been they've changed the terminology  and they've changed what it does.  So what does Markoff say three is?  I don't know what the point of that article was, to be honest.  I read it was on the front page of the New York Times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was trying to figure it out. That was the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That was the point.  The point was that John now gets bragging rights to say I coined Web 3.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you know what? I'm announcing it right here now.  Web 4.0.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, actually, it's funny, we were talking with Mike Errington,  who is really the kind of the guy at TechCrunch is his blog on Web 2.0.  And he said I don't know registered Web 3.0.  So I think you've got to start at four and it might be even more.  I mean, I'm at four. OK.  John's got four. Anybody want five?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Anybody? I think five is a nano  in nano implantation into your brain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hope that five by then we're all, you know, at the Webgoat,  you know, there's something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think five will be Vista ready.  I think there's no doubt about that.  We're open. We're convinced of that.  Bug free. Bug free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you have a web page on the Twitter.  TV website that describes this process for people?  No, but I could.

Transcript:  You know, I bet if I just type McCrone into my Firefox ad, you know, you  address bar, I'd probably go to you.  Yeah, it's amazing how that was pretty smart about that.  Well, I pulled up Google, but it did.  It did pull up the right thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Just put him on Skype.  He'll be happy camper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, Adam was actually the thing about Dig, which is really sad,  is that, you know, Murdoch offered well over 100 million dollars for Dig.  And it wasn't Kevin.  It wasn't Owen.  I don't think he was even Jay.  None of the none of the principles there.  They all wanted to take it.  Believe me, they wanted to take it.  And that's what happens when you take investors.  The investors said, no, we're worth 150 or nothing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I can't believe for a man that the two founders  couldn't push that one through.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Boy, you'd think so.  But I've heard from I haven't talked to Kevin about it,  but I've heard from very good sources that Kevin wanted to take it.  He wanted to take.  Well, he's worth.  I think he he really would if he if they if they've gotten us  100 million, he would have been worth that 60 million.  The business week said he was worth.  It's kind of sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, probably wouldn't have been that way.  The investors would take a big piece.  He probably had been worth some good money.  I'll tell you this much. He'd be buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He'd be buying.  And we keep telling Kevin that we'll get him back on the show.  Patrick couldn't be here because he was at the Baja 500  and he's still coated with dust.  But once we hose him down, he'll be back on to it probably next week.  I'm Leo Laporte. Well, thank you so much for joining us.  We'll see you next week. Another twit is in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But we all learned so much.  John, let's let's get back to the MCA.  Why do you keep turning us off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the story we didn't cover was Yahoo's going to have a big shakeup.  What's going on there?  Is that a big story that you were going to break?  No, I broke the story about the UAE banning Dvorak.  Or that was the big story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know something about a shakeup of Yahoo with the UAE  banning your blog was the big story.  I think so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The shakeup of Yahoo's everywhere.  What's the shakeup of Yahoo? What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're going to put Rosenzweig in the CFO as the co-president.  Really? Dan's one of ours.  Dan's a good guy.  And then they're going to probably fire up and present the company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wow. And buy loads of crappy social media.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they just did that, though.  Didn't they just go on a shopping spree?  I don't understand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe I need to go and get down to Yahoo and England.  Come to buy it. It's my bit tech.  That would work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think a small, struggling technology podcast  that would make a wonderful purchase.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perhaps talking of struggling.  Don't use the word struggling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are we getting paid or what?  We're always getting the struggling part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, yeah, not struggling.  About to break out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
