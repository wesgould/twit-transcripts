Transcript:  It's all about cars.  And Sam's here because tomorrow in the wine country, Nissan is going to demonstrate their  new LEAF electric vehicle, the 2018 LEAF, which comes up for sale next month.  And actually it was really great.  Sam got Nissan to bring one down.  We did a segment for Saturday's new screensavers, took a ride in it and everything.  I'm excited.  And we've talked Brianna before about electric vehicles.  Brianna is aggressively, she's an ICE person.  Internal combustion engine all the way.  Just bought a Porsche Cayman.  I did.

Start time: 302.89
End time: 315.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did.  When they put out a good electric vehicle, I will be the first to buy one.  They have a lot of great dynamics.  They accelerate quicker.  It's just, you know, the Tesla, it's a four-door car.  And I'm just not that into coupe vehicles.

Start time: 317.68

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I would be honored to be called that.  Don't expect me to do her voiceovers.

Start time: 328.08
End time: 363.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, she's good.  If I could hire Simone to do my ads, I would just sit back and listen.  Sit back and listen.  Should we start big or should we start small?  I just, I can't decide.  Cyber Monday was last Monday, the biggest Cyber Monday ever.  The biggest shopping day ever, even besting Amazon Prime, at least for online.  Amazon said the Prime Day back in July, which had set the previous record, was surpassed  by Cyber Monday.  I don't see any numbers on this.

Start time: 363.68
End time: 378.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, which was interesting.  Yeah, Amazon didn't really see any numbers.  This is completely anecdotal.  I can only speak for myself.  But I weirdly, I didn't buy much either Black Friday or Cyber Monday.  I did get a bed and a new mattress on Cyber Monday.  I hope it was a Casper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 385.12
End time: 388.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Even Simone can't overcome that.  Just, you know, I understand.

Start time: 389.04
End time: 402.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I'm not commenting.  I just didn't get a new bed and a new mattress, but I didn't really buy anything else.  And I didn't see some of the spectacular deals, but maybe I just  wasn't looking.  Maybe I already have everything.  What about you?  Did you guys buy anything?

Start time: 403.10
End time: 424.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I think one of the reasons Amazon did so well is because they so drastically discounted  the Echo devices.  That was the number one seller.  It always is.  That's one of the things that's really shaping up this holiday season is a battle between  Amazon and the Echo and Google and its home.  And unfortunately, Apple is not in the battle.  It wanted to be, but the HomePod is delayed till next year.

Start time: 425.74
End time: 441.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And, you know, I actually have an Echo Dot that I was gifted about a year ago.  And when I got it, I took it out of the box, plugged it in, played with it for about 10  minutes and then stuck in the drawer.  And it's never been plugged in since because I found that I actually have no use for these  devices.

Start time: 441.62
End time: 448.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You just didn't give it more time.  And I think what happens is you've come up with uses over a period of time.

Start time: 448.72
End time: 473.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, I actually don't mind getting up to hit a light switch.  You're nuts.  You're insane.  You're crazy.  What can I say?  I do use voice controls on my phone.  I've got a Pixel XL.  And ever since I had my first Moto X several years ago, I've used Hello Moto or OK Google.  So you're used to talking to your phone.  I talk to my phone all the time to set reminders for myself, set timers and things like that.

Start time: 474.02
End time: 496.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I miss the Moto X had one feature that I don't know why these other guys don't do it.  You could set the trigger word to anything you want.  Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi, because that way it wouldn't be triggered by anything.  I could easily remember it.  And plus, it gave me a kind of thrill every time I said it.  Why can't we do that with these with these better, more modern devices?  Why do we have to choose from their limited supply of trigger words?

Start time: 496.30
End time: 498.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It should be capable of doing that.  I'd like to have something besides.

Start time: 500.01
End time: 511.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I know I hate it.  And it's a problem for us because we can't talk about.  Right.  You can't use the Madame A word.  We can't use the S word.  We can't use any of the words.

Start time: 511.88
End time: 530.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And for all of the people watching, if I just triggered your devices, I'm sorry.  You're not ashamed.  I've got to make sure I know how many times I've been annoyed over the years  when I've been in my car and Ron Richards would say, it's a problem.  You did it again.  I'm sorry.  It's a bad habit.  It's just having everybody's devices go off.

Start time: 533.19
End time: 563.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I did.  You all see like as you were driving around, did you see many people out actually  buying things this year?  Because Lisa was talking about this in the mall nearest to my current house.  It was, I mean, it was there were people out there shopping,  but it wasn't as packed as it usually is.  And I'm wondering if we're getting to a tipping point where more people are saying,  you know what?  I don't need to go to the mall.  I don't need to go into meat space.  Like, let's actually just get all this stuff on Amazon because the deals are so  consistently good every year.

Start time: 563.44
End time: 589.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'll go a step farther.  I think not only are people buying more online to the point where we are probably  very close to 50-50 if it's not tipped.  What's really interesting to me, and you saw this in Singles Day in China,  and you see it to some degree here on Black Friday and Cyber Monday,  not just online, but on mobile.  People are shopping on their phones, which is a kind of a, would you, would you,  Christina, would you do that?  Would you shop on your phone?  Oh, yeah.  Would you buy a mattress on your phone?

Start time: 590.53

Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Start time: 591.50
End time: 593.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See?  I bought stuff online.

Start time: 593.22
End time: 663.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I did through Amazon, but I did.  I mean, and other things.  I mean, at this point, you go to what device are you on most frequently?  For me, I'm most frequently on my phone, so it makes more sense to do that.  I will say, I do think I agree with you, Leo.  I think that if we're not already at the tipping point, we're probably really close.  But I was surprised, maybe it's just Seattle, but on Black Friday,  we were driving to meet a friend downtown, and so we had to go through where the  flagship Nordstrom is, and there are a bunch of other stores.  The traffic and the call of people was insane.  It took us a really long time to get to the restaurant that we were going to.  On Thursday and Thanksgiving, we happened to go by, and again, it was a Best Buy,  so I mean, it's a different thing, but there were people at five o'clock at night  lined up around the block.  I don't know what time the store was opening, probably eight or nine, but people were,  I mean, it was going around and around.  It was a big shopping district.  So I do think that maybe it's just these big events that bring people out,  because I do think that by and large, most people are, I'm like, I won't even go,  and I'm not going to wait in line to save an extra $20.  I'd rather go to a store to wait in line, you know, in a store to save $20.  I'll just buy it online.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Pardon me?  Let me wax philosophical.  Sure.  So until very recently, if you had a man-made artifact,  it was a special thing.  People might have one book or probably no books.  Books were for rich people.  Everybody slept in the same bed because beds were so expensive.  You might have one pot.  You might have a candlestick.  It's only recently, we now have any one of us.  It's a 20th century phenomenon.  It is.  Any one of us has more artifacts, man-made things, person-made things.  In our lives than a whole country might have had 200 years ago.

Start time: 714.80
End time: 733.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a post-industrial revolution phenomenon.  The ability to mass manufacture goods in high quantities with relatively high levels of quality  at very low cost has enabled everybody to have or enabled most people to have  almost anything they want.

Start time: 734.10
End time: 744.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does that improve the standard of living or not?  Is that a better thing than I have my little rag doll with the paint on the face?  That's a special object.

Start time: 744.16
End time: 795.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's changed it.  I don't know.  It's certainly improved things in a lot of ways.  For the most part, you have far fewer people  starving than you would have in the early 19th century.  That's true.  Life expectancy has doubled.  There are a lot of downsides to it as well as we are increasingly seeing, especially now  with the influence of social media on our own well-being, our mental well-being.  I know my wife, for example, the stress that she feels when looking at Facebook now and seeing  the reports of what's going on in politics, it raises her blood pressure.  I know it does.  It's very stressful, this world we live in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I was just going to say, I do think that things are more commoditized.  We're talking like a Tesla that's never going to be as rare a thing as  I'm looking at buying a Porsche 930.  This is a really classic one from the 80s and 90s.  You're not going to have that in the same way.  Marco Armit on our network, he really got into old style physical watches because it was the  exact opposite of an Apple watch, something meticulously made by hand.  I know for me, part of the reason why I really enjoy painting my own car is because it's such  an opposite experience of the world we live in where everything is so commoditized,  something you really make and maintain yourself.  It's almost magical in 2017 because we don't ever get to do it.  There's also the issue of crap.

Start time: 855.66
End time: 914.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We've gotten to the point where this is such an engine that has such a motive force that  we, every company, Apple's a good example, every company needs to make more stuff.  If a company doesn't have ideas for the next thing that's new and innovative, they just  recombine.  I just got this.  It's actually not a new product.  This is a mouse.  It's called a Skype mouse.  It has built into it a speaker and a microphone and a little DAC.  So you plug it into the USB port, suddenly the sound starts coming.  It sounds tinny, but it comes out of the mouse and I can make phone calls into my mouse.  That's the example of crap.  What I mean by crap is there's nothing innovative in this.  It's like recombinant DNA.  They just took three different parts, threw them together and said,  let's see what happens with this.  I feel like a lot of what we're looking at in the marketplace is that.  It's not truly innovative.  It's just randomly recombined parts.

Start time: 916.48
End time: 948.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, earlier this year, my wife and I moved and our kids are grown and out of the house.  We took the opportunity to do a huge purge.  I was amazed at how much stuff we ended up throwing away in the course of doing that move.  After two weeks of packing stuff and getting it out of the house,  all the closets and everything still seem to be packed with stuff.  It was like our house was a giant Tetris puzzle with stuff packed into every nook and cranny.  It's a good feeling though when you get rid of it.  Yeah. It was amazing to get rid of all this stuff.

Start time: 949.66
End time: 975.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't want to project, but we recently had fires here, as you know, in Sonoma County.  A lot of people, hundreds, I think 1,500 people lost their homes.  It was pretty terrible.  Oh, yeah.  It's as bad as it's the worst.  4,500? Wow.  So it's the worst you could even imagine.  But a surprisingly large number of them seem to be pretty complacent with the whole thing.  Like, oh, thank God I got rid of all that crap.  As long as you and your pets survived.

Start time: 976.22
End time: 979.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now I don't have to go to Home Depot and get a couple of bags.  It was a kind of a purge.

Start time: 980.64
End time: 997.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, I'm not speaking for everybody.  I know that's been a devastating thing.  I was kind of noticing that a lot of people were kind of okay with that.  I got insurance.  And I wonder how many of them will replace one for one all the crap they just got rid of.

Start time: 998.96
End time: 1004.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know if it happened to me, I certainly wouldn't get to replace most of the stuff.  Yeah, I'm not advocating it.  Yeah.

Start time: 1005.36
End time: 1028.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think something with the...  When I travel so much these days, you really get used to your entire life being like a Macbook  and everything that you can fit in the bag because there are parts of last year I was  living out of a suitcase like almost a third of the year.  Like, Christina, how many shows did I do with you last year when I was on the road?  Get so many.  It changes.  Yeah, it changes your perception of what you really need.

Transcript:  No, I agree with you, Bree.  When we moved to Seattle, we were in corporate housing for the first two months.  And so we only had limited things with us and all of our stuff was in storage.  And my husband and I both kind of discussed, we were like,  we didn't really miss that many things.  And so, I mean, I got rid of a lot of clothes when we went through that.  It's going to be harder to get rid of some other things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's all I did.  You're supposed to look at everything in your life and say,  does this Skype mouse spark joy?  Yeah.  Does this spark joy?  And if it does, you keep it.  And if it doesn't, you just get rid of it.  Actually, it sparks some joy.

Start time: 1102.40
End time: 1112.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the thing.  That's where the thing breaks down is if you're someone like me who's kind of a…  Everything sparks joy.  If you're a hoarder and a collector…  That's good.

Transcript:  Can I tell you all the worst story about being a bad wife?  I was so embarrassed about this.  So my husband is a pack rat.  He just is.  He loves to collect stuff and we have moved five times since we've been married and we are  getting ready to move to a nice house in our district where we can hold dinners to  bring people over and fundraise.  He left a window open downstairs in our basement and it rained and it got all over all of his books.  We have two floors to this house and downstairs is just nothing but Frank junk.  He had to throw about 80% of it away.  I was so thrilled.  I was so secretly happy.  I wasn't going to have to move all his books from the 70s again because I've done it so many times.

Transcript:  There we are broadcasting from 1935.  You know what they didn't have in 1935 they really ought to have had?  Casper mattresses.  Absolutely.  Life would have been...  In The Godfather when they went to the mattresses,  they could have just saved themselves a lot of trouble.  Just have a bunch of Casper's sent to the hideout.  Slice the box open.  Yes.  It comes open.  It smells great.  It's comfy.  They would have never gotten off the mattresses.  They would have just said, hey, forget the gang battle.  Let's just all stay here.  Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost.  And they are awesome.  I actually have the new Casper, the Wave mattress.  It features a natural geometry support system and a new top layer.  They are expanding their line.  Yeah.  So these guys obsessively engineer their mattresses.  Make many, many prototypes.  Try all sorts of things.  What they're going for is something everybody wants.  A mattress that is...  It seems a contradiction in terms, but a mattress that you sink into, right?  So your hard bits, your hips and stuff, sink right into it.  But yet, it's firm so it supports your back.  Oh, and by the way, as long as we're doing that, let's make it breathable so it sleeps cool,  so you never get overheated.  Then you're going to have the perfect night's sleep.  Well, Casper's done it.  They've combined multiple supportive memory foams with different characteristics.  So it does, in fact, you sink into it, but it does support you.  It sleeps cool.  It smells great.  It's the first mattress I ever bought that I didn't have to air out for a week before  we slept on it.  It's just incredible.  Soft, comfortable, and you buy it directly from Casper, which means you eliminate the worst part  of the mattress equation, which is that middleman, that mattress store where they mark it up 100%.  They do it because people say, oh no, I have to go lie on it in the mattress  or to choose my mattress.  You cannot choose a mattress lying on in a mattress store.  You can't.  You need to lie on it at home and you need to sleep on it, and you need to sleep on it  for many nights.  In fact, with Casper, you could sleep on it for 100 nights.  And if at any time in the first 100 nights you say, yeah, it's not for me, they will come,  they will get it, they will turn every penny, no cost to you.  It is as easy as can be.  The mattress come in a great box, compact box, free shipping and returns to the US,  to Canada, now to the UK.  Take a look at the regular, the traditional mattress and the new Casper Wave mattress.  And on either you can save $50 by going to casper.com slash twit, use our promo code  twit at checkout casper.com slash twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you know what?  Maybe how much better is sleep on them.  You know what really is happening?  And Casper does this, but I think of like Warby Parker and Harry's and Dollar Shave Club  is that entrepreneurs are smart.  They're looking for a situation where the middleman isn't working, where the markups  are too high, the experience of the consumer isn't good enough.  And they're saying we can fix that with e-commerce.  And when it really works, it really, really works.  It's awesome.  We had a kind of interesting Tuesday, Mac Break Weekly.  We're sitting there and all of a sudden somebody's tweets.  Oh no.  You know, you can log into a Mac.  You can change settings in a Mac just by using the root account with a no password.  Renee Richie there and Andy Anaco and I, we went what?  And Patrick, our programmer Patrick Delahannity tried.  He said, that's right.  It's true.  And then Renee tried and he said, I'm going to go to the root account.  And he said, I'm going to go to the root account.  Right.  It's true.  And then Renee tried and I tried it and we were like, what the hell?  How could this happen?  This is high Sierra, the new Apple Mac OS.  First of all, on Macs traditionally the root account is not active.  So they activated it.  And then because it had no password, it was weird though, because the first time it might  not work, but the second time it worked or the third time it worked.  So you had to try a few times.  I quickly was able to go onto my Mac, give the root account a password,  just open terminal and type sudo passwd, password root, give it a new password and that fixed it.  But then Apple, well, yeah, Apple pushed out a fix on Thursday, which was more sophisticated.  Then they pushed out an update to high Sierra that broke the fix.  What the hell?

End time: 1701.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, what this goes to demonstrate is that it's no matter how good your intentions  are, how hard you try, it's virtually impossible to guarantee absolute security in a complex  electronic system.  Apple is as good as any company out there doing this stuff.  And if they can't get it right, who can?  We've seen all these things, the Mirai botnet with IoT devices, and now we're getting into  automated and connected cars.  The potential for what can go wrong there just explodes exponentially.  So we're screwed.  Pretty much.  Yeah.

Transcript:  I mean, I do think this really brings a very serious question forward.  I'm not someone like I love Apple.  I'm a huge Apple fan.  Everything I buy is Apple.  But I do think there is some truth.  I think there's a kernel of truth in these critiques about Apple not making the Mac as  big a priority as they used to.  And I think when you have a devastating bug like this that comes forward, something that  really seems like this isn't an edge case.  This isn't like a really sophisticated bug.  This is a really big oversight.  I do think it is reasonable for Mac fans to look at that and go, what's going on here?  Is the Mac really the priority it needs to be?  We're going to be covering a piece later in the show where it looks at Tim Cook and  his legacy so far.  And I do think that it's a legit criticism that a company as big as Apple that they do  seem to be struggling with getting out yearly updates for iOS and Mac OS on time.

Start time: 1793.84
End time: 1808.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess that's my question.  Is this just, you know, bugs happen and Apple fixed it quickly, unfixed it.  I presume they fixed it again.  Should we draw larger conclusions from this, Christina?  Or is it just something that happens?

Start time: 1808.60
End time: 1837.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that it's too soon to draw a larger conclusion.  I do agree with, you know, there's been a lot of conversation because it was in addition to  the root issue, which is a massive, massive security flaw.  And then kind of it's hobbled with handling things.  And then even the root update itself broke file sharing.  So you have to use terminal to re-enable that.  If you were using file shares, there were some, the iOS 11.2 update that they had to rush out  because there was a time issue.  December 2nd.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You'd get notifications from third party apps that would crash your iPhone.  And by the way, if you had that problem, it wasn't enough just to install iOS 11.2,  which came out yesterday.  You had to turn off all notifications, which by the way is not easy on iOS.  There's no master switch.  You've got to go through hundreds of apps.  Yeah.

Start time: 1864.84
End time: 1895.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And no, I mean, and I think that I think it's fair to say what's happening here,  but I think that I don't want to draw massive conclusions from one week, from one bad week.  I think we have to look at things.  I think if we come back in a year and we're able to kind of say, has this been a pattern,  or even right now, if we were to say what has been the pattern of bug fixes to releases,  then you could maybe say something, something's rotten to Denmark.  But other than that, but I feel odd making some sort of sweeping generalization after  after a bad week.  And you know what?

Transcript:  But to Brianna's point about the reduced attention to the Mac,  have we heard, has anybody looked back or, you know, do they have,  has anybody still got copies of the beta versions of High Sierra running?  You know, were they able to look back and see if this bug was in the betas that were  running all summer long?  I mean, how far back is this problem?  And if it went that long without anyone noticing, right?

Start time: 1927.45
End time: 1948.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and then from what I mean, and that that's unclear from what I've read,  and I've seen cut some anecdotal stuff, there were some forum activity in September about it.  And it does appear as if this probably did exist in the betas.  And that's, that was the part that to me was the scariest is that this sort of bug  existed for so long and wasn't tested.

Start time: 1948.86
End time: 1955.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it would be very serendipitous if somebody, some user just came along and said,  I wonder if Root would work.

Start time: 1955.88
End time: 2080.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, someone did in their own user forums for all this happened.  And then nobody did anything about it.  And then, which I, to me, this is the bigger problem than even saying it does,  does that all have, you know, is their QA not good enough?  Because I, again, I think it's too soon to make that sort of judgment.  My bigger concern with all of this is that a lot of people really came after the original  person who shared the exploit on Twitter and said, you didn't report this the right way.  And how dare you not go to the right channels, XYZ.  A, I think that, and I said this on Rocket, and I look, I work for a large software company who  we have, you know, big operating system, and I don't speak for them, but we've definitely had  our own, you know, fair share of things that go on.  I'm aware of that.  But I think that you have to acknowledge that even though responsible disclosure is good,  going after the messenger, especially when you are a nearly, you know, you're a $750 billion company,  doesn't need its fanboys to attack, you know, somebody who brought a bug out there in the  public. That's the first thing.  I think the second thing is, and I've talked to a lot of people about this,  it's not really always really clear with Apple how you can even report a bug and whether or not  they will take it seriously.  And I've talked to people who are well known in the community who often don't feel like their  radars, which is Apple's term for filing a bug report, are seen and have to make a fuss on  Twitter. And then everyone on Twitter will say, well, why didn't you just file a radar?  And people are like, well, I do, but nothing happens.  And case in point, you know, and look, I understand that most of the times the Apple user  forums are not moderated, but if these sorts of things are happening there, I'm a little more  concerned with are the right channels in place if people do find these sorts of bugs and find these  sorts of holes? Is there a right avenue for them to be able to get the communication across?  Are the right people looking at those things?  That's to me a bigger problem than maybe trying to ascertain whether or not there's a QA  issue or they don't care enough about the Mac. It's more like how easy is it for people to report  bugs and how confident are we that there are enough people behind the scenes reading those  bug reports and testing things out?

Start time: 2080.36
End time: 2125.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. So the guy who did it is a Turkish developer, Lemi Orhan Ercan. He says,  Dear Apple support, this was on Tuesday. We noticed a huge security issue at Mac OS High Sierra.  Anyone can log in his route with an empty password after clicking on a login button several times.  Are you aware of it, Apple? This was his way of reporting it. Yeah, I think, you know, if he was  a security researcher, you'd expect him to do it in the more traditional method, notifying Apple  before letting the public know. On the other hand, it's such a serious flaw. Apple support responded  very quickly with send us a private message. Let's figure out what's going on. So it blindsided Apple  a little bit. To their credit, they fixed it within two days and then unfixed it. But that's

Start time: 2125.38
End time: 2228.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  another matter. I can't speak for what it's like to work at Apple, but I can say like a game studios,  people that do community, you know, community management, community support, that is often  the least respected job at a game development studio. It's one of the hardest, it's one of the  most critical. So it's easy to imagine Apple kind of overlooking this kind of form management  and not putting the resources into it that they need to. I, for me, though, this is a bigger  question beyond this bug. And Christina, I really agree with you. I don't want to draw bigger  conclusions here because there's not enough data there. I think the question is fair. I don't think  that you can come to a conclusion yet. But what really worries me about this is the fact that you  could tell net in. And for me, I do everything right. You know, I have Wi-Fi that's a dedicated  box. I have two factor authentication on everything I can. I stick to Macs since I announced my  candidacy. I don't use Android phones anymore. You know, this bug being out there for somebody like  me and many other people. This is the difference in your career, like being destroyed or not  destroyed. Like if every email I ever wrote got out there to the public, that would be  disaster for anyone. So I really- Do you use Google's new, stronger protection on your Gmail  account? First of all, do you use Gmail? I am forced to use Gmail because it's the only mass  market email service that will have two factor authentication built in. So we do reluctantly  do that. And we use that. Do you use the new Google Advanced Protection? Which is designed

Start time: 2229.38
End time: 2261.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  specifically for people like you. It was designed for John Podesta because of course his Gmail was  hacked by the Russians and leaked to WikiLeaks. I didn't even think of this, but yes, as I guess,  as a congressional candidate. In fact, are you worried about- you must feel that you might be  under- I guess once you- you've got to get through the primary. Sure. Once you get through the  primary, and I have all confidence you'll get the nomination, you're going to have to really- I  think the Russians are going to be very involved in 2018.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So there's a larger issue. And Elcomsoft, which is a fairly well-known security company, published a  story on Wednesday. It's titled iOS 11 Horror Story, The Rise and Fall of iOS Security. Now,  this is intentional on Apple's part, not a flaw. What Elcomsoft is saying is that iOS used to be  very secure. And we've talked about it a lot on our shows on security. Now Steve Gibson has  read the Apple white papers on security and has talked a lot about the secure enclave and the  things Apple does that are really impressive. And Elcomsoft essentially says that's all changed.  And they use as an example, Apple, traditionally in security, there's a balance between convenience  and security. More convenience means less security. Apple has decided to move in the direction of  convenience, in particular with the encrypted backups of your iPhone. It used to be that if you  did an encrypted backup of your iPhone, you couldn't, not only could you not use that encrypted  backup, but you would have to go through iOS in order to change or remove that password for future  backups and provide the old password. If you had forgotten that, you'd be stuck. You'd have to  factory reset the device and you'd lose everything, which was a good protection against your data  being stolen. Apple has backed down on that. And I was not aware of that in iOS 11.  While you still can have an encryption password in the backup, if you forget it,  you just go into your phone and iOS settings and you reset the settings, which blanks your passcode.  You still have to have your iPhone passcode, but basically you can create a new encrypted backup  from that point on. I'm sure this is in response to users constantly calling Apple support. I think  I've done it a few times myself saying, we can't remember what our encrypted password backup is.  Can you help? But it is now very much easier to do that. And what the upshot of that is,  if you set a temporary password, made the backup, then decrypted it with an Elcomsoft tool, they  have a tool called Phone Breaker, or just use Keychain Explorer in their Phone Breaker to,  you could access the user's passwords, authentication tokens, credit card numbers,  everything in that keychain. And while you're at it, you might as well go through their photos  account as well. So what is interesting is happening, and a couple of questions come to mind.  A, is Apple backing down a little bit on their traditionally very steep security? And I, for one,  have been a constant complainer about, God, I got to enter my password again? It used to be in iOS.  You'd enter your password at the drop of a hat. That has, by the way, if you've noticed,  you don't do that as much anymore. Or, if I'm really paranoid, is this in response to pressure  from federal law enforcement agencies, who really have been angry at Apple, because the iPhone is so

Start time: 2510.32

Start time: 2517.06
End time: 2531.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a backdoor in there? It's not a backdoor, but it means it would be good for law enforcement.  Or a master key, I guess. It means it's easier to get into the data, even if it's encrypted.

Start time: 2533.92
End time: 2655.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's important to note, and I'm not disputing what Elkomsoft is saying,  but I do think it's important to note that a lot of this was an advertisement for their  phone breaker software. Yes. And all security companies do this.  Yes. But I think it's important in this context, especially to say, I've actually used their  software. When the iCloud hack happened and celebrities' photos were taken and spread across  the way, and we started asking a lot of questions about iCloud backups, I actually bought their  software, used some other tools, and wrote an article for Mashable about how I hacked my own  iCloud for $200. I remember that. And I used their software to do it. And so part of this,  I think, is obviously an advertisement to their software. And I'm not really sure how the encrypted  backup stuff has changed, but it's something that even Elkomsoft has bragged about being able to do  for years, far predating any of the FBI stuff. And so I feel like we can ask questions about  how much physical access is required and how good or how bad various forensic software is  and what it can do. But I don't feel like we can go far enough to say that Apple is putting them  back doors or is trying to kowtow to government pressure because the company went out of its way  on a big level to fight the government's order for them to get into that San Bernardino phone.  And from everyone that I've talked to at Apple, they went out of their way to make iOS 10 and  iOS 11 even more secure. So the local backup things, I agree that could be a potential flaw.  I think you also have to say how many people actively backup their phones on their computers,  and that number is decreasing all the time. And in fact, iTunes is becoming less and less  used to even install apps on your phone. They took that feature out of iTunes 12 point whatever. So  it's a concern, but I have to kind of my ears prick up a little bit and think, okay,  but how much of this is just about promoting the newest version of Phone Breaker?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Good point. Yeah, I think that's fair though, Christina. But I think the thing I would say,  do you remember President Obama, we spoke at South by Southwest two years ago,  he made comments there. They're directly related to this. This really struck me when he said it,  because it scared the mess out of me, to be honest. He said that in response to the Apple  San Bernardino case, if Apple did not work with the government to find out a way to give courts  access to iPhones, when situations like that came up, that he believes Congress would go behind  their back and in secret pass laws that would force them to give them access. And that's something  they can do. You can pass laws like that in secret committee. So I think you can have an utterly,  I'm right there with you. I think Apple has the best of intentions. They've made their statement  known. They have a great track record. That's why I buy their stuff. I do think that that,  like Leo, what you're saying, I don't believe that's true automatically, but I think it's a  reasonable fear to have. It will happen sometime if it hasn't happened. By the way, the perfectly

And by the way, the takeaway and Elcomsoft says this at the end of  the article is because your only protection on your phone is your passcode, don't do a six digit  passcode. Use a long, strong passcode because that is the last line of defense, contrary to previous

Transcript:  I don't think so. I don't think so. And that's why I brought this up in kind of contrast to what  we were talking about earlier with the login bug. That was a flaw. That was an error. That was maybe  lack of attention. This is a very conscious decision. This is Apple's security expert saying,  all right, we've got this balance, convenience, security. We feel like maybe convenience has  gone down too much. Maybe we're getting too many calls to support. We're going to make it more  convenient. It's going to be less secure. It's something people should be aware of. And you're  right. Obviously, every security firm, when they report security flaws, it's an ad for the security  firm as much as anything else. So I always take those with a grain of salt. I'm glad, Cristina,  you brought up Obama's appearance at South by Southwest because that was the one where he said,  you can't take an absolutist view on phone encryption. He says, we've got to stop fetishizing  our smartphones. He says, quote, if your bargain is strong encryption, no matter what, that we can  and should in fact create black boxes. I think that does not strike the kind of balance that we've  lived with for two or three hundred years. It's fetishizing our phones above every other value.

Start time: 2825.18

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That cannot be the right answer. But it's not about fetishizing. He was talking about this  before. Everything's in there. It's your brain. Exactly. The phone is an extension of your brain.  It's about keeping what we know secure, whether that be in here or in our phones.  We have a right. The Fifth Amendment gives us that right to protect that information.

Transcript:  It is a balance. I think Obama brought up a very good point, which is we expect and want law  enforcement to maintain law and order in a civilized society. It's a very difficult challenge.  If anybody, criminals and us alike, can make completely impenetrable storage,  where does that put law enforcement? But it's a very difficult answer. I understand why he  brought it up. I think he's wrong. I can understand why law enforcement feels that way because they  also feel they have a responsibility. They have a lot of other tools to work with too.

Well, there's a bottom line to this whole conversation, which is it's more and more  up to the user to be cautious, to pay attention to security, to do the right thing, maybe have a  better, stronger passcode on your phone, and pay attention to security bullets because, who knows,  somebody could log in.

Cristina is saying they're trying to sell a product, but I think as far as a market  capitalization, there's not enough security research out there in comparison to what I have  to imagine governments all around the world are spending on trying to hack this stuff.  I think for us as a nation, we've got to have a really adult conversation of how can we better  fund security research? How can we protect this infrastructure? Because right now, all respect to  the ones out there doing it right now, they're saving the world, but we need a lot more of that.

Start time: 2974.90
End time: 3014.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Absolutely, but I would even go a step farther. We've got to actively fight companies,  and this happens time and time again, who threaten to jail the security researcher who comes up with  a flaw. Federal authorities who use the very draconian anti-hacking laws to go after people  who are really just trying to make us more secure. The IP, intellectual property protection laws like  the DMCA, that forbid security researchers from looking at flaws entirely. All of these things  have to be fixed. I'm amazed people still are security researchers. There is such a risk to them.

Transcript:  Well, fortunately, from my perspective from the auto industry, things have actually changed quite  a bit just in the last two or three years. When I first started talking to people in the industry  about this back in 2010, 2011, they would stick their heads in the sand. Hacking is not an issue  with our telematics systems like Hotstar and other systems. As recently as about three years ago,  you had GM joining John Deere in fighting DMCA exemptions for security research.  At least the auto industry, I don't know about John Deere, but the auto industry has moved beyond  that. They've really embraced security researchers because as they move forward into this world of  automated and connected vehicles, they realize the risks inherent in that. Several companies have  now formed bug bounty programs for the first time. Tesla was first, GM and Chrysler have done it now.  Others have informal bug bounty programs. Last year, the industry also formed an auto ISAC,  an information sharing and analysis center. ISACs are common in a lot of different industry  verticals. For the first time, we now have one in the auto industry that enables both automakers and  suppliers to work together to share information about best practices and some of the threats that  are out there and how to fight these threats. Fortunately, at least in the auto industry,  we've seen a change of attitude towards security researchers. Now, Charlie Miller and Chris  Valasek, who I'm sure you know those names, both of those guys are now working for Cruise Automation,  which is a subsidiary of General Motors that's developing their automated driving software here

Transcript:  in San Francisco. There's some success stories. This month, the Department of Defense, the Pentagon,  invited hackers to attack it. As a result, fixed thousands of bugs. Hacking protected systems,  even to reveal weaknesses, is illegal under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act.  The Department of Justice has repeatedly made it clear that it will enforce the law. This is according  to Lilly Hay Newman writing in Wired. But in the last 18 months, a new Department of Defense project  called Hack the Pentagon has offered real glimmers of hope that these prejudices could change. They  found thousands of bugs in the DOD's public-facing websites. This was a great success. I also  want to, by the way, circle around on the Apple root story because Lemmy Orhan, who tweeted about  the root flaw, did write a Medium post, which I had missed, who said, I did not discover this. It  was actually discovered at my company. And it had been mentioned, they discovered it a week earlier,  and had informed Apple about it. And it had been on the Apple Developer Forum since November 13th.  Apple either hadn't paid attention, didn't want to publicize it, didn't have a fix.  So he said after I was told by my IT guys that I had to get a root password on my Mac  to fix this problem, he said, what? And he tweeted it. He tweeted it. But Apple had been  apprised of it weeks earlier and apparently decided not to take it seriously, didn't see it.  So this is something that really has to be changed. The laws have to be changed,  and there has to be a culture of encouraging security researchers to find these flaws or

Transcript:  the bad guys will find them first. I think it's really important to say if we're talking about  changing the laws on this, you don't have to get every single jerk store in Congress to agree with  this and pass a law. There is one committee and if you have 15 votes on that, you can  like append legislation to make sure security researchers have A, B and C. This is a solvable  problem with if you get a group of technologically illiterate people to run and replace the  technologically illiterate people in there, they're currently responsible for gutting net  neutrality. So this can happen. We just need more technologically illiterate people to get involved

And then the entire front page of Twitter for a brief  period of time, because they had then campaigns to vote those karma up on all those, was one after  another member of Congress, member of Congress, member of Congress, member of Congress, and the  amount of money.

Well, and not to veer off into politics, but one of  the stories behind the tax law that was passed in such a strange way a couple of nights or last  night, was it last night? It was Friday night. Friday night? Was the threat from both sides  to members of Republican members of Congress that they would lose their seat from the right,  people like Steve Bannon saying, if you don't vote for this, the Koch brothers saying, if you don't  vote for this, we're going to oust you. We're going to get a better candidate and you're going  to lose in the primaries. And from the left, people saying, we don't want this tax bill.  Republicans are going to lose in 2018. I don't know if you're a Republican member of Congress,  I don't know what you would do. I think I would hope, one would hope you would do the right thing,  do what your conscience dictated, because you're going to get screwed.

And the last, the person that's the least important seems to be the voter. I think we can fix that by  voting. I would hope. I would hope. Anyway, I didn't mean to get political, but it's just  mind-boggling how dysfunctional this has become. Let's take a break and we will come back.

I would totally pay the monthly fee. My issue is that it's only in Japan for right now. So I'm  not going to pay a monthly fee in Japan. Like where I draw the line is getting a Japanese credit card  and subscribing to some sort of Japanese mobile service so I can try to have that.  Just take Ambien and it'll all make sense.

Transcript:  And the judge is upset. The judge is actually pissed off.  Because that's...  It should be.  The question is... So Reuters says Uber's use of encrypted messaging may set legal precedents,  but I think Reuters is confusing encrypted messaging with self destruct messaging.  Yeah.  Yes.  Yeah.  Both of them are problematic, but at least with encrypted messaging, the message still exists,  so you could, in theory, demand it to be unencrypted.

Start time: 4375.44
End time: 4399.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like the key. Yes. You could, in theory, say that as part of the discovery,  you have to turn over the key to decrypt these messages. The self destruct part is what's  more damaging, especially in conjunction with this case. And obviously, I think of all of us here,  Sam knows the most about this Waymo Uber stuff, I'm sure, and all the stuff it's over, but this is  insane.

Transcript:  Well, among other people, Corey Lewandowski was using it.  Anthony Lewandowski.  Anthony, not Corey. That's another Lewandowski. Corey Lewandowski is a Trump guy.  Anthony Lewandowski was using it. And so they were using something called Wicker,  which I'd never heard of. So the issue was that, for instance, and the judge is talking about this,  he says, in fact, attorneys that counsel in future cases could be found in malpractice  if they are unable to turn over evidence from specialized communication tools like Wicker.  For instance, Wiki would have been a way for Lewandowski to communicate with other members  of the engineers. They could say, hey, Anthony, when you had, how did Waymo solve this problem  with the trolley car, Anthony could respond. And that would 30 seconds later, that whole  conversation is gone forever. There is a responsibility for companies to preserve this  paper trail, especially when there's litigation going on. If they're concerned that there's going  to be litigation and they're deleting it intentionally. Yeah. I mean, companies, most

Start time: 4467.42
End time: 4489.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  big companies have retention policies for email and anything, unless it's relevant to something  you're working on now, if it's over a certain age, you're supposed to delete it and get rid of it.  But if there's ongoing litigation and it's relevant to that litigation, then you're supposed to retain  it. And it sounds like this. I mean, how long was this? Was 30 seconds that it was? Well, I don't

Start time: 4490.06
End time: 4494.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 4494.74
End time: 4508.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  version of Wicker. Yeah. And depending on when they started using this, if they're used pre-dates,  Levandowski's arrival at Uber, you could, I suppose, make a case for that. I mean, I'm not

Transcript:  a lawyer. Sure. The new CEO, Dara Koswarski, thank you. You're welcome. I can't say your name  either. So it's good that you would help me with this one. The new CEO said that he says,  true, that Wicker Telegram were often used at Uber when I came in as of September 27th and  had directed my teams not to use such apps when discussing Uber related business. So

Start time: 4531.96
End time: 4606.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a question kind of related to this. Obviously, Wicker and Signal are one thing,  and we kind of know what those are. But Slack, which is obviously a much more common tool,  and I think that people kind of raise their eyes and understandably so to say, why are you,  to conduct business, why are you using Wicker or Signal? And like you were saying, Sam, of course,  it would kind of, you could make the argument that if the use predated Levandowski's hiring  an auto or was it auto? What was the name of his company that was acquired? It was auto. Yeah,  an auto being acquired and becoming part of it, then maybe you could say, well, this was already  kind of common practice. But I think it would still raise eyebrows in any event that to do  company business, you're using Wicker, you're using Signal. But let's take Slack as an example,  which is a very common business tool. And Slack, even though they have retention policies  and that most companies do them, you can also set things within channels, whether they're private  or public, to auto delete after a certain period of time. So after three days, after a week,  after 24 hours, it'll delete. I don't know, maybe one of you three does, I don't know what Slack's  ultimate retention policies are. Like are those still kept somewhere on the back end?

Start time: 4606.58
End time: 4610.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's up to the user. And in fact, somebody in the chat room is saying you can set Slack

Start time: 4611.16
End time: 4662.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to delete direct messages after 24 hours. Yes, you can. And I say that what I'm saying is from  a corporate level, is that something that is a log still maintained going to the admin that I'm not  sure about because Slack is obviously used much more frequently than any of these other tools are.  And as someone who worked for a company that was the Basuud and whose Slack and other logs were  brought into litigation, I didn't work there at the time, but I'm friends with people who  were part of that. I know that that can be really painful, but you do kind of wonder if  you can delete those things, does that become a problem within discovery in a legal sense?  Because Wicker and Signal are one thing, but more traditional, like more quote unquote legit  collaboration tools, I think that the question becomes stickier, right?

Start time: 4662.62
End time: 4679.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Right. Well, I think it's exactly as this piece suggests that if in the process of discovery,  you are using these tools to auto delete it, you are going to not have a presumption of innocence  there. Yeah. Isn't that interesting? This is federal civil court guidelines enable judges to

Start time: 4679.96
End time: 4691.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  tell jurors that you can presume information covered up by a litigant and now missing would  have been negative. So the presumption is, well, whatever it was, it was bad.

Start time: 4692.54
End time: 4754.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah. I think like when we talk about police departments having body cameras,  a lot of the time that footage ends up missing. I think this is sort of a similar problem that  when that goes, I think we need to have this presumption legal in the legal sense, this  legal presumption that something was there. For my husband's profession, he does patent law for a  living. They worry about this a lot, data retention, because if you can legally prove that the person  that you're suing for patent infringement knowingly infringed on your patent, then it's triple  damages at that point. So if you're talking about biotech, that's just a mind-bogglingly huge number.  So I think like the important thing to really define here is the legal presumption that you  have something to hide in this case, because you're never going to be able to go through and say,  okay, you can use Slack, you can use Snapchat, you can use this or that tool. I think it's got to be  up to each individual company to very carefully keep their records. And most big companies,

Start time: 4755.36
End time: 4796.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  their IT departments, well, let me drop the word most there. A lot of big companies,  their IT departments, they take into account things like retention policies. For example,  my company, we use Exchange for email and Skype for business for our chat, our internal  corporate chat. So we're supposed to use these tools and the IT department has whatever,  I'm not sure exactly what their policies are as far as how long they keep it, but they do have  those kinds of policies in place. And we've been specifically told not to use things like Slack

Start time: 4796.66
End time: 4811.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for work-related communications. Because it'll be preserved. Well, because they don't have to.  After all, can't you just have a voice conversation or a phone call and none of that's preserved?  Yeah, that's true. If you really want to be private, talk in person or talk on the phone.

Start time: 4813.22
End time: 4818.72

Transcript:  writing an email or sending a text message. Yes. I don't know about you guys, but I've done things  I don't think would ever be the... I've been in work situations where I don't think our conversation  or anything about it would have ever been the subject of a lawsuit, but where we've been texting  or iming or emailing back and forth. You want to pick up the phone or you want to walk over to X  because it's just, don't leave a paper trail. Sometimes it's paper trail. Sometimes it's

But yeah, you're right. So I don't know how it would be if the noise went away. In fact,  one of the weird things when we were in Bellevue for the first two months here, there wasn't,  it was like being back at the sub. It was so, yes. I couldn't deal. I couldn't deal. And so one of  the reasons we moved to Capitol Hill, which is where I live now in Seattle, is because it is an  actual city and especially on the weekends it gets loud. And then for me, I was like, oh, finally I  can sleep, you know, because, or I was like, what is this? I don't know how to deal without

Well, I have an app for the iPhone that will  have background noise for sleeping and it has not only, you know, wind and rain and  Manhattan wind chimes, it also has loud street sounds. And so I was using, we were using the  wind and rain when we were, cause we stayed crazily. I don't know why on Times Square. So it was,  it was very noisy the whole time. I love that. I just, I feel like I'm at home. I have to,  I have to say though, there's 40,000, the cabby told us there's 40,000 cabs, 40,000 medallions  on the New York city streets. And I don't know, untold numbers of lifts and Ubers driving in New  York. You just take the subway, right? You wouldn't drive somewhere in New York.

Transcript:  I mean, I would take Ubers, lifts, the cabs and subway. I would do a combination of all of them.  Be prepared for a long drive. Oh yeah. No, totally. I mean, and look, but I'll be honest. I mean, I,  I calculated how much money I'd spent on Uber over like between 2011 and I think 2016. And,  and I think it was 20, I think it was $24,000, I think. But that's cheaper than a car.  Without a doubt it is, but that's just Uber. I'm not counting, you know, cabs. That was just Uber.  So, but even then still way cheaper than a car. Because I had this problem and, and when I gained  a little bit of weight and I lost it all, but I think what, there were a few things that went  into that. And I think part of it was because the subway wasn't that close to my apartment. I would  just take an Uber in the morning. Oh, there we go. And that would work, but I would work in the back  of the car. See, this is why I can't wait for self-driving cars. This will make you feel at home.  Work in the back seat of a cab.

If you're a Mac person, you're an Apple person of any kind. You probably know  JAMF. You're an IT. Absolutely. You know, JAMF. JAMF. The problem is, you know, if your business is  small as ours was when you first started out, you have a couple of iPads, a couple of iPhones,  a couple of Macs. It's easy to keep track, but as you grow, you buy more equipment for your employees  and your staff and it gets harder to keep track of everything.

And so I was like, oh, well, that kind of sucks. It would have been better if they could have just  gone directly to, in my case, the ACLU's website and donated to the ACLU. But yeah.

And, you know, as long as  we're talking about this, I'm always so frustrated that so many businesses in Boston  did the same thing. Like they've outsourced their corporate charity giving to the employees of the  companies. If you go to, you know, like a grocery store here, they'll ask you to donate to some  Red Sox Fund. And, you know, 20 years ago, that would be that corporation that would donate that  money to, you know, the Red Sox charity. Instead, they're like outsourcing it for you. And that  bothers me.

You know, like this year,  for example, we had 20 people went to local women's shelter in Ann Arbor, or better women's shelter.  And we completely redid the laundry room. You know, we cleaned everything up, pulled all the  machines out, repainted, patched all the holes in the walls. We spent about four hours doing this,  you know, so did some, you know, productive work activity, you know, and do something analog,  you know, forget, you know, instead of clicking, you know, just clicking on something to send 10  bucks here or 20 bucks there, do something real for a change.

And actually one of the great  Giants batters, Kevin Mitchell was the coach for a while till he threw a chair a little too hard.  Maybe you should move on, Kevin. But the fun thing about these minor league teams is the  promotions they do in between innings because they are so cheesy. They would have one where  they'd get a bunch of kids. It's like between the fifth and sixth inning. And they'd put a bat on  home base and they'd make the kid put his forehead on the bat and spin around, spin around, spin  around till he got really dizzy and then see if he could run to first base.

And the author of the book about Silk Road, Nick Bilton, he was on here. And I read that book.  I absolutely loved it. I devoured it. We talked about it on Rocket. And I, on a whim,  after I read that book, bought $200 of Bitcoins. And now I have $2,000 thanks to coming on your  show. You're kidding me. Thank you very much. I am not.

That's amazing. Yeah. And American Kingpin, which was the book he had just published, I think  that's optioned. I know the Twitter book is optioned. Twitter book is optioned. I'm sure  that the Silk Road book is optioned. I think he's writing that script. He's the next Aaron  Sorkin. Good for you, Nick. He's great.  So Bitcoin did cross $10,000. Is it still that high? Then it crossed $11,000 and then Coinbase  and a few other things crashed. Wow. And it dropped. Do you want to hear a sad story? I'll  give you a sad story.

You didn't have to have a nuclear power plant next to you to do it. And the first  night it drops 50 Bitcoins, which would be worth $500,000 right now.

In fact, that was my original kind of entree into kind of getting interested in Bitcoin was  the drama around like the Bitcoin scam artists. If I'm being completely like candid, like that was  the most fascinating thing is all the people even before ICOs became like modern Ponzi schemes,  there were Ponzi schemes happening in like Bitcoin funds, like four or five years ago.  And it's, but yeah, you're right. It is really interesting to see how much of it  has disappeared because people have either lost it or stuff has disappeared off of different  wallets or exchanges have been hacked.

Nakamoto's kind of disappeared off the face of the earth.  We don't know if it's a person or multiple people, what their real names are,  or whether they still have access to those Bitcoins. They've not moved them in any way.  Maybe they forgot. That would be bad. A related story, of course, a coin hive,  which is a website and there are a number of these that offer JavaScript resources for websites.  Oh, God, these are so bad. That want to mine Bitcoin on your browser using JavaScript. Typically,  actually, they're mining, I think, Ethereum. Yeah, yeah, you're usually doing it.

Because at one point, my husband was looking at getting into mining operations and I was like,  you're never going to do it in quantities where it will matter and the Chinese are taking over  anyway. In much respect to me, maybe I should have encouraged him to spend $600 a month on power  to do it, but who knows? Who's to say?

Transcript:  We have a friend, Steve Gibson, I have a friend who lives in Arizona where power is cheap  and has made a living mining Bitcoin in his garage with very fancy advanced ASIC machines.  And so forth. But I think as because of course, part of the way that this works,  and this is the brilliance of Nakamoto, is it as more bitcoins generated, it's harder and harder  to solve these mathematic problems. And so it requires more hardware, more power. And that's  how it's supposed to be. By the way, it's not Ethereum, it's Monero. It's another cryptocurrency.

Start time: 6257.22
End time: 6295.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I have to say, I have a different opinion than y'all do about this. I think that websites have  to find a way to monetize the stuff that they're putting out there. And the current way to do that,  even huge sites like Vox do this. They put all these ad trackers and they basically sell your  data to whoever they can give it to and do it with ads. If I had to choose between using my  computational power to give them X number of cycles to solve these cryptocurrency problems,  I would so much rather do that than have everybody and their mother spying on my browsing habits.

Start time: 6295.50
End time: 6324.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Chad Moses Yeah, but before you do that, you definitely want to, they need to be up front,  they need to be candid about what they're doing. Just like in the days when people were running  SETI at home or protein folding. At least if you know what you're getting into, that's fine.  But I think the problem is these guys are being just as, they're doing this behind the scenes  without telling you just like the trackers are. Lauren Ruffin Right. And what's starting to happen

Start time: 6324.36
End time: 6361.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  too is that I've noticed this is that people are buying WordPress plugins that have X number of  installs and they're going to people and they're acquiring them and saying, hey, I'll give you X  amount of money. And then they're updating the WordPress plugins to basically include  this sort of thing. So people are putting it on their websites and then unknowingly  having these crypto mining operations happening on their sites and then they don't know why  their sites are slow or why people are complaining and have no clue that they're aiding all of this.  So I think that there's something to be said if you're making that part of your explicit  business model that says rather than showing ads, we're going to be doing this and that's something

Start time: 6361.64

End time: 6377.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lauren Ruffin Yeah, that's what I'm saying. Lauren Ruffin I mean, it would depend on the content of the site.  I don't know if I would agree with it. But I mean, it would depend on the resources it would take,  right? Because in some cases, the resources on certain websites are so ridiculous, especially

Start time: 6382.44
End time: 6453.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  ads, your CPU would be- Lauren Ruffin Right. And so it depends. I mean, on the one hand, you could say,  oh, well, if they were doing it in moderation, but of course, as we've seen with ads and trackers and  all that, no one will do anything in moderation. So I don't know. I mean, I still think that what  you'll have is there will still be a contention of people using blockers and whatnot. I will say this  though, and I know this will be really unpopular and I don't really care. I have a problem with  browsers like Brave that are, if you want to actively block ads and you want to make that part  of what your browser thing is, do it, whatever. But I have a problem with Brave who blocks the ads  and then has people paying into its ICO and then says, oh, well, you can give money to websites.  And as long as they sign up for, as long as they tell us that they've signed up, then we'll give  them the money that you choose to pay on. I'm not a fan of that. Why don't you like that? Because I  thought that was a really good idea. Because I feel like that puts the onus on the site owner to  have to then reach through a million hoops and sign up and say, here's my information. And now  you get payment. I also, if I'm being completely honest, I have a problem with a company who's  raising money through an ICO and then their main business model is to deprive revenue from other

Start time: 6453.90
End time: 6488.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  people. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, what Brave was doing is not that much different from what's Pocket  originally back when they were still, read it later. I mean, they had a similar kind of business  model and other sites have done similar types of things. As Christina said, you're putting the  onus on the site operator to reach out and go through all these hoops in order to get the money.  I prefer something like what Google was doing. Google Contributor. I like that.  You're just paying an amount of money every month. And basically, I was doing it.

Start time: 6515.38
End time: 6556.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're trying to find a way around that. Right. And that's fine. And like I said, if you want to  have an ad blocker, I mean, I have the same issue with some of the Adblock Plus, which is part of  an ad consortium and has people to whitelist. Right. You know what I mean? Exactly. It's like,  if you're going to do that, do that. But I have a problem if you're raising money, if you're  raising VC funding and if you're raising an ICO and the whole impetus of your product is to get  rid of trackers, get rid of advertising. And then you're saying, oh, well, even though we're  depriving revenue from all these websites, we want our users to be able to give to them. But  you have to jump through these hoops to get it. Oh, and you have to have a minimum amount to get  the money out and those things. It rubs me the wrong way. What's the alternative? I mean,

Start time: 6557.52

Start time: 6561.24
End time: 6592.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I feel like if the whole point of your browser where you're raising funding and you're making  money, that's really where it comes to for me is you're making money off of depriving income  from other people. You're making that choice and then saying, oh, but we're going to give the money  back. But it's going to require every single site owner in the world to sign up and go through all  these hoops. It doesn't pay off. And I doubt that the amount of money that they're collecting  will ever be anything meaningful for even the biggest websites out there. Even if-

I mean,  we saw another round of really devastating journalist layoffs this week that has  consequences for our society, for how informed we are and the kind of non-clickbait news that  gets made. So these are really serious issues. And I completely agree with what everyone's saying,  the informed consent that is the core issue here. I just think we're going to have to find some  alternative model for journalists and media content providers to get paid because eventually  we're going to know so much about everyone that the value of that YouTube is going to be less and

Chris, just a couple of weeks before Christmas 2010, in the next three  months, eight stores in Michigan and Ohio were robbed at gunpoint. The robbers took bags filled  with smartphones. On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will consider whether prosecutors violated the  Fourth Amendment, that's the one against unreasonable search and seizure, by collecting data from  cell phone companies showing the movements of the man they say organized the robberies. So aside  from the guy, obviously, you know, okay, he's a crook. But this case, Carpenter University of  the United States, is being considered by many, including Jeffrey Rosen, the president of the  National Constitution Center, the most important electronic privacy case of the 21st century.  Effectively, it comes down to should the police be able to access the GPS on your phone? And the way  they do it, by the way, is not through your phone, they contact your cell phone company and say,  and almost I think all the cell phone companies have portals for law enforcement, where they charge  a small amount in law enforcement can say, well, where was Leo Laporte on November 28?  Apple, Facebook and Google, I'm reading from the New York Times article by Adam Liptec.  Apple, Google and Facebook have filed amicus briefs urging the Supreme Court to bring Fourth  Amendment law into the modern era. No constitutional doctrine should presume that consumers assume the  risk of warrantless government surveillance just because they use these technologies.  The court will decide by June. The issue, I guess, is the Fourth Amendment is an 18th century  solution. This goes back to our conversation about encryption.

Transcript:  And tracking.  Yeah. Yeah.  Yeah. I can say, Leo, like this is the most important story that we're talking about this  week. I think everyone listening or watching a show would agree we want to get bad guys. Like we  want law enforcement people to go and get a warrant to be able to go before a judge and get that  information with pressure to law enforcement and putting bad guys in jail. No one would disagree  with that. What this is about is the standards of proof that law enforcement has to bring before  a judge to get basically huge reams of information about you. So, yeah, this is very similar to the  Apple San Bernardino case. It's a situation where everybody wants the person to face legal  consequences. But if this decision goes through, the government will have the ability to go forward  and present a very, very low burden of proof to a judge and be able to get all of your records.

Transcript:  Is this what's called a pen warrant?  I don't know.  You don't need to go to a judge. You don't need to get a warrant. You need merely to go to the  phone company, say, you know, I'm investigating a crime. The cell phone companies turned over  the defendant Carpenter's cell phone records over 127 days, placing him at 12,898 locations.  Prosecutors could tell whether he had slept at home on a given night, whether he attended his  usual church on Sunday morning, and in fact used that data to convict him and sentence him to 116  years in prison because that phone was nearby when several of the robberies happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And this is only going to get, this is actually a really important case because  this is going to expand dramatically. Going back to my autonomous cars and connected cars thing,  this is going to expand dramatically because when you get into autonomous and connected cars,  you're not going to be buying those cars. You're going to be either subscribing to them or paying  a la carte. They're going to be available through mobility as a service models.  Well, even if I buy it, Elon knows everything I do in my car at all times.  But, you know, in the next couple of years, you know, virtually 100% of new vehicles that are sold  are going to be equipped with telematic systems. So you're going to have a cell modem in virtually  every new car. And as you get into autonomous, you know, there's going to be monitors inside the  vehicle that look at who's in there, who's riding around in there. So, I mean, there's going to be  way more information than we have even now, which is tracking a phone because there's going  to be cameras inside the vehicle that can see who's in there so they can know who to bill,  who to authenticate. And it's, you know, it's going to, you know, if with the phone, you don't  know who's actually carrying that phone unless you have eyes on that individual carrying that phone.  But once you hop into an autonomous car to go for a ride across town, they're going to know exactly  who's in that car and where you're going. And we're not saying law enforcement shouldn't have

Start time: 6943.02
End time: 6998.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  access to this. We're saying they should have to go to a judge and get a warrant. Exactly.  Which they don't need to right now. It's called a pen register. And it comes from, I didn't know  this, but previous Supreme Court decisions like the 1979 Smith versus Maryland, Supreme Court  ruled a robbery suspect had no reasonable expectation to privacy extended to the numbers he dialed from  his landline phone. The reasoning is, well, you turned that information over to a third party,  the phone company, when you dialed the phone. So we can ask the phone company and you have no  reasonable right to privacy there. You will get, this is the third party doctrine. And, and  governments and the government and courts have used this to justify seeking data from a cell phone  company showing users movements. So I don't think it's unfair or unreasonable to say, no,  this is really a lot of information. You should need a warrant for it. Right. We don't know what

Start time: 6998.88
End time: 7032.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the Supreme Court will do, however. Yeah. No, we don't. And I think it's important too, to point  out, because some people say, oh, well, don't you want to catch the bad guys? And why are you trying  to, you know, fury what law enforcement is supposed to do? And it's important to remember that like  the Miranda case and many of our big, you know, Fourth Amendment cases, Miranda was not a good  person. That doesn't mean that you shouldn't be ready to write. Just because someone is Robert  does something terrible doesn't mean that if, that if the government overstepped, that it's not  important to put that in perspective because there, the consequences of allowing that to go forward

Start time: 7033.28
End time: 7124.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  could be much, much worse. So there is some encouraging, you know, precedent in this. There's,  there was a case a couple of years ago, Riley versus California. The court said police must  generally have a warrant to search the cell phones of people they arrest. Chief Justice Roberts wrote  modern cell phones are not just another technological convenience. Even the word  cell phone is a misnomer. They could just as easily be called cameras, video players,  Rolodexes, calendars, tape recorders, libraries, diaries, albums, televisions, maps, or newspapers.  So that's, that's good news. There's some understanding there of this kind of higher  level of information that a cell phone provides. There's another case, US versus Jones from 2012.  I remember talking about this on Security Now. The police attached a GPS tracking device  to a suspect's car. They tracked him for 28 days and the court ruled nine to nothing that that was  problematic under the fourth amendment. The majority said the police were not entitled to  place the device on private property. Five justices who did, you know, vote against it, but they,  you know, voted in saying it was problematic, but they said they, their problem was the government's  ability to vacuum up troves of private information. So there is some good news that even both the  conservative and the liberal wings of the Supreme Court have had some discomfort with this kind of,  kind of overreaching collection of information. So cross your fingers. We'll find out in June.

Start time: 7125.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think that it's really important that we have new laws passed that kind of set these standards,  right? Like we've got to look at what privacy is like in, you know, 2017 because so many of the  precedents for our law were set back when, you know, the internet was first being invented.  You know, like when you look at harassment law, this is all based off like the communication  standards and decency act, which was when the internet was just a baby. So we've got to go  through and we've got to have people that understand these issues that can define privacy and  can give consumers a wider, you know, set of rights because right now we're just at the mercy of  Facebook and Google and, you know, for the goodwill of a lot of these systems. Yeah.

That's  it. It would be another example of the third party. It's another click through agreement though.  Yeah. Yeah. No, nobody actually read. No, no. Let's take a break. We'll come back with more.  Want to talk cars and this Elon Musk tweet from yesterday. He's talking about putting his roadster  in space. I think he was joking. Never change, Elon. Never change. Don't ever change. We'll talk  about that in just a second. First, a word from IT Pro TV. Love these guys. They've been with us  since practically the beginning of IT Pro TV. In fact, Tim and Don who founded it were IT trainers  who say, and I believe them, that they went to a presentation I was part of at NAB and they got the  idea. Why don't we do what Leo does with Twitter, do it for IT training, for IT professionals, to  help people get the certifications they need to get the jobs they want, to help people keep those  jobs by getting extra skills and polishing up their existing skills. And now IT Pro TV has  completely eclipsed us. They have five studios. They make 125 hours of new content every week,  thousands of hours of on-demand content covering every area of IT. And you can watch on your  computer, on your phone, but you can also watch on your big screen TV, on your Chromecast,  on your Roku. There's a great IT Pro TV Roku channel, Fire TV. They have an Apple TV app,  iOS and Android apps. This is great for an individual who says, I want to be in IT,  but I need those certs. Maybe get that certified ethical hacker cert. I love that. Learn how to  use Kali Linux or Linux security techniques or ITIL, ISC squared security certs. Get the  CISC, the CRISC, the CISSP, the CISM, the CISA, the CEH. I love the acronym soup that these certs have.  You can learn all the skills you need to prepare for the certs you're interested in at a very low  cost. And if you manage an IT team, Harvard did this, Harvard University, they bought IT Pro TV  for the whole team so that they could get new skills and polish the skills they had. And with  the team solution, you get group pricing, you get access to a supervisor portal, lets you  control your team's training schedule, create custom groups, training assignments. You can see  individual analytics, group analytics, view logins, viewing time, view downloads, track course  completion, everything you need to keep your team on top of things. Now more than ever.  The estimate is that there will be one million security jobs open this year, 2018, and mostly  unfilled. These jobs have been hanging around for a couple of years now because there just aren't  enough IT pros out there with these security skills. Get those skills, get that great job  at ITPro.tv. Find out how IT Pro TV can offer you or your team the best IT training solution.  What do we have for you? It's a free seven day trial plus use the offer code TWIT30 at ITPro.tv  plus if you use that offer code TWIT30 you'll get 30% off your subscription as long as you stay active  forever. Forever.

That's got to be a hot topic right now. I wouldn't be surprised. They're really good on  this kind of stuff. We had a hacker on here. He's chief of security at DEFCON. Works at,  whatchamacallit. Gosh, it's escaping me. Anyway, he was on triangulation. He is the guy who hacked  the Tesla. He says it's running Linux. I can't remember which version of Linux.  There's a lot of Linux in vehicles.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have said this many times. I think Elon is, and I've interviewed him a couple times,  I think he's an incredible visionary. I think what Tesla has done  has really inspired the auto industry to move forward. They were not doing much with  lithium ion batteries until Martin Eberhardt and Mark Tarpenning, his partner, really got Tesla  going and then they brought in Elon with the funding. But it wasn't until that really started  to gain some steam that the rest of the auto industry really started paying attention.  That's when you got cars like the Chevrolet Volt, the first generation Leaf, and now over  the next couple of years we're going to see a whole slew of long range affordable EVs coming to market.

Transcript:  if that's what happened. He has said that he would be fine with everybody. I don't know that  he actually believes that part of it, but he has said that he would be fine if everybody else would  just abandon internal combustion and just go all electric. He said he'll make his patents  available to anybody to use, which is fine. I admire Elon's vision and I think he is an  incredible visionary. What he's not though is a good manager. He's a terrible manager. He's  terrible at running the company. He has picked up a lot of Steve Jobs' worst traits without the best  traits. So he's got the vision, but he doesn't seem to have the self-awareness to realize that  he's not the guy to be handling the day-to-day operations. He wants to retain total control of  what's going on at the company. What he needs to do is he needs to bring in his own Steve Cook.  He needs to step aside from the CEO role, be chief visionary officer, and get somebody that can  actually execute on that vision and make that a reality. More importantly, make it a profitable  reality because if you can't turn a profit, then the company is not going to survive and that vision

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  goes away. I want to really agree with what you're saying there on two points. First,  I think you're dead on everyone of my friends that works for Tesla says exactly that. When  Elon is focusing on your division, when he's thinking about your problem, money is coming,  leadership is coming, problems get solved. When you're not, things get lost in limbo forever,  which is why we've seen very slow iteration on some of Tesla's features.  The other thing I would say is a lot of the time when we talk about EV technology,  I'll respect these more boring, environmentally friendly cars. I think what the average consumer  doesn't know is just how much EV technology is critical in supercars these days. The Accura NSX  just came out. It has a combustion engine and then it also has a Freaky Amazing car,  but it also has this EV engine built inside of it, which is why I can get to the 0-60 in 1.9.

End time: 7923.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they killed it before because the gas industry and combustion engines was their bread and butter.  I mean, things have changed.

Start time: 7924.84
End time: 7986.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The reasoning behind the EV1 was a unique one-off product at GM and all the parts in it were  completely bespoke. They didn't use any off-the-shelf parts from other vehicles.  Legally, for liability reasons, they had to support that vehicle for an extended period of time. It  would have been incredibly costly to do that. Certainly, I think from the way they communicated  it all, they did that very poorly. If they had done that better and gone directly from that into  and already been working on a new EV program, then you never would have had this issue.  Unfortunately, they did drop the ball there because the technology was not commercially viable.  For the same reasons why Tesla may or may not actually survive, if they had focused too much  at that time on EVs, then they would have been in trouble with Wall Street as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The thing that's actually likely to make EVs really commercially viable is actually autonomy,  driving automation. EVs are still more expensive. The cost has come down, but they are still more  expensive. For the way most average people drive their vehicles, the payback time with the lower  operating costs of an EV stretch out so long that they can't wrap their heads around it.  For fleet operations, for autonomous mobility services, now the operating cost is much more  important. You've got vehicles, instead of them being driven 10 or 15,000 miles a year, they're  running 100,000 miles a year. Automated vehicles need the electrical power to drive everything.  I was with GM last week and they showed us their autonomous bolt that Cruz is working on.  The first prototypes of that were just the autonomous system was drawing  three to four kilowatts of power. Ten hours of use, that thing is going to draw down half  the battery without even moving. I think autonomous mobility can really be the thing that gets  many, many EVs on the road and gets people using them and really starts to get critical mass.

Transcript:  I also think there's another story we didn't get to get about Samsung. They finally managed  to get a commercial application of graphene in their batteries to make it charge that much  more quickly. For a lot of biotech companies around Boston, you can go there and you see  they've installed Juice Bar where you can charge your car. Once graphene and this new battery  technology starts making its way into electric vehicles, when you have something that's both  super-compassitive and super-conductive, that means this range problem is obviated because you can  fill up an electric vehicle as quickly as you can fill up a combustion engine. I think those  two technologies together are really going to get us on the right track. There's still the issue

Start time: 8123.72
End time: 8141.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  though of actually being able to mass produce those graphene batteries. There's been a lot of  very interesting breakthroughs in batteries over the last 10 or 15 years, none of which they've  managed to actually figure out ways to mass produce it. If Samsung can do that, Samsung  actually does some very good battery technology. If they can do that with these graphene batteries,

Transcript:  not the ISPs and the candidates. He's not angry about Twitter  promoting certain candidates. He's angry that Twitter bans Nazis sometimes. That's what he's  angry about, is that people who are conservative, apparently, are treated poorly. That's his  argument against Twitter, not the Russian underpinning. He says, now look, I love Twitter,

Start time: 8234.04
End time: 8294.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but let's not kid ourselves. When it comes to a free and open internet, Twitter is part of the  problem. The company has a viewpoint and uses that viewpoint to discriminate. Unfortunately,  Twitter is not an outlier. By the way, he's speaking to a friendly audience here, because  if he were speaking to anybody else, they'd go, what the hell are you talking about?  Indeed, despite all the talk and all the fear that broadband providers could decide what  internet content consumers can see, recent experience shows it's the edge providers  that are deciding what content they see. These providers routinely block or discriminate  against content they don't like. Here's the fear I have. This is the first shot.  In the now we know what the position is going to be from people who are really carrying water for  Comcast, Verizon, the big companies, because that's what Comcast and Verizon would like you,  the voter, to think is, oh no, it's not us. We're just nice people bringing you the internet.  It's those people at Google and Twitter. They're the problems.

I know Al Franken is somebody  that hasn't had the best month, but in his last book, he had a chapter that was very,  very relevant to this where he talked about when Comcast went through their last acquisition.  They went before his committee and they were trying to get basically antitrust permission  to move forward. He talked about how he fought to force clauses in there where Comcast would have  to basically give internet access to lower income people. They absolutely, they went before Congress,  they said what they'd have to say and they completely lied about it. Just didn't follow  through at all. I think you've really got to look at these companies history when it comes  to regulation. They're PR people saying we're going to do A, B and C. It's not legally binding.  There's no reason to believe that. Companies are going to do what is in their best interest.

Transcript:  Of course, an interesting article which was unfortunately titled by Ben Thompson in Stratechery,  his original title, Why Ajit Pai is Right, really wasn't, I hope, what he meant to say.  What he is saying, I think, and it's as usual with Ben, it's a lot of very erudite writing,  but what I think he is saying is maybe title two regulation. He says, I'm for net neutrality.  He's not for title two competition.  I believe fostering innovation. I think the net neutrality is the only way the internet can  function at scale and innovation is how we survive the internet-driven transformation that's only just  beginning. But he says title two regulation is not the way to do it.

Transcript:  I love Ben and I think he's incredibly smart. I do disagree with him on that point. I think he wrote  a compelling argument that could sway a lot of people. I personally disagree with it.

Transcript:  I can't disagree with the idea that the government should execute a light touch and what we really  need is competition. The problem is what we don't have is competition.

Start time: 8513.28
End time: 8551.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the whole point, is that we don't have competition. We haven't ever had competition and  there's nothing being done to increase that. In fact, when those things do happen, you see  companies, even in the case of Google Fiber, when they were attempting to come into different  places, now obviously Google has backed off of that plan. You would see the behavior on behalf  of Comcast and Verizon in those areas to do everything they could to stymie Google from  getting, from even starting there. I would be with you. Light touch would be great, assuming we  had competition, but we don't. In fact, most people don't even have a choice on who their ISP is. It  depends on where you live and you probably have one choice. If you're lucky, you have to. If you're

Start time: 8552.10
End time: 8626.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  lucky, you have to. I would submit, and I don't know why Ben isn't mentioning this, but what  actually Ajit Pai has done is the antithesis of light touch and encouraging competition because  he's banned the states from in any way interfering with net neutrality and he's allowed to go forward  the efforts by ISPs to prohibit public broadband, municipal broadband.  Exactly. I was going to say-  That's where competition could happen and the FCC and the ISPs are shutting it down.  Now, let me say another thing that's going to, and I'll take all the arrows now. I'm not sure.  I'm not sure that we need to worry about Comcast and Verizon. I know we've seen bad behavior from  them in the past, but I think all eyes are upon them and I think that they are going to, one thing  we know for sure, they're going to act in their best financial interest. That's how these companies  are constructed. That's what they should do. They're capitalist enterprises. Because I think they  would get so much heat if they were to throttle Netflix again, that that may not be a real threat  in at least in the months to come. Do you think?

Start time: 8626.78

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe not originally, but again, okay, so they get blowback, but what is your choice as a consumer?  Okay, so it's because of Comcast is the only person I can get as my ISP and they decide to  throttle Netflix unless I pay them an extra $10 a month. I don't have any recourse. I can't go to  another ISP. I still have to do that. But I'm with you. I think optically they might refrain  from doing that instead, but I think they're probably going to do. And I think in some ways,  this is more insidious. And we've already seen this happening with wireless companies, which  already weren't being held to the same net neutrality standards as traditional ISPs, is an  increase in zero rating. And zero rating on its face can be very good for consumers by saying,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, consumers won't complain about that.

Start time: 8672.08
End time: 8686.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's first of all, they'll complain about it because they're like, Oh, I'm getting this for  free or I'm getting this more stuff. But that to me is actually more insidious because it is giving  preferential treatment to certain services and it is giving certain places an advantage to leg up  because of their business relationship or because of something else.

Transcript:  What if we, instead of putting pressure on Ajit Pai to not, by the way, they haven't voted yet,  December 14th, not to preserve net neutrality, but instead put strong pressure on the FCC and  Congress to foster competition, to make rules, instead of make rules that are anti-competitive,  make rules that are pro competition, that encourage small ISPs because if there is an alternative  and companies behave badly, consumers will move to the alternative.

Start time: 8715.20
End time: 8733.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, in theory, that's great, except that there is no alternative today.  I mean, that's why they need that's why the government needs to say the Congress we have  today isn't going to do anything. I mean, it's pretty clear that they don't care what anybody  thinks, at least not the majority of the people. I mean, whether it's net neutrality or competition.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I do think you're dead on, Leo. The answer here is we've got to roll back these huge mega-mergers.  So we have basically two essentially ISPs throughout the whole country. We've got to  roll that back. I also think rather than leaving this up for the FCC to interpret,  I think it would be much better if Congress would just pass a bill, you know, ensuring this.  I think that's the way to do it. Well, that's your job, Brianna Wu. When you get into Congress in 2018,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you're going to step up there and you're going to say the I think we'll make up a nice acronym  for it, but the the act to foster competition among internet service providers. And we're going  to get that bill passed and it's going to be something everybody can get behind. And that  is better than anything. Let's not have a government regulation. Let's foster competition.  And if true competition were out there, then I wouldn't really be worried.

Transcript:  Because frankly, let's face it, Facebook, Google, Amazon, these companies really like,  they would love to get rid of net neutrality. That is true, because they are incumbents.  It's the companies in power that will stay in power. It's the little small innovative competitors  that are going to be disadvantaged if we throw out net neutrality. And so truthfully,  I don't think Google's fighting the fight for net neutrality.
