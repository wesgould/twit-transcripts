It's the same sort of thing with Facebook slap on the wrist five billion for Facebook  Yeah, I mean why not? Yeah, I'm a million. It's not that much  Why not do what GDPR does and charge these people on a percentage of their revenues not their problem  Wouldn't that be a great that way you get all your tech accounting out of the way and companies might actually take it seriously

In other words, we want that on internet that we will be safe on  they also though  we're working with project hope to investigate the topology of the Russian internet and how it connects to other countries networks and  That's kind of interesting because  Earlier this year. You may remember Russia ran tests to disconnect from the rest of the world  And so it's thought that this project hope  Might have been part of that trying to figure out if we wished to  Severitize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So a couple of points first of all, yes, it's a company based in st. Petersburg  But the guy who started it actually was working at Microsoft when he thought of face app in Seattle  You've heard of Washington State. He said well, wait a minute. We don't send the photos to Russia  We do upload them to the server. You do the servers on Amazon Web Services and Google code  Which as any sensible app that makes sense  They did in the license agreement say we own your picture  Forever for all time in any media here to after and we can share it with anybody we give it to anybody  But that's just lazy lawyer boilerplate. That's what I mean

Start time: 726.42
End time: 737.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  I mean if you look in the terms of service for  Basically any app you download that is going to you're going to be uploading content to or from it's gonna say the same thing  There are all these kids signed a waiver to get into our studio

Start time: 737.44
End time: 758.86

Transcript:  That's gives us the right to use their image forever in perpetuity on all media now known or ever  Invented in this time of the universe if you could just leave your passport you all signed that right?  Okay, good because we're showing your face right now. So  On the one hand obviously  This is kind of a crazy response from Senator Schumer and he actually said we got to investigate

Start time: 759.70
End time: 763.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well in cases like this, yes, but this is kind of I mean  They're not taking they're not worried about Google or Facebook or anything else. It's just like the Russians are coming  The Russians are coming. It's I think we can be we can be we can get concerned about  about privacy and private information, but  This it doesn't seem like they're doing that much wrong compared to any other social media firm  I mean parity the expert on this but

Start time: 793.26
End time: 840.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  yeah, I mean it it's seems kind of frankly a  Xenophobic response we've had this sort of outcry when it's related to face app because there is a  Russian involvement and similarly  There was a similar outcry in regards to tick-tock because it has I guess it's Chinese similar policies and it's Chinese  Bloomberg I believe wrote a whole article  Being like, oh what's up with tick-tock this scary Chinese app that's building something for your kids and gonna take your data  It's like listen, I mean all apps are  Taking your data in some way or another probably and especially many of the apps that are targeted at children  I mean, it's good to be aware of these privacy violations, but not solely just for a

Start time: 841.38
End time: 858.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Xenophobic or like ethnic based fear. We should also point out face apps been around for two years  Just it's just now gotten it's a second viral 15 minutes my favorite.

These are all biometric  Identifiers that aren't easily readily changed  You can even change your social but you can't really change, you know  How you look or how your fingerprint works how your DNA is? I'm pretty sure the Kardashians would have  It's the Kardashians may have had their DNA altered with that's unknown  It's sensible to me that people should at least start thinking about this. So I don't I don't kind of mind  The idea it's it's you know, this these warnings go out fairly regularly  Remember when Instagram everybody's freaked out over Instagram saying oh we own your photos and all the professional photographers said  Oh, I never put your photos on Instagram and Instagram changed it because it's just it's default lawyer ease. It's like yeah  Cover your ass. Well, we will just take everything until somebody says something  I don't know if face app is gonna sell pictures of my 88 year old

Transcript:  I mean people had done audio in the I've done audio in the internet before that  But the whole idea of making an RSS feed with a show in it that people could subscribe to and it automatically download that started  When Dave Weiner Adam Curry convinced Dave Weiner to add binary enclosures to RSS  Saying you know that enclosure could be a audio file and then people could subscribe to it  Dave did it and if the fall 2004 a number of people including Dave and Adam  And myself started doing podcasts, so I'm glad to see that it's back  Podcast listeners are going to be like, oh my god  Podcast listenership according to Bloomberg has more than doubled in the last  what is that five years and  Apparently they're worried about Spotify because remember Spotify bought gimlet for a hundred but two hundred ten million two hundred thirty million dollars  And and it's pretty clear Spotify's plan is to have exclusive podcasts produced by glimit gimlet  Which will be available on both the paid and free tier?  Free-tier  And so they'll make money in advertising on the free tier and they'll make money from people paying for it to hear these podcasts  Maybe they'll even be podcasts you have to pay for  This is a model to me. I'm I mean, this is a little inside baseball  So I'll move on but this is a model to me that I see a lot  I think gimlet did this a serial and all that stuff. It's the TV model  See, I think a podcast is radio shows. We're sitting around. We're doing a radio show  But some  Podcast producers think of it as a TV series an audio TV series. So it's gonna have 13 episodes  It's gonna have seasons and I think this is exactly when Apple says we're gonna bankroll original podcasts  That sounds to me like the same model that they're using for their Apple TV plus shows  They're gonna use for podcasts. It won't be as expensive instead of 15 million dollars an episode  It'll be maybe $15 an episode, but they but they'll pay people to do exclusive podcasts  It'll only be available on Apple's whatever platform

It's all the grandstanding  I mean, it doesn't seem to have had any none of these individual hearings have had any direct impact yet  From a congressional perspective  Which I think is kind of telling in and of itself  I mean how many times are we just going to lock all these people in a room with a bunch of tech reporters and  Pretend like something's going to happen Seth.

They have too much ADD to kind of deal with that  I mean I will say about this thing  So Peter teal said one thing and of course, he's a board member of Facebook and he's kind of throwing the dogs over to Google  Like hey look, you know  Google's doing bad stuff. Never mind that big  five-billion-dollar  Thing that we just got and and our stock went up six billion dollars because of it  So he's throwing them off Fox and Friends  Quoted him incorrectly and made all these things about treason and all this other stuff. So Trump of course  Quotes Fox and Friends, which totally miss quoting Peter took off on that. Yeah, right  So, I mean, this is typical. This is typical what happens now and this is you know, our president  You know my feeling is that  The Trump administration wants to send Google kind of a message that hey  We have our crosshairs on you, you know, don't don't go liberal on us or don't you know, I  Feel like there's a lot of in conservative media. There was a lot of talk  The last election about how there was you know, like in Breitbart or whatever that  High-ranking Googlers were very upset about the victory of Donald Trump and I think  the Trump administration wants to send them a

Transcript:  Message that you know, hey, we're watching you. Yeah, we're not gonna do anything, but we are watching  right  there's also the issue that I  Feel like this is this is something there's there's a there's a lot of roiling around on the surface  But let's not forget under the surface  There's a lot of tension between law enforcement and these companies on on two fronts one  At least publicly companies don't seem to be as cooperative with law enforcement as law enforcement would like there's even been rumors that  You know, they'll be talking about encryption backdoors and things like that  Mm-hmm  But on the other hand, I think actually these companies are highly cooperative law enforcement in ways  You know in all sorts of ways and that that a lot of the information  That goes to Google Facebook Amazon  Apple even Apple ends up in the hands of law enforcement anyway  I think and I think law enforcement is reluctant to expose that relationship and doesn't want to want to  Rock the apple cart

Oh, yeah  You go and then there it is  But it's when you start talking encryption backdoors or with the San Bernardino case with Apple where they wanted a custom version of the  Operating system that can allow them to get around this  It was just you know, that's too far and if they break their own encryption to satisfy American law enforcement  They can't sell that encryption around the world anywhere else, right? I mean no one is gonna trust trust their products if they're not actually  Sorted out that way. So there's a lot for the tech companies to lose  But yeah, if they get if you turn up with a warrant doors open

That's a that's pretty severe  That's a severe banning  The company was Ku Tech actually here. They are at the New York Stock Exchange where they are listed  Ringing the final Bell's done to their stock price  BuzzFeed News has a story Craig Silverman that when BuzzFeed and a security company right at evidence  That Ku Tech's apps were bombarding users with disruptive ads even after the company told Google no, no, we stopped doing that  Google investigated there were hundreds of Android apps in the Play Store including the touch pal keyboard apps  60 of those apps have now been removed from the Play Store Ku Tech is completely banned from any Google ad platform buys and  Google says a Google spokesperson said more removals will follow  So  That's malicious behavior Ku Tech's response was our apps have been temporarily disabled  We acknowledge that we have the ability to attract new users and generate revenue from Google ad mob and that may be adversely affected  The actions taken by Google will not affect Ku Tech's existing users or their ability to use the app  How did it affect their stock price? Did you find that?  Let's have a quick look. Yeah  This is the second major Chinese developer to receive a ban by Google this year  That's not good went down a little bit plummeted just a little  All apps from do global a developer half a billion installed in one month.

They've had a few slips over the years, but not money  But the Play Store their automated checking system suck and the amount of malware that's still in there is  Really painfully high for a 30% cut  Is that what the 30% goes to well the 30% is supposed to be on maintenance and marketing and the rest of it  But as an end user, you know, I do feel that you know  If they're charging that much to the developer, then we should be getting some benefit from it, right?

Is it a sensible?  Privacy move to blip to say the government  It's not banning face recognition. No, I mean private companies

Start time: 3536.86
End time: 3598.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, no what it's saying is if you want to set up if law enforcement wants to set up a facial recognition system  Within our city then they have to apply with permission for permission to do so and  Explain exactly how it's gonna work and how you're gonna build privacy into that  That's certainly what they do with San Francisco. That's what they did. I think in Connecticut  You know you if you try and roll this stuff out too quickly then  Things that they're gonna cause problems  As we've saw with the Orlando case this week with with Amazon getting kicked off their off their contract  It is incredibly difficult to make these facial recognition systems work and  Because of problems with training them  They predominantly are accurate for white men and inaccurate for women and people of color  Because that's just what the data sets were largely about  So I think putting a temporary ban on it's fine and asking people to justify their decisions  You can end up with fewer costly mistakes like we've seen in Florida  And frankly, I'm not just not wild about the technology in the first place, but I don't know.

Transcript:  anti, oh  yeah, it just feels like  It's all gonna come crashing down at some point because there's like 300 different types of cryptos  obviously bitcoins that the first and biggest but  There's a lot of different types and you know, very few are tied to real-world value  You know, it would be nice to have a you know, a currency that wasn't based on any nation state  but  You know in particular Facebook's seems particularly troubling because the the company behind it is has been so  Lack of days ago about you know  The foreign act rogue actors not just foreign actors, but you know  Not necessarily folks with the best intentions  using their platform for  Bad things electioneering that kind of stuff. So  You know obviously Facebook if a profits in the crosshairs isn't gonna stand in the way of  Money laundering or terrorism or anything like that? And we know that's how it's gonna go down and  And  You know on the other hand Facebook is a multinational  Corporation they can kind of start this little small, you know the the money thing as a small thing  with you know in other countries and  All of a sudden it's a global currency. So  You know, I think it's a bad bad thing but inevitable the one thing I like about

Transcript:  Facebook and it by the way the whole idea behind  The Libra coin is that it is a consortium of I think as many as a hundred other countries companies  It's run out of Switzerland  It's not just Facebook that may be a smokescreen to keep Facebook's involvement kind of a little bit under the covers  I do though. I can't say I hate the idea of undermining banks  like the the whole the whole thing that that happens with with  Blockchain and crypto is that you don't need a centralized source of truth for who has what money right?  In Bitcoin, there's no central bank. There's no it's completely decentralized. Everybody has the ledger and  You have a source of truth for who owns what it's there been some issues  Libra might solve some of those issues and I can't think of a better group of people to be disintermediated  Than the global banking system  Am I wrong?

Transcript:  That's gonna be quite interesting. I have to say I did feel like a failure in life because  CNBC had a big profile today on the 26 year old woman behind this Morgan Beller  She is one of three people all Facebook employees listed as co-creator of Libra along with  Vice presidents David Marcus and Kevin Wilde since they're vice presidents. I'm thinking she did all the work  This was her this was her doing she's 26  26 new VP at Facebook. She's not a VP. She's but but she apparently  She's a according to CNBC a rather new employee in Facebook's corporate development unit  but she a couple of years ago got very interested in the whole idea of  Cryptocurrency and blockchain and had been really pushing it at Facebook  Beller is known in the blockchain community as the original driving force behind Facebook's push into cryptocurrency  She's on LinkedIn listed as head of strategy for Calibra, which is the the consortium as well as co-creator of Libra coin  So I think that's kind of interesting and what's driving her apparently at least according to CNBC is is this whole notion of  Getting rid of the existing financial system, which really isn't doesn't work for a lot of people in the world and  Making a kind of more democratic money system

Transcript:  55,000 yes, there's the guy who bought the Bitcoin pizza. Mm-hmm like two or three million dollars now  That's the by the way that's there's a couple of significant problems with Bitcoin that presumably Libra coin and others would solve  One is that the complete volatility of it? I mean it goes up and down it was as high as 20,000 for a while  It was back at 7,000. I think it just went down after this Libra coin kind of thing and went down again  The other problem is the blockchain itself the the Bitcoin  Wallet is more than a hundred gigabytes massive  Yeah, and every single person uses Bitcoin if they're using their own local wallet has to store that because that's a distributed ledger  And and then that I guess that really gives rise to the third problem, which is that transactions can take ridiculously long on Bitcoin because  Well, just as kind of the nature of the way that the proof of the proofs are done the Bitcoin miners the amount of power  It requires. Oh, that's another problem. I came up with four problems. It's using more energy than some of the some countries  the Bitcoin miners, yeah

No, I'm sorry  It looks like 230 gigabytes  Yikes so many gigabytes. That's so many. It's all the gigabytes  Somebody saying you can zip it but I don't know but still still that's a lot of data.

This was in the early days. Yeah. Yeah, he's a big deal. It's Bitcoin. He put it on a hard drive  It was at one point worth a million dollars  Turns out he never he wouldn't admit this. He finally admitted to me. He had erased the hard drive  I didn't back up as well back up kids back up your wallet. Yeah. Yeah  That's all I could say he'd erase the heart he erased a million dollars worth of Bitcoin just pay, you know erasing it  As he do as one does did you see this was a good one from Brian Krebs speaking of security  Oh, wow QuickBooks cloud hosting firm in sync  Hidden ransomware attack.

Where did you go to find computer programmers nowhere?  So he was a smart guy. He was he applied to the instrumentation laboratory at MIT  23 year old math major and  They said well math, okay, come on in and he ended up with it with a team writing the software  For the first, you know IC based interactive computer in space if you look at the actual hardware

Transcript:  They just they did look at the source code and they found some some fun whimsy in it  Some of the routine names for instance the ignition sequence was named burn, baby burn  And when the computer wanted to reposition the landing radar antenna the code said I  presumed this is a comment astronaut, please crank the silly thing around and  Then it performed a calculation to determine if the astronaut had moved it correctly called see if he's lying  When the antenna was aimed and the landing could proceed the code said off to see the wizard  Okay. Yeah Easter eggs was still always been a thing then I also want to give credit to a woman named Margaret Hamilton. Yes

Transcript:  Yep, and you'll probably probably seen the picture of her with the with the source code printed out on a picture on the  reams of paper as tall as she was  She she's now you may I don't know if you remember but you'll if you listen to the landing you'll hear at one point  As the lunar module is trying to come down  Neil Armstrong say we have a 1202 error  There's the picture of her with the the reams the huge printout of all the code. Oh my goodness  What's a 1202 error Armstrong asks?  and  Nobody knew what the 1202 error is she knew  She was sitting along with other programmers and engineers  Because she wrote the alarm codes including the 1202 code. She says they were this is also in the Wall Street Journal  They were never supposed to happen alarms. I was in a state of shock  I mean, they're literally minutes from landing on the moon. They are in the lunar module  How could this be happening just before the landing? I'm thinking. Oh my god, this is not real  but to their credit  They had written the 1202 in it was a signal that the computer had been overloaded  But and this is this such a great story  It had been designed if it if its RAM was full to start dumping unimportant tasks in order to keep flying safely  and that's what 1202 was and 1202 kept happening and Armstrong said what is going on and  Eventually and you can hear this on the recordings the flight director Gene Krantz says to him. It's okay. You're go  Because they said oh no, this is this you're not supposed to see this error there was there was  Something a switch had been flipped wrong at some point and and data was being dumped into the computer  But the computer was handling it properly that 1202 error reset the computer  They continued to land they landed safely  and I think a lot of credit goes to Margaret Hamilton and  The team and many many many people yeah at MIT and NASA who who had written this code  So I there is absolutely a story to be told around this Apollo 11 landing and if you use a computer today with  Microprocessors you have them all of that. Yeah. Yeah. Thank you can thank Margaret Hamilton and  And what an amazing team?  Including the young Don Isles

Transcript:  The shift New York Times earlier this week it actually this is yeah, this is gonna be interesting on the VidCon  When the first tick-tock star is elected president writes Kevin ruse who's great. I  Hope she'll save some room in her cabinet for older and more conventional  bureaucrats even if they don't have millions of followers great hair or amazing dance moves I  Say when not if because I just spent three days at VidCon  Hanging out with a few thousand current and future internet celebrities and it's becoming increasingly obvious to me the teenagers and 20-somethings who have mastered these  Platforms and who are often dismissed as shallow preening narcissists by adults who don't know any better are gonna dominate  Not just internet culture or the entertainment industry, but society as a whole Paris you live in this world you agree

Start time: 6053.44
End time: 6093.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

It's not  relegated to I don't know one part of the world be it like beauty or entertainment or  Even culture and generally it is an all-encompassing way in which people

Transcript:  Interact with consume and create content interact with each other. I kind of blame myself because  inevitably when we talk about influencers we talk about Logan Paul we talk about  Kim Kardashian we talk about kind of the outliers the weirdos the strange people the dubious stunts the  extreme political commentary things like that, but ruse points out he said  That you know many of these people are  Entrepreneurs they they have they've set up businesses. They're hiring staff. They're managing budget  They know you know  This is a business for a lot of these people and the skills is completely transferable to running the world in 20 or 30 years  Is AOC does she count as maybe she counts a little bit as one of the first influencers in Congress?  She certainly knows how to use Twitter fix. She gave classes in Twitter to  Her older colleagues as I remember I still this is a definition

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been trying to figure out lately is I mean, how do we define influencer?  I think the thing that separates influencers from celebrities or  other kind of  mainstream figures kind of in the limelight in society is that influencers come up  through and gain like notoriety through  Social like posting on some sort of platform or creating content in some sort of space originally kind of for a  non like  Originally in a way that is not monetizable they have this kind of air of authenticity  Meanwhile like celebrities they come they get notoriety and gain fame because they are participating in more of an established industry  And celebrities can be influencers and influencers can be so I have three years right I mean yeah when you go to Japan

Thank that's it. I was he was everywhere  He's made of anyway actually roost points this out. He said influencers have been running the world for years  Can you say President Ronald Reagan?  We just haven't called him influencers we've called them movie stars or talk radio host or Davos and Ted knees  And and honestly, I think you could probably point at the president as there is the boss  Tommy Lee Jones  He is its boss coffee  Which by the way the boss coffee logo see if you can find the one where he's riding the inner tube the boss coffee logo is  Is it is like the the guy with the pipe from the?  slack religion  Slack religion Joe Bob. What's his name? J Bob Dobbs J Robert Dobbs?  It looks just like J Robert Dobbs. I'm sorry. I'm I'm this is Leo being an old influencer  President Trump is an influencer right who he is he used you Twitter  No, he great effect used Facebook better than any candidate  Mm-hmm you could really make the I think a very credible claim that he won not because of Russian influencer election fraud or  Electoral the Electoral College, but because he used Facebook incredibly effectively

It's interesting point about the interchangeability that you made personal on celebrities and  Influencers I  Don't know how you feel about this, but we were talking in the office  We occasionally will get some like would you like to promote my product and in return?  I'll give you a shout out on my Instagram thing those just come across as complete pillocks  But at what point does someone become an influencer on is it reaching a certain regular number of social media hits per post?  Or is it just the effect that they have I?

Transcript:  Think that the term influencer at least as we kind of have used it for the last years or the last couple of years is  intrinsically tied to  Capitalism and intrinsically tied to purchasing power and specifically the ability to influence or sway the buying habits or actions or  Kind of beliefs and trends of others  Because I mean predominantly when we're talking about influencers, these are people who are  Making money and a career and a life out of being able to  produce content in some way and they generally finance that career by  brand promotions or merch sales or any of the these kind of  Entrepreneurial I guess you could say efforts in order to  Fund an over a unrelated probably  channel or sort of content promotion, which is the one thing that does  That does split influencers from  Political figures or people who have a general influencer political power in a more tangential sense  I

Transcript:  That's why brands love them so much. I guess from an advertising dollar perspective  Much better for advertisers and celebrity endorsements are kind of meaningless in comparison to very specific  influencer type advertising because okay, if you're trying to  Target an audience you can say oh, yeah, I'll  Have this celebrity promote my hair product, right?  Some of their followers probably like this big oh I can go to this one hair product specific  Instagram account where everyone here is talking about hair. I know I'm gonna reach the people who matter the most these are my customers

Transcript:  That's actually the same thing that  People do with Facebook ads a Facebook ad spent tends to be hundred bucks two hundred bucks very small  But a great many of them because you're targeting very narrow slices  Yeah, and I would imagine this the same thing with influencers the problem with that if you're proctor and gamble  And you want to spend a hundred million dollars on influencers  It's hard to spend it a hundred bucks at a time. Is there a is there a burgeoning system for making this work?

Start time: 6574.28

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it ages? There are a lot of like mini markets and agencies  for middle tier influencers not ones with like tens of millions generally they  On  YouTube or Instagram there are a bunch of different companies that exist where influencers can sign up  Kind of operates like a mini marketplace. They sign up put their interests  things that they're interested in and then brands also will put their interests as well as  Put out campaign offers and the agency kind of acts  You know as a broker between the two and then they form a campaign from that  Which in some cases can happen more of an automated scale if you want to do it more simply and in other cases can be more  Can produce a more bespoke form of advertising? So Texas is too  Yeah, the one difference though as far as influencer marketing versus something like Facebook is that most people don't  when you see  What I guess would be an ad or sponsored product through an influencer most people don't think of it as an  Advertisement in the same way that they would if you see a Facebook ad you're gonna be like, oh this is an ad  It's meaningless. I'm not going to look at it very purposefully if you notice it at all  But when it's your favorite influencer talking about how much you love this product
