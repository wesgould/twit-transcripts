Start time: 307.99
End time: 331.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it wanted to be a comedy, but failed.  Yes.  So Ian has been so dapper, because he's been dressing up for his daily editorial meetings  on the register and posting these crazy pictures on Facebook and Instagram.  And this is the mustache, I guess, is part of that.  And then you were formal and then you said we should...  And I think, Amy, you said we should all be formal.  Yep.

Start time: 332.20
End time: 335.82

Start time: 356.38
End time: 383.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the whole thing kicked off because after about day four or five, my standards  really slipped.  I started off the video news meeting in the morning and I was wearing a sweatshirt.  I hadn't washed my hair at all, it wasn't even combed.  And there were some justifiable comments that I was letting the side down.  Oh dear.  So then I wore this and then I started dressing up.  It got slightly weird last week with the girl with the pearl earring stuff, but it was...  That was great.

Start time: 383.80
End time: 394.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the girl with the pearl earring.  I found the Photoshop slightly disturbing.  Did you post it on Instagram too?  Let me see if I can pull it out.

Start time: 394.49
End time: 411.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, just on Twitter.  I don't have an Instagram account.  But yeah, that was a friend of mine who was just a whiz with Photoshop or Gimp or whatever  it was he was using and changed it around and it was disturbing.  Yeah.  Even my mother was slightly freaked out.

Start time: 412.99
End time: 415.00

Start time: 434.20
End time: 436.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  it wasn't going to do it.  Oh no, you didn't try to redo the hole, did you?

Start time: 437.46
End time: 444.34

Start time: 458.32
End time: 461.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 470.55
End time: 482.76

Start time: 483.73
End time: 486.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Start time: 487.78
End time: 498.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is nearly eight weeks growth though.  And I think my lip's too thin.  It looks like I should have a top hat on and be tying young women to railway tracks going,  aha, my pretty, I have you now.

Start time: 499.58
End time: 512.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's very, no, it's kind of nivenesque.  I think it's good.  I think it's really good.  Yeah, I don't know how long.  How is your side doing, Amy, during the shelter in place?  Where are you these days?

Start time: 513.42
End time: 541.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I left, so we've got a place in New York and a place in Baltimore.  New York, I did not want to ride this through there.  So we're in Baltimore and my team is all working remote.  And we've actually been, everybody wants to know the future and what to do.  Yeah.  It's been a very, very, very busy couple of weeks.  I've been working 18 hour days.  Wow.  You're kidding.  But I'm happy to do it.  No.

Start time: 542.20
End time: 543.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're working harder because of this.

Start time: 543.57
End time: 592.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  I mean, most, so contrary to what a lot of people understand about what futurists do,  we don't just look out into the far future.  We also look, I mean, the future is sort of always, right?  So we're trying to figure out now what do global supply chains look like in three months?  What are the next order impacts of a federated approach to people going back to school and to work?  And what liability challenges does that trigger?  And like all the stuff that's happening with privacy and tech has massive,  huge implications for regulation and consumer sector and all this stuff.  So I've, you know, we're just building model after model after model.

Start time: 592.30
End time: 596.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And, you know, it's only really one thing I'd like to know.  And that's when will the McRib be back?

Start time: 599.75
End time: 600.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that an annual thing?

Start time: 601.28
End time: 605.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. It's unpredictable.  That's the beauty of it.  You never, I think, never know.

Start time: 605.20
End time: 609.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The president, if anybody's going to know, or if you know this, right?

Start time: 611.03
End time: 612.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're not an epidemiologist.

Start time: 612.62
End time: 617.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm not an epidemiologist, but how do you?

Start time: 617.36
End time: 642.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's the question.  I mean, so the one question everybody says is, well, what's, you know, what's the medical prognosis?  And even the epidemiologists don't know.  In fact, the WHO just put out a thing saying, you know, everybody's counting on the golden ticket,  the, you know, the certification that you you've had it and you're immune.  But you shouldn't count on that, folks, because we don't know yet if you're immune.  So this whole idea of having antibodies may not even work.

Start time: 642.62
End time: 756.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So something I guess I will just announce that I haven't told anybody yet.  I think it's probably OK.  My next book. So the book that I wrote that came out last year was out on AI.  The next book that I started writing before that other book came out is about the future of synthetic biology.  And a lot of it has to do with viruses.  So my publisher is like, hey, could we get that manuscript now?  Let's get that out now.  So viruses are a virus is kind of like a USB stick, you know, and unlike if you shove a USB stick into your computer, stuff comes out, you know, maybe good, maybe bad, maybe malware,  maybe a benevolent system that can fix like broken code.  It's a it's a it's a way of transmitting code.  And really, that's what a virus is.  It's just code. It's it's a way of transmitting code.  And of course, the problem is we don't know, you know, like Linux is complicated, like computer systems are like easy, but but in some ways, super, super complicated.  And you don't always know how if you if you install something new, how that might have next order impacts on all the other parts of your machine.  Right. So we don't know what the bugs look like yet with this particular virus, I think is the problem.  And we're not going to know because and this is kind of interesting.  This is why supercomputers have been in the news a lot because they're trying to crunch numbers on what are all the different ways that this virus could impact given all of these different variables.  And if we introduce these types of medications, it's just it's just like it's a compute problem at this point more than anything else.

Start time: 757.38
End time: 762.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Interesting. What an interest. That's how I think that's your that's your particular slant on it.

Start time: 762.72
End time: 788.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And yeah, yeah, yeah. I mean, I'm yeah, I don't have a my background's game theory, not biology.  So I don't I don't know. And I think part of the problem is there's a lot of the other problem that we're dealing with is this like infodemic where there's all this information coming at us from every different direction.  It's hard to tell what's believable and what's credible. And, you know, it's just really challenging.

Start time: 788.30
End time: 810.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I've never had to have bullshit filters up quite so high. I mean, it's the amount of conflicting evidence to come with.  First off, if you've got it, you're immune. Now, if you've got it, you're probably not immune.  You might have three to five percent of people might have enough antibodies to give them limited resistance.  They're now apparently spitting off Tom Hanks's blood for antibodies. You knew that was coming.

Start time: 812.73
End time: 869.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And everybody wants to know, does that mean will we also be better people after the injection? That would be nice.  But it's just in typewriters. But yes, obviously, you know, I think the thing is because this is such a new virus and we know so little about it, we can't say it behaves the same way as the flu or a cold or other coronaviruses.  So and I guess people like me think, well, golly, we ought to be able to find out pretty quickly. Right.  And so we're all a little frustrated by the time frame of this. But it you don't know right away.  So what the WHO said, I should clarify it, is that it's certainly no evidence it confers a lifetime immunity.  But there may be some limited immunity.  I guess they were really concerned that some governments were poised to start offering get out of jail free cards if you had, you know, the antibodies and they were.  Yeah, that wouldn't be a very good idea.

Start time: 870.07
End time: 882.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It also kind of blows a hole in this whole herd immunity rubbish.  You know, it's just like, oh, well, if we all just get it and we'll get it out the way and everything will be fine.  That's not how it's going to work. It seems you need to test, isolate and kill it, just like other countries.

Start time: 883.36
End time: 920.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Amy, do you consider what the human reaction to this will be?  Because this is the thing that seems most unpredictable to me. Humans are infinitely chaotic.  And and so, for instance, as I'm walking around Petaluma in the last couple of days, I noticed fewer people wearing masks, more people kind of hanging out at bars.  I feel like we're and you look at the beach pictures from Southern California, from Huntington Beach.  I feel like we're rapidly all of us approaching that point where we throw up our hands and say, I can't take it.  I don't care what happens. I'm going out.  Can you can you can't predict that, though? We don't know. Right.

Start time: 921.86
End time: 997.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. So part of the problem is that everybody is looking for two answers.  One is what is the new normal? And two is when is the new normal?  And as a futurist, I always say, well, what would it take for X to be Y?  What would it take for us to get from now to the new normal? And how long would that take?  So I don't actually think people are asking about what is the new normal.  I think people are really saying, when is my life going to have less change coming at it from every direction all day long?  And for that reason, we have to remember that people are capricious.  So you may see people obeying rules one day and not another day.  And what drives a break in that behavior? You can't like the behavioral predictions are really, really hard.  And you can have all the social data that you want and you can have all the behavioral biometric data that you want.  Ultimately, what causes us to continue to change our minds is pretty unknown.  So in a place like China, where you've got a top down regime, very authoritarian, a digital health passport works,  like people sort of stay in the lines, they color in the lines, that is totally not going to work in most places around the world.

Start time: 999.60
End time: 1010.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a FOMO element among Westerners anyway, where we see somebody walking around.  Doesn't matter if they've got a golden ticket. I want to walk around too.  Yeah, I mean, it's so yeah.

Start time: 1011.84
End time: 1081.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry, I'm just saying I mean, there are some I've been doing some reading up over the over the last couple of weeks.  There are some fascinating historical parallels with where we were with the influenza epidemic.  A hundred years ago in 1919 in San Francisco, there was an anti mask league.  You know, we haven't really advanced that much in the last century.  Funny. I read that.  Yeah. And in one case, a San Francisco policeman shot and killed someone who was obviously sick and not wearing a mask wasn't prosecuted.  I don't think we're going to get to that level, nor should we.  But, you know, I mean, there are some fascinating parallels in that, you know, we're still quite dumb about these things.  And, you know, I don't think the lockdown is going to work in itself unless we sort of test and isolate.  But it's certainly we're getting there.  And I agree with Amy.  I mean, China's situation just isn't going to cut it in the U.S.  I mean, we're lucky.  We are at least lucky.  You know, we are the three of us can work from home.  You know, if you were if you work in a hospital or a grocery store or you're an Uber driver, you are out of luck at the moment.  Yeah. So, I mean, I'm I'm trying to keep keep down on the oh, it's so terrible because at least, you know, absolutely.

Start time: 1081.26
End time: 1100.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here we are sitting in evening clothes.  You know, that seems unseemly, but we're just trying to cheer each other up.  That's right. Yeah.  And I don't think any of us is insensate to the horrible suffering that is occurring not just in the U.S., but all over the world because of it.

Start time: 1100.28
End time: 1140.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to tell you when we however this whole thing happened over Twitter, I've really been I haven't I've really looked forward to this whole, you know, and me too.  I look forward to seeing you guys in.  And I think that's to me that's sort of analogous to what a lot of people are going through.  Life is slower and smaller than it was before.  And so I think if we can keep finding moments, small moments of joy, I mean, that would be a nice after effect of this is chasing incremental moments of joy.  You know, that would probably put us all in a better place going forward.

Start time: 1141.80
End time: 1158.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we've all become misinformation fake news machines because we all have our opinions and we all have we all pick and choose our stories.  And we all are trying to figure out what's going on.  So I'm going to leave it to the expert, Amy, and let you do all the prognosis.

End time: 1178.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's hard because, well, Ian, you you looked back to the last time this happened.  And and certainly there are some analogies, but also it was a very different time in 1918.  I mean, the world was a very different place.

Start time: 1178.98
End time: 1204.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I mean, can you imagine if this had hit 25 years ago before we had the Internet?  Right. You know, I mean, it would it would have been catastrophically worse because at least there are some people that can work from home.  We've got decent communications with our friends and family through Skype and online social media and the rest of it.

Transcript:  Some of my family and friends and even colleagues are posting on Facebook.  One of the things that was interesting, Larry Magid posted he was at CES came back.  CES, this is January, came back deathly ill.  And now we're learning that antibody tests have shown that there were people at CES who had covid-19.  Everybody it's very common to come back from the Consumer Electronics Show ill with the flu or with a cold.  I did not. But a lot.  But Larry tagged me because we had met up.  He tagged all the people he met that he could remember that he met at CES and asked them.  And a great many of them suffered very similar symptoms to covid-19.  The worst flu I've ever had.  I could barely move that kind of thing.  And so there's some question now I thought we dodged a bullet.  I thought, boy, if this had emerged a couple of months earlier out of China, CES would have been a disaster movie.  But maybe it was just a slow moving disaster movie.

And again, I had the week after I had the worst flu of my life.  I had to turn down a twit because I had coughed myself so hoarse I could barely speak.  And I haven't been that sick in a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So again, but like, what does that mean?  What are people right?  So I think the challenge is, so I'm actually going for a test tomorrow for an antibody test.  Oh, wow.  I think I was probably an early community spread case in New York.  And I never the problem is nobody would give me a test.  I was the other I was sick at CES years and years ago.  And then I got horribly ill at the end of February and I couldn't I had asthma as a kid and I still have it got extra exercise, induced asthma.  Now, I couldn't breathe.  Anyhow, so I'm going in to get a test tomorrow.  And it's a little like I'm kind of in a like Schrodinger situation because I'm working with the assumption now that I've had it and I'm feeling great.  You know, like the golden ticket, somebody that I know did test positive and we were in close contact.  And since I haven't been sick since I just did the math and in a way knowing that he tested positive.  And then me doing the math.  I felt the sense of relief that I cannot describe.  I've been living with that relief.  I've still been taking all the precautions, but just, you know, a sense of calm.  I'm going to go in for this test tomorrow.  And then what's on the other side of it?  Will you be horrifically disappointed if you that's what I'm well, you know, there are the false negative rate, the false positive rate on the covid test is low.  The false positive rate on the antibody test is high.  Yeah.

Start time: 1448.02

Transcript:  So I don't know what I there are both as I've I've read that there are some some number of covid tests that received that emergency dispensation.  The FDA has been offering, which means I don't I guess I gather that they're not as thoroughly tested as one would hope.  And there have been in all of the tests, some number of false positives and false negatives.  So how reliable is the test is one question.  What does it even mean if you have the antibodies is another question.  And and what does it mean regarding, you know, I told my son who came back from Bali and seven days later got pretty sick.  Well, you probably had it.  And if you test positive for the antibodies, you can get a job.  Congratulations.  You can work anywhere in the world because you'll be magic.  Right.  Or really, that's a concern.

Start time: 1497.38
End time: 1567.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I worry a lot that we are entering this strange new stratification between those who have tested and can prove that they've got antibodies and those that don't.  And and if this winds up protracted over the next, you know, 12 to 24 months, which it very likely could, I'm going to have privileges.  I already have privileges, but I'm going to have the people who have the antibodies.  Are going to be a privileged class in whatever country, wherever they happen to be living.  And I think that that's going to cause a lot of psychological problems.  I think that's going to cause it's going to help potentially restart our economy, but it's also going to cause a lot of social unrest.  I mean, I I don't know.  I don't know.  I'm concerned about the I think in the one hand, like making getting the antibody test good and giving it to everybody,  and focusing a lot on that, or as much on that as we are a vaccine is important.  But I don't know what to do about this.  Like two classes of society, those who have been infected and those who haven't.

Transcript:  Well, that's one thing this is definitely brought to light is the vast inequalities in American society, at least.  And that's just going to be one more.  And I think that's one of the reasons the who when I say the who I think of the World Health Organization put out.  Put out that letter because they want on Friday or Saturday because they really didn't want countries to go around giving people these gold stars that were on their forehead.  Yeah. Yeah.  This is it's a really interesting time.  And one of the reasons I wanted to have you on Amy is besides I missed you, but is because this is kind of the meat that you deal with all the time.  But you're in a unique position now during a massive crisis where everybody's trying to predict the future.  But how how how accurate can your crystal ball be?  I mean, what kind of what's the level of information you give people?  What do you say to them?  This is Ford, for instance, is trying to figure out, do we are we going to have cars to sell in the fall?  Will there be customers at all?  Should we make them?  Should we? What should we do?

Start time: 1636.25
End time: 1842.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes. Yes, I'm familiar with those questions at Ford.  I bet you are.  So so here's what you do.  We we have this like little diagram.  I'll post later somewhere, but it's a cone, a futurist.  So I I my job is not about predictions.  It's about preparation.  And that's not a hedge.  That's just acknowledging the complications of multivariate equations.  Right. We'd like we're dealing with too many variables.  So so instead of using a timeline to mark between now and the future, we use a cone.  And the further out in time you go, the more uncertainty there is.  Therefore, we have a wider spectrum of possibilities.  But whatever we do in the near term, we have to do thinking about downstream implications.  And we also have to imagine a plausible future state and reverse engineer that back today.  And the analogy that I've been using a lot is one that maybe you the two of you don't have to deal with where you live.  But I do. And that's driving on a slippery ice covered road.  So anybody who's been behind the wheel and I grew up in the Midwest.  So like part of learning how to drive is you have to prove you can drive on ice.  If you're driving along and you hit a patch of ice, the instinct that we have is to slam on the brakes.  And of course, that's the wrong thing to do.  But and I think everybody sort of understands that.  But it's good to ask why.  And the reason is because if we slam on the brakes, you could theoretically steer the car to safety if you were in charge of every single variable.  If you knew exactly what the PSI of all four of those tires were, you knew exactly how tight the transmission and the gear shift and everything else was.  You knew exactly what the incline was.  Basically, you had to be like omniscient. But we're not.  So instead, when you hit an icy patch, you're supposed to steer into the slide, which feels wrong.  But you do that while looking at the road ahead.  And and that sort of slows down what's happening to me.  That situation is analogous to the one that we're in right now.  So there's all this like all these data coming in from everywhere, right, which is kind of like being on this road where you're sliding out of control.  And the issue is everybody wants to slam on the brakes and go back to normal, right, which is where we get all of these.  How soon does the economy reopen? How soon do we go back to school?  And instead, what we have to do is to kind of like lean into uncertainty.  We have to be totally open to everything being different at all times right now because we're in the middle of it while keeping an eye on the road ahead and steering into that direction.  What I'm noticing is we're very consumed with what's happening right now because it's a crisis, which I totally understand.  But I don't see enough people with one eye on the road ahead steering us into a direction.  And I think that's the biggest problem that we're facing right now, even though I know the immediate problems feel much more acute.  And that's when you look at what Google and Apple are doing with they're not calling it contact tracing.  They're now calling it something else with Bluetooth.  And the fact that all of that came out of the private sector and we don't know what the road ahead looks like, or even if having all of those data, what does that really do?

Start time: 1843.96
End time: 1945.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it's sensible to do it just in case we can use it, right?  Well, I don't know.  Let's take a break because this is, of course, one of the big topics we've been discussing all week, which is the Google, Apple API.  That's going to be pushed out and eventually an app, perhaps.  And in fact, in Europe, there's been some pushback.  France said, we want more data.  Apple said you can't use Bluetooth if you exfiltrate the data.  You can't keep the data.  France is upset about that.  Germany at first said we're not going to do it either for the same reason.  Now they've come along and said, OK, as of today, Germany said, yeah, we'll use this API.  A lot of privacy advocates are very concerned that this could be used against us down the road.  Google and Apple have released a number of follow up white papers.  In fact, they've even changed the algorithms a little bit to say it's, you know, the data will be destroyed at the end of this.  So this is a big battle going on.  And honestly, I think that the Google Apple solution is better than the one proposed by the Pan European Commission, which is much more data intrusive.  Ironically, given that the GDPR came out of the EU.  So there's a lot to talk about here.  And I think we have two very good people to do it.  Ian Thompson from the register.co.uk.  Thank you for being here today.  We really appreciate it.  Always a pleasure.  Mr. Bond.  And and to there's actually no no bond woman's name that I could give you without insulting you.

Transcript:  I think it might be the best.  I was a doctor.  No fan.  But anyway, well, that's for we could talk about that, too.  But let's take a little break.  I show today brought to you by Extra Hop.  They originally started out as a way to monitor your network for performance.  It turns out when monitoring for performance, and this is not just your local network,  but the cloud everywhere all the way to your end user.  You also can learn a lot about threats.  More and more companies going fully remote.  The bad guys are out there ready to take advantage of this.  So it's more important than ever for organizations to really see everything active in their  enterprise from the cloud all the way down to the IOT devices employees are using to  do their jobs from home.  Remember the NASA employee that brought a Raspberry Pi into the NASA network and caused  a data breach because he said, well, I just want to bring my Raspberry Pi in.  These are the kinds of things you need to know.  And since many of your employees are working at home, you need to know about everything  in their environment too.  In order to protect and scale your business, you need more than just visibility.  You need fast, reliable, actionable information about threats and remote access problems.  You need it in context so that you can do something about it.  And that's what Extra Hop does.  It helps you detect threats and performance issues 95% faster and respond 60% more efficiently.  You'll get complete visibility on every asset in real time and at scale.  In fact, I want to invite you to go to ExtraHop.com slash twit.  They've got a demo dashboard so you can see what that data in real time looks like and  how you're going to be able to see it and act on it.  You can secure your enterprise.  Everybody's enterprise is now hybrid wherever it is today, wherever it goes tomorrow, automatically  detect new rogue and unmanaged IOT devices.  See everything in your environment from the cloud to the data center all the way to the  customer.  And there are a lot of people, a lot of people using Extra Hop now.  In fact, they're getting some real love.  I'll give you an example.  Wizards of the Coast, their chief architect, Dan McDaniel, they're using it for their AWS  cloud.  McDaniel said, there is no other company, this is a direct quote, that aligns to supporting  the DevOps model, the speed and the lack of friction than Extra Hop.  He loves it.  The Home Depot is using Extra Hop to manage and secure 2,300 remote sites because they  say there is no data set more complete and accurate than the data set we get from Extra  Hop.  These are real users getting real benefit in a very challenging environment.  Now is the time to take control of your cloud security.  Extra Hop, E-X-T-R-A-H-O-P.  They've got a lot of resources at the website.  You can get tips on securing and supporting remote access.  And as I said, that incredible full product demo, which is just fun to watch.  It's really cool.  ExtraHop.com slash twit.  Take a look.  I think you'll find this is exactly what you've been looking for.  ExtraHop.com slash twit.  We thank them for their support in this difficult time.  All of our sponsors are extra special to us right now.  And we thank you for supporting us by going there.  ExtraHop.com slash twit.  So the Google Apple proposal is, I think, in many ways superior to and more trustworthy  than something a government would propose.  And everything's flipped on its head these days.  But it's pretty clear governments, or at least it's certainly a reasonable fear that governments  might use this kind of data gathering just as they use the Patriot Act long after 9-11  to invade our personal privacy and security.  It's a great opportunity.  And I think with companies like Google and Apple, whom I think you can reasonably say  not only have great technical expertise, but also have a great interest in security and privacy.  Certainly Apple does.  You might debate about Google's interest in privacy.  But I think they do.  And it's tip top security experts.  I think I trust something from Google and Apple more than I would trust anything offered by France  or Germany or the US government.  Ian, you disagree?

Start time: 2237.61
End time: 2261.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, I kind of agree and disagree.  Apple and Google, I actually trust to be reasonably safe with their data.  Because with Apple's case, that's their selling point.  With Google's place, that's kind of a commitment they've made.  The one company name that we're missing out on is Palantir.  Palantir has been given contracts by the US government and by EU states as well to do roughly the same sort of thing.  My point exactly.

He was hanging around outside.  I mean, I've got a New Zealand tech journal friend who's just saying,  awful lot of private flights came into New Zealand just before the ban came in.

Transcript:  But coming back to what you were saying about sort of data handling.  On one level, having a COVID tracking app like that could be incredibly useful.  But in and of itself, it's not going to do that much.  You've got to if you tie it down with isolation and with dealing with infection in, you know, in isolated units, then it could be useful.  But just having a tracking app on your phone the whole time that tells you you may or may not.  It comes back to the false positive thing that you were talking about, Amy.  I mean, the amount of potential false positives and panic this could cause.  I'm not sure if it's worth, you know, because we can't enforce it.  I'm not sure if it's actually worth going ahead.

Start time: 2453.56
End time: 2626.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I agree. And so this is the so here's my what I'm seeing happening.  And I think Leo made an excellent point, which is, I mean, really, we're faced with a fundamental question of our time, which is, who do we trust?  Do we trust our government structures, which have given us a lot of reason to mistrust them?  Or do we trust our technology companies, which we which don't always offer the level of transparency and traceability and explainability that we may ask of them?  Now, there's no question that Apple's differential privacy work is above and beyond everybody else's.  You know, they made some, I think, early there was a little bit of an early mistake, at least on the Apple Google partnership with how they were doing encryption, which I think has kind of been shored up.  But the real question here is, what is the point?  So in China, you know, they have you can move about, but you are scanned.  There is a code and you have to show that code, which theoretically could be spoofed, maybe to move around.  This is an opt in system in the United States.  We don't know exactly what happens with the metadata from Bluetooth transmissions.  We don't exactly know where the oversight is going to lie.  I mean, if it's something that's being built by Palantir for government, there's a government structure in the GAO to do accountability and auditing after the fact.  But in the private sector, we don't have that.  We just have the market.  And so in a free market economy, the market's going to tell us whether or not this was a success or a failure.  But in the middle of all this, who owns the database of people who have tested positive?  And that really begs the question, who owns our genetic data?  Is it us?  I mean, we don't really have legal answers to those questions in the U.S. or the EU at the moment.  And so to Ian's excellent point, then what does all of it matter?  So like, fine, you get a beep and somebody tells you that you've maybe come into contact.  Now what?  There's no vaccine.  You may or may not be able to get an antibody test.  You know, you may have found out that information because it's opt-in at any point.  So you don't know if the person that you've come into contact with tested positive two months ago and you maybe just saw them yesterday.  There's a temporal element here that's like super, super important.  Otherwise, the data are just like sometimes more data is not good.  It's just more.  And it could seed misunderstanding and confusion and fear.  And at the moment, I think what we could use is a shot of confidence and, you know, maybe not the bleach, but definitely a shot of confidence.  Isn't it?

Start time: 2627.46
End time: 2658.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, one thing that we've got to keep in mind is that and again, I'm not an epidemiologist.  I don't even have to say that out loud, but I'll say it anyway, that we don't have to be perfect.  We just have to reduce the infection rate, the R naught of the virus.  If we can get it below one, then we can it will it will slow down and die out.  And so any solution doesn't have to be universally adopted.  It doesn't have to be perfect.  It just has to be effective enough that you reduce the communicability.  Yeah.

Start time: 2659.54
End time: 2678.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I'm not an epidemiologist, but I am married to a doctor.  And what I and what I believe is happening is we just have to wait for the virus to.  In the virus running its course, everybody is going to get infected.  So we just have to sort of slow this all down so that everybody can get infected.  Who's going to get infected?

Start time: 2678.34
End time: 2701.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I don't want to get infected because the more now maybe this is propaganda, but there's been a lot of stories lately about how devastating this is.  People getting young people having strokes, damage to organs like the liver and the heart besides the lungs, long term consequences, even if you survive, it doesn't sound like a good illness to get.  No, it does. I mean, again, I I would agree.

Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the analogy I heard of the old flat and the curved thing.  Yeah, go ahead.  Well, I mean, it's the problem is unless you're willing to take the kind of steps that China has, which I don't think America is, then you're going to have to accept there is going to be a pool of people out there who are constantly spreading on and spreading on.  It's kind of like a swimming pool.  You can't have a no peeing section of the swimming pool and expect that to stay pure.  If the water is going backwards and forwards and we're all going to get it.  So, I mean, unless you're actually willing to take a medical approach, lock down, isolate, backtrace the people, which would at this point would just be a colossal task, which I don't think Americans are going to stand for.  Then honestly, I don't see an awful lot of until we get a vaccine then that works, then we're all going to be at risk for the next year or so.  As far as I can see.

We can't we muster the full might of human ingenuity to think our way through this problem in terms that aren't binary?  Isn't there a future that involves vaccines and antibody tests and a bunch of other things?  Couldn't I mean, couldn't somebody design a better mask?  Couldn't we figure out some other way to do meaningful information spread and data collection in a way that's not half-assed?  Well, it feels like that is happening though.

Start time: 2857.24

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is distributed.  So you keep track of the contacts you've made on your phone.  And if you test positive, that data is sufficient to reverse to tell those people without telling them about you.  But you're maintaining it.  There's no set as far as I could tell.  There's no central database of who met who when.  And Apple, by the way, and Google have in an addendum said we will destroy this data as soon as it's over.  This data is not going to be preserved because it could be reverse engineered at some point if you get the whole database.  But I think the whole I think this is quite clever.  In other words, I think they've very cleverly thought of a way to do this, minimizing the privacy.  I worry, though, a little bit.  It sounds like I sounds like people are saying, look, we're all going to get it.  We're just trying to slow it down.  We're all going to get it.  And what they're leaving out is because at some point it's got to be back to business as usual.  Does it have to be?  I don't know.

Listen, I'm politically independent, staunchly so.  However, I am always in favor of smart people in charge of things.  And we have a situation where we just don't have the right people.  We don't have decisive leadership.  I think it's super interesting that in the United States, we're reverting back to a 300-year-old model where we've got regional authorities versus a  strong national authority.  And it's really...  This is kind of a similar model to what's happening in Europe, which sort of neuters the promise and position of the executive branch in the United States.  I don't know.

I mean, I get what you're saying, Amy.  There is this breakdown now, and particularly in the last couple of weeks between state and federal governments,  where you've had positions where states have ordered medical supplies, PPE, masks, the rest of it.  And when they've ordered them, paid for them, they've turned up, the federal government has seized them and rooted them Lord knows where.  There is some really, really weird stuff going on in American politics at the moment.  And as a foreigner, I have to say I'm finding it slightly...  trying to keep up with where this is going.  You've always had this, it seems, this contrast between the state, the friction between the states and the federal government,  but it's really coming to the fore right now.

And that is, you know, when we are all sharing a common problem that's acute and needs attention,  you either need a very strong logistics network running the show or you need a strong leader running the show.  And the problem in the United States is that we neither have decisive top-down leadership  nor a central authority that's running like point on all of this.  There was a sort of awful story that I read, I think, in the New Yorker.  It might have been the Times.  No, it wasn't.  It was an opinion piece that Vint Cerf shared with me on Medium that I will try to find because it was great,  that explained the problem that we're in is not that we, it's not because we weren't prepared.  It was because there were too many preparation plans and nobody knew which one to use.  Let me see if I can find it.  That's interesting.

I think that it was everybody understood the idea, the notion of flattening the curve.  Not everybody, but enough people did.  People are trying to self isolate.  In fact, by the way, not just America, all over the world, it's kind of inspiring in some ways to see the entire world say, oh, I get it.  We've got to stay home.  I can do that and do it, even though for many it's a huge economic nightmare.  I think that's kind of inspiring.  Honestly, that's you can have leadership at the top, but it takes it takes good follow ship to do it.  Yeah, trust.  Trust. Yeah, but we're not.  But you know what?  We're trusting.  So what are we trusting in?  We're not trusting in our leaders.  We're not.  We're trusting in medical authorities and we're listening and we're acting.

And yeah, there does seem to be a drop off in ransomware attacks against hospitals and health care facilities.  Unfortunately, that has also led to a stepping up of attacks against financial institutions and some other types of business.  But yeah, I mean, honestly, this could be the chance to get a really good community spirit going.  And it's been amazing in our neighborhood.  People are actually talking to each other on a regular basis.  OK, shouting at each other from six feet away.  But, you know, I mean, we got together on everyone's lawns and we all had their sat in the glass door and we talked things through.  What could we do if somebody was having problems getting groceries?  Someone else agreed to go and pick it up for them.

The more stuff they sell in essential stuff, the more warehouse workers are put at risk, the more delivery people are put at risk.  Is that too heavy a price to pay?  Should Amazon not be making money or trying to make more money at this time, but instead limit it to just stuff that people absolutely need?  Admittedly, Amazon provides a great service because it is one of the few ways people can get essentials.

Transcript:  So here's what I've been wondering.  Amazon has something called AWS RoboMaker, which was built.  And I don't know if it's launched at scale yet, but the whole point of it was to help companies test and deploy intelligent robotics applications.  At scale in the cloud, which means you have a physical group of robots that can work collaboratively, share the data, improve.  And if you push a change to one, it sort of pushes to all.  You know, and those are not intended as toys.  I believe those are intended in places where you would have a lot of repetitive tasks and motions like a warehouse.  And Amazon's also got Scout, which it had been testing outside of Seattle,  which looks like a land based drone, similar to Neuro, but smaller.  And, you know, all I can wonder is at what point has Amazon had the capability to push some of these services out at scale  and chosen not to to reduce the spotlight, the federal oversight spotlight from different countries, right?

Start time: 3733.00

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I've been sort of wondering if we're going to start seeing that at some point, especially because there's so much there's suddenly over the past month.  There's been an increase in investment, increase in workflow around collaborative robotics and drones, land based drones, air based drones.  And there's never been a better time to do geospatial mapping because you got nobody outside and you got nobody ahead.  Right. But no, I think this is exactly the point.

Transcript:  If Amazon is, as you say, they've been putting money into automizing the warehouse jobs and getting rid of the fleshy component on that for quite some time.  Perfect time to introduce it.  But I do feel that it's slightly disingenuous amongst a lot of tech companies, because one of the first things Amazon did,  I think was a week or 10 days ago, was cut commissions to third party suppliers.  This is a great time to lock down your supply chain, get rid of all these tiny third party people.  He don't really make you that much money.  It's much easier to deal with just 10,000 big suppliers than a million small ones.  Good time to get the workforce replaced by machines, because you can say it's being done by the public health thing.  Google and Facebook are dropping advertising rates left, right and center to try and squeeze out third party platforms as well.  There's a lot of quite nasty stuff going on in all this, but it's the way the technology progresses.

The first rollouts will be for medicine, I'm sure.  Medicine and certain types of groceries to people who are older and can't get out.

We have to get stuff. My dad's on a slew of medications. He's afraid to go out. I'm afraid to go out.  So I think that even with all of the precautions, and again, this is what a futurist does, right?  We're not trying to predict what happens. We're trying to sort of figure out what signals are there, where do we have data,  and what are the plausible implications if we start connecting some of these things?

It's only had two days where it's really dropped the ball big time.  And I'm not that keen on Zoom because it's a great platform, but it's been forced to go to scale really, really quickly.  And as such, a huge amount of intense hacking has been going on to try and find out where the vulnerabilities are.  And it's no worse than any other video conferencing platform. It's just been under scrutiny much more.  So I think of Google Hangouts, but there was a lovely story that I saw at the weekend.  Google's head of business development was apparently having one of the Google video meetings and was asked by one of his staff.  Oh, that's so funny.  You saw this one?  Yes.  Oh, just gee.  I didn't see it. Tell me. Tell me.  Oh, OK. He was just like, he was asked by a Google staffer, why is it that Zoom is eating our lunch?  You know, it's like we've been doing this for years.

Now, I've been hearing that deadline ever since.  This actually is the year of video conferencing.  And it's been very interesting seeing how people have adapted to it.  Yes, it's kind of wearing.  And but it's the first time my family have actually done video conferencing.  It's the first time we've done it as a team.  And also, you have to enforce some rules.

Right. Yeah. Like some idiot got metal in his eye like three days ago was like,  Oh, it's fine. And now his eye is all inflamed and it's gooey and gross.  So that everybody in the area, a lot of the specialists said they don't want people clogging the E.R.  Somebody's got to treat it. They don't want to clog the E.R.  with people who really aren't that kind of emergencies.

But I really did think that WebRTC was going to sort of take off and hit the masses much faster than it has.

When you're in a mass Zoom call, there's always one bugger who's just like, oh, check out this new background and check it out.  Oh, I'm a potato and now I'm cupid.

Transcript:  Let's take a little break. And then I want to I think we can do I have some thoughts about and I really want to quiz you guys about how the world might change in some interesting ways like education, for instance, how this might set the tone for a whole new way of being.  Self driving automobiles or in particular self driving delivery vehicles.  There's some interesting technology, technologies that might be forwarded by this.  And I'm curious what you think. And then maybe some technologies like, in fact, autonomous vehicles for end users might be held back a little bit by this.  I'd like to talk a little with our guests, the futurist Amy Webb and a man who lives in the future.  Our show today brought to you by LastPass because of their sponsorship.  We can bring you that breaking news. We can bring you our shows.  They have been very good to us this year. And boy, you know what?  I couldn't be happier because I've been a LastPass user, a happy LastPass user for more than a decade.  LastPass is, of course, the world's best password manager, but it's so much more.  And as you send your workforce home, you got to remember they now are a potential security risk.  But LastPass can make that transition from in office to in home a lot easier.  You still want the IT team to be the gatekeeper, right?  You don't want to give them give up their control because after all, these these resources like your banking, like your databases, like your website, these are the most.  These are the keys to the kingdom. LastPass helps IT stay in control over which employees are accessing which resources.  It doesn't matter if they're working from home or working from the office.  You get unified visibility over access and authentication everywhere.  LastPass also make sure that your employees have secure access to their work applications with tools like single sign on, which employees love because it's so easy.  They just tap yes on their phone. And yet it's more secure than passwords.  And of course, LastPass is the king of password management.  They generate long, strong passwords and remember them for you in an encrypted password vault that can only be decrypted on your devices.  LastPass never has access to it, never has the password.  And it works everywhere you do. Windows, Mac, Linux, iOS, Android.  Every time I install a new browser or set up a new system, it's the first thing I install.  LastPass makes your team more productive too, as well as more secure because with LastPass folders in the LastPass Enterprise product, you just create job assignments, workflows.  For instance, we have an Ops folder. We have a business office folder.  We have folders for the studio. Those different folders make it very easy to onboard an employee and say, look, you have access to these resources because we're going to add you to this folder.  That's huge. LastPass lets remote employees securely share passwords across teams.  So there's no friction. You know, the average business has a hundred and eighty five shared folders.  It's critical for businesses to consider implementing policies and tracking reports on shared password activity to make sure employees are operating securely and not sharing passwords with people they shouldn't.  And that's what LastPass does. Seamless collaboration with co-workers without reducing your security.  And of course, there are more phishing attacks. Spear phishing particularly.  LastPass reduces the risk of phishing schemes because it will never auto fill passwords on suspicious websites.  And for remote employees who are logging in through the VPN, LastPass adds an additional layer of security to your VPN through biometric multi-factor authentication.  We couldn't live without LastPass. And that was even before this happened. And now we're so glad we have it.  We're going to do an event with LastPass in a couple of weeks. I'm very excited. It's going to be a virtual event.  It was going to be an in-person event. But of course, as with everything, it's virtual. Cybersecurity and identity trends unlocked.  Our guests will be myself, Steve Gibson. Actually, I'll be hosting the panel. I'm no expert, but Steve Gibson is. Andrew Keene.  He'll be a lot of fun. And of course, LastPass is CISO. Gerald Buchelt. It's Thursday, May 14th, one o'clock Pacific time.  It'll be a live panel. Stream it at twit.tv slash live. And afterwards, of course, it'll appear on the Twitter events feed.  We're going to discuss what the new decade will bring, how it's going to impact digital identity and authentication, both for businesses and individuals.  We had a great event in Boston a couple of months ago. I'm very excited about this one. This will be virtual coming out of our LastPass studios.  May 14th. Just put a pin in that. Save the date. One p.m. Pacific. Twit.tv slash live. LastPass. Get security.  Easy but effective security across every access point with LastPass. LastPass.com slash twit to find out more.  LastPass.com slash twit. Thank you, LastPass. I'm going to tip a little. Louis XIII, in your honor, because man, we couldn't do it without you.  Thank you, LastPass. All right. Now that I've wet my whistle, let me just see how many people are in the Jitsi.  Holy cow. Nobody's turning on cameras, but there are a lot of people in there. If I turn on the sound, it'd probably go crazy.  So this is kind of fun. It's open source. I got a server. You know, John, I think I'm going to bring the server in here because I think this is a better place for it than my house.  Since we have that demo network open to the outside world, I'll put it on that. I'll bring it in the next couple of days. It's also my Minecraft server. You don't mind, do you? No.  Schools. A lot of kids. Sad to say. A lot of seniors not walking. Of course, West Point reuniting just for the benefit of the president.  But most schools are having either virtual graduations, virtual proms. They're not getting to walk. And it probably is the case. I don't know. But this fall we may well be going back to class online again.  My son, our stepson, my stepson, Alyssa's son, Michael, 17, high school junior. He's been going to online school now for a year and a half, long before this.  And he's really comfortable with it. But I kind of wonder, you know, we've heard numbers like 50% of students not showing up for online classes. And yet at the same time, there's a lot to be said for online classes.  It can bring education into more homes. It can give you access to better teachers. Maybe you have to, you know, it also leaves some people out if you don't have internet access and laptops.  What do you think, Amy? What is the future of schooling? Is this going to give us a new kind of way of thinking about education?

So all of the healthcare workers are obviously, you know, putting their lives at risk to help us all. But there's a whole other group of unsung heroes that get no credit.  And that's everybody working in IT, all the sysadmins, all the network engineers, everybody that nobody knows who are making this possible, who are stressed out of their gourds right now, trying to make sure that all of these systems for school, for work, for everything stay active.  So I just want to say thank you.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I've got to say, yeah, same with us. I mean, our IT support guy, the Reg is based in Italy. So he's been under lockdown for about two and a bit months now. And as it turns out, he doesn't really like people, so he's quite happy with it, but his wife isn't.  But yeah, these are the people who are keeping us going, who are keeping the entire infrastructure of the nation going, and they deserve our thanks.

Start time: 5146.38

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, we have our own IT people. And of course, our studio engineers, John's here. We have somebody has to be here every single day and Russell is staying in touch and working with us too. And absolutely, that is a tough job, even tougher to do remotely. And when you have to come in and splice cable or reset a machine, it's even more dangerous. We have a lot of IT professionals in our audience, I'd say that's probably the vast majority of our audience. So I'll lift it.  So good health to all.  Cheers.

Transcript:  And nobody acknowledges the stress that you're under. I just want to say thank you. So.  Yeah.  All right. School. So what would it take for school to have been changed? Most not. So I've talked about this on the show before. We have kind of a unique setup. We built my daughter's internet, which is her own. And as far as she concerned, she's concerned she has access to everything.  She doesn't. It's very, very locked down and we've got these separate provisions for her. But we have a very, very strong connection. So again, I'm very acknowledging my privilege here. She's got no problem. She lives with two highly technical parents. And so for us, this hasn't been a challenge.  Now, I know that every day her parents, the parents that are in her class that are trying to connect remotely are challenged. Not everybody has stable connections. Some people, for God's sake, are still using like satellite.

Transcript:  That's right. Not everybody's on a T3. Everybody's got fiber. There may be situations where you've got one device for a family. Printers are super useful when you're doing math and learning how to do equations and write things down. So I don't think it's realistic that we revert to some kind of online only system going forward.  That being said, there are changes coming to education that I think we ought to consider. So one of those is that other countries were actually already set up to deal with distance learning in a way that we aren't. And that's going to give, and China is one of them, it's going to give them a competitive advantage.  The other thing is that in the United States, our education systems are funded not an insignificant amount through the lottery. And people are not out buying lottery tickets.  What a mistake that was. Oh my God.  Right? So a lot of states-

Start time: 5311.36

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  When we voted for this in California, Ian, the slogan was, the kids win too. The sad thing is that the people who run the lottery are basically Vegas back house gambling ventures who have very much made sure that the profit mostly goes to them.

Start time: 5336.83
End time: 5415.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  So the fact- so the issue is the revenue that was designated. So like that line, and schools are already, public schools for the most part are running super, super razor thin margins. So you have the lack of, anyhow, so this is super bad.  And the question that I keep coming back to is I'm sort of less interested in the technology at the moment and more interested in what 20 years from now does our workforce look like? Because we will have had a- there's all this longitudinal data on why early childhood education matters a lot and why words, like volume of words over just sort of screen time that's passive.  And we know that passive screen time is going way up versus active learning, which is going down in a lot of cases. So 20 years from now is also about the same time that projections are, assuming that things stay constant, that that's when some of our AI starts to make leaps and we start to see more technological unemployment.  I'm not worried about the implications for right now. I'm actually worried about education, the negative impacts of education 20 years from now.

Now, the music teaching profession has had an absolute, I can't say it, but a fundamental, the fundamental about this. But what's really shocked me about this is the lack of support given to teachers, because they were basically given, you know, like a three hour course in how to prepare video calls.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Well, it's right. So I also, I'm a professor at NYU Stern School of Business and my, so we went to online, the whole school went to distance learning, like the very beginning of March. We were kind of set up to do that because I was already, I teach a very different, I teach this foresight, but I do it using a lot of different tools. So we were kind of okay.  But a lot of classes, you can't, you know, you can't just take the existing syllabus and make it work online. It doesn't work that way. So, yeah.

And he's like, aren't you supposed to be in class right now? I said, well, actually I got a 22nd loop of video loop.  Oh, the intensive running in the video stream and I can get on with other things. And he goes, I was half outraged and half so impressed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, he's learning skills, maybe not the skills you want him to learn, but still you can't deny.  That's useful in the real world.  Yeah, I mean, I think higher education is one thing, but I think when you're talking about K through six, or even K through 12, where you're talking about no socialization, no social life.  My poor, our poor son who's been doing online school, he at least had a social life. We would make sure that, you know, there were kids around the rest of the time. Now he's going nuts. He's so sick of us.  You know, it's just really a challenge. So I don't mean to say that everybody's going to say, oh, this is the greatest thing ever. And we're going to do more of it. But I do think it might impact how we think about teaching.  It's certainly going to impact how we think about the inequality in access to the internet, to technology in general.

Now, OK, in Britain, 80%, I think Australia's done 75%. Netherlands has done 90%.  There's also signs of some firming up in terms of European countries not giving bailouts to tax exempt to people who have offshore their companies, who have offshore their taxes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And in some states, everything is open. This is the problem. If we were serious in this country about stopping this, you can't half-ass it.  And I think the problem is, so if you want every state, if you want to go back to a state-led model, fine.  Then every single state has to deploy its National Guard and nobody can move in between the states.  And then once you have proven a certain level of, you know, once you are able to show that your infection rate has significantly deteriorated, right, is significantly down, and there's some kind of standard.  And also you can prove that people aren't going to infect others nearby, then you can reopen them.  What we are doing in the United States is not coordinated enough, not good enough. And unfortunately, we're not New Zealand. We're connected.  You know, every state is connected to other states.

Transcript:  No, I mean, it seems like we're crashing the economy for no good reason, because we're not actually doing the follow-up work that needs to be done.  You know, lockdown is all well and good. And, you know, I don't know how it is on the East Coast, but in, you know, in Northern, you know, in the Bay Area, they've actually been pretty good about the lockdown.  But that doesn't really help us unless we actually track infections, isolate them and lock them down.  And I've got to say, also, there's been some pretty shameless showboating by tech firms with, you know, like Uber Eats going out or, you know, the food delivery places, like, just remember your food delivery driver.  It's like, no, in this kind of situation, you buy direct from the restaurant and you go and pick it up yourself.  Why pay the middleman? You want the producer to stay alive, not the middleman.

Start time: 5920.42
End time: 5931.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I think you should pay them both. Those people are probably a lot of, I would imagine, a lot of the people doing deliveries and Instacart shopping right now or had other jobs until recently.

End time: 5938.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've already started. So those working in the area of so like within segments of AI, like computer vision, automation, as it relates to automated small delivery, like so Neuro, Uber had a fairly successful pilot running of autonomous  delivery vehicles in Pittsburgh until at one point it was they were trapping people in wheelchairs out in the street because nobody had trained the system to recognize wheelchair as an object or human.  So I was going to say for fun or what? No, but you don't have people outside. So again, what would it take for X to be Y? What would it take to see a faster acceleration?  We've got the conditions right now for that to happen. I'm also seeing an influx. I was already, but I'm certainly now seeing an influx in synthetic biology investment.  And, you know, if it's the case, if we can redefine biology as technology, which is a little controversial, but if we can think of ourselves as code that can be programmed, that it's programmable, which we can now.

Start time: 6021.44
End time: 6026.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So synthetic biology. Do you think like Elizabeth Holmes is thinking if I could only have held down?

Start time: 6028.04
End time: 6086.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I mean, so it's kind of no joke, though. I mean, Amazon was already working at home based diagnostics on all kinds of systems and services. Google and Apple are also working on diagnostic tests outside of a lab.  We are seeing the problem that occurs when you've got too much consolidation with basically two labs, Quest and LabCorp in the United States.  The rest of the system becomes brittle. Again, these become accelerating factors for greater investment in home based diagnostics, home automation, single data records linking all of this together.  All of the machine learning and the deep learning ecosystem and the AI used for scientific discovery. These are things are all interlinked.  So all of that is going to see an acceleration going forward. So if you're somebody who's like, hey, I'm an engineer and I kind of have some interest in these areas like that, those are good areas to be looking at right now.

Start time: 6087.38
End time: 6125.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I am curious, though, on the automated car front and sort of on the automated drone front. The big players, yes, they're pushing forward on this, but they just seem to be sort of drying up VC funding for the younger players who are trying to get to scale first.  So it seems as though sort of a lot of startups are now really struggling for money. The VC funding seems to have cropped up.  Do you think we're going to see a sort of consolidation around the first leaders or are we going to see some kind of spring of new ideas?

Start time: 6126.36
End time: 6210.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. So nothing that I was just talking about is new. It's what I'm describing as an accelerating factor that wasn't present before.  And with it, yeah. So like synthetic biology has its roots back in 1992 and a lot of the Uber in Pittsburgh using little delivery drones is like that's been around for a while.  I think the problem is you've got, you know, the VC community and the private equity community tend to be chasing the shiny a lot, you know, and I just envision them chasing the new shiny, which is technology related to automating parts of the logistics in the supply chain.  So things having to do with like private 5G infrastructure within manufacturing plants and factories, scraping and using metadata that comes from the collaborative robotics and the 5G systems.  I see money like potentially going in that direction, which has a feeder effect back to automated delivery vehicles.  So maybe we don't see like a ton of new neuro competitors or whatever. And maybe some of that funding dries up, but the rest of the factors that lead into that ecosystem are moving forward.

Transcript:  You wrote a book called The Big Nine. It's all about the big nine IBM, Alibaba, Google, Microsoft, Amazon, Facebook, Tencent, Baidu and Apple. Which of these companies are going to see huge growth because of COVID-19?

Start time: 6227.98
End time: 6328.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. So this is one of those cases where I really wish. So that pragmatic scenario, the middle of the book has three scenarios, optimistic, neutral and catastrophic. That neutral scenario is starting to take shape, which is a concern for me because it leads down a dystopian superhighway.  What are the signature features of the neutral?  That's much just sort of more pragmatic. And pre-virus, I was studying again, like tech companies intersecting with health, which has been going on for a while. Tech companies intersecting with farming and agriculture.  In a lot of countries around the world, the government just stopped funding basic research. So somebody else had to step in. So I'm not against Google or Apple or Amazon necessarily building out the future infrastructures of healthcare.  But I think if we're going to rely on them to do that, and now we see an accelerating factor in the virus, we have to demand traceability, accountability, explainability, transparency. And that needs to be in place, if not first, then while this is all happening.  What happens to the tech lash?  I don't know that there is tech lash. I think that there is among my friends and probably your friends. But I think if you ask the average person, the average person doesn't actually know. To the average person, Amazon is just the place where you get stuff from on the web.

Transcript:  Even if there's a low hum of privacy, Google, I know a lot of people don't have Amazon Echoes because they don't want Amazon to listen. But that low hum doesn't stop them from shopping at Amazon.

End time: 6378.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No. And Walmart is a technology company. We just don't talk about it that way. And I see people responding. So again, what are people really upset about? I don't think they're really upset about their privacy. I think they're upset about other things.  And it manifests in like, let's go after Amazon. Let's go get Amazon the bad guy. Let's go get Google the bad guy. I think that people are actually angry about other things and they have absolutely no idea what these companies actually do.

Start time: 6379.72
End time: 6426.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, that's kind of the thing that drives me nuts about this. It's just like, well, you know, it's just like, I just order this stuff and the rest of it. And it's like, yeah, but if you actually look at the kind of data they're collecting and in many ways useful, but in many ways deeply disturbing.  And I think one of the things this has done is widened out an awful lot of technology. I mean, people used to order from, in my experience, people used to order from Amazon, but they still went down to the shops. Now they can't go down to the shops. It's up to Amazon to provide that. And I think that will lead to a bit more focus as to what these companies collecting and what they're using this data for. And particularly to come back to our earlier point about the healthcare apps, we're about to give out a huge amount of healthcare operate information to companies who we have no real guarantee.  They will use sensibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no such thing as privacy. Privacy has been dead. I mean, dead for a while. So the challenge going forward is to be to have sort of a better sense of understanding, like a better digital street smarts, right? A better understanding of what data are being scraped under what circumstances. And there has to be some sort of  accountability. These companies have to explain what data brokers are, who they're using, how the data are being transmitted, because it's the obvious stuff like people sort of get like that their faces are being recognized. They have absolutely no conception of what ambient data and ambient computing are and metadata, right?  All of the other sort of digital emissions that are coming from us and from our homes and from our offices and all of it.

Start time: 6555.66
End time: 6612.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you reminded me of a very famous phrase from from son Scott Manili, which was, you know, privacy is dead, get used to it. And then when the Edward Snowden revelations came out, he tweeted out, it's just like, wow, I had no idea quite how bad, how correct I was. But yeah, I mean, it's kind of like, okay, we always say, okay, some of us use Facebook, and you don't actually put your personal I mean, you put personal feelings on Facebook, but you don't, you've got to be careful about what you put on Facebook.  you put personal feelings on Facebook, but you don't, you've got to be careful about what you put on there, because otherwise, that data is going to be sold off. And it's the same with Twitter and the same with any form of social media, you have to be careful about what data you're putting on there. I agree with you total privacy is dead and gone.  But I'm willing to fight the rearguard action, you know, it's just I'm not willing to handle this stuff. It's like all these Facebook polls for Oh, what are your 10 favorite albums? Yeah, I'm really going to tell Zuckerberg what my 10 favorite albums are so I can get some of them down with you know,

So snap in 2015 16 or so filed a patent on it was a computer vision patent that would allow it to recognize any object in the frame of the photo that somebody was sharing. And then they were developing an auction based ad server to sell you ads against whatever was in that that frame. And this is so like, I understand, I understand that.  And this is so like, I understand, I understand that anytime I'm transmitting data of any kind that there's, you know, it's it's multifaceted. My point is that the average person doesn't recognize that. And so it's not just your face that's being scraped. It's all of the ambient data around you that others can use, right?

We and the amazing audience listening to us are all discerning consumers of news, but that is not true of everybody.  And in this age of algorithmic determinism, where we don't have somebody human thinking about the factors that go into making these assessments, you start to get led down digital rabbit holes.

So again, like, so there's a problem with having too much data. Sometimes too much data is bad and sometimes not enough data is bad.  Too much information is sometimes bad. Not enough information is sometimes bad. That is the current situation that we are living in.  And I think with 5G, which is kind of like difficult to actually understand, you know, I think the problem is you have some people with too much of the wrong information and then a whole bunch of people with no information.  There's no center ground where cooler heads prevail.

You know, I mean, if, if you, I mean, it's a shame there's a British paper called the National Paper called the Daily Express, which used to be a very good paper, but is now all about asteroids and, you know, conspiracy theories and the rest of it.  My gran used to read that, you know, and took it as a gospel, you know, that we do have this information overload that we, you know, and people are just like, well, I read it on the internet and we need to teach media savvy to people just to, with anything that you read, who wrote it?

Yeah, remember in 1965, I'm old enough to remember going to the US, the New York world's fair and AT&T had a video phone.  They said, you know, by 1970, we'll all be using video phones.  And I remember in 2001, in 1977, the two, that movie 2001, he's, he's on the moon.  He's talking to his daughter and his wife on earth via a video phone, a video phone booth.  And it never took off. All of a sudden, we're all making video calls.  I think this, this might have been the impetus to finally get us over the hump because we didn't want to.  I think people didn't want to, but now they're making video calls. And I don't think we're going to stop.  I think that this is, that's a, that's something that's changed dramatically.

Transcript:  Oh, I conferences are not over for a couple of very practical reasons.  The first of which is that people are humans are social.  So there is no way people are going to opt for no gathering or a virtual gathering over an in-person in-person gathering.  It might take a year for us to get back into the swing of things.  But to me, this is a little analogous to nine after nine eleven, when everybody said nobody's going to fly again.  You know, we just, we have to sort of wait it out to have the new protocols and for people to feel confident.  And then everybody's going to be back on planes.  Is anybody going to go on a cruise ship ever again?  Well, that's you. You're the one who cruises.  You tell us.

Transcript:  I was talking yesterday with Johnny Jed, our travel guy, and his thesis was you're not going to see widespread air travel or cruise travel or maybe even conferences until we have fast universal testing so that you can go to the airport five minutes early, get a swab or spit in a vial, get tested.  If you pass, you can board the plane. If not, you can't.

But that is going to cripple the air industry for a while.  But yeah, I think for this year, conferences are over.  It may come back, but until we get a way of either accurately testing or giving the golden passport to people, then mass conferences like CSA.  CES is over. I'm sorry.

Transcript:  So we have a habit, we have a cognitive bias.  When we think about the future, we tend to take signals in the present and amplify them.  So everywhere in the world, there's a 14 day quarantine period.  How would this ever work out for conferences?  Assumes that, you know, no other variable external or internal will change between now and some point in the future.  So I just I would caution against, you know, the inclination is to say the future will be like today, but much more.

This is a long term and I think we're all going to have some significant PTSD from this.  And I think people are going to become germaphobic, at least my generation, our generation.  This, you know, the Generation C will be germaphobic to the degree that there are certain activities as much as we might want to do them that will be reluctant to do.

Transcript:  Well, yeah, there are some. So what would it take for us to answer that question?  What are the what's the revenue?  And AMC is about to go out of business period.  Right. So how how can they sustain in the short term?  You know, my job really is about how do you sustain your operations in the short term while still planning on longer term growth?  And and the honest answer is there are a lot of companies, some industries that are going to sort of have to go on hospice.  There's no such thing as a business.  Exactly right.  I wish we had like a hospice for business, because that would allow people to say, listen, we're in a situation where three months from now we're probably not going to exist.  We acknowledge this. So it's not like it going out of business sale.  It's a smart way to wind down a business.  And I think that would probably be, you know, there are ways to do that and provide tax incentives and to do everything above board.  And that would be a that would be a smart thing for a lot of countries to start doing right now is to figure out what does a hospice environment what a hospice business look like.

The rest of it.  That's fine. Sports team.  Yep. Love that.  But why on earth we bailing out companies which do very little for us and not keeping the local companies which that's true to add so much to local life.

Transcript:  I agree. But I've spent a lot of time the past couple of weeks on the Internet Archives magazine section of the site where you can go through and they've got this amazing archive of old computing magazines like Byte.  Oh, I used to write for Byte.  So the whole archive is there and it's really interesting.  I mean, the most recent was reading a popular mechanics from the fifties.  And one of the big stories was about from 1954 was about how there weren't enough computer engineers like that story has always been true in every single decade.  It's true right now.  So what does that tell us?  That tells us that even when there are and that was that was Cold War.  We have to make a decision ultimately to create the future that we want to live in.  If we don't actively make a decision, then things kind of just happen.  So, yeah, there's there's a ton of optimistic framings out there.  I mean, we could I really believe that we could wind up on the other side of this five years from now in many ways better than when we started.  But we have to decide that that's what we want to do.  And then we have to have leadership and we all have to march together in the same direction.  What's the future of leadership in the new world?

But I mean, people naturally defer to authoritarian leaders when they're scared and frightened.  And why am I why am I Germany?  The threat of communism.  Well, I mean, seriously, we're into global depression territory, but unemployment statistics at the moment, we are into 1930s territory at the moment unless something really changes.

Obviously, in a lot of sci-fi books in the Watchmen, right?  In movies.  What's that like when things get really bad, what's the thing that saves us?  An alien invasion.  And when there's an alien invasion, like that's the thing that's going to be the most important thing in the world.  And that's the thing that's going to be the most important thing.  And I think that's the thing that's going to be the most important thing.  And that's the thing that saves us.  An alien invasion.  And when there's an alien invasion, like that's the thing that brings everybody together.  And suddenly, like we're all working it out.  And like humanity is one.  This is our alien invasion.  And when it occurred to me that that's what was happening and the outcome is not as I was promised, which is our like everybody steps up.  There's a level of maturity, kumbaya.

Transcript:  Our show today brought to you by Cashfly.  Literally, quite literally, Cashfly is our CDN, our content delivery network.  And it's been doing this since 1999.  We haven't been using it since 1999, but we've been using it for almost 15 years.  In the early days of Twitter, I was puzzled, stymied by the challenge of delivering terabytes of data to listeners all over the world.  We tried BitTorrent.  We certainly web downloads weren't going to work.  Then along came Matt Levine from Cashfly said, Leo, let's talk.  And Cashfly to the rescue.  We've been on Cashfly ever since.  And now we do petabytes of months of data, audio and video delivered to you seamlessly, quickly and at a predictable cost.  Thanks to Cashfly.  One of the things Cashfly does for us and will do for you is smooth out the spikes.  You know, our delivery is very spiky.  In fact, I would guess for a lot of companies, it's not a smooth curve.  You know, there are some days where you just get a lot of downloads.  And if you have a normal delivery system, you might be worried about exceeding your cap at any given time.  You might be worried about the bill that's suddenly going to come due with Cashfly.  They take your usage, average it out over a year so you get consistent billing and you never have to worry about those late nights where you were suddenly a lot of people download the show and you go, oh, no, cash flies doing even more to help you with something they call 100 percent cash shield.  One of the unknown costs of a CDN is your cash hit ratio.  If you can get it to 100 percent, you're going to save a lot of money.  But if you if you have a lot of cash is aging out, suddenly you're downloading a lot of content from your source and you may have, you know, Amazon expenses, big expenses with these data transfer fees.  Cash hit ratio is awesome.  You're basically buying some storage on Cashfly and that becomes your origin.  It brings your cash hit ratio to 100 percent.  No more surprises.  Plus, your customers are happy because 100 percent cash shield means no buffering.  Data is there every time, whether it's a web page loading a video, video buffering your games downloading your podcast arriving on time.  Everybody wants to be faster.  Your customers expect it.  But when your cash items are being evicted for large one off requests costing you a fortune and data transfer out fees, that doesn't feel so good with 100 percent cash shield and cash flies guaranteed availability.  There's a simple way to avoid it.  It's a next generation content delivery solution for today and tomorrow.  A dedicated storage space just for you, keeping your content closer to your customers without the traffic of other companies.  You can purchase as much space as you want.  Your data will always be fetched from 100 percent cash yield rather than your origin.  Shielding reduces origin spend by thousands a month and guarantees no cash misses.  It's also going to dramatically improve download speeds, eliminate buffering, guaranteed availability, the highest quality of service, scale your video streaming to reach global audiences of any size.  It's a great scalable solution for gaming.  Now we're all doing that right gaming online.  Your podcast will be delivered quickly and reliably without delay or timeouts.  And by the way, I could testify it works.  Cash flies awesome.  You get lightning fast digital download speeds for large files no matter where your customers are.  And because cash fly servers are all over the world, they can guarantee 100 percent availability, 100 percent cash flies global throughput for performance dominance ensures any cash misses.  They're delivered five times faster than from your origins.  So even if you do have a cash hit, it's coming from cash fly and it's fast.  Cash fly right now will give you a detailed analysis of your current CDN bill and usage trends and show you how much you can save.  This is a little bit of a complicated calculation.  How much storage should I buy?  You know, how much should I pay for cash?  How much is it going to save me?  They can help you.  They can get this all clear so you know what you're getting.  See if you're ever paying 20 percent or more for your CDN.  And if you're not on a CDN, why not?  Twit.CashFly.com.  Learn more.  Twit.CashFly.com.  Thank you, CashFly.  Thank you, Matt and team, because you have saved us year after year after year.  This is a little movie we made highlighting some of the fun things.

So it's not enough to have a great, and this, Ian, goes right back to what you were saying  about the startups and investment.  It's not enough to have a great technology.  It's not enough to have a great technology with demonstrable use cases.  You have to have the ecosystem around it.  And I think the problem with that Windows phone was no ecosystem.  The problem with Cortana was no ecosystem.  And for a time, no clear direction on what they were doing internally with Cortana and  what AI was going to be for Microsoft and with Microsoft.  So I think that, you know, I read all the academic research and their team consistently  produces very strong research on machine reading comprehension and, you know, natural language,  like a lot of the core pieces of spoken interfaces, but you got to get it somewhere being used.

And then just, and trust me, if you get a few beers down me and get me talking about  Microsoft and Nokia, I will swear to the rooftops because they took, they got this idea, oh,  we'll buy Nokia, we'll substitute Windows phone for the Symbian operating system, which  Nokia was stupidly holding onto.  And everyone will flock to that.  It didn't work.  They wrote the entire investment off against tax and we paid for it and Nokia died.  And I just, Microsoft has this real problem between developing these great technologies  and just complete inability to bring them to market in any way that anyone wants.  I don't understand it.

Transcript:  If it weren't for COVID, the absolute huge story this week in technology would be this  scoop from Mark Gurman at Bloomberg.  And because it's Mark, I think it's credible.  Apple aims to sell Macs with its own chips starting next year.  Apple has had some remarkable chip technology, but it's only put in iPads and iPhones.  But if, in fact, one of the other headlines that was interesting this week was one of  the Android blogs, Android Police bemoaning the fact that Apple's cheapest iPhone, the  iPhone SE, which just came out, has a faster processor than any Android phone, any Android  phone.  And that's because Apple's A13 and its chip technology is superb.  But is it ready for desktop?  And that's a very interesting question.  Microsoft has famously put out some ARM windows.  They have Windows on ARM and they put out some ARM devices that have been less than  stellar.

I don't think Apple is such a big customer of Intel that them going to ARM chips or their  own design chips is going to be a huge hit for Intel.  But what is interesting is if if you can get ARM chips in the in the network centers in  servers, that's going to be a big problem for Intel.

Even if...  I mean, China...  Even if China will...  Unilaterally...  No, no.  China will absorb Taiwan over a course of years.  They're hopefully going to do it peacefully, but it's going to happen.  Kind of like they've absorbed Hong Kong.  Yeah, exactly.

They backtracked the infection rates they got.  And as a result, they've virtually been untouched by this.  But if you honestly think that America is going to be able to win a war against China  over the control of Taiwan, it's not going to happen.  China is going to walk in there in five, ten, maybe 20 years' time, and they're going to  own the process of technology that's there.  So, you know, we're just going to have to deal with that.

Transcript:  So from a game theory point of view, what would it take for us to increase our military?  What would it take to have an engagement that involves force?  I don't think that it would.  I think it would be a losing game for either side to escalate to that point.  What's more likely is that China reclaims Taiwan and we don't stand in the way.  Is that because of the nuclear deterrence?  No, I don't think it's a nuclear issue.  I think this is an economic issue.  And I've been advocating in the DOD that we think about, we have to redefine warfare.  And this is a tough one for all of the labs around the country where they do advanced physics research, nuclear research, and all the rest of it.  We have to start thinking about war in economic terms.  What would it mean for a war to be fought in code versus combat or using economic measures in ways we haven't seen before?

Transcript:  But no, if the US decided to defend Taiwan, let's look at it logically.  You've got a 4,000 mile supply gap, which you're going to get harassed by Chinese submarines the entire way there.  China has spent the last 30 years developing anti-aircraft carrier technology,  which is going to make even the best US aircraft carriers huge targets which can't be defended.  If the US goes to actual physical war with China, that's my biggest fear because it might end up nuclear, in which case we all do.  But what I suspect is going to happen is that the US will make some noises.  China will slowly absorb Taiwan in the way that it has with Hong Kong and Taipei.  And that's the way they work.  They don't start wars. They just win them.

Transcript:  Amy's been talking about this on our shows for a long time because she's an expert on this.  And you've been talking about the Belt and Road Initiative, which is China's kind of economic hegemony plan to spread itself throughout the world.  And it seems very difficult to counter.  Do you see us going to a cyber war? Do you see that as being a credible deterrent of some kind?

Start time: 9368.37
End time: 9490.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Here's what I think has been happening.  Parts of our military have been reorganizing.  And I think that there has been a greater focus placed on preparedness as it relates to code.  The challenge is that we have a very long history of fighting war in a very different way,  a way that is tactical and requires building things and blowing things up.  So that's fine. The whole point of our military is preparedness.  So the question is, are we preparing the right way?  I wonder if nuclear is really the big challenge going forward or if it's attacks against our critical infrastructure  and security flaws.  And to me, cybersecurity feels more imminent and problematic than the threat of nuclear escalation.  So when I say, how can we think about this in terms of economics, when you look at the Belt and Road Initiative, which is one of many, many policies.  So China's been building physical infrastructure along the old Silk Road route in part, mostly it's in emerging economies and emerging markets.  But they've also been laying fiber and digital infrastructure.  And so what happens if there's a non-contiguous, but like huge swath of the planet in Africa, Latin America, parts of Europe,  that are aligned with China and we're locked out, you could cripple our economy slowly by compromising our supply chains, our travel routes, our trade routes.  I mean, there are a lot of different ways to wage war against another country that don't require guns and ships and airplanes.

Start time: 9516.58
End time: 9565.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, and I do want to just caution against continuing to think of China as a copy paste culture.  They were totally scraping everybody's IP and copying it like everybody knows that.  But I think things have changed over the past decade or so, and they're innovating in their own right.  And certainly when it comes to policy.  So the bottom line is they've got people on the ground.  So like we don't have like our state departments, our companies have like started, you know, for a long time, we haven't had people on the ground in all of these places.  China has. So they have relationships.  They understand each other. They've got a cultural sensitivity and awareness, you know, and are sort of.  Gosh, I don't want to say.

Like there's a different way of doing things and somehow, you know, this predates Trump.  This goes also back to.  This has been sort of a.  It's been going on for years.

Transcript:  Well, no, but I mean, we've come back.  It comes back to the central idea of hard power and soft power.  America has always had this.  Yeah, we are the hard power.  We have the military.  We have our nuclear arsenal and we've got the soft power, the cultural.  Everyone wants to be like America.  The rest of it.  Well, the hard power is gone.  Basically, America hasn't won a war for 30 years and its military is in combat.  Its military is a complete mess at the moment.  Soft power that's dissolved over the last 10 to 15 years as well.  China is perfectly willing to step into that as far as I can see.  I'm open to suggestions, but it just seems like we're kind of painting ourselves into a corner on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I trace my lineage as a futurist back to him.  So he was on thermonuclear war and was at the height of the post-military industrial complex thinking about nuclear deterrence.  I guess my thought is nuclear weapons are bad.  I think that there are things that are worse.  I just do.  I think the threat of biohazard is worse.  The threat of algorithmic, like cyber sovereignty is worse in some ways.  So I think that the war games of the 80s don't...  Obviously, we still have nuclear weapons, so it's still an issue, but I don't think it's the issue going forward.  With apologies for Herman Kahn.

Start time: 9736.75
End time: 9739.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Wasn't Herman Kahn the guy who said a nuclear war is survivable?

Start time: 9739.34
End time: 9832.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yep, but he did that for a particular reason.  So he was also a quantitative modeler and had access to classified Air Force data.  And it's from him actually that we have the word scenario because he was trying to figure out a way to get people to...  The whole reason that he explained that it was survivable was because he wanted to extend the scenario of dropping bombs out to the nth degree for the purpose of people not doing it.  So in a way saying everybody will be dead is a good way to...  You got to think about this.  So he's credited with saying we must imagine the unimaginable if we are going to confront deep uncertainty over very difficult questions.  But that's kind of the situation that we're in right now.  And so I think it's good for us to think through because if we're really focused on what's the future of nuclear deterrence,  then we're not also paying attention to the future of bio weapons and cognitive enhancement and like many, many other technologies that meld with our soft technologies or like market manipulation or all kinds of zero days.  Maybe there's like an archive of zero days that nobody knows yet that all get released at once and cripple our financial systems for X amount of time.  We see now what happens when we cripple our financial systems for even a week.  You know, look at what's happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the old idea...  Actually, EMP is the opposite, right?  It would destroy technology.  What happened in the 80s was that EMP would just destroy the electrical grid back to medieval levels.  But bioengineering, that kind of stuff really worries me.  Because EMP, we're screwed.  But bioengineering and the tailoring of viruses, that's a really nasty area to be in.

Start time: 9872.26
End time: 9940.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So this is where...  So similarly to AI, this is where this is a really thorny issue because viruses are not bad necessarily.  Just like with AI, tech isn't bad on its own.  Viruses aren't necessarily bad.  They potentially do bad things.  You could also theoretically create viruses to fix code, right?  To do good things.  So anyhow, there's a lot of...  You could create a virus to fight a cancer.  You could create a virus to fight another virus.  There's all kinds of opportunities here.  However, obviously, you can also use all of this to humanity's detriment, just as you could use AI and its evolution to humanity's detriment.  So we have...  Nuclear bombs are sort of like the Flintstones bam bam version of mayhem.  We're like orders of magnitude more sophisticated now in the year 2020.  And I'm much more concerned about all this other stuff than I am about how nuclear deterrence goes, even given what stupid things the Trump administration did with regard to Iran.
