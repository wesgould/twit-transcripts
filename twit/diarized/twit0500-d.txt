Start time: 239.54
End time: 283.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Britches up. Nice to hold up the bridges.  So people are noting this is episode 500 of this little program.  We've been doing this for quite some time.  And and wondering, well, why aren't you doing something like, where's the cake?  We are. But the but the reason we're not doing it today is because next month  is the 10th anniversary of the very first twit.  So April 19th, we are.  That's when we're going to do all the celebrating.  I figured 500 10th anniversary. Let's do 10th anniversary.  So 10 years we've been doing this show.  The first twit was April 17th, 2005.  And all of the original cast members.  Are coming back for that.  So it'll be John C.  Dvorak, it'll be Kevin Rose, Patrick Norton, David Prager.  The only person I think who hasn't committed Roger Chang.

Start time: 284.30
End time: 289.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Roger Chang's a maybe, you know, he just had a baby.  So maybe because he had a baby. Exactly.

Start time: 289.30
End time: 295.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So that's why I'm in Barcelona.  Yeah, you know, Roger's Roger's holding out.  I think he's got a son.

Start time: 296.58
End time: 301.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That special gift uncle Leo, you got some that little baby rattle  to entice them out.

Start time: 301.72
End time: 337.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Some Cheerios. There you go.  So anyway, that's why this is I mean, this is a special show,  but this is why we're not doing a big party or anything.  And also the director's chairs didn't come and the and the crown is missing.  So as soon as we have to wait for everything to arrive.  So I guess we should start.  Tomorrow is the Apple Watch event or something spring forward.  We'll certainly talk about that.  But I think we should probably start with what happened, because, frankly,  we don't know much about what's happening tomorrow, but we do know  what's happened in the past.  And that's Mobile World Congress.  And it just happens Miriam Schwarz just back from Barcelona.  First of all, was it fun?

Start time: 338.44
End time: 379.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's always a fun show.  It's a busy show.  It's harder than CS in many ways,  because you have to jump around the whole city for a lot of the press venues.  So just like CS, you have the actual show days,  which are not really that big of a deal for the media.  And then you have the days before the show when, you know,  all the press conferences happen, like the Galaxy S6 launch,  the HTC M9 launch on Sunday, March 1st.  That's the stuff you have to run around the whole city for.  You know, you know, that's not the only two that happen that day.  So it's a great show.  It's really crazy.  I had a really good time, as always.  A lot of really exciting announcements this year.

Start time: 380.22
End time: 382.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, Ian, you used to go, you didn't go this year.

Start time: 382.86
End time: 391.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  No, no, I haven't been now since 2008, since I came over here.  But I was going back to it when it was still through GSM in Cannes.  So it's changed an awful lot.

Start time: 392.28
End time: 395.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I remember those days.  Yes, it feels like we've forgotten.

Start time: 395.22
End time: 409.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It feels to me now like this is in many ways more important than CS,  certainly as mobile computing becomes more important.  And no, really, there weren't many cell phone announcements in January in Vegas.  They everybody said, well, let's we'll wait till till March.

Start time: 411.24
End time: 427.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, yeah, I mean, if you actually announce a cell,  it makes sense to do that because there's so many news announcements  coming out and see, yes, and Mobile World Congress is the mobile show.  Yeah. So I've got it's a bear pit out there.  I have to say much respect to you for doing it.  You must be exhausted.  Is the show floor as big as CES?

Start time: 430.12
End time: 496.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Probably. I don't know.  It's probably about as big.  It's hard to tell because it's a different venue. Right.  Now they've moved it to this new space that is gigantic.  It's bigger than the Las Vegas Convention Center seems.  But it probably isn't because the Las Vegas Convention Center  is one of the biggest in the world.  It's it's big.  And you know, what was interesting this year is this is the first time  in many, many years that we've had that many launches of phones  and devices at Mobile World Congress.  The trend in the past few years had been for at least Samsung and HTC  and a few of the mainstream players like LG to launch their phones  at their own press events separately and ahead of time or after Mobile World Congress.  Think Galaxy S5, think HTC One M8 last year.  They did not launch at Mobile World Congress.  So this is the kind of a return to form.  The GS2 was the last major phone that was launched at Mobile World Congress.  I didn't realize that.  That and the M7.  Actually, let me think. The M7 on the One X.  I can't remember, but it's been a while since the big players  have launched anything major at Mobile World Congress.

Start time: 497.60
End time: 509.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I guess if you're big enough like Samsung,  that you can have your own events and the press will come.  Apple is a good example.  You don't really need to be in all the noise of something like Mobile World Congress.  It's convenient for us, though.

Start time: 510.42
End time: 531.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It's very convenient.  It's also a bit of a buyer's show as well.  You know, just as with CES, if you've got a buyer's tag on,  everyone wants to speak to you.  And if you've got a press tag on, nobody wants to speak to you.  I mean, Mobile World Congress seems to be moving towards that being a buyer's show.  But there's still a lot of decent tech out there.  I mean, Samsung's launch seemed to go fairly well.  Yeah, a huge improvement over previous Samsung events.

Start time: 531.90
End time: 550.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's the biggest launch that I've ever seen. It was massive.  I have never seen a press launch like that.  The demo room was literally thousands of people.  Wow.  They had a separate demo room for partners, which are the carriers and people.  I have never seen anything like it.  It was the biggest launch of all of the history of launches that I've ever attended.

Start time: 550.44
End time: 558.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And thank you, Miriam, because we used your footage  from that demo room last week on Twitter.  We also used your footage of the M9 from their press conference.

Start time: 559.36
End time: 589.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sorry I didn't get a chance to get you more stuff.  But that's plenty. Those are the two folks I cared the most about.  These were the big ones.  And, you know, a lot of people don't know this because I've had some people  tweeting at me saying, why aren't you covering this for Twitter?  Where's your coverage?  I didn't go for Twitter.  I went for Mobile Geek because I'm a freelance  tech reporter, tech journalist.  So my gig was with Mobile Geeks.  And, you know, I know you sent Mike there and he got some  really great coverage for you guys, too.

Start time: 589.68
End time: 608.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  If you go to our special feeds, we have three full day coverage  day one, day two, day three on the Twitter TV specials.  And of course, on our news shows, Mike was, you know, right there  Skyping in and stuff.  So, yeah, we had a lot of coverage, but I really appreciate what you did for us, too.  That was really great.

Start time: 609.62
End time: 631.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, no problem.  I just do a lot of these hands on videos.  I can just wing them and put them together real fast.  I told Jason that I figured the timing would be perfect, right?  You had your show coming up and it was later that day, basically.  So I was like, if I get this stuff and I put it in a drop box and, you know,  the press room is really fast internet so I could upload that in like 10 minutes,  which is exactly what I did.  And all it went very well.

Start time: 632.06
End time: 641.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I actually don't think the big, big item there was a phone,  but we're going to talk about that.  I think the HTC Vive might be more interesting,  but let's talk about the phones before we.

Start time: 641.82
End time: 643.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I got to try it out so I can.

Start time: 643.86
End time: 672.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah, I want to get your impressions, but the S6 looks pretty good.  I was impressed that Samsung kind of got off of its tone deaf presentations.  They didn't have the Broadway show.  Oh, that was awful.  It was terrible.  Painful to watch.  And it was also less sexist.  Actually, three of the four presenters were women or two of the three presenters were women.  It looked it looked a little bit more professional all around.  And I think the phone looks better than they've ever than any phone they've ever done.  It's got a glass back and front.

Start time: 673.96
End time: 681.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks more solid.  You know, I'm sure it feels better, too, in your hand.  I love that edge.  Yeah, I had it as fine.  And I had it for like a week.

Start time: 681.72
End time: 682.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Android.

Start time: 684.26
End time: 736.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is the most beautiful Android phone I've handled yet.  Better than the M8.  Better than the M8, but the M9 is the M9 itself.  The new one is better than the M8.  So it's a toss in terms of feel in hand.  It's a toss between the M9 and the the 6 Edge in particular.  But I would say that in terms of like detail and design, I think the M9 still wins.  But what to me brings the S6, the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 Edge  kind of on top in a way is all the other things that they got right this year.  They seem to have just completely nailed this phone.  In this incredible way, which we all know Samsung can do if they apply themselves.  And now that they have the heat, you know, the fire under their butts,  they actually are doing it.  And it's incredible to see what.

Start time: 737.94
End time: 742.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They need to, because the S5 was kind of a flop.  It was a turd. I've been.

Start time: 743.58
End time: 762.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  OK, another way to put it.  I've been very, very public calling the S3, S4 and S5 a turd.  The S2 was the last great flagship.  Device from Samsung  counting and of all the Note 4 is by far the best one.

Start time: 763.40
End time: 774.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm yeah, I'm carrying a note for after after going back and forth  for a while with all the different new flagship phones, including the Nexus 6.  I ended up going back to the Note 4.  Owen, why did you get rid of your S?  You said you had it for a week, the S5.

Start time: 776.88
End time: 788.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One, somebody needed a phone and I I buy stuff like that just to test it out.  So I was like, look, I'm not going to use it.  I took it in the pool for like two days when I was with my kid.  And I took I thought that was the coolest part of the phone.  Because it was waterproof.

Start time: 788.28
End time: 789.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't take the new one in the phone.

Start time: 790.16
End time: 813.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, and that's the thing.  The way it felt, it felt cheap.  And that's the thing I didn't like about it.  Like, I felt like I was going to personally break it at some point.  And then once you with the water feature, I feel like you take that back off  a couple of times, get into the SD card and doing things  that feels going to wear out on you and then your beat.  So once this new phone looks amazing, it looks small, though.  I don't know whose hand that was.  That's that was Maryam's hand.

Start time: 814.88
End time: 822.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, she's ladylike.  It does look a little small.  It's only five point one inches.  That's for if nowadays that's small.

Start time: 823.14
End time: 824.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And that's funny to me.

Start time: 824.52
End time: 828.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Like, it's like, OK, I like what do you think, Maryam, edge or not?

Start time: 830.56
End time: 919.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Absolutely. For me, it's edge.  But I think it's very divisive.  A lot of people like very polarizing.  A lot of people much prefer the regular Galaxy S6 and some much prefer the edge.  I think personally, I think the edge feels better in hand.  It has a bit more of that kind of sharper, not sharp edge.  Like the Note 4 edge that was terrible was really sharp.  This is very nice in hand.  I think the Galaxy S6 for me, what I don't like it about it is that it feels  I mean, it feels really premium, right, because all metal and glass.  But it doesn't look that much different than the Galaxy S5.  You know, I'm saying like, you kind of look boring.  It looks in fact, the S5 was uninspiring.  Yeah. Right. Yeah.  And so the iPhone 6 looks boring, even though it's beautifully made.  The GS6 looks boring.  And I guess Samsung's going for that kind of like an offensive look.  But with the edge, they literally  part of the plot, they really have kind of an edge device.  It is edgy. It feels and looks like they're really pushing the design envelope  in a really significant way.  And it is a complete gimmick. Don't get me wrong.  But there is one thing about it that's great.  And it's that that, you know, a lot of Android apps that you swipe from this  like this, you know, from both sides, like the Google Plus app is a good example.  And that feels so incredible with that curved screen.  It's like a marriage in heaven.  Like, it's like, wow, perfect.  Now I get why they've done the edge.  Do you think Samsung?

Start time: 920.02
End time: 936.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the Note 4 or the Note is on a fall release.  They announced this Note 4 to IFA in September.  So presumably they'll do it this fall for Note 5.  Do you think the Note 5 will continue to have a removable back,  removable battery SD card, or are they?

Start time: 936.60
End time: 962.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a feeling that that's they're going to kind of deal  tunnel the Note as a pro device and the GS, the S series as a  as a kind of like a design centric and and flagship phone.  And as such, I totally understand their choices of removing the  mixing the removable battery and SD card slot.  Look, the iPhone doesn't have removable battery and SD card.  That's why I carry a Note 4.

Start time: 964.88
End time: 967.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just because the iPhone is exactly why I don't carry an iPhone.

Start time: 967.96
End time: 993.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We're not the kind of audience that this phone is going after.  Right. Right.  I have a Note 4 and I love it, too. Right.  But I think that you have to understand where they're coming from.  They're they're got their lunch eaten by Apple and others this year.  And they're really going straight for that for that market.  We may even be somewhat desperate.  Yeah. Sorry. 32 gigs, 64 128 devices.  You know, right.

Start time: 993.48
End time: 1011.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But after you saw this, after you saw the sales of Apple,  you know, they're desperate for that market. Right.  The iPhone just blew everything out of water.  They need some to get in the market.  My biggest problem when you just said the space and the phone is dedicated  with no SD card, I can't trust how much bloatware they're going to put on these  phones because they backing off on touch with.

Start time: 1013.22
End time: 1019.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You put so much stuff on these phones.  Yeah. I mean, this Note 4 doesn't have a lot of touch with on it.  It's got a little touch with on it.

Start time: 1019.86
End time: 1028.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it still has touch with and it's still a pain in the ass.  Never to buy that phone.  They've bundled they've bundled a bunch of Microsoft apps,  which is really interesting.

Start time: 1028.74
End time: 1034.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Not a bunch. Just Skype, OneNote and OneDrive.  Just three.  The rumor was they were going to do a lot more than that.

Start time: 1036.46
End time: 1092.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, none of that matters, though.  We still haven't talked about where it really makes these two phone  absolutely incredibly awesome and blow away the M9 to smithereens.  The fingerprint.  No, no, that's that's cool because that's like up.  You don't have to swipe anymore.  That's nice.  It's the display and the camera, the camera in particular.  That display is unbelievable.  If you see that display in person, you will like think you had brand  new eyes installed. It's unreal.  And then, you know, just because they hadn't had enough fun yet  with one of the best displays ever made, Quad HD 5.1, the highest DPR  any display. Well, let's curve it right.  Like they didn't go 1080p for the edge version.  They went Quad HD. They curved that display.  That is unbelievable to me.  Technically, like this is like their way of saying, I'm dropping the mic.  We've made the best display ever in the history of smartphones.

End time: 1126.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Everything. How is that?  How is so I am kind of convinced with the fingerprint reading.  I am really convinced that that's important.  I work so nicely on the iPhone. I think it's dangerous.

Start time: 1128.23
End time: 1140.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, if you look at the court rulings on this,  if you get pulled over by the police, they can force you to use your fingerprint  to unlock the phone, but they can't force you to give a passcode.  Password is something in your head.  Whereas a fingerprint is physical evidence.

Start time: 1140.12
End time: 1149.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is the same thing as they can.  They can require DNA.  They can't take a hair from you.  Courts have ruled that that's not test of self incriminating testimony.

Start time: 1150.02

Speaker: SPEAKER_09

They can and it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very,  apparently, your privacy protections are different if you're crossing a border.  You don't have any. You have none.  So they required somebody to unlock his phone.  He said, what are you talking about?  That's that's private.  And he's actually he's going to go to jail, I think, because of that.  So that's something to be very aware of.  But I don't think that's going to keep me away from it.  I mean, I'm not so paranoid that I'm not going to get a fingerprint reader  because the cops could make me do it.

Transcript:  if you think the demo, the demo was impressive, but I never trust a demo.  They had side by side low light comparisons, both stills and video.

Start time: 1337.46
End time: 1381.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's unbelievable.  And you know why? Because F over one point nine. That's why.  That's the only reason it is the fastest lens on any flagship today.  There's plenty of F two lenses.  Yeah, but that's quite a bit different.  If you've ever used F one point nine versus F two, you'll know the difference.  It's about, you know, you're getting an extra like doubling in light.  It's unbelievable.  It's just it just makes such a difference.  And then on top of that, you've got OIS 16 megapixel  and one of the fastest, fastest camera apps like it starts in point seven  of a second, you can double tap the home key for it to start.  And and it's instantaneous like you tap the shutter button.  You get a picture. It doesn't matter what you do.  It's like they're going after Apple is huge because there's a lot of phones,

Start time: 1381.98
End time: 1385.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  including quite a few Android phones where you touch the button and you wait.

Start time: 1385.56
End time: 1448.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, it has manual controls as an option.  It has it has tracking focus now so you can tap on on an object.  And if the object moves like a car person,  it'll continue tracking it like live in the viewfinder.  That's cool. So, I mean, it's really they've they've really gone crazy.  I'm not a huge fan of Samsung usually, but I have to say,  you know, the camera on the M9 is a huge disappointment.  No OIS 20 megapixels with really small pixels that are really noisy.  You know, so far hasn't impressed anyone, even though the rest of the phone  is gorgeous and wonderful.  It's like Samsung's just really nailed it this year.  They've done everything right, except they're not waterproof,  no removable battery and no micro SD.  But that's a small compromise, in my opinion, compared to all the things they nailed.  And I think this phone is going to sound like hotcakes.  And I actually think, I mean, it's not going to dethrone Apple, no way.  But it's certainly going to give Apple a bit of a run for its money.  Isn't it close, though?

Start time: 1448.98
End time: 1457.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, isn't it?  I know Apple's dominant, but isn't Android close?  And isn't Samsung kind of close within 10 points of of Apple  in terms of adoption?

Transcript:  Android markets flooded with opportunities to that's the one thing  that dilutes that whole conversation.  But one thing about the camera, every time a new phone comes out,  I hear how great this camera is.  And I read all the statistical things about how much better these cameras are  than an iPhone.  And everybody I know that does phone camera shooting, they all use iPhones.  If you see anybody without one, some people buy an iPhone  just to use it for their camera for that kind of stuff.  That's because people are sheep.  That's because people are sheep.  I'm telling you, people just use your camera.  There are quality is better.

Transcript:  But Owen, you have to point Owen, you have like I'm a person.  I'm someone who became a blogger because of camera phones.  OK, so I I actually started writing my own blog  because I was absolutely fascinated by the concept of a phone  being able to take pictures.  And I've used every major camera phone since 2005.  And I'm telling you, there's one thing that the GS5 didn't have  and that many of the competing phones right now that are supposedly good,  but I don't end up being good, don't have.  And that's OIS and a fast lens.  That is a killer combo right there.  And the Note 4 is an example of that.  The iPhone 6 Plus is an example of that.  And you're going to we're going to get that out of the S6 and S6 edge.  They're going to be incredible shooters.  And you will see.  I'm going to buy one on your word just to try it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's several other shooters out there that are really, really quite good  because of the combination of a fast lens and OIS, you know,  and and some of the Lumia's and some of the LG phones, actually.  But they're crippled.  The Lumia is a crippled by by delay, by like.  Denim, Denim fixes that.

Start time: 1589.50

Transcript:  I mean, I have you seen me wrong.  I'll tell you, Apple knows how important this is.  If you go to Apple dot com right now, front and center,  this new gallery of iPhone six photos and they're they're stunning.  They're stunning now.  And most of these are coming from social networks.  Apple spotted them and and added them.  And they're just I mean, I've never seen these.  These are DSLR quality.  Now, some of these guys are pro photographers.  And it shows you the eye is important.  But this is iPhone six.

Start time: 1652.92
End time: 1703.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The iPhone still has the edge over the GS six and the note four.  And that's the fact that they refuse to go more than eight megapixels.  Right. That gives you large pixels that are even cleaner and less noise.  And then here's where Apple blows everyone away.  It doesn't matter how good Samsung's GS six phone is going to be.  The software Apple has the best camera app and camera software.  So you combine that with a fast lens and OIS.  And now you have a really killer combo.  I use a G, an iPhone six plus right now.  And the pictures I'm taking with it blow my mind.  They're really incredible.  And I'm a person who can take good pictures, almost any phone.  And it's like they make it so easy and seamless.  It's it's amazing.  But I do think that the GS six, like the note four is going to impress  a lot of people in terms of of imaging.  And it certainly sets the bar.

Transcript:  And one thing Andy and I could point it out is that  if you know what your capabilities are, you notice all of these are in fairly  bright daylight, for instance.  Yeah. If you know what your capabilities are, you can max them.  That one's not. That's the Eiffel Tower.  But there's a lot of light there.  You can maximize the capabilities by maximizing the quality of the picture  by knowing what your phone's good at and staying away from the stuff,  maybe low light, for instance, that your phone's not so good at.  And that's clearly here. But I have to say these are amazing.  And we're going to take a break.  I don't I think this we won't know till March, April 10th  when this S6 comes out.  And then we'll all get one.  And then we can fight then.  And I want to I want to see your pictures, Miriam.  And if you show me yours, I'll show you mine.  Not you, oh, doctor.  I know not me.

Transcript:  The bunch of interesting Android Wear watches,  the LG Urbane and Urbane LTE watches were pretty hot.  And then there is the Huawei's Android Wear watch.  All of these were kind of premium looking metal watches  with gold and silver like finishes.  Pretty high end, pretty nice.  The thing about the Huawei one was that it's got a display  that is round but doesn't have the flat tire of the Moto 360  and has very little bezel, which I thought was awesome.  Finally, somebody's cracked that nut.  So that's cool.  But the LG ones, you know, they look they look really great.  They're kind of like an LG watch are  G watch are on steroids in terms of the design  and the quality of the materials and the build.  And then there's an LTE version that doesn't run Android Wear  because Android Wear doesn't support LTE, doesn't support being an independent  self-connected device, as it were.  And now one runs a variation of WebOS.  It's very much the same watch that we saw Audi show at CES.  So it's interesting that the Urbane LTE is  is an evolution of the Audi watch from CES, like a further advancement on that.  And with WebOS and LTE and self pairs with your phone for notifications,  but it can run standalone and take phone calls and all that.  And then the Urbane non-LTE is an Android Wear device  that's very similar to the G watch are, but much more premium.  So these will come out very soon.  And I'm probably going to get my hands on some  because I get good connections with LG, as you know.

They'll stay relevant for a while, but it's going to be a challenge for them.  So this is their way of saying, look, we're thinking beyond smartphones,  you know, where they also did a wearable called the re-grip.

You wear it when you're inside in your house.  It connects to a PC.  So this is the thing people don't understand.  This is not a standalone device.  This is a PC connected peripheral.  It will have a couple of wireless  controls that go along with it.  And like joysticks or like

I've tried Oculus and I've tried Gear VR and I've tried a bunch of different  products. And, you know, they're they were kind of wow, but not like  I want to stay in this universe and I want to experience.  I don't know.

Transcript:  Oh, my God.  Well, I'm telling you this.  This was unbelievably good.  First of all, nobody got sick.  I've talked to every single one.  Women, men, everyone.  Nobody got sick. OK, that's a big deal because I get sick with the demo.  And the reason for that is because instead of having a single display,  they have separate displays for the left and right.  Super high res, they're twelve hundred by ten eighty each.  And they refresh at 90 hertz.

Transcript:  If you look at a white surface inside the VR universe,  you do not see any flicker.  Also, the motion sensing is so accurate that you have no lag whatsoever.  So when I was using the two controllers  and I was touching them together in the virtual world,  I could actually feel them touch in the physical world.  Exactly the way I saw them in the virtual world.  So the accuracy of the positional system they're using, just laser based,  is really, really good, which is another reason why you don't get sick.  So they've really done their homework.  And, you know, you can tell Valve has worked on this for a long time.  So you're going to see why Valve and HTC?  Well, it's very simple.  HTC and Valve got together to do this in the starting in the summer.  And they now already have basically a developer unit.  And that's because HTC is a Taiwanese company.  They can design and manufacture products very quickly.  Because they have that expertise.  And conversely, Valve has a ton of expertise in creating virtual worlds,  on, of course, in video games and in a way to monetize  and distribute these through Steam.  So this is a huge deal.  I think I know. Remember, I'm the next video game developer.  I worked in video games for 15 years.  I actually got interviewed by Valve a few years back.  I didn't take the gig because they're a bunch of crazy workaholics,  but I love them dearly.  But the point is that that I think this is significant.  I think this is significant because it's the first thing that everybody  unanimously agrees there's no ifs or buts.  This is really good.  And two, it's a really kind of marriage made in heaven.  These two companies are five minutes apart.  They're headquarters.  So it's like it just seems like a great fit.  And for HTC, it's a great way to move forward.  And Valve needed a vehicle, you know, after the after after  they've been working on this stuff forever.  And they can't they couldn't scale.  They couldn't manufacture this stuff.  So they say it's going to be in stores by Christmas.  Yeah, they want to launch it by the end of 2015.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I don't think it's worth it.  You could, but it's not interactive.  The thing about this is unique is that it's really designed to be used in a  like you're going to have to make space in your house to use it.  Ideally, you need a room that's 15 by 15 feet.  No, no, seriously.  This is like I don't think it's going to be a mass produced thing.  I think it's going to be a niche product for a while.  But but the reason for it is that, you know, the games are optimized  so that you can walk.  And and as you get too close to the real wall of your seems like a really bad idea.  It kind of fades in this grid in front of you that shows you  how far you can go without hitting something.  And it's really, really well done because I never ever  single time hit anything.  And it kind of fades in and out really seamlessly.  But like, look, you know, I was not impressed with Oculus Rift ever.  OK, so take it with a grain of salt if you want.  But this blew my mind. This was so good.  I was like, wow, I've seen the future. This is it.

So the kind of games I was at GDC this week, the kind of games  that they really want to get this into are ones where you're sitting  in a spaceship like elite or where you're sitting in a racing car.  If you're doing a first person shooter, then it's not so good  because you want to run exactly.

Recipe for disaster guides you through that doesn't let you,  you know, basically shows you where the limits of your real physical world  are, so you don't run into things.  But they don't want you to be sitting down as much as we've seen.  Who's going to dedicate a 15 by 15 room?

Transcript:  Well, you'd think I mean, this is why we went around the stand,  but we weren't seeing we weren't seeing anything there.  But I mean, I mean, I'm with it.  It does appear to be much better than the Oculus in terms of the kind of  the experience that it gives and so much better than than Samsung's version of this,  which is just blocky as all.

Start time: 2808.32
End time: 2826.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Samsung's version is just basically a note for in a thing.  Yeah, well, Google, kind of like Google Cardboard.  Yeah. Yeah. So we could we could throw that out.  That's not really in the in the mix.  We're talking about, you know, kind of interactive, real time, immersive gaming.  And it is Oculus.  It's funny because Facebook spent a lot of money on Oculus Rift  and they've been scooped by HTC of all people.

Start time: 2827.38
End time: 2870.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, you know, the thing about Oculus is that their technology can scale.  Right. So all they have to do is improve the resolution of the display.  Refresh rate and a bit more accuracy on the positioning.  And then they're probably going to be able to catch up.  But the thing that does make Vive unique is these two controllers as well.  It really does give you the ability to like pick up things in the world.  The controls are very similar to the Valve controller, the one for the Steam PC.  So in the sense that they're like, if you took that and broke it in half,  basically, and held both halves, that's basically what you have to do.  Two D pads where your thumbs are trigger buttons on the bottom.  And you can squeeze the controls as well to make them click.  So, yeah, it's really well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the things that came up with all the reporters, I talked to a mobile  Congress who got the demo, who were all amazed was, how do they market this?  Because you have to experience it.  So you need to create some sort of studio where people can go and try it out,  because then they'll be blown away and buy it, perhaps.  But but until then, it's kind of like you guys are hearing me say it's amazing.  But you don't believe me because you haven't experienced it. Right.  I believe you. I believe you.

I believe it's probably the best thing to do on the market.  I believe that you've you've sold that part of it.  It's just all the other aspects of it as a regular person or people in the market.

But the thing is, all of this stuff going on right now around VR,  the kind of the rebirth of VR is eventually somebody will figure out  how to make it work and make it a more acceptable thing  and a more manageable and marketable thing.  But this what we're seeing happening here with H.T.  Valve needed to happen.  Here's what it is. The quality wasn't good enough.  This is now the quality is good enough.

The first thing you see is the holodeck from Star Trek.  Very much the same.  An empty room with lines and you're like, holy crap, I'm in the holodeck.  And then they kind of fade in the world and it feels so unbelievably real.  It's it's just that's the thing that blew my mind compared to Oculus.

They, as I said early on when we started discussing it,  for sure the controls will be wireless.  The big question mark is on the developer release, the headset will not be wireless.  It will be connected by a single cable to PC.  But on the, there's talk of the final version, the retail version,  to be potentially wireless in terms of the headset as well.

But I mean, when you're using the HoloLens kit,  you had to carry a battery pack with three fans going nine to the dozen on there.  You had to wear the special headset.  Now, the keynotes, they showed the sort of black headset which sat around.  They wouldn't let us touch it, but they did have one in a glass case.  It has no air sockets on there.

You put apps on the phone,  and then if the app has a watch component,  it will, just like Android Wear,  it'll communicate with the watch,  and then the watch will have a thing that it does  that's related to the app.

Transcript:  So it's kind of silly to talk about the Apple Watch  because tomorrow's the event,  and we're gonna stream it live and talk over it,  and everybody's gonna yell at us and say,  shut up, and then we're gonna say,  go watch the Apple event yourself  if you don't like what we're saying,  and you know, it's the usual.  So I will not be streaming it from there  because I'm not invited,  but Renee Ritchie will be there for MacBreak Weekly,  Serenity Caldwell, Jason Snell,  and we'll get them the next day  and MacBreak talking about it.  I don't think Apple will have a watch there.  They've said already that April  is when the watch will be for sale,  but the most fun speculation is how much it will cost.  Oh.  And remember when the iPad was announced?  I think Apple seeded rumors  that it was gonna be a thousand bucks.  Everybody said, oh, it has to be a thousand bucks.  Apple knowing that in fact it would be almost a thousand  bucks, but they seeded those rumors  so that when Steve Jobs said, and it's $499,  you could hear an audible gasp,  that by the way is the last event I ever was invited to,  but you could hear people in the auditorium go, 499?

Oh, they're all around the back.  Just to get the applause going.  And then the journalists are kind of desperately  trying to sit on their hands, not get excited,  because it's unseemly to applaud  at an event you're covering, that's unseemly.

Start time: 3801.26
End time: 3826.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Well, it's a breach of, honestly,  I think it's a breach of journalistic ethics  to applaud at a press conference,  but I must admit, last time I did it, 2003,  I felt very ashamed.  2003, what was that for?  Palm Pre.  I was so glad to see Palm back.  It was just like, I still have my Palm 3X,  and I love it dearly.  Yeah, you for a moment.

Transcript:  Yes, full disclaimer I did.  They went back to the well.  I'm very excited about the product,  having seen the hardware when it was being created,  especially the metal version, really great, great hardware.  They're keeping true to what they're good at,  which is a daytime readable display that's always on  and fantastic battery life.  But, they call it display 64 colors.  It's very pastel, so don't expect to just use that  to see pictures.  It's more like to increase the readability of the UI  and give you some sort of color coding for notifications.

End time: 3963.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm very excited that they launched this finally.  Kudos to the team.  But I think going to Kickstarter for this  it's clearly extremely successful.  It's unseemly.  It's using Kickstarter as a store.  You're not pledging anymore, you're buying, you're ordering.  And I think that's kind of breaking Kickstarter.  And of course Kickstarter is on board  because they're making a shit ton of money at it.  But I just think it's, I don't know,  it's kind of icky to me.  I agree.  And it seems it's a very smart strategy  in terms of marketing, very clever.  That's what it was, all about the marketing.

Start time: 3963.94

Transcript:  I'm like, what do you care?  There's one thing people are forgetting.  If you look at the number of watches, how many watches,  sorry, how many pledges are there?  How many backers?  All right, so that's how many watches  are going to sell out of this.  Or probably more by the time it ends.  That's not a huge number.  Do you know, I cannot speak of the numbers in public,  but let me put it this way.  When Steel launched at CES,  that number was peanuts in comparison  in terms of number of pre-orders, okay?

Start time: 4004.72

Just because the fact that the people that eBay  and sit in line to buy it  so they can hopefully sell it to somebody else.  Half the people in the line for my iPhone  were selling their ticket in line  or buying the phone to go and sell it online  to somebody else.

Transcript:  So John Gruber has a great article  and it's complete speculation.  We'll find out more tomorrow.  Couple of things he raises.  There are two sizes for each of the three models.  38 millimeters of 42.  He says, don't be surprised if the 42 costs  a little bit more.  Because it's a little bit bigger.  He also says, well, he quotes Apple's description  of the high-end band.  Now a lot of people forget  that the band may be sold separately  or a watch with a fancier band may be sold separately.  The steel, which is the middle watch,  there's the sport watch.  We know that's gonna start at $350.  We don't know what the steel will be or the edition.  But the steel, the best band on the steel  is what they call the link bracelet.  And then Gruber quotes this.  Listen, this is Apple.  Crafted from the same 316L stainless steel alloy  is the case.  The link bracelet has more than 100 components.  The machining process is so precise.  It takes nearly nine hours to cut the links  for a single band.  What?  In part, that's because they are, this is Apple.  They aren't simply a uniform size,  but they subtly increase in width  as they approach the case.  Once assembled, the links are brushed by hand  with small minks, no, I added the minks,  to ensure the texture follows the contour of the design.  The custom butterfly closure folds neatly within the bracelet.  I mean, they're setting you up for an expensive band.

End time: 4185.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03

So I could date supermodels,  if they just go to mymatch.com for me.  I gotta find these people,  because it's so insane.  And you would think that, you think,  you wouldn't lie and say nine hours  if it didn't take nine hours,  but the cost effectiveness of that,  it's making me angry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Impossible.  It doesn't matter, because the prices will reflect that.  See, look, it takes the H-E-C, no, listen to me.  It takes 150 minutes, 150 minutes per HTC One M8,  last year's model, to machine the case.  Oh, that's interesting.  The new one takes about double that, according to them,  because of the dual color, the dual anodizing-  It takes three hours to make the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why not nine hours for Apple?  All I'm saying is that when the watch sells for 10K  and the bracelets sell for one or two K each,  you'll see that it makes perfect sense  that it takes this long.  And it will attract the right kind of customer.  Trust me on this.  I think Gruber is totally right.

Start time: 4245.66
End time: 4293.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now, gotta acknowledge, Gruber may have,  this may be somebody leaked this to Gruber,  in order to set up everybody  so that when the real price comes out,  they'll go, oh, see, it's not so bad.  Or, these are, and John says, this is just guessing.  The Apple Watch Sport, we know, 350 bucks already.  The Apple Watch Steel, the middle one, Sport Band, 750 bucks.  The Classic Buckle, $849.  The Milanese Loop, that's the one I want,  because it looks like water, right?  The Link Bracelet, $14.99.  Or, if you want it in space black steel, $18.99,  almost $2,000.  That's the middle of the road one.  He then says, the gold one, the edition,  will go up to $10,000.  Yep. Credible?  Yeah, I believe it.

I mean, there are people who will pay that kind of money  for a Rolex, which gives you worse timekeeping  than a cheap digital watch you can get from a garage.  But, you know, it's a fashion statement.  It's not actually a functioning timepiece.  I'm sure, as I say, there are fanboys who will pay that.  But, for the bulk of people who are gonna be buying this,  if they're gonna be selling a million on the first day,  they're not gonna be spending that kind of cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think the thing you have to understand is,  it's about Apple's traditionally always been about profit,  right, making profit, not quantity.  So, they're gonna make so much profit  on those fancy watches, the editions,  you know, they don't need to sell that many.  And also, think of the Chinese market,  in which they're well established now,  and in which it's a status symbol to own an Apple product.  Some people there are just gonna not care  and just spend the money.  And they'll do it again every two years.  Trust me on this, it'll happen.

Start time: 4360.54
End time: 4386.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  I'm not so sure about the Chinese market.  I've gotta say, I've spoken to someone  who's living out there at the moment,  and they're saying there's almost a kickback  against buying Apple at the moment,  because it's better to be seen  as being buying homegrown brands,  and Xiaomi is doing some really good stuff,  and Y is doing some really good stuff.  It's, I mean, I'm sure there are plenty  of rich people over here who will pay it,  but I'm not quite sure about the Chinese market.  And I don't think Apple's quite got the luck on that yet.

It's all gonna be, all will be revealed tomorrow.  One of the things he says is that the watch  is always measuring your heart rate.

Transcript:  I have heard from a very reliable source  that the Watch is not the only thing  that will be announced tomorrow.  The much-awaited new MacBook Air Retina supposedly,  now this comes from a source that is impeccable,  will be also announced tomorrow.  And it is time for Apple to refresh their MacBooks  because they are a little bit behind.  Both Dell, Lenovo, and others are using  Intel's Broadwell chips.  Those came out in January.  So it is time for Apple to do this.  It would be a logical time to do so.  A Retina MacBook Air would be a great product.

So the rumor is there will be one,  and only one connector on this new MacBook Air  that will do everything.  Power, data, video, yes, it can be for your 4K display,  all of it out of this new ethernet, everything.

Transcript:  That's just so much.  Again, it's Apple.  I'm sure they paid a lot of money,  paid a lot of attention to how they're gonna work that out.  I just need to see it.  And the whole hype stuff,  I had to shut myself down from it  because like you say, it's gonna cure leprosy.  You get so much hype in your mind.  Just shut up and get here tomorrow, one o'clock from me.  I gotta wait till afternoon.  You guys get to wake up to it.  I just need to see the stuff so I understand it.  Because when you say it, it's like,  what are you gonna do that makes that functional  for normal people?  Again, it's a finite group of people that are nerds  and love everything Apple does.  So we'll see.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm skeptical on the USB-C because it doesn't bring anything  to the table that Lightning and Thunderbolt don't already do.  And those are the two things that Apple is using.  And so I don't see them.  I mean, look, there's a type,  there's one device out there already with type C USB  and that's the Nokia N1 tablet,  which was announced back in December  and was finally, we were able to play with it  at Mobile Congress.  It's an Android tablet made by a part of Nokia  that is not absorbed by Microsoft.  And it's a very nice looking iPad mini clone  with a USB type C connector for charging and data and power.  But on a MacBook Air, I don't see it.  I think that they might have the USB type C connector  and include a dongle to connect regular USB devices  to the MacBook Air because it's thinner.  But I still think they would still need some sort of Lightning  or Thunderbolt connector to do everything else.  It would be quite a departure.  And they have their own standards.

Start time: 4765.14
End time: 4792.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the thinking is that this is not a standalone device.  This is not your only computer.  This is your new accessory computer.  I see.  And that in order to make it really thin and elegant,  and certainly this would get a lot of attention,  this single connect, this thing.  I mean, I can totally see Johnny Ive saying,  and we've eliminated all the connectors.  There's just one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Lightning is a better solution for the exact same problem.  Why would they go to USB-C when Lightning does it better?  It's a faster connector.  It's thinner.  It's reversible, it's Apple, it's got power on it.

Transcript:  The thing is also, the USB Interpol Implementors Forum,  the demoing the Type-C cable about six months ago,  and they were quite bearish about how quickly  it was gonna be adopted.  Nobody's done it.  Now, it may be that Apple has taken a jump on the game,  but as you say, they've got Lightning and Thunderbolt.

Transcript:  I see so many people with Apple devices  that still use a USB 3.0 hard drive.  I've got 30 of these things sitting around.  I could get a Thunderbolt drive, but I don't want to,  because if I wanna do something else with it.  It's too expensive.  You say these things.  The cables are expensive.  The mass market does not use those devices  for storage and things like that.  Everybody knows USB is they use USB SD cards, so whatever.  And this is designed.  You say, well, Apple does whatever they wanna do,  but that's not how the world works.

Actually, that's an interesting story.  Let's take a break and talk about.  Apple's plan with Beats is starting to become  a little bit clearer.

Transcript:  So, as long as we're talking Apple, let's talk about beats.  So the story line now seems to be developing  that Apple's not gonna offer a free version  of streaming at all.  Spotify, and the music industry hates this.  Spotify does, everybody does, RDO does.  Taylor Swift said, no, you can't.  I don't want you to put out my album on the free version.  Spotify said, well, too bad.  So Taylor Swift said, fine,  I'm not putting my stuff on Spotify.

Start time: 5195.02
End time: 5210.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It probably didn't.  It got them a lot of great publicity.  Taylor Swift isn't gonna be hurting  because she's still selling albums by the...  She sold a huge number of albums.  You know, there's an awful lot  of depressed teenage girls out there.  So yeah, I don't think it hurt Spotify at all  just for them to say, right, fine,  if you don't want us, you don't want us.

Start time: 5211.22
End time: 5258.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It does feel like though that she kind of represented  the music industry, planting a flag saying,  we think free services under value are what we do.  We don't get enough money out of it.  And apparently what Apple's doing is capitalizing on that,  saying to the record industry, don't.  And in fact, give us exclusives.  When you, we're gonna revamp beats.  It's gonna be, I think, 799, less than the $10  everybody else is charging.  And the goal of Apple is to have lots of exclusive launches.  So when Madonna's new album comes out,  they hope it's first available on Beats,  then a month later available everywhere else.  And that would, well, let me ask you, O Doctor,  what, do you listen to streaming music?  Do you use a streaming music service?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes.  And I'm just old school.  I like having things, quote unquote, on demand  Like I use iTunes Match so I can download something,  but I like having it on my phone.  And it's one of those things where Apple is behind the game  as far as a streaming service,  but they're ahead of the game  on getting people to pay for product.  So if they come to you and say,  hey, just pay us 799 or whatever the amount is,  a lot of people are gonna do that.  And a lot of people are gonna want to do exclusives  with them because it's Apple  and because of the title they have.  I think that they're gonna take beats  to another level with that.

Start time: 5310.94
End time: 5349.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Honestly, I think it's a remarkable turnaround.  I mean, you remember how many, 10 years ago,  how the record industry hated Apple  for dictating to them what price  they would sell their music at.  Whereas they wanted to sell at one price,  Apple was saying, no, you're gonna sell it  at the price we set it at.  Apple broke the album by selling 99 cent singles.  Indeed, and now it's coming back round  and Apple is saying, you know what guys,  let's play nice, we can both make some money out of this.  And admittedly, and I agree with what you're saying,  artists don't get paid enough on Spotify,  they don't get paid enough on Pandora,  it's an endemic problem for the industry.  I'm just intensely suspicious of Apple saying,  right, we're gonna be the gatekeepers on this one.

Start time: 5350.90
End time: 5425.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they did a really good job.  The reason when everybody hated it  is because someone else is taking control of the money,  right, but you fall in line  when everybody starts using that service  and you accept that and you get paid  and you realize that CDs are going away  and now even buying albums are going away  and streaming is coming in.  So for Apple to come in and say,  hey, you're gonna get more of a chunk of the pie  than 80% of those people that are paying on a free service,  especially when you're giving us exclusives  and bringing people in as adopters,  at least you're gonna get some money from me.  Even if you're skeptical, Apple,  you're gonna say, hey, at least if I go with them,  I know I'm gonna get money from something  if someone's playing my songs or listening to my album.  So it's a different dynamic  and you believe and trust in Apple now  if you're an artist, especially because a lot of artists  are doing independent launches.  I mean, they put albums out on iTunes  with no marketing, no video launch now.  Like Beyonce, her last album came out.  I love what Beyonce did.  Directly on iTunes overnight, Wednesday night,  turn on iTunes, a million downloads the next day.  And a video for each song.  No one knew she was doing it, it was boom.  Yes, yes, and I mean, not everybody's Beyonce, obviously,  but I'm saying if they could land places like that,  like how Jay-Z did his album release with Samsung.  I know people that wanted to buy the phone  just to get Jay-Z's album,  because they're Jay-Z freaks  and they need to have his music for us.  Didn't Prince give away his album

Transcript:  Bigger names is gonna be better, but.  I would never, ever say that the music industry  could get a clue, right?  These guys are clueless.  They're the definition of clueless.  So this clue they're getting from Apple is meaningless.  I think the real clue you get,  you take away from Taylor's, Taylor Swift's shenanigans  from Radiohead is, from all of these,  is the best thing to do is forget the labels,  create a fan base, build a community,  and go direct to them and eliminate all of this other crap.  Because who's supporting Taylor Swift?  Why could she do that?  Her fans who love her and wanted to buy the album.

Start time: 5481.34

They encouraged their fans to go out, share the music,  get it out online, build up a fan base,  and they went mega.  And they hate record companies.  Even in interviews with music journalists,  they insist on buying their own drinks.  They're that much purist about it.  But they built a great following about it.

Transcript:  Yep, if you've actually got the talent to do it, fine.  Record companies are very good at pimping out  crap manufactured bands.

Okay, let me tell you something.  There's countless artists that I could just name  and I'm not going to waste my time,  that started off doing their own YouTube thing.  And I'll just take somebody stupid like Soulja Boy.  Before anybody ever hoarded him,  he had millions of followers on YouTube,  millions of views on his videos.  Mac Miller, same thing.  He was two years on YouTube.  Had a huge fan base, but you know what?  Until he got on the radio,  regular people didn't know who he was.  I knew who he was because I'm on YouTube all the time.

Transcript:  Soulja Boy was on YouTube for two years.  He gets on the radio next thing you know,  everybody's doing a stupid dance  and he's known all over the world.  There's a different level.  Radio did not sell Soulja Boy's dance.  Okay.  Did it?  It's a stupid thing.  I'm telling you, yes they do.  When you see people doing all these dances,  you hear about it, but then as soon as somebody takes it,  and puts it on the radio and puts it on MTV,  it's viable, it actually goes viral,  as stupid as that sounds, but it gets to the masses.  So there's a lot of people that can make a career,  yes, doing their tours and doing their circus.  There's a lot of people who've never blown up,  they never will.  We'll never hear about them,  but they make a living every day.  But if you want to go mainstream,  you do need those things.  I mean, I'm not saying you need a record label to do it,  but you better find somebody who's great at getting you  on the radio or getting you on television  because you need those things.  And that's what the record company gets.

I hate to mention Soulja Boy in the same name as this  because it's going from sublime to the ridiculous,  but Justin Bieber, for example, was very big on YouTube,  but it wasn't until he got on radio  that he started making stupid amounts of money out of it.

In the real world, some people don't give their kids,  my daughter's got an iPod, an iPhone, a Mac Air,  but not everybody's bawling out like me with their kids.  So what do they do?  They give them a little headset  and they listen to the radio and they get in their car  and they put it on radio because there's no cursing  and there's no foul language.  They can trust the music that's coming in  and they get brainwashed.  There's a lot of things where a large market of people  can't afford to have an iPod and a Spotify account  and all those things that you're saying,  like that's where music gets discovered.  Music still gets discovered heavily on the radio  and I know a lot of kids that sit there and watch MTV Raps  and the Rock Channel and MTV all day long in the background.  That's how the real world still works.  And the world you live in in San Francisco  where people pay $4,000 for a shoe box  and a woman makes the news for living in a garage  for $4,000 a month isn't the real world.  It's not the real world.  Get outside that box and come over here and hang out.  Not with me because I'm still bawling.  Go back to folks that can't afford stuff  because you're diluted in your mind  about how you think the world works with discovery.  It's not real.  I still love you.

Transcript:  So it's interesting to me because the one thing  we haven't talked about at all so far,  we've talked about song purchases, album purchases,  streaming services like Spotify and Pandora,  we've talked about regular radio,  I've even brought up XM radio.  One thing we haven't talked about,  which I actually do listen to a lot, is internet radio.  And what I mean by that is people who are streaming 24 seven,  they're DJing, they're setting what,  I'm not picking what I'm listening to,  and I love those stations.  I listen to a whole bunch of them,  that a lot of them are in the Bay Area  for some reason or whatever, I guess, you know,  it's a bubble again.  But the point is, all you need for those  is like an app like TuneIn on your phone, and off you go.  They use Shoutcast, which is an old standard  that was created alongside Winamp, and they're excellent.  You know, one of them, that ones I like the best is Dog Lounge.  There's a bunch of them based in SF as well  that are like electronic and dance,  and they're really, really good.  Has anybody listened to those?  Because for me, the biggest thing that I hate about radio,  radio, official radio, like what we can get out of the airwaves,  is the sound quality is crap.  Even XM sounds like crap.

Start time: 6088.58
End time: 6098.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 6098.70
End time: 6122.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but HD doesn't sound that great, so.  I've listened to music that way also,  and there's a couple of stations in New York,  like Hot 97, I can't get them where I'm at,  so I always listen to their app,  I have their app on my phone,  and a lot of people listen to music like that.  Like, my one friend's from Seattle,  and they listen to, I'm like, what are you listening to?  And they're like, oh, it's a station in Seattle.  And that's what he's always listening to,  because they stream it online.  So there's different DJs, like what he's talking about,  and radio stations you can find.

I mean, if you want to listen to some quality radio,  and then I listen to CBC, the Canadian radio,  they have a bunch of really awesome streams,  playing some really awesome, talk about music discovery,  that's the best music discovery you can get right there.  Actually, the BBC has some great music stations.

Start time: 6154.54
End time: 6214.29

Transcript:  BBC, actually, it's kind of depressing,  because the main BBC music station, Radio One,  but that's aimed at the younger market,  and I've started listening to Radio Two now,  and it's just like, wow, tracks from the 80s and 90s,  yes, I am getting a little old on Saturday.  That is depressing, yeah.  But is it four, is Radio Four, somebody's-  Radio Four is gold.  It's our equivalent of NPR, but it's so much better.  Yeah, I love it.  But the big advantage where internet radio comes in  over something like Radio Two, Three, and Four,  is that you can get decent pirate radio,  or what used to be called pirate radio stations,  setting up and not having to,  if you're trying to tune into Radio Four  and getting through a jungle pirate station  on virtually the same waveband,  internet radio makes it so good for that,  but it's a question of getting to your market,  and pirate radio, what we used to call pirate radio,  spreads around by word of mouth,  and I haven't yet found a decent app  which allows me to skim through  the internet radio stations that are out there  and find something that sounds good.  So if you've got any suggestions, always up for that.

The other one is honestly anybody who's got a Mac  with iTunes installed, iTunes has a section-  Actually iTunes Radio is excellent.

I'm being a little devil's advocate  because in fact I do work in radio  and I have my fingers crossed for radio.

Now the radio was useless for getting into new bands  but then you went online, you searched for them,  you downloaded some stuff, you then went  and bought some albums.  That's the way it works now I think.

That they want to do discovery on their new beats thing  and they want people like this who are well known  for helping people discover new music  do the same on the internet.  All right.  Zane Lowe is in his 40s so he doesn't count.  That's what the chat room's telling me.  God, I'm sold.  We're gonna take a break.  Come back with more.  I want to tell you about the number one  most innovative company in 2015 according to Fast Company.  Who do you think that would be?  If you were gonna pick Warby Parker?  Yeah.  Let me get my Warby's out here.  Warby Parker is bringing changes to the eyewear industry.  Changes because frankly the eyewear industry  got subsumed by one big company  who artificially keeps the price of eyewear  frames and glasses up.  And the guys at Warby are classic internet entrepreneurs  who said there's gotta be a better way.  A better option.  No more bland choices.  No more overpriced frames.  Glasses at Warby Parker started $95.  That's including the prescription lenses.  I use progressives.  Those start at $295.  That's about half what I pay.  They also use these kind of cool digital freeform lens  so you don't see the, they're smooth.  They're a beautiful advanced progressive technology.  Digital application means you get a larger field of vision  so the design is more precise  than traditional models of progressives.  All glasses include, and no charge,  anti-reflective, anti-glare coating,  a hard case in cleaning cloth.  I am a fan of Warby.  Now you might say, well how am I gonna buy glasses online?  This, the Warby Parker Home Try On program.  So I want you to go to warbyparker.com slash twit  and choose five pairs of glasses.  They've got really gorgeous frames.  And they will send you this box  and you can try them on.  You can show them to your friends.  You can post pictures of yourself on Instagram.  You can say, what do you think of these?  These are, I just picked these out  because I need new frames.  They include a special frame box  and a prepaid shipping label  so it's very easy to return them.  You choose the frames you want.  If you haven't entered the prescription,  you can get them in sunglasses  but if you have a prescription,  give them the prescription details,  Warby Parker takes care of the rest.  Here's something nice.  For every pair, I like these.  I'm gonna go with these I think.  For every pair of glasses you purchase,  Warby Parker sends another pair to someone in need  using the nonprofits like Vision Spring.  I think that is so cool.  I like the OLPC.  Yeah, it is isn't it?  Yeah.  The OLPC, the one laptop per child.  One pair of glasses per child.  Get the free Home Try On,  get a free three day shipping on your final frame purchase  and do it all at Warby,  W-A-R-B-Y Parker,  P-A-R-K-E-R.com slash Twitter.

I mean, they are the Silicon Valley blue chip  venture capitalists.  Oh, absolutely.  They were there right at the start  and the stuff that's coming out in this trial is just,  you know, they had an away weekend  with investors and clients,  and it was decided not to have women there  because women might bring the event down.  You know how women do that.  Yeah.  And then one of the investigators put a graph in there  looking at how well women's partners' investment had gone  compared to men's,  and they were doing much better than the men,  but they weren't getting promoted.  It's looking pretty bad.  I mean, not Wall Street bad,  but by the sons of California, pretty bad.  It's-

Hillary Clinton, who was Secretary of State, as you know,  never had an official .gov email address  while she was Secretary of State,  even though she was supposed to,  instead was using her own private email address.  Now we find she was running her own Linux-based email server  out of her house.  Right on. Smart woman.  That seems good.  Smart woman.  Now, you're not supposed to do that, obviously.

I understand it's wrong because government email  is part of the public record,  and it doesn't belong to you, it belongs to the people.  For instance, every president's email  and documents and records, they're all public.  I mean, they're not necessarily open to the public,  but they're kept by the archivist  and eventually open to the public.  It's part of history.  And she knew those rules, clearly.  She's a savvy person.  On the other hand, I gotta give her a little respect  for first of all, having the balls to do this, right?  And then for running it out of her house.

Transcript:  Well, but the real risk is...  And this is why it's taken so long for this to happen.  This is what they call over the top, right?  It's on internet, not directly from the cable company.  But most of the revenue for most cable channels  comes from cable.  And when you do something like this,  you really risk irritating your most important partner,  which is the cable companies.  But if HBO goes over the top, it's just the beginning.  I think a lot of people are gonna watch,  see how this works.  If it does well for HBO,  I think they tried this in Scandinavia already.  If it goes well, I think you could see,  you could expect to see more of this.  Sling TV started it right with ESPN and CNN.  It's 20 bucks a month.  You get ESPN, CNN, some Disney channels.

If you compare the Comcast versus the Fios app,  for instance, Comcast has dedicated a lot of time  and effort to where I don't even have to go  to the HBO app anymore  because everything is contained in their system.  As far as Fios, they're not that well integrated.  So I still have to go and use HBO Go for a lot of things.  But Comcast is really dedicated  to giving you a great enclosed mobile experience.

I don't know about Cox,  but Cablevision and Cox have both said,  you know what, what we'll do is we'll bundle this  with our broadband package.  I think what's gonna happen is they're gonna get the money  one way or the other.  They're gonna recognize that people wanna,  okay, you wanna cut the cord?  No problem.  It's gonna cost you exactly the same  as it costs now for your cable bill.  And now how do you feel?

Start time: 7443.90
End time: 7465.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Because that's.  Well, I think it's also a question of the cable model  and how many things they can,  they're not gonna be able to bundle in  all the useless channels that you didn't want.  I mean, why on earth would I pay  for Joe Bob's Fishing Safari if it's just,  if I just wanted HBO?  It's a great show.  You don't like that?  That's a great show.

And he's like, well, if you keep television  and just lower it down to the lowest grade,  we can drop it down to $75.  And if you send us back your box,  we could drop it down to $54.  So I said, okay, so they cut me down  and I still been using this box.  I get so many channels with it.  And I'm like, well, why was I paying $150 every month?  And I feel like I still have 90% of the channels  that I had before I told you I was gonna cut it off.  It's so weird how they market that.  I'm like, so I'm gonna pay $54 to still have TV  and my internet when if I just had my internet,  you wanna charge me $85?  I'll just keep this TV then I guess,  for the reason of that.  Like the price differences, the price points are so odd.  It's like they just charge whatever they wanna charge.  And even when you drop stuff, it doesn't matter.

The rules aren't out and everyone's like,  oh, I mean, I've seen some figures,  15 billion in extra taxes.  People are just talking at their backsides on this.  Until we see the document, we don't honestly know.  And then the lawsuits will fly  and it's gonna get ground down into something  which is just about acceptable to all parties.  But I mean, we've got the same problems in Europe  with net neutrality now as well.  So it's gonna be years before this is sorted out.  That's the voice of reason.

Transcript:  I'm excited about Google's,  and I don't think Google's confirmed this rumor  is that Google will become a wireless carrier by bundling,  I think this is fascinating,  T-Mobile and Sprint connectivity with Wi-Fi.  They've signed deals for it already, yeah.  Your Nexus 6 will, according to the Wall Street Journal,  choose whichever is best.  And you'll pay less because of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  It makes sense.  I mean, the technology is there to do this.  You just got a whole bunch of entrenched networks  like Verizon and AT&T who don't wanna play ball.  And Google is desperate to get out there  and break this ISP stranglehold.  It's gonna piss Nexus 5 owners off

Transcript:  Well, I noticed the Republic Wireless has figured out  how to do a very elegant handloft  between Wi-Fi and I think they're on the Sprint network.  I used one of their Motorola-based phones  and it did, I mean, I was on the phone in the house  making a phone call on Wi-Fi, got in the car, drove off  and all of a sudden they hand off to 3G or 4G or whatever  and it worked.  It worked really seamlessly.  There was no bump or anything.  So I think the technology, I think that it does exist.  But this, according to rumors,  it could happen any day now in the next couple of weeks.  Monday, Sundar Pichai did confirm plans  for a wireless service, but no further details coming out.

She's like, can we watch movies and play Minecraft?  And I'm like, oh, okay.  So for four hours today, that's what we did.  We watched Once Upon a Time and Minecraft.  And I was like, oh my God.
