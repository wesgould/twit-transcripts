Transcript:  in tech is provided by AOL radio at AOL dot com slash podcasting.  This is twit this week in tech episode 76 for November 12th 2006 to zoom.  This week in tech is brought to you by Dell.  Visit Leo's picks for some great deals on Dell desktops and laptops at twit dot tv slash Dell.  Time to twit and a great panel joining us back from the dark side john c dvorak dot org slash blog.  Hello John.  Hello.  Haven't seen you in three weeks.  You've been on a boat.  I was on a boat.  We did a twit on a boat.  And right in the middle of the twit the captain gets on for six minutes to give us a scenery brief.  And I had to edit that part out.  Molly Wood is here from CNET's Buzz Out Loud.  She is the queen of buzz at CNET.  Buzz dot CNET dot com.  Hey Molly.  Hello.  Welcome back.  Thank you.  From I've been loving Buzz Out Loud by the way listening to you.  Just it's such a fun show.  Thank you.  You do every day what we try to do once a week.  And you.  And you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well we have.  We do a little shorter than you.  That's why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have a studio too which helps and everybody.  That does help.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And it's right down the hall.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like that.  Will Harris is here.  He's not right down the hall.  He's across the pond in Oxford England where it is midnight right now.  Hello Will.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Good morning.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Will is from bit tech.  Big dash tech dot net.  A great enthusiast site which I really enjoy reading.  In fact we're going to talk a little later about a great column you just wrote this week  on why dual core is a good thing for gamers.  It was a fantastic column so I'm glad.  Yeah I'm really excited by that.  But first of all.  Oh I'm leaving out our newest panel member.  Guy who's never tweeted before but we had on screensavers many times.  From Windows secrets dot com.  The king of the secrets.  Brian Livingston.  It's great to have you on Twitter.  Welcome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes nice to be here Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Brian's actually co-author of the new Vista secrets with my buddy Paul Thurotte who does  our Windows weekly podcast.  And that'll be out just before Vista comes out.  And also you've got some news.  You've got your Windows secrets newsletter which has a quarter of a million listeners  now readers now has merged with the Langa list.  So that's that's a lot of readers.  Congratulations.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Starting on November 16th.  Congratulations.  That's wonderful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  First merged newsletter.  And you're on for one million subscribers.  That's a that's a that's you're on for that reason.  But also because this was the week that Microsoft after after five years of struggle finally  went gold with Windows Vista.  Is it a big ceremony when they do that.  Do they they have a guy with a briefcase and handcuffs like a golden ticket anything or  is it just kind of quietly slipped cert to cert to slip to FedEx.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They actually had a power outage in the building that they were making the final gold CD and  they couldn't do it one day.  So that was one day of the delay right there.  You would think they'd have a generator or something you know.  Well it's not Florida.  So they don't expect those things up in Washington state.  But I don't know about the man with the briefcase and the suit the handcuffs but they presumably  have some way of getting it to manufacturing and I am told that it takes about three or  four weeks to make all the CDs and then they have to truck them to stores.  Meanwhile corporations are going to be starting to get their own master copies of Windows Vista  and will be installing it at the end of November.  But the consumers supposedly will have to wait until January 30th to stand in line in a  freezing cold to be the first to buy their copy of this to in a store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's been it's been five years since we had a Windows launch.  Will there be a big launch event as there was with XP and 95 or 95s?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft has an event in New York City on November 30th that is for the press and I  don't know what they're doing in January.  You would think that they would have had a big event if they were in time for the Christmas  season and I think a lot of people are crying that they didn't have it out before Christmas  because buying a computer in December with XP on it and getting a coupon to get Vista  installed later is really not as much fun as seeing a computer with Vista on it under  your Christmas tree.  You agree John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think it's fun getting a computer with Vista on it under your Christmas tree?  God no.  When are you running out to buy your copy of Vista?  Why?  I'm sorry.  When will they send it to you?  Let me put it this way.  When will you install it on a machine or get a machine with it?  I'll probably wait until the machine comes pre-installed with it for the next couple

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of rounds.  There's some new machines coming out.  There are some new chips coming out at the end of the year from both AMD and Intel that  might be good for Vista.  And there's also the issue of the hybrid hard disk.  Those haven't really gone into full production yet and I want to wait for those.  Will, you'll probably have one as soon as they're available for release.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As soon as they're available for review, yeah?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think so.  It would be good to finally get hands on with the final code and really see how it all panned  out.  I'm actually more anxious about installing it and seeing how it works on my MacBook.  From my point of view the problem with Vista, well not the problem with Vista, but Vista  comes with DirectX 10 and of course there's no DirectX 10 games yet for quite a while  so for gamers and enthusiasts there isn't really much reason to upgrade to Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, I'm thinking I'm going to build a quad core 64-bit machine, get a GeForce  8800 and Vista and then just wait until something I can actually run on that platform.  But boy, it'll be a nice platform.  Look at it.  Yeah, that's all I'll be able to do actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I agree with the hardware but I'm not sure you need Vista for it right now.  I've got one of those up and running in the office and it's very nice indeed, but not  with Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, Steve Gibson on Thursday will do a Vista security summary and not to steal  his thunder too much, but the main point he makes and I think Brian you'd probably agree  with this is that if you want to secure Vista, 64-bit Vista is the way to go even though  it doesn't run stuff as well, hardware won't work as well or may not be drivers yet, security  software doesn't work, but that's the way to go secure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  64-bit Vista requires special 64-bit hardware which many people don't have in their PCs,  but it will be much more secure than the 32-bit version.  That's because Microsoft has been able to take advantage of the hardware and keep applications  that are not part of the operating system from making changes to the operating system  kernel.  I think Internet Explorer 7 will benefit from that too with its patch guard technology  that prevents a website from changing virtually any of your system settings or your registry  and of course a lot of websites out there would very much like to change your registry  and make their own code run every time so they can be monitoring your keystrokes and  stealing your passwords and things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you have IE7 now on XP, it does not do that.  It will do that on Vista.  Will it do it on 32 as well as 64-bit Vista or is it only 64-bit?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Internet Explorer has some security features that require Vista and don't work  on Windows XP and Internet Explorer 7 will benefit from Windows Vista's security features  that only work on 64-bit hardware.  So we can go into that and draw a chart of what will and will not work.  No, please.  You're better off with IE7 than with IE6 and you're better off with 64-bit hardware  and 64-bit Vista than without.  I would caution consumers not to just go out and buy 64-bit hardware and 64-bit Vista  and install it and expect everything they're using today to run.  I don't even know everything that won't run on 64-bit hardware.  It's really a crapshoot whether things have been upgraded to work with 64-bit hardware today or not.  And if you really want to experiment and you know what you're doing,  do buy a 64-bit system and do install 64-bit Vista on it and see what will work and don't.  And let me know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Write a list and send it to Brian, windowssecrets.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, did you see that Jim Ulchin, who was the sort of outgoing head of the platform group,  isn't it, Microsoft, who said he was quite happy to let his son run Vista without any antivirus software installed?  That's how confident he was about security.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He doesn't say if it's the 64 or 32-bit version, does he?  He doesn't say that, no.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Plus, he doesn't say whether he allows his son to have email or surf the web.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, my son is only playing living books, but he's safe, boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just a minesweeper.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is an example where the headline writer really has not accurately described the content of the story  because what Jim Ulchin said in the story is that his son is restricted to only using sites  that Jim Ulchin has approved using parental controls.  So yes, if I can restrict my kid to only visiting Disney.com,  I wouldn't have to use an antivirus program because I think he won't get a virus from Disney.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, although he did say that he wouldn't say the same about Windows XP, though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Vista XP doesn't have parental controls, so you can't restrict which sites a person is going to.  Or if XP does have parental controls, a seven-year-old would certainly be able to disable them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here's a feature that he talks about I had never heard of called ASLR address space layout randomization.  He says that the address space is different on every Vista machine. That's bizarre.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, that's a very good feature, actually. If I could say something from Windows Secrets,  a lot of viruses do take advantage of the fact that the operating system has code  that's in a specific place in memory every time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So a buffer overflow can jump to a specific address and know exactly what's going to be at that address  and know it'll get executed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, if the virus runs one time, it can patch that executable in memory,  and then the next time that you open Notepad or something, you're actually running the virus.  That's an oversimplification of what's actually happening.  With address randomization, the virus doesn't know that patching a certain address in memory  is actually going to be some executable code that the operating system needs to run.  That's a very good feature. I wouldn't say that just addressing your space randomly  makes you invulnerable to viruses because any spyware that you download and you click OK,  and you say, I will let this program run, that program then runs.  It doesn't need to patch a space in memory because you just let it run.  So you haven't really made yourself invulnerable.  It does eliminate a class of viruses that do patch windows in memory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We are getting ready for at least six months to a year of Vista, Vista, Vista.  John, are you dreading that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I'm already dreading the way this conversation is going on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're bored already. And it's just beginning.  I mean, really, this is the beginning of it.  On the other hand, Brian, you've got to look forward to it because, hey, it's been five years.  There's probably not many secrets left in Windows XP.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I didn't think there were any in the first place.  So I've written 10 books called Windows Secrets and I declined to write a book called Windows XP Secrets.  Somebody else did and it was a bomb.  But I thought that XP was a terrible implementation because the ActiveX features that they put into Internet Explorer 6  were very dangerous, were certain to be taken advantage of by hackers.  And that's exactly what happened with XP.  Microsoft said XP was the most secure version of the operating system ever.  And those were lies. They were not secure.  They didn't know the operating system was secure, but they marketed that way.  And they have egg all over their face for having thousands of virus writers all over the world taking advantage of their terribly insecure operating system.  I think Vista is much, much better.  That's not saying a lot, but being much, much better than XP does make it an operating system that I would like to see people buy  as soon as they buy a new computer, they should really get Vista.  They shouldn't buy a new computer with XP on it these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Speaking of, you know, Dell is a sponsor on this program.  I don't know if Dell pays President Bush.  I know that Michael Dell is a supporter of President Bush.  You know where I'm going with this, Molly.  Yes, indeed.  I want to play a little clip of it for you of the president's remarks in which he essentially plugged Dell.  But do you think it was a...  Do you know what I'm talking about, John?  Have you seen this video?  You probably put it on your blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I didn't put it on the blog.  I'm familiar with it.  And there's actually some...  This is some sort of a violation, by the way, that to do this kind of thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He says people will be watching it on their Dell televisions.  He says, oh, I meant to say televisions, but I started saying tele...  And then I stopped and I said...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although when you watch the video, I watched it a couple of times just to make sure because it was so odd.  And I actually had it on in my office live and remember turning around going, did he just say...  It sure sounded like it.  What?  It doesn't seem like a stutter.  It doesn't really seem like he starts to say television.  Let me play a little bit of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And it's tough in a time of war when people see carnage on their Dell television screens.  The amazing thing about this...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That sure sounds like Dell television screens, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's absolutely deliberate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, on the other hand, it sounds like maybe he went to say like a curse word starting with D.  Damn television screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, Dell is a big company out in Texas.  Dell is in Austin.  They give a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Michael Dell is a big Bush supporter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  When people see carnage on their Dell television screens, the amazing...  That sure sounds like Dell television screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will say that of all the things that were happening that day, it is amazing to me that Dell would be that top of mind for the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what's really amazing is how much press they got out of it.  I mean, even if it was a misstatement, they sure got some mileage out of it.  I can't imagine him actually trying to say, give Dell a surreptitious plug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But who knows?  Yeah, that seems a little farfetched.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Dell doesn't make televisions, so...  They do make televisions.  They make HDTVs, you bet.  You can buy a Dell television and watch whatever you want on it, including president.  Okay, where can you buy it from, Leo?  Why, Dell.com.  In fact, if you go through Leo's Pigs page, I'm sure you'll find a great deal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they're getting a big plug here.  I was thinking about CRTs.  They're a sponsor, Brian.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We make sure we say their name as often as possible.  www.twit.tv.  No, actually, I think they got a bigger plug from President Bush than they'll ever get from us.  John...  No comment.  I know.  I sent you all my...  I went to NPR called and said, we'd like a review of the Zune on All Things Consider.  I said, I'd be glad to do it, but I got to get one first.  Sent a note to Wagner Edstrom saying, I'd like a Zune.  And it came out.  Zune comes out Tuesday.  It's coming Zune.  How did I get that?  Bum bum.  Bum bum.  And I got in return a Zune Reviewers Kit Agreement, which I sent to you all.  It's kind of restrictive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I find this thing very weird as a former reviewer and someone who's borrowed a lot of products.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've never seen anything like this.  Have you seen...  You've seen a lot of these, John.  Have you seen anything like this before?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, this is the most ludicrous thing I've ever seen coming out of Microsoft.  To be honest about it, they should be ashamed of themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In reviews, you must only reference the name of the device and services in the following way.  Zune, Zune Device, Zune Marketplace, Zune Software, Zune.net.  And you may not refer to the Zune Reviewer Kit in any way.  What?  I don't know what that means.  It goes on and on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the worst that that thing is unbelievable.  It says you can't take it apart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It says you have no permission or right to disassemble the Zune device.  To what extent?  To what extent?  I wonder, can you take the battery out?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Apparently not.  No.  You know, it's very common on web...  That's bizarre.  ...on enthusiast websites to take apart devices like this and show what's inside.  Absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what this says to me?  Somebody got in the company, either at the PR agency or at Microsoft or somewhere with  their...  I don't know, what can I say?  Their heads up their ass.  And they did this as some sort of an initiative.  Nobody caught it because I don't believe for a minute that the top guys at Microsoft wouldn't,  you know, fire somebody over this note.  I mean, this reminds me, I'm going to give the anecdote that I mentioned earlier.  Years and years ago, and somebody might remember the name of this product, but Xerox had a  desktop publishing package that was competitive with all the other ones back in the day, in  the early days of the laser jet.  And they were letting people review it and they sent out some similar documents such  as this to reviewers.  And apparently it was just done by some lawyer who just rewrote some old non-disclosure agreement  that had something to do with copying machines because there was a number of provisions in  there about how you're going to hold the company blameless if you get injured by the product  or if you drop it on your foot.  It's software.  Maybe it was a big box.  And it was this incredibly stupid document that really didn't even let you review the  product.  I ended up, of course, just writing a column about the document because it's more interesting  to readers to know what kind of shenanigans these companies do in the background.  And it's just foolishness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, needless to say, I didn't sign this nor did I review it.  And I'm not going to be reviewing it on Regis and Kelly or on the NPR.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Of course, by talking about the document, you are breaking the terms of the document.  No, because I didn't sign anything.  I just signed something that appeared in my mailbox.  It's like Fight Club or something.  First rule of Zune is don't talk about Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, don't sign those documents and you don't have to worry about it.  They give you the document.  They don't make you sign a nondisclosure before you get the document.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't disclose the contents of this document.  You have to sign that first.  That'll be next.  They'll go, I forgot to send this to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, they don't want you to disassemble the Zune because you might find out why it's almost  twice the bulk of an Apple iPod.  It is, isn't it?  And I'd like to myself, but I'm sure that somebody will take it apart and they've used  old flash RAM or something that is making it a lot heavier and a lot thicker than the  iPods.  You would think that Microsoft would be able to buy better technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It is bigger, but I like the rubberized plastic.  That's the new thing now is this soft rubberized plastic and it does have that.  Have you held one, Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have.  I have to admit, I mean, I liked that, but I was so distracted by its sheer hugitude  that I was a little distracted by that.  There is a reason for the hugosity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's got a big screen, so it looks, I mean, the video looks good on us.  I think it's got a good user interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But she means the depth, the thickness of the device.  The screen could be six inches, but it could be one-tenth of an inch thick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I found it surprisingly, I mean, to me it was much more, I found it more comparable  to like an Arcos device, like a portable media player than strictly, and maybe it's just  possible that it's been cast in the wrong light and it should be more fairly compared  to portable media players than to an iPod.  But it's way too large for me to ever want to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Poor Arcos had to send out a press release saying, but wait a minute, we've got a Wi-Fi  device, we've had one for you.  They're just kind of lost in the fog.  Have you played with this Zune yet, Will Harris?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No.  Well, unfortunately, we were a bit stuffed over in the UK because they haven't, or rather  a Microsoft bot came out and said that we weren't likely to see it over in Europe until  early 2008.  2008 was a bit rubbish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sorry to report that the document that they sent Leo also says in no way could he  send it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It does say that.  It says specifically Will Harris cannot have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, the problem is that they've, you know, Apple obviously took a while after rolling  out the iTunes music store in the States to roll it out across Europe and then all the  various different countries.  Well, Microsoft is only just now sort of starting on that tack.  So they've got it all sorted out for the States, but they now have to sort of get someone to  build a store in the UK, then get someone to sign up and do all these different things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're starting from scratch with the Zune.  There's a new store.  It won't work with Windows Media Player 11.  David Ewald on Forbes.com writes Zune stinks.  And he says, and it's not about the hardware.  He says the fact that this doesn't, you know, you have to, you can't use Windows Media Player  You have to use the new Zune software.  The slogan for the Zune store is welcome to the social.  Remember that they used to have socials like ice cream socials, like in the 20s.  Is that what is that their idea of hip?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Welcome to the social.  I don't know.  You know, that may be that that concept may be developed by the same idiot that did that  non-disclosure agreement they sent you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then get this.  And this is from Ewald's.  By the way, as soon as Ewald wrote this in online at Forbes, hundreds of pro Microsoft  comments, like, you idiot, you moron, Zune's great, came in.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Munchkins or back in work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they're aiming the Zune kids, I guess.  Here's get this.  He says this actually, Walt Mossberg's writing this in the journal, but he quotes Mossberg  to buy a 99 cent song from the Zune store.  You can't just give them a credit card number as you can at iTunes and buy a song.  You have to purchase a block of points from Microsoft.  And it has to be five bucks or more.  And then the weird thing is the points don't equate to cents.  Which are 99 cents are 79 points.  So you have to figure out what a point is compared to a cent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, it's weird.  And it's the same system they use on the Xbox 360.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's who's figured it out is the Xbox Live kiddies.  They get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, and Nintendo is going to do points with the Wii too.  I absolutely hate.  Well, I, you know, I was ranting about this and an astute listener wrote in to tell me  that the reason why is because none of the increments ever add up to a zero.  Oh, you know, a zero sum or a zero dollar amount.  So that you, yeah, you either always end up giving them some money or you end up buying  more points in order to complete a transaction.  It's just a constant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't they have enough of our money that we don't have to lend them four bucks to buy  a 99 cent song?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Unless it's a prime number of some sort, there should be a way to get the thing to zero  balance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it might cost you thousands of dollars.  Well, let me say, yeah, really 79.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is, what is John figure out?  What is the largest common factor of 79 with a zero at the end of it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You'll get there, but you'll be bankrupt.  And I have to go ahead.  Oh, I was going to say the most sort of dumbfounding thing to me about all of this is that after  spending so much time and energy creating the plays for sure DRM scheme, they kill it  sort of, you know, an alternative to the iTunes universe.  And they just come along and create a brand new closed ecosystem that doesn't even support  music that they themselves have been selling at the MSN music store, which is now gone.  It's crazy.  It just goes on and on.  It's ludicrous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Doesn't that suck for people that have bought music from the MSN music store?  You can't buy it soon and use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Or people who have bought music from any of the, or have a huge subscription library from  Rapsody.  It sounds like the Keystone cops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It does.  A bunch of guys bumping into each other.  They don't know what they're doing.  They're sending out that idiotic document that you got.  They can't get their act together.  It's incredible.  I'm telling you.  It's just this company has got nothing but these kinds of problems.  It wasn't for the Xbox people who seem to be the only group that put their act together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's Jay Allard who did this.  That's what I don't get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He ought to know better.  Well, Leo, you'd have to buy 495 songs before 99 cents would add up to an amount of a multiple  of $5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm glad we have somebody who can do math on this show for the change.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Everybody in Microsoft knows that people spend more money when they're spending points than  when they're spending dollars.  This is why you get tickets when you go to the amusement park.  You get tickets and you go on the rides and you forget how much you paid.  Microsoft is competing against one of the most sophisticated and attractive stores on  the internet, which is the iTunes store.  They are not going to make much headway with this kind of a pricing model when you can

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, can I throw in something here on this idea that you buy more with these points than  you do with real money?  You know, there's another aspect to this called barriers to entry.  That's barriers to entry, which is another marketing concept is when the more barriers  to entry that you create, the less sales you get.  And this is a barrier to entry in a big way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Look how simple it is to buy, as Brian is saying, look at how simple it is to buy something  on iTunes.  You click it, you own it.  You know, they've got your credit card number.  You do have to give that.  But once you've signed up, it's pained.  As I know, because I keep buying songs, I wish I wouldn't.  It's painfully easy to buy a song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and I will say that even though the masses are not totally aware of the DRM loop  that they lock themselves into when they buy music in a closed ecosystem like this, they  are starting to become aware.  And so I think it's a really bad time actually to launch a store that basically just locks  you into yet another digital rights management and content protection scheme that, you know,  is locking you into buying music that may in the future become obsolete.  People are starting to catch on to the fact that actually that's not that cool, whether  it's iTunes or Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want people to know it's not I'm not saying this because I'm bitter that I didn't  get a zoom to review.  I'm not bitter.  I probably will buy one on Tuesday, although now as this goes on, I'm getting less and  less interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a letdown.  I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt on the zoom, but boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now you talked a little bit about this on Buzz Out Loud, and I'm interested in your  take because I know Tom Merritt disagreed with you.  Microsoft, not the first time I understand that happens.  Yeah, Microsoft.  This is the most amazing thing on the zone has agreed to pay Universal Music Group a  fee for every zone sold.  We're not talking about a cut of sales for the music.  We're saying that every time they sell a zone, they give Universal a buck.  Yeah. The presumption being this is going to be, you know, people are going to use the  zoom to pirate music. I don't think so.  So we ought to get our money out of this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's unbelievable.  I think it's a horrible, horrible precedent for hardware makers to basically saying we  will allow you to extort us on the assumption that every single one of our consumers and  customers is a pirate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're all thieves. It happened in Canada.  The music industry got this done in Canada with blank media CDs.  Well, it happened here in the States with that tapes.  They weren't able to get it on blank CDs.  But every time you buy a blank CD in Canada, you're paying the recording industry a little  money because they presume, well, the only reason you'd want a blank CD is to steal from  us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think Canada also had or was trying to have an iPod tax.  Isn't that right? Or was there another country that had an iPod tax that was based on a

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  similar?  Do they do anything like that in Britain, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, thankfully, just ridiculously high rates of sales tax.  Oh, you got the VAT.  You got the VAT.  But no, thankfully, it just strikes me as amazing, doesn't it?  That Microsoft would even...  And there was a story that was saying Microsoft had gone out and talking to other record  industry labels about this.  It's like, why would you go out and offer this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Get this. Doug Morris, CEO of Universal, said, we felt that any business that's built on  the bedrock of music, we should share in.  Well, of course, they felt that way.  But why did Microsoft agree?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think, honestly, Microsoft probably feels and maybe it is true that this is the only  way they can make the content deals that they need to make, especially by...  And it probably extends to their ability to offer those movies and television shows for  download on Xbox 360.  It seems to me that they're trying to get as cozy as they can with the content providers.  Well, it sets a precedent.  This is no more than no less than a bribe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Morris said, we have a current contract with him, Steve Jobs, but at the end of that, I'm  sure we'll negotiate.  In other words, they're setting a strong signal that we expect the same thing from Apple.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't know if you're going for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The really confusing thing about the Zune for me, Leo, I really can't understand why they  are not using Windows Media Player after they've gone through this horrible antitrust  situation with the European Union and made such a horrible fuss over we have to have  Windows Media Player in Windows.  And you can't use the Zune with Windows Media Player to load it with music.  Microsoft has shown again and again that its products don't do well on the marketplace  unless Microsoft can use its domination of Windows to bundle the feature in with Windows itself.  Now, they have a lot of products and they have a lot of products that are successful.  Microsoft Office, for example, is on so many people's computers, but they bundled  Microsoft Office with a lot of PCs that were sold to people and it came with Windows in  Office the first day that you got your PC.  I can't understand how the Zune can be successful without Microsoft bundling it with  Windows. And if you have Windows, you can use your Zune.  And if you have a Zune, you can use it with Windows.  They just seem to have forgotten what makes their products successful, which is their  monopoly bundling of products with each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it would be good for them. I don't understand why they did.  It's just crazy. I have to say I like the Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ask them when you turn their agreement back over to them unsigned.  What the hell were you thinking?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I like the Zune when I first saw it, but I have to say now having that with all  of these issues, I have to say it doesn't sound like a very attractive, a very attractive  deal. On the other hand, speaking of Microsoft Office, at the same time as the  announcement, it kind of lost attention because of the announcement of Vista.  But they also announced that Office 2007 is done.  In fact, it got out of escrow a couple of days before Vista.  I guess they had a little race with the Vista developers to see who would ship first.  And a lot of excitement. I know Paul Therotte was very excited about Office 2007.  Are you equally excited, Brian?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think Office 2007 is going to be successful.  They might have taken a few extra days there before they RTM to hide the menus even deeper  in the user interface.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm with you. I like menus. I'm with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we've learned menus. We've probably used menus for 20 years.  We're wimps. We like the Windows interface and the mouse pointers and all that jazz.  People are going to have to use some imagination to understand Office 2007 because a lot of  the menus are hidden and you'll have toolbars and little buttons that do things and things  that you hover over and they do things for you.  I turn menus right back on. As soon as I start using Vista, I turn every menu right back  on because I like it.  But if people learn to use this new way of using Office 2007, maybe they'll think, oh,  I would never want a menu because I just have this toolbar here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I got a little taste of this with IE7 and it's very confusing.  You look for menus on IE7 and they're hidden.  They're not where you expect them to be.  You have to click things like a star with a circle or just strange places they've put  these menus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in Internet Explorer 7, I guess I've gone to the tools toolbar pop up and pulled  it down and said menu bar.  It just turns the menus back on.  Ah, there we go.  So then I have the same old file edit view favorites that I had before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's back. Thank you. You just saved me, Brian. That was a secret.  I've learned a Windows secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, I don't think we even have that in our book because pulling down the tools menu  and turning on the full menus.  Okay. All right.  Well, you're not our target audience.  Let's put it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The morons.  That's the dummies book.  You've got to write a dummies book for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My friend Woody Leonard is coming out with Windows Vista for dummies.  Maybe that's what I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll graduate the secrets later.  Interesting ruling in a Brooklyn, Brooklyn Federal Court.  The presiding judge in a RIA lawsuit has held that the plaintiff actually, I'm sorry,  the defendant can say, you know, my I'm sorry.  RIA is asking for $750 per song.  That's their standard statutory damage request.  The defendant said, well, wait a minute.  Who says it's $750 a song?  The actual wholesale price of a download is 70 cents.  Shouldn't it be 70 cents?  The judge said, oh, a good point.  Yeah, why is it?  Hey, RIA, why is it $750?  So now they're going to go back and have to explain why they want $750.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think it's obvious why they want $750.  Because it's a lot more money.  I'm amazed it took this long for someone to ask.  You know, it's interesting in all these RIA cases.  We're finding more and more that as soon as someone fights back and asks for, you know,  proof, the RIA immediately backs down.  They collapse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's, you know, it isn't the way it is always.  You know, if you pay lawyers by the month, you use them and you hope that the other guy doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And bullies can rarely back it up.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And I think what they're trying to do is to avoid ever having to lose a case.  Because once they've lost one case, then the whole PR campaign of we're coming to get you falls apart.  Because then, you know, it's proven that they can't get you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You say, come and get me, sucker.  The Mac guy, Justin Long, is gone.  I heard about this on, where was it?  Oh yeah, Buzz Out Loud.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the world cries.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The world cries.  It's your fault.  I ended up on CNBC.  It's your fault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why.  My fault?  Yeah, you and Tom and Veronica mocked the Mac guy.  You got him fired.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We were not alone in mocking the Mac guy.  You said he was snarky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, I don't know this story.  Can you guys brief me on it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you seen the Apple ads?  The new Apple ads have one of the great comics, John Hodgman, as a PC.  He's very likable, very cute.  He always loses because, you know, he's a PC and it's an Apple ad.  Justin Long, who is, according to his agent, an actual movie star, with such great roles as Dodgeball and Waiting.  Anyway, he plays the Mac.  And of course, you know, it's actually, they're funny.  You haven't seen these ads, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I've seen the ads, but I'm not sure what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what happened is they've done a whole campaign.  People like the PC guy.  They feel sorry for him.  He's funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, Hodgman's great.  Well, you've seen him on The Daily Show.  He's quite funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They don't like Justin.  They say he's snarky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's annoying.  He is.  He's snarky and he's like a mean Keanu Reeves.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he comes off as kind of smug and a little bit hateful and actually the opposite of what you would think you'd want your branded notification to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but the fact is that's exactly the way Mac people are.  Yep.  But usually you don't see Apple admitting it and building a brand campaign around it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think they notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what?  I didn't notice and you're exactly right.  They think it's a good thing.  It's just one of us.  Yeah.  Maybe that's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All the people that I see using PCs have suits and ties on too.  Oh yeah, there's another one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the time.  I am on my PC.  Well, I guess they've either fired or Justin's moving on.  He's in the new Bruce Willis Live Free or Die Hard movie.  So he doesn't really need the commercial work anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I love the way the Apple Insider story has that the report points out most people who watch the Get a Mac ads come away liking the PC guy  whilst quote wanting to push the Mac guy under a bus.  Successful campaign?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that I read a profile of him in the Los Angeles Times actually of Justin Long.  And he said that people come up to him on the street and berate him basically for being kind of such a turd.  Wow.  In these commercial.  It's a big, you know, and Apple is nothing if not a brilliant branding company.  So I think this is a pretty surprising misstep that they really did not realize that people would would look at Hodgman and go, I'm kind of more like that guy.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or at least I would want to be.  I'm kind of embarrassed because I actually like these ads and identify with a Mac guy.  But I guess I'm snarky.  We already knew that, Leo.  You're one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm one of them.  Actually, I like the ads too.  I thought they could have been.  I don't know.  You know, I didn't realize that that was going the wrong way for me.  I thought there were very creative ads.  I mean, Apple had always had excellent advertising concepts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But now that you say it, I can see how people, you know, would identify with the PC guy more.  He's cute.  He's funny.  He falls over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I say bring back that woman who threw the hammer into the television screen.  That was a bad one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We just want to see her again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That was an ad in slow motion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That only ran for one day.  And that was a great ad.  So maybe one can do it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It ran for one day and was shown 25 million times.  After that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  For free.  I think Ellen Fice and the hilarious.  They never aired that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, they didn't.  Which one?  She was the switcher that looked stoned.  He should have.  The stoner.  Oh, the stoner girl.  Yeah, but that's been all over the place.  That's a great ad.  I know.  I thought they did air it once.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they did.  I used a Windows PC one time and it crashed.  It was a bummer.  That was a great ad.  It was brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know if they ever aired it if it was just online.  It was funny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But it has been on the website.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's clever because maybe they did do that on purpose, knowing that it would get picked up.  No, I don't think so.  Pre-YouTube.  Pre-YouTube.  But really kind of ahead of its time in that respect.  I'm going to re-blog that ad, not to mention that is a funny ad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That ad is brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It never fails to crack me up.  It made her life miserable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The backstory about that.  I know.  She had nothing but grief after that ad.  In fact, for over a year or maybe two, if you looked up stoner girl on Google, she'd  be right at the top of the list.  She'd pop right up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's interesting because I hear that she and Justin Long are actually getting married.  That would explain everything.  I am a little actually angry with Apple because I bought a MacBook day one and now here they  upgrade it to a Core Duo, a Core 2 Duo without telling me.  You have a MacBook, don't you, Will?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I literally maybe a week ago just bought my second, I think about three days before  the Core 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You must be even more angry because it's the same price, but you get a Core 2.  Yeah.  And a dual layer burner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Leo, you've been complaining about this before you bought the machine.  I remember and the people out there can prove this by listening to some old twit broadcasts.  Before you bought that machine, you began to complain about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Haven't I been humiliated enough?  You know, John, on episode 74, we aired a best of and I don't know if you know, but  you'll be very happy that one of the segments in the best of was me saying, oh, Apple's  going down the tubes.  This Intel shift is the worst thing that's ever happened.  You're going, no, this is great for Apple.  You were absolutely right on.  And it's quite embarrassing to me now that the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, if you take enough swings at the ball, eventually it goes out of the park.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Very embarrassing to hear that one.  But then we have the I get no spam right after that.  So we're going to do, by the way, I don't know if you know this, John, but just in time  for Christmas, we're getting I get no spam bumper stickers.  Right.  Yeah, they'll be in the twit store.  Marco will be glad to see that.  Oh, yeah.  Well, yeah, we should give them a penny for every one we sell.  We're getting...  You should be giving us a penny.  I'll give you a penny.  I will share all revenue with you, I promise.  It's not going to be a lot.  You know, these stores don't make a lot of money.  I thought they would.  Nobody buy it.  We have had twit hoodies.  We've sold like 12 of them.  You're not doing it right.  I must be doing something wrong.  We have these new stainless steel mugs.  They're great.  You know, the coffee mugs with the twit logo on them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you're doing it right now by promoting a stainless steel coffee cup.  That's pretty interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What's the address of the store, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, just go to twit.tv.  It's right there.  We also have static stickers you can put on your car.  Is there something you can click on?  Yeah, it's on the left there, just where it says twit bling.  I just tried twit.tv slash store and it didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay, I'll fix that.  That's where you've gone wrong.  Yeah, that should help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  People don't enter twit.tv slash store, do they?  He just did.  Okay, I'll fix that.  That's easy to fix.  I can't find the mug.  You've only got the hoodie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's no mug.  This is why you're not selling anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plus, I think you need to dump bling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Bling is totally over.  Bling is too ghetto.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Get over that.  What should I call it?  What should I call it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But it's over.  Or, S-T-O-R-E.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You should call it like twizzle for your hizzle.  Okay, for shizzle and hizzle.  Or that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All that.  Twit.  It's either all the way there or not even close.  Twit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Word.  Yeah, it's hopeless.  It's hopeless.  Brian, do you sell stuff on windowssecrets.com like mugs, t-shirts, that kind of thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we sell a paid version of our newsletter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Which I subscribe to and paid for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And we won an award this year because we don't charge people a fixed fee.  We let them pay any amount they think it's worth to them.  And fortune, I think it's worth quite a bit.  It's not as much as cable TV a month, but people do act very generously.  Nothing is as much as cable TV a month.  We found that it wasn't really too successful linking to books at Amazon.com.  And I think this is why a lot of blogs don't really make any money.  Because they think, oh, they'll have Google ads and they'll make millions of dollars.  But it's really just a few dollars here and there.  Or they'll review books and they'll link to Amazon.com.  But you only get 5% or 7.5% from Amazon if somebody actually buys the book.  Amazon is paying you nothing for all of these people you're sending to them.  So I think that more like listeners supported radio to discuss something that's close to your heart is really a better model for blogs.  Well, that's what we do.  To ask people to contribute money.  We do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We give them the chance to contribute as much or as little as they want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, your one-time donation buttons aren't working in Firefox, so I can't even see what you're talking about.  Oh, great.  You're getting killed today, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think this switch to Intel is a bad idea.  A bad idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I think a stainless steel cup would be cool.  That is cool.  You should put that on the front page.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I will as soon as we got them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As soon as we got them, we'll put them in there.  You got the vault.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happened to all the shirts and then hoodies that you were supposed to get?  We got hoodies.  We're going to get some more shirts.  Oh, you want one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll get you one.  You say that every time.  Well, we only sold 25.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's because you're not pumping it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know.  Yeah.  I could learn something.  I need to give them away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what we do.  Do you give them away?  Yeah, we give them away every Friday.  Oh, give me one.  All right.  One one.  I think you're going to look good in it.  It is Kelly Green in a big, big way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's hideous.  What is it?  It's Kelly Green.  What is it?  Kelly Green.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's just a Buzz Out Loud t-shirt.  It's a bright, crazy, scenic green with a sort of yellow logo.  Oh, it's a scenic color.  Hey, I definitely need that.  Sometimes, you know, the bummer part about working in a big company is you have a design  department and they think that Kelly Green is like a brand statement instead of a terrible  fashion mistake.  But people still seem to want them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We need a design department.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Forrest Green would be OK.  How about it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Talking about design, hasn't CNET News had a little bit of a refresh?  Yeah, all of the Web 2.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All of the Red Ball properties, so CNET, CNET, CNET.com, News.com and Townlow.com all got  a redesign.  It is very web 2.  It's all pastel.  And actually, I'm happy to say it is a little tidier than past iterations of CNET.  A lot tidier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is it because Shelby left that everything's changed?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They lost their art director some years ago and they've been floating all over the place  with this design over there.  I like the Red Ball design.  I think the original stuff that they were, the original direction they were headed in  the early days in 95 or so, I think was superior to what they're doing now personally.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think we're coming back to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like, you are actually, with CNET TV is very much like the early days of CNET.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, well CNET TV is an all different sort of look for sure.  But I like the CNET TV look.  I sort of like the new CNET, although I'm not a big fan of the web 2 turquoise text.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a big one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I just don't really dig it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That'll be dropped on your head.  I like contrast myself.  I like the Navy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a big fan of Navy.  Well, you're in the Navy.  But our site is looking a lot better.  I'm very proud of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How about black on white for a text concept?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No.  What?  That's so 80s.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How would you know what to click?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  NTP, the folks who sued RIM for $612 million are now getting sued by a 43 year old software  developer who says he did much of the work that created those patents and now he wants  his cut.  You were an NTP fan, John C. Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I read a lot about the whole story.  I wasn't a fan by any means, but I didn't think they were bad guys for doing what they did.  They weren't just a, you know.  They weren't just a company.  But they seem to have evolved into what everybody complains about, which is a company that's  just out to sue people.  Right.  Now, I don't know that for a fact and I have to get back into the story, but I haven't  really followed it for the last six months.  I'm not sure, but this is kind of an interesting irony, if true.  You're kidding.  The sewers get sued.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He wants to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, and it seems to have happened partly because they attracted so much attention by  filing so many lawsuits and getting so much money out of RIM.  Right.  But then this guy said, all right, then I'm cashing in too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At the time, John said that the NTP patent was good.  In fact, they deserved to get some money out of RIM.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't know, though, because now a lot of those patents are under review and at least  two of them, I think, were found to be not valid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right about at the time of the settlement, as a matter of fact.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right.  And seven of them are being reexamined.  Some have been rejected as invalid.  So I find their current, at least I find the fact that they're suing Palm to be a little  sketchy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I agree with that.  It seems odd, especially since it just seems odd.  Again, I'm not having kept up with the story.  I guess I should.  And I can maybe say something smart.  Nah, why start now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, why bother?  Google sends us being smart.  Google sends out the commasuit to worm and email to 50,000 members of its Google video  blog discussion list.  Boy, that's dumb.  It's not.  I had to hurt.  I can't understand why they did it.  I don't understand how it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why did you do it?  Google stand why there are 50,000 people subscribe to a blog about Google video.  That's surely the point of the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You deserve a virus.  What are you?  What are you subscribing to that for?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I guess we pretty much wrapped this thing up.  The one thing I haven't done more than a few times is mention Dell.  And I do want to thank them for supporting the podcast financially and encourage you  to visit the Leo's picks page, which is logically enough at twit.tv slash Dell.  And anything you buy there, of course, helps us.  And I'll make sure just for you, Will Harris, twit.tv slash store actually goes somewhere.  And just for you, Brian, I've fixed the donate any amount button.  So please feel free.  Figured out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Doesn't open in a new tab in Firefox.  No.  You try to open it in a new tab.  It doesn't do anything or it just opens the same page that you were already on.  That's a bug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So you were doing the control click thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, in Firefox, if you click the middle button and now in IE seven, I click the middle mouse button, it opens a new tab.  What kind of old mouse are you using?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, the scroll wheel.  He's talking about the scroll wheel.  The whose back scroll wheel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Scroll wheel.  They'll never go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John's still using one of those balls that you rub with the bottom of your palm to move this cursor around the screen, I'm sure.  So they'll never go anywhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I'm using one of those, but not for the cursor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was using IE four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We.  Yes.  Hey, nothing.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We didn't get a chance.  We didn't do we didn't do multi-core.  I was just about to say that.  So let's let's let's wrap up with a quick look at a bit dash tech dot net.  Will Harris, who is saying you do need multi-core.  You know, I got in this debate way back when with Intel saying who needs a two gigahertz process, a single core two gigahertz processor.  And I guess I was wrong there, too.  This is the day for me to say I was wrong.  I don't I like multi-core.  In fact, I'm running a quad core Kenfield Mac Pro and I love it.  I love all that power, but I don't use I never see it go above, say, 50 percent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, that's I mean, what we're saying was that we we we until just released its new sort of Nate, its quad core processor, Ken's field.  And there were loads of people saying, oh, why would you bother?  And it's so expensive.  And do we really need this much power?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, I announced an eight way workstation, didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know, they said the same thing about the four eighty six when it came out.  It's unbelievable.  It's unbelievable how the same thing happens every time a new chips released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Anyway, go ahead. It is a lot, though.  Actually, I'll tell you the problem.  And maybe you have a defense for this will.  The problem is, yeah, it's great.  Eight cores, very fast.  You're I.O. bound.  You're so fast that the hard drive, the ram, the bus, all of that's keeping you from doing anything useful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, the the the desktop version, Ken's, which is four cores, that that isn't so I.O. bound.  It's it's it's not so stressful that it's that it's a problem.  But certainly in the workstation, especially if you're using all those all those cause of virtualization and things,  then I.O. really does start to become a bit of a problem, which is why I think the rev that we'll see in the new year will address that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Leo, it depends on what you're doing, because something like Microsoft Office is single threaded.  It's not benefiting at all.  It's not going to take advantage of two or more processors.  So for the server at Windows secrets dot com, however, we found a major improvement when we switched from older PC that we're using as a server to a dual socket, dual core, opt run.  And that means you have two CPU sets, each of which has two cores.  And when you're doing something like an Internet server feeding pages out and the pages are usually the same or you're hitting a database, which is the same,  you can be serving four times more people with a dual socket, dual core.  That's not the kind of work that most people are doing on their desktops.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But even there you'll get I.O. bound. I mean, if the hard drives can't keep up with you, doesn't avail you anything to have a faster process.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Most of our pages are most of our pages are 30 to 50 case.  So the I.O. is not really a bottleneck for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think the new hybrid hard disk will make a huge difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You said this. Now, what is this hybrid hard disk?  This is the part of the Vista thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Everybody's going to be using these things.  It's a disk that has essentially is similar to the old caching controller disk where you have a lot of memory, but these are all flash based.  And how much memory?  Two gigs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Wow.  Typically, that would probably will make a difference since you do tend to load the same data over and over again.  Have you tried any of these, Will, at all?  Have you benchmarked any of these?  Yeah, we haven't benchmarked one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I had a bit of a fiddle with one and we found that there were some ways Intel's got some good sort of optimizations of things in beta.  For example, we found that you could run Battlefield 2 that would like it is notorious for being a very slow loading thing and that would load a lot quicker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the question is, were you fiddling while the ROM was burning?  I'm sorry. I just had to throw that in.  And apparently went right over everybody's head.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So I was going to laugh, but I was on mute and then I didn't hear anyone.  You don't have to laugh. It's all right.  I did want to say to Will, though, before we signed off that I am totally lame and late to the party and have only recently discovered bittech.net, but I am hooked.  Isn't it great?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Excellent. I'm very glad. Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you're not yet hooked on Buzz Out Loud, just listen to one episode and you will be Tom Merritt, Veronica Cartwright.  Belmont.  I always want to call her Veronica Cartwright because, well, when I was 12, I was in love with Veronica Cartwright on Lost in Space.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Many people are in love with Veronica Belmont.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's very adorable. And of course, the wonderful Molly Wood.  And that is at Buzz.Cnet.com. Highly recommended. And you're all over CNET TV too now, which is great.  Yes.  And one last minute note. Join me and the Pick Spot team, plus Chris Perillo and Don Tapscott via conference for our Undo.TV preview party.  Yep. We're almost there. It's this Tuesday, November 14th, November 14th, 7 p.m. in Toronto at the No Regrets Restaurant and Lounge.  We've done many events there and it's a wonderful place. We're going to preview the new Undo.TV site.  We're going to demonstrate the technology. We'll have invitations there for those who want to participate.  Complimentary hors d'oeuvres. It's going to be a lot of fun. 6 p.m. on. No regrets to RSVP or get directions.  Visit P-I-K-S-P-O-T dot com slash preview. Undo.TV is the future of tech TV and we're very excited about it.  And we hope you will come visit us if you're in the Toronto area this Tuesday at No Regrets.  Windows Secrets is at WindowsSecrets.com. I am a paid subscriber.  Now that Fred Longa's Longa List, which I was also a paid subscriber to, has merged, I'm very excited.  This is going to be kind of the ultimate Windows newsletter. How do you get it through the spam filters?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we ask people to whitelist our email address.  And you don't have a problem because you're sending out a quarter of a million newsletters every week.  Well, we will be on November 16th. I haven't done it yet.  So we calculated that it's going to take us more than nine hours to send it to all the subscribers  because our email service provider, which is a broadcast email company, can guarantee us about 30,000 messages an hour to go out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And you don't have to worry about getting blacklisted or listed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, we do all the time. AOL has a problem. Sometimes if you see a link in there for something that a lot of spammers have also written about,  they say any email that has a link to this site must be spam, even though we're supposedly on the whitelist at AOL as being very good guys.  But the only thing that we found that works is to have people put editor at WindowsSecrets.com into their whitelist.  And any email that is from that address, that's okay. Don't put it in the junk folder.  That seems to work with most of the email clients that you have out there. Outlook, Outlook Express,  Eudora, things like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just wonder if newsletters are ultimately doomed by spam and if maybe RSS or some other form of push.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes, all email newsletters are doomed and every other publisher should quit publishing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  WindowsSecrets.com, pay what you think it's worth. And I think it's worth an awful lot.  Dvorak.org slash blog is absolutely free because John makes so much money on Google Ads and Amazon affiliate fees.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, right. I make like nothing. I'm losing my butt on this thing. But I feel it's an important public service at Dvorak.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  As is Twit. And I'm very glad to continue this public service for as long as you will listen.  We do thank you for being here. We thank you all for joining us and we'll see you next week.  Another Twit is in the can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Service back to the screen at that firewall.
