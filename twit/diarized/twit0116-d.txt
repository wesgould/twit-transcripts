Transcript:  This  episode.  This is Twt this week in tech episode 116.  And for the first time ever I actually have a title for the show before the show even  begins.  Zune Rhymes with Doom.  Is that right Kevin Crewell?  That's Cnet.  I'm an homage to Cnet.  Cnet there.  And homage.  Yes.  At least that's one of the Cnet writers had proclaimed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, it doesn't.  You know it doesn't really mean anything to me.  Yeah, it doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know it doesn't really rhyme.  Come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, oh, Mr. Literature Professor John C. DeVargue.  Let me introduce the panel and then we'll get to the bickering.  Kevin Crewell is back.  He is of course at NVIDIA.  Before that the editor in chief of the Micro Processor Report and often one time contributor  to Twt.  We just kind of lost track of you Kevin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Transcript:  I've been haunting you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And I just wanted to get that in.  leoville.com slash blog.  John C. DeVargue dot org slash blog is here.  I did that as an homage to you, John.  Drinks and everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thanks for having me back Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Big story of the week.  The recording industry socks it to her.  She's a single mom from Minnesota who was sharing 1702 songs through Kazaa.  Does anybody still use Kazaa?  Recording industry suitor for 24 specific violations.  The judge told the jury that if she did it, you know, if she was just offering those songs  regardless of anybody downloading them, that it was it was a crime and the fine could be  anywhere from just a few hundred dollars per song to thirteen thousand dollars per 24 songs.  The jury, I think, decided to go right down the middle, charge her nine thousand two hundred  fifty dollars per song.  To do the math, two hundred twenty two thousand dollar fine for Jami Thomas of Minnesota,  30 year old single mom.  John, you think Jami might have made the wrong decision to fight this one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She got herself in a Jami.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's in a Jami, all right.  Oh, is this the rhyming show?  Everybody's going to rhyme.  Yeah, if you would.  Oh, by the way, yes.  Everything that you say has to be an iamic pentameter.  Everything would be nice, but not required.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now I, you know, I kind of just saw the story pass by because I wasn't going to really  spend a lot of time.  Why not?  This is huge.  This was expected to happen.  But the question on my mind, and did anybody explain that, you know, with some of these  systems that you I mean, this I know this was the case with I think it was the case  with Kazaa too, that if you get yourself into a situation where the thing auto loads when  you're booting your computer.  No, it's normal.  It just sits there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And anything you've downloaded goes into a folder, which is unless you say not to automatically

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  share.  And there's a lot of naive users out there that probably don't know that this is actually  going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jami wasn't so naive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, she claimed she was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You know, if you read the details, it seems like Jami kind of really did walk right into  this.  You said John that the EFF.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's not so that's wait a minute.  You're telling me so that that means she's not naive that she walked into this.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For instance, for John, what are you becoming?  You become the nitpicker of the crew.  She hears.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, by the way, I want to interrupt right here because somebody called in and said you  were really picking on Leo last time you were on.  You were you were mean to him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Not me.  No, you weren't mean to me.  You were mean to that other guy, Tom Merritt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, was I mean to Tom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Remember?  Yeah.  Oh, you were so mean to Tom.  He started synopsizing his book.  He said, all right, that's enough of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, I know I was complaining about Tom's book, which, by the way, I think people  should go out and buy.  I was complaining about the fact that he used Lulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, yeah, but then he started to talk about what his book was about.  You know what?  The funny thing is, neither Tom nor I thought anything of it.  You know, and then we start both started getting all this email saying Dvorak was so mean.  And no, I apologize to Tom.  Tom doesn't need an apology.  He doesn't want an apology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because I kind of stiffed him on it.  You know, I didn't go to I was supposed to I was scheduled last week to do one of their  broadcasts over at CNET and I didn't never put in the calendar.  And that was so that's two strikes, Mr. D. So now I think he hates me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think we ought to fine you $7,920 per non appearance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, then I'd be broke.  I'm telling you, I'm getting flaky in my old age.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So according to a former music executive, Chris Castle, this woman, quote, found lawyers  who tried to make her the Joan of Arc of illegal downloading.  Are they going to write the check?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, you know, Leo, it's just amazing to me.  I was when I heard this story, I went and I looked around and, you know, more than anything,  you know, there's such a dangerous precedent and everything else.  But if you look at the copyright law, it says that, you know, we can charge per per incident,  like 750 up to 30,000 or something like that per active infringement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And if she did on purpose, if they could, if they could determine intent, $150,000 per  song.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, am I missing something here?  But you know, when I go to an iTunes, it cost me 99 cents for a song.  I mean, in what world is this song my active infringement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is now I'm not a lawyer, but this is what we call stat, what they call statutory  damages as opposed to actual damages.  So in other words, they're not going to look for actual damages.  How do you prove how much, how many sales they lost?  How do you demonstrate that?  So their lawyers said, no, we're going to go for the statute.  The damages specified by the statute.  And remember, this statute doesn't just cover music.  It covers movies, covers anything copyrighted.  So these are the damages that the statute specifies.  The law specifies.  And they do provide quite a range.  Now, why the jury decided 9,250, I don't know, but probably because it was right, you know,  kind of in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a lot.  They were trying to be balanced.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah.  Fair and balanced.  But it's a peer to peer network.  So therefore, even as she had stuff on her PC, she was sharing with other people because  it would up, when she uploaded.  So that's part of the damages.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So here's the deal.  She said, oh, I don't know anything about it.  I didn't do it.  But it turned out that the login that was being used on Kazaa was a name that she commonly  used on forums and so forth.  Her lawyer said, well, somebody was impersonating her.  Then she tried to, she pulled up.  This is, I think, what probably convinced the jury.  She said she had swapped out her hard drive the year before the record companies were  able to prove that she swapped it out just a few days after she got a notice that she  was illegally file sharing.  Oh, it's kind of a smoking gun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So now you know, let's go back to your basic thesis that she was not naive.  She was not naive.  How did she make all these mistakes that she was not naive?  I see what you're saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She could have covered her tracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, she, my point was she knew what she was.  She knew she was sharing music.  She knew once she got that notice, she was in trouble.  She tried to cover it up.  And I think that's what the jury saw and said, well, you know, we're going to, we're going

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  to she should have just broken the tears and just, you know, begged for mercy and said  she didn't know it was wrong.  She got bad legal advice.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But the other thing is she could have settled earlier.  She didn't have to go to court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, this is, this is how it usually happens.  The RIA comes after you and says, but for $5,000, we'll forget it.  And in fact, this is one of the few cases has ever gone to court.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it sets an ugly precedent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The EFF apparently encouraged her to pursue it.  They thought they had a good case, although I think as the case evolved, they probably  regretted that.  Although Fred Lorman at the EFF says a number of attorneys have come forward saying Fred  von Loman said, saying that they would be glad to defend her in an appeal.  So I imagine there will be an appeal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, you can make a name for yourself if you win this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Sure. Or even if you lose it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know about that part.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this is a, you know, I don't know if there's much cause for appeal here.  I'm not a lawyer again, but boy, it seems like they caught her dead to rights.  The law is very clear.  The one thing people were saying, maybe the judge went a little far in his instructions  to the jury.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just take it doesn't take much.  Just one little slip up and you go to appeal.  Right. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So no word on whether she will appeal.  There's a good article by Declan McCullough on CNET, the Econoclast on the jury instructions  and why the jury really had to do what it did.  The instructions were very clear.  The judge said, first of all, the act of downloading copyright song recordings on a  peer to peer network without license violates copyright.  Period. Instruction 15, the act of making copyrighted sound recordings available on a  peer to peer network violates copyright regardless of whether anybody actually  downloaded any.  So the jury didn't have to determine that somebody actually downloaded it.  And finally, they he said, you can award him award to the RIA statutory damages, which  could be seven hundred fifty to thirty thousand dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And if you found willful, that's when that's where the jury could have stepped in and  said, OK, we can follow all that instructions.  And since you have this, this, you know, there's a there's an option of what you can  make this statutory damages.  They could have made it a nickel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, they could have made it seven hundred fifty.  It has to be at least seven hundred fifty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they could I think they could have made it a nickel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Are you an activist, an activist jury?  Is that what you want here?  Absolutely. Well, even even seven fifty a song is not is not insignificant for twenty

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  four songs. You know, it's only twenty four songs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's so stupid. Well, she was sharing seventeen hundred, but the RIA picks twenty four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  OK, you know, I look at this and I say there's no doubt in my mind that she was guilty  and she did what she did. And I don't think there's any debating that.  And I think that, you know, to some extent, she should be charged something.  But, you know, how many more people are out there and how many people are worse than  doing a share, you know, ten thousand, twenty thousand, thirty thousand, or even just the  pirates over, you know, in Asia and everything else.  I mean, why is it that that we're basically just focusing on, you know, the single mother  and we're just leaving all the big guys out and do what they want to do?  I mean, that's always been my biggest issue with this low hanging fruit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, is is is Jami Thomas the reason CD sales are down eight percent?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Absolutely. It's the Jami Thomas's of the world.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  All of them. Well, it certainly sends a strong message.  I mean, if you're I imagine more than a few people ran to their e-donkey and turn it off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what it really does?  It turns you know, all the kids in the colleges and high schools that do a lot of trading,  it it makes it's going to it's going to up their game a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Screw dad. So I think you're right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it just pisses them off more than anything.  And they're going to go out and say, listen, you know, I'm going to do twice as much as  to come get me. You know, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I know. I don't think it's I think they're going to make it.  They're going to do twice as much anyway or how many they're going to do.  But they're going to do it with very discreetly in some way.  I mean, the original MP3 scene, which began in the 90s, you know, started by these guys  when the first MP3 came out, there were college kids trading and the record industry  went after them because there was you could go on the Internet and just look up,  you know, a song and you still can be.  Well, I know, but it was to an extreme.  There used to be MP3 search engines and you could find these huge sites  and you could just download whatever you wanted.  And nobody, you know, was just a small job people anyway,  because nobody knew what an MP3 was.  Go to Seek Pod. It's S-E-E-Q-P-O-D dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You can find any song for playable song on the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You want to give the public that URL again, Leo?  Yeah, S-E-E-Q-P-O-D.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But I know what you're saying.  Go ahead, finish your point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was the fact that they cracked down.  And so the kids, you know, they took all these sites off.  They went to black sites.  They went. They took action to prevent this from happening again.  And they went underground and they just keep going deeper and deeper  and deeper underground and harder and harder to to dredge up.  The more that this takes place.  Well, and that's the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, they started these lawsuits in 2001.  There have been 26,000 lawsuits or at least subpoenas.  And if you look at the amount of songs being shared,  the number of people using peer to peer networks since 2001,  it's it's doubled every year since it hasn't even it hasn't slowed it.  And then I'm just looking at Seek Pod.  I typed in Metallica, which, of course, is the band that is most famous  for abhorring making a fuss. Yeah.  And every minute I could play.  There's let's see 40, 507 songs, different Metallica songs for play,  for download on websites.  They're not underground, not hidden right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, do you can you do you really think you can get those songs?  Because, you know, I think over the years,  I think there's a lot of dead links.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Listen to this.  That's Metallica, baby.  All right. Playing right off the Internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How do you like that?  You know, these are all real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You win. My whole point is moot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not it. No, it's not.  Your point is right on.  But it's even worse than you're saying.  It not only have has it as it hasn't even driven them underground,  it hasn't slowed it in the least.  Well, they're going to have to deal with this.  Well, and that's kind of, you know, I'm kind of thinking  and I talked about this on the radio show.  I mean, this is the law.  The court enforced the law.  The jury enforced the law.  They didn't really have that much choice.  It's very clear. The law is very clear on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A lot of laws that people just disobey.  You know, there's scoff laws out there that won't follow any laws.  And then there's a lot of dead letter laws.  If you really start looking into it, you'll find a half.  You know, I mean, in any state, there's there's like thousands of laws  that aren't being enforced.  They're called dead letter laws and they can't be enforced.  And so any law can be just ignored by the public and then not enforced  by the officials.  I mean, these guys obviously have to enforce this law if they want to keep  keep it in place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  This is a constituency that really wants this law to be in fact to be used.  And there's a lot of dollars at stake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's the point is there's nobody going to court saying, hey,  he grazed his cow on my lawn.  But there is obviously somebody going to court and filing a lot of lawsuits  saying they're stealing our songs.  I was not doing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the point is, is that I think we've all made is not doing him any good  with all this growth in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My point is that the law needs to be changed.  If you really want to do something about this, you can't, you know,  get mad at the jury or the judge or even the recording industry.  You just have to change the law.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We got to go to Congress, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you got to go to Congress and say, this is this law doesn't make sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, the problem with Congress is that they have so many lobbyists now  in the United States that they dangle a few hotties in front of a couple of  these horny old senators.  And the next thing you know, they got anything they want.  Actually, Jamie Thomas is kind of cute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, maybe maybe hotties are, you know, hotties may not work with senators  anymore.  Well, it could be, you know, gay hotties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Come easy.  He's a cute boy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't know.  Just go to a bathroom, you'll be fine.  You guys are bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You're bad men.  Hey, by the way, I got a phone call from some anonymous guy named Tyler,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  who's who wants me to say that he that he's he's coming out of the closet.  So Tyler out there.  Now, actually, you say this drunken kid calls me up.  He says, Hey, can you say that Tyler's cool?  So like, how do you get your number?  Yeah, three months ago.  Well, you know, you can get my number if you try.  You're the most unlisted guy in the world.  I'm not going to do this for anybody else, by the way.  I'm not going to do this for anybody else.  I'm not going to do this for anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm not going to do this for anybody else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not going to do this for anybody else.  Just from drunken guys that call you.  It's like two months ago and I keep saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'll do it just as a as  a lark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But next time you're drunk in a bar, devorac.org slash blog.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Drinks on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  New Zune is out.  Several new Zunes.  And actually, one thing that gratified me is for the first time ever, Microsoft is actually  supporting podcasts.  There's a podcast menu item on the new Zune.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it's called podcast, not netcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that odd that it's called podcast?  I thought I'm glad to be proven wrong, but I thought there was no way Microsoft would  ever use the word pod in anything.  I think it was a mistake, especially on the Zune.  I mean, isn't the iPod the deathly enemy of the Zune?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, when they call Zunecasts.  Yeah, why didn't they?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, no, really not.  Seriously, that would have been a perfectly good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, I think so, too.  I think somebody screwed up.  I think somebody probably got chewed out for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The new Zunes actually are making me think I might want to get one.  There are flash models.  There's an 80 gig hard drive model.  Finally, Wi-Fi syncing, which is something not even the iPod does.  Support not only for podcasts, but recorded TV.  And there's going to be a firmware upgrade, they say, for the existing Zunes.  It'll add some of these features to the existing Zunes.  Hooray!

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yay!  You know, Leo, when the first thing I saw when you announced this, as soon as they announced  I thought to myself, let's say I go to the store, I look at the new iPod Touch and I  look at the Zune next to each other.  Oh, you're right.  And to me, the Zune looks just, it looks like last year's model.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It looks like something the Soviet Union designed in 1958.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I mean, if I had to choose between a touchscreen, something that looks futuristic,  it's on the cutting edge, or I look at this, you know, finally it has a scroll pad, finally  I can do things I was doing on my iPod two years ago.  I mean, you know, what's the impetus there to buy it?  Not to mention, it's what, some of them are 99 cents more expensive than the iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I agree with that.  It's like, you know, Apple's gone in a new direction and Microsoft's picked up the old  direction.  Well, that's what they do.  By the way, there's an iRiver.  Have you seen the new iRiver?  The iRiver's always been good.  I like the iRivers.  Yeah, but they have one that's got a new clickable.  The whole thing is like, the entire thing is like a giant kind of a switch.  The clicks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, actually I reviewed that.  I reviewed that for information week and it's great.  It's really, really nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And it's a completely new user interface that, you know, doesn't copy the iPod.  That's the way to do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the way to do it.  So it looks like the touch.  What is different about it?  How does the clicks work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole front panel, the front plate of it is clickable, like John said.  So let's say I'm looking at the menu and I want to, you know, go drill down from music  to artist to song.  Instead of having a scroll pad or whatever else, all you do is just click the side of  the screen.  It's almost as if like the middle part of the top is hinged and the rest of it can be  moved anywhere you want.  And you just, you basically hold it as you would like a Blackberry, I guess, and you  know, with your thumbs there and use your thumbs to just maneuver your way around it  by clicking the panel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's like there's a gimbal in the middle of this whole thing.  It's almost like a controller because you can actually hold it with two hands and click  all over the place.  Right, yeah.  It's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's not a touchscreen though.  It's just there's a physical click.  Weird.  Weird.  Well, we've always liked iRivers.  iRivers makes the sound quality on iRivers is excellent.  Are these flash based?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't, yeah.  Yeah, I think they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, cool.  Well, wait a minute.  Now let's see HD.  Yeah.  I mean, look at, look at, there you go.  It's possible to innovate.  You don't think Wi-Fi syncing is an innovation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think it is, but I don't think it's enough of an innovation to justify me spending  that kind of money on a Zune.  You know, I mean, I think it's, there's more to this device than just Wi-Fi syncing, you  know, and all in all, when I compare it, like I said, to the iPod, it just doesn't really  give me anything worth buying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Zune rhymes with dune.  You feel better about that, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It also rhymes with moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And spoon.  And too soon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And tune, which I think is the reason they use the name Zune.  Zune and tune do rhyme, but what's the Z stand for?  I'm not sure.  It's whatever the social is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Did you see also that they ousted Jay Allard?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They threw him out?  He's the guy who invented the Zune.  Yeah, I can't remember the guy's name.  Actually, he didn't invent it, but Jay Allard was the Xbox guy they brought in, the only  guy at Microsoft apparently who had any consumer sense at all to head the Zune division, figuring  if anybody could save the Zune as Jay Allard.  So I guess he didn't save the Zune, huh?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think he's still going to stay on as like a creative director or whatever he's  going to be called.  But this new guy is going to take his place.  His name is Rick Thompson is the name.  The new leader of the Zune there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's got to be a job.  You just can't wait to get that call from Bill, right?  Yeah.  Hey.  Yeah, we were wondering if you wanted to run the Zune division.  What?  I'm sorry, I'm losing you.  I'm losing you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So while we're talking about this kind of thing, we should discuss the whole bungee  software issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why did they spin off the most successful thing that they've done in the last 20 years?  Halo 3 comes out in a week, sells 300 million dollars.  I mean, it is the biggest entertainment product launch in history, beats any movie by a factor  of 50 percent.  And then they spin off Spongy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They probably either had to spin them off or they'd lose the talent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nobody wanted to work for the evil empire?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They probably had contracts that would be just coming up about now.  And they released Halo 3.  So maybe their terms of, well, I'm conjecturing here, maybe their terms of employment might  have expired where they would have been free agents anyway.  So by allowing the whole group to spin off, you keep that core team together and you can  still work with them.  They still have an investment in that organization and they can still call on them for other  development work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's more or less what happened.  And one of the things, of course, is I've been convinced that they had something up  their sleeve that they wanted to bring out thinking Microsoft would think it was cool.  Like, for example, some software for the Wii, which Microsoft doesn't really directly compete  with but they could make money from.  And I think they said, no, no, no, no, we can't do that because there's no such thing  as the Wii.  There's only one thing in the world and that's Xbox.  We eat our own dog food, blah, blah, blah.  And so these guys started grousing about it.  I mean, they already moved to Kirkland because they couldn't stand being around the Redmond  compound.  And they, you know, they got their own key card system because they couldn't take these  Microsofties coming in and out of there and pointing at this and pointing at that and  saying, this is right and that's wrong.  And so, you know, at this point, they said, look, and you're probably dead right.  There's probably a way they could have lost half the talent.  And yeah, OK, what do you got left?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Let's not forget that Bungie's first game was for the Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right.  They may have a Mac thing up their sleeve.  Who knows?  That would be interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  See, you know, I almost thought I almost think it's a blunder on Microsoft's part in that,  you know, they still own, I think they still own most of the rights to Halo and I think  whatever some kind of future properties that that Bungie is developing.  You know, is it just another instance where Microsoft gave up on something too soon or  just shouldn't have done what it's supposed to be do?  And now it might pay the price.  I think, like you said about the Mac, I think they said that they were they're looking towards  developing for the Mac because they want to go back to their Mac.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were Mac guys.  I mean, that really was their thing for a long time.  In fact, really, if you look at Halo closely, it looks pretty much like a successor to Marathon,  which was their great Mac game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Gaining on Mac.  Is there such a thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, baby.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Marathon.  Actually, I've been I've been playing Halo 3 and it's really it's not, you know, it's  it's not a great single player game.  It's you know, it's just another shooter.  But it is it is probably the best, you know, online gaming out there.  Right after World of Warcraft.  I love World of Warcraft.  Yeah. Wow. The wow starts now.  Actually, we had in our message boards a little discussion about whether Microsoft had done  any advertising when Vista came out.  And I thought, man, Microsoft, did they do any ad?  They spent what? Like seventy five million dollars on advertising and nobody remembers  one ad.  Do you remember any Vista ads?  I don't. Not at all.  No, they skinned the New York City subways.  I remember that.  I remember when I remember flying.  Yeah, that worked. I remember flying into JFK and there was like a long, you know, those  long escalator conveyor belt corridors going from terminal to terminal.  And the whole thing was lined with plasma displays saying the wow starts now.  Wow. As you're going down this 800 foot corridor.  That must be what they spent all the money on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Public art.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They should have. They should have spent more time fixing their operating system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No kidding. This is Don Risinger is on the guy who said that Microsoft should abandon  Vista. You know, maybe, maybe.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not the only guy said that, too.  So, I mean, it's not like what you've been saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what you said. You said that last year, though, John.  That was the difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I said it again recently.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they could spin Vista off like they did bungee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I'm using I use Vista and it's I mean, it's it's pretty nice.  It's just early.  Yeah, I guess we're all being sort of the beta two testers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It wasn't done.  God, you think after five frickin years.  It was that word again. Frickin rhymes with stinking.  You think it'd be done.  First lawsuits against Apple for bricking iPhones had to happen.  It's about time. Timothy Smith sued Apple in a class action case  in Santa Clara County Superior Court.  That was the attorney of record.  The suit filed by Damian Fernandez.  I'm sorry. Vice versa.  The suit is filed by the attorney, Damian Fernandez.  Damian actually was soliciting people for the case.  He found somebody doesn't ask for a specific dollar amount,  seeks an injunction against Apple, which prevents it from selling the iPhone  with any software lock.  Also asked that Apple be enjoined from denying warranty service  to users of unlocked iPhones.  So there's a news there's a new scam going on.  I'm not going to say who's doing it,  but I know a few people who brick their phone, which, by the way, is a dumb.  I mean, you got plenty of warnings not to do this upgrade.  I don't know what they were thinking, but they did it.  So now this is the solution because you can't bring it in with  what it's brick because Apple can tell you, yeah, you hacked it.  So what you have to do is you unbrick it sort of by reverting it to 102.  And then you start the upgrade again, the unlock upgrade again.  And then you pull the plug halfway through.  And this so fatally destroys the phone.  Cool. That even Apple can't tell you hacked it.  It just looks like the thing just died.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I had it. I had a different I had a different  recommendation, which probably less work,  which is that you find any output on the thing, headphones, whatever.  And then you hook it to your 12 volt car battery.  And after that guy's that guy's battery blew up in his pants the other day.  I think this would probably work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What some guys. What happened?  It was an iPod. It was an iPod blow up in his pants.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's got to hurt.  That's some hot music he was playing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I believe it was at an airport, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Just as long as you don't say bomb, it's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And let me check that.  They'll be confiscating those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And whatever you do, do not carry any more than three ounces of fluid on your person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Three point two ounces, actually. Is that is that it?  Boing boing for a while.  The one guys that were, you know, you go to the airport  and they've got the bullhorns out like we're in the Soviet Union,  you know, berating.  You can only have this.  And if it's you know, I had one guy who was in some airport.  He's yelling through the bullhorn.  He says, if you have two ounces, but the package says four ounces,  I will assume it is four ounces. Oh, jeez.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, jeez. I figured it all out, by the way.  You got to follow the money.  Dick Cheney served on the board of GLAD  packaging

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  that makes ziploc bags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And how many ziploc bags have they sold since this policy went into effect?  I ask you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a conspiracy theory.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like it. I just made it up, but it sounds good, doesn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So bully.  But it sounds good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I like you look at everybody's got to carry a ziploc fricking bag.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I don't carry that crap on the plane anyway.  And the other thing is, I've been carrying.  I don't want to say this, but I'm going to say it anyway.  I've been carrying a little to dinky tube of toothpaste in the luggage.  And you know, these guys look at going, oh, crap, another dinky tube of toothpaste.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You think that X-ray can tell that that's a tube of toothpaste?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It can't see the outline of everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Well, just get toothpaste that's shaped like a gun and you'll be all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, here's a great gag, by the way, talking about that.  I always thought this would be a good something to do that.  If you because you know, you're going to get somebody in trouble  and hopefully they don't track it back to you.  And I'm not recommending, by the way, anybody actually do this. OK.  Disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer, disclaimer.  It's get you find some guy who likes to take books under the plane  and then get a get some lead foil and cut out a thin outline of a gun  with lead foil and then slip it into the book just between the pages.  It's a bookmark.  Has a bookmark and see what happens when they when the X-ray machine sees that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is it illegal to carry gun shaped pieces of lead foil?  That's the question. It seems unlikely.  I can't believe that there's a law against that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Well, in Boston, there probably is. Oh, yeah.  You have play dough in your hands and you go to the airport.  Apparently, that's a really threatening.  The girl from the girl from MIT who went to the airport to pick up her boyfriend.  And she had a sweatshirt on with a improvised electronic device,  which was basically a flashing LED sign under her sweatshirt.  Oh, yeah, that thing.  And she had play dough on her hands for some reason.  And then she refused to answer when she was questioned about her shirt.  And next thing you know, she had a she they were arresting her and they had a,  you know, they were at gunpoint. Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that was a big news item when it happened.  I was actually in some airport when that broke and everyone was looking and watching,  trying to figure out what was going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I would caution people not to mess with the TSA, though,  because they actually have more teeth than one might think.  And I'm not talking about tasers on their belt.  Well, you know, Boeing Boeing suggested that people were carrying.  What they would do is they would play little tricks on the TSA.  They'd carry bottles of water and they'd slip around and so forth.  And a guy did it and got fined like ten thousand dollars.  The TSA can actually fine you and big fines.  So don't mess with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's why I don't recommend any of these gags.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No. Where these are pure speculation. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  There is active imagination of John.  You know, I know there's a bunch of goofballs out there do stuff like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John's an imagineer.  It's a troublemaker troublemaker.  According to Engadget, it's the French.  It's the fault of the French.  It is the French. It's not that far.  Apparently, the launch of the iPhone in France is being held up  by two different regulations that prevent it from being locked down.  Oops. A law passed in 98 requires that carriers  unlock any phone upon customer request.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good. That's what we have should have that law in this country.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is just obvious for a fee during the first six months.  That's fair of the contract.  So they get their money back and for free after that.  And by the way, all three major French carriers have challenged this law and failed.  The second law apparently requires carriers to sell both locked and unlocked phones.  They can't just sell locked phones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, why would all three carriers?  I don't understand why they'd be all upset about this.  I mean, in the end, in the end,  but wouldn't it all wash out in the end?  I mean, you know, I lose, you know, say, five percent of my customers every month.  To the company and I get five percent from them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They all think that they suck.  And they think they're going to lose all their customers.  The other guy who thinks he sucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're right. They all think you're right.  This is exactly it, Leon.  I think this is actually this is a good idea for a column for me.  They must preconceive themselves as totally sucking to such an extreme  that they have to fight these things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If you allow unlocking, we'll lose all our customers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But it costs them a lot to both get new customers  and also lose customers.  So the overriding of that kind of cost rather than just holding on  to a customer for two years or a period of time is much cheaper for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I got a crazy idea.  Why not give them good service?  You know, reasonable costs.  You know, hey, let me get my pen down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Why not give them something to stick around for?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, no, we got to lock them in,  because if they found out what we're really like, they'd leave.  You know, I unlocked my iPhone and of course, did not update it.  So it's still working unlocked.  But, you know, I have to say, I feel like it's going to be stuck.  It's a dinosaur because I can no longer update it.  So it's just going to be the way it is for the rest of the rest of the two iPhones.  I do have a regular one that is not a dinosaur.  It's updated and then one that's not.  OK, no one actually left.  I left the one that I'd unlocked in Canada.  I just put it on the street hoping some Canadian would find it.  No, I left it with the TV show.  And a weird thing happened.  I've been able to use it with T-Mobile,  but they were not able to get the Rogers Sims to work in it.  I wonder if Rogers has done something.  You wouldn't really want a Rogers Sims to work in it because it would cost you.  They estimate it costs several hundred dollars a month  because of the exorbitant data plans in Canada.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Leo, I don't know too much about Canada.  I've never been there, but it seems like everything I hear out of there is from Rogers.  So they just run everything up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the guy's taking over the country, believe it or not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ted Rogers owns everything.  Down to video store, you drive down the street and there's Rogers VHS video stores.  The guy owns everything.  He owns the dome where the Blue Jays play and he owns the Blue Jays.  And he owns the television network that broadcasts the games.  Wow. I mean, talk about it.  I mean, you see, the problem is Canada for all its size and it is.  I think it's the biggest landmass of any nation.  It's one of them anyway.  Has only 30 million people.  So it's so it's spread, it's spread like peanut butter, very thin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a lot more than Iceland has.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  OK, true.  And look how much Reykjavik has done for for all of us.  Did you know that the White House was actually applauding this RIA victory?  Did they really?  Chris Israel, who's the US coordinator for intellectual property enforcement,  formerly, as for whatever.  Well, I'll tell you, he's formerly a senior commerce department official  appointed by Bush in 2005.  Before that, he worked for Time Warner Records.  Oh, shock. Shock.  Another friend who says this proves copyright law is effective  and working as planned.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. Then why?  Why is it going up like we just talked earlier?  Yeah. Let's just sue everybody and see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, you make a lot more money instead of selling records, just sue people  and then lock their iPhones.  Hmm. That's a war.  It's a war.  You know, it is a war, isn't it?  It's consumers against big companies.  The difference is consumers now can use the Internet and other technologies  to kind of band together in a way they couldn't before.  They could they could take us out one zee two zee in the past.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think you're right.  I honestly, if they're going to that is a war.  You know, and I'm honest, I really think consumers will win easily.  I mean, I'll take the war any day, any day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Only if they're organized.  A more smaller organized group  can can still defeat a larger unorganized group.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You guys sound like a bunch of communists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Hey, I read I read Confessions of an Economic Man.  Consumers of the world unite.  I know what's really going on.  You read the book.  I'm fine. I'm not finished with it.  I'm reading it. And it's fascinating.  The premise is John's been touting this book on Audible and paper for a while.  And the premise of it is this guy was recruited.  I'll give him the name, Leo.  The Confessions of an Economic Hitman,  or as he calls it, an EHM.  And this guy was this guy was recruited after dropping out of college  to go around and pretend to be an economist, essentially.  Go to nations and tell the nation, you're going to have a huge boom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You're going to you're everybody's going to cost  the standards of living are going to go through the roof.  It's going to be amazing thing.  All you have to do is borrow a couple of hundred billion dollars

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  from the U.S. monetary fund.  Send that money national.  I'm sorry. It is international in name anyway.  From the World Bank and the IMF.  Send that money back to the U.S.  to companies like Halliburton and Bechtel to build these dams  and and nuclear power plants.  And then you'll owe the U.S. for the rest of, you know, forever.  And a lot of people get rich in the U.S.  A few people get rich in your country.  It's going to work out great.  And apparently they've been doing this for a while.  And do you do you believe this guy, John?  Do you think he really was an EHM?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I like the story a lot.  And if you if you read the whole thing or listen to the thing on tape, you  and then you reappraise the news as it comes out, it's like everything he says.  Everything he says is like right on the money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It does make sense. It explains Iraq.  It explains a lot of what's going on.  One of the things he says is the reason that we had to go to war with Iraq  is because they wouldn't play along with the EHM strategy.  They weren't like Ecuador.  Ecuador played along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, yeah, and Ecuador is going to be apparently, according to this guy,  the next target for like being destroyed.  It's pretty funny, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's funny if it's if you're over here.  It's funny if you're living here. Exactly.  Hey, that brings up audible.com, by the way, once again, audible  sponsoring this wonderful show.  And we thank them very much for their support.  A U D I B L E dot com slash tweet.  You can get the confessions of an economic hitman there.  That's how I'm listening to it.  But I also want to remind you that they now have  Stephen Colbert's book.  In fact, they were they got it before it was in the bookstores.  I am America. And so can you.  The new book is actually hysterical.  Colbert at his best.  He reads it, of course, it wouldn't be the same if he didn't.  And this could be one of one of any any number of books.  They have 45000 titles, nonfiction fiction,  even radio shows and lectures, comedy club appearances, all sorts of stuff.  Great listening.  And you can get a credit for a free book by joining up now at audible dot com slash  twit twit, our recommendation of the week.  We got two confessions of an economic hitman.  We've recommended that before, but but still a good read.  And I am America.  And so can you.  Which makes no sense by Stephen Colbert.  Does that rhyme, John, can you give us a the judges opinion on that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm not the rhyme or rapper here.  You guys are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Thanks to audible dot com for their support.  We really appreciate it.  Audible dot com slash twit.  You can still get your free chapter, by the way, of the Chopin manuscript at  audible dot com slash free chapter.  OK, that's that.  Go ahead. You were you were going to say something.  Was it Kevin or Don?  You guys sound so much alike now.  I'm going to have to remember that because  I'm going to have to get a chick to separate you for the next time  you're both on at the same time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, does that mean we can't both be on the same time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you can't. But we need somebody in between that sounds different.  I tried to get Veronica.  I said, Veronica, I need a woman and she didn't respond.  I don't know why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is what is she doing anyway?  She was going to work for Cali Canis or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  She's doing a show at Mahalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Mahalo has shows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know. I asked her that.  I said, that's exactly what I said.  Mahalo is show. She said, well, I've only one me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Where do you find it?  I didn't even I was on Mahalo for the first time yesterday,  and I was off in about five seconds, but it was I don't know.  I couldn't really find anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a search engine. What do you mean?  You can't find anything.  It's got a flower on it. What do you mean?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Perfect. There you go. Flowers all I need.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I don't know where you find her show.  In fact, I don't even know if she's made any shows yet.  But Jason can afford to have a couple of people.  I think you're just looking for a date.  I think so, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Need all the help I can get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jason's a care. I love Jason.  He's quite the character is the Brooklyn guy.  And but I don't know what's going to happen with Mahalo.  You know, it's funny, I was on Marketplace the other day.  I think I mentioned this and they were asking about another search engine  that's trying to compete with Google.  And I, you know, I said, yeah, right. Good luck.  Yeah, too funny.  They said they said, but wait a minute, they got twelve and a half  million dollars of venture capital.  Oh, and I said, how much money do you think Microsoft  sported to their search?  Have they beat Google yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  However, I went that that for I know what you're talking about.  I always like to throw back, you know, Google has two point two  billion dollars in in R&D as its budget.  Yeah. And you're going to tell me 12 million is going to do what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And they have more PhDs in Switzerland has people.  So, no, I agree.  Anyway, essentially, that's what I said.  And I got an email, a very nice email from the CEO of the company said,  Well, let me let me demonstrate why we're going to succeed.  And it's like, OK, yeah.  Let me put that on my busy schedule.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have any of you ever used or get bought?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe they maybe get bought. I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Who would buy it?  You ever used cluster?  I'm sorry. You ever use Clusty dot com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I like Clusty. But again, I use Clusty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use it like when I'm really hard up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The idea of Clusty is it aggregates, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, I use it for a little while and it wasn't all that bad, really.  You know, well, I know it was at Google.  No way. But, you know, that's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google's a verb for crying out loud.  Well, and so does a nine.  And I used a nine for a while because I thought, well, it's it's all the  all the value of Google plus.  But you end up going back to Google, don't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't a nine really a Microsoft product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, it's Amazon. It's Amazon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, right. Right. I'm sorry.  There's something in Australia that's got something weird moniker like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's why I know you're talking about.  Yeah, I saw that. It's a different kind of search.  Yeah, I can't remember the name of that.  Everybody's nibbling around the edges, but forget it.  You can't. What are you going to do?  You can't beat Google now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, what you have to do is you have to hope that something, some new concept breaks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know what? The one thing that actually had a chance  and it lasted about five minutes, Ask.com made a big deal.  Oh, we don't save any search information.  You can say, you know, completely anonymous search.  And I think for I've used it for like a few minutes.  And then I went back to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Yeah, people are fundamentally going to are lazy.  You're so used to going to a certain place each and every time.  Google, it's really hard to break that habit.  Or, you know, Yahoo is still like number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I tried. You know, somebody said, oh, Yahoo's got  because apparently Yahoo's updated how they do it.  And I don't know, they're doing something better and different and neat and new.  So I tried it for a few minutes.  And, you know, you get one bad search result and it's back to Google.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I think that Yahoo dropped the ball some years ago,  especially when Terry Semel came on board.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, he's gone now.  And, you know, I think they're turning around.  Don't you? They're trying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They got a lot of smart guys there. I know that for a fact.  But the point is, is that when they had their original before they were,  the search engine became a search engine before Alta Vista.  Yahoo is extremely popular, but it used a methodology that was somewhat,  you know, community oriented. So people would like, you know,  the public itself would actually contribute to what was popular.  What was the definitive site about bear hunting or whatever?  That's the idea behind Mahalo.  And well, you know, the irony is, is that, you know, they invented it.  They were called, of course, they were directories more than they were search  engines. But meanwhile, we've gone to this Web 2.0 community thing  and all the rest of it, and they drop the ball on the.  It's like it was handed to him on a silver platter and they dropped the ball.  I mean, coming from behind, like, you know, I mean, they had critical mass.  Mahalo's got no mass.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think there are enough people in the world to do that.  Remember, in the early days of the telephone,  they had humans, operators, female who actually they're all women.  One ringy dingy.  They would connect. You'd say, hello. Hello, central.  Give me John Dvorak.  And she would put a wire in the hole that said John Dvorak and a wire  in the hole that said you and connect you.  And that was that they that was the theory.  That was how it was going to work.  It unfortunately did not scale very well.  In fact, somebody, you know, they kept hiring more and more and more  and more operators.  Somebody made a calculation that by 1950, at the rate of growth,  they were going every woman in the entire world would be employed  by the phone company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's the same problem you have, which actually makes no logical sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you think about it, because who's making all the calls  if they're working at the phone company?  Yeah, right. Not me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They'd be calling each other. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So thank goodness electronic switching came along because it would  be a scale. You know, I think I've been better the old way.  It's a great story. You want to call central?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. You know, that's why I'd be able to call somebody and say, hey,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  get me Leo on the phone. I know I like that, don't you?  That feels powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it feels it feels I efficient.  It's efficiency. That's what we're looking for.  We're not looking for being the bean counters out there.  We have to punch in a million numbers just to get somebody on the phone  when you could have just told somebody to get the person and they get paid.  It's personal efficiency.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And how much does that phone call cost?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Probably less than it does today.  You think? Because now the millions and millions of dollars  going into the CEO's pockets, you know, could have been distributed  to all these people. I mean, look at these people are making  one hundred million dollars a year in salaries, sometimes two hundred million.  What is what do they do with this money?  I mean, that's one hundred million dollars is like one hundred people  that could be making a million dollars or, you know, two hundred.  You know, you can just extrapolate.  There's plenty of room for expansion.  I'm not buying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They in the in the old days when there was an operator,  that this was the origin of the time lady.  You would just ask the operator what time it was.  And she would look at a clock on the wall  and she would tell you the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the olden days.  It's real olden days.  The olden days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But people expected that.  And so when they went to electronic switching, they had they literally  in the 50s had to invent a way to do this because people expected  to be able to call central and get the time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, you know, they did have that popcorn number or whatever  was anything people felt whatever.  And of course, they killed that like about two weeks ago.  Remember? Yeah. Yeah.  So you can't get the time anymore because it's too much work for them  to have an automated system that gives you the time.  Forget it. Hey, wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Money making idea. Google time.  Oh, that part. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You can do that.  You actually called that number, though, at this point.  I've been trying to call it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I would I would call it.  So we just called a friend of mine, just called, tried to call it  the other day and found out it no longer works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I called it all the time when the power goes out.  Who? What's the first thing you do? You call popcorn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, you can't do it anymore.  Well, Chris, I mean, most people use their I mean, I use my computer for the time.  I have the atomic clock, which is what everyone should have as a utility,  which is one of the programs that have a Mac and it does it automatically.  OK, it calls the atomic clock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, so does Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But anyway, go ahead and keep keep talking.  Well, whatever the case is, my computer calls the atomic clock.  That's every time I boot.  And does the atomic clock look at the clock on the wall?  Warner has the time and tells me what time it is.  Is that amazing? It's incredible.  How does it know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, there it is right there calling you to the time.  Hello.  I just I just bought a BlackBerry to replace my my hacked iPhone  because it can put third party software on it.  What a concept.  This the new that get this the new T-Mobile BlackBerry, the 80, 80, 320  has Wi-Fi on it.  And you can use the Wi-Fi to make VoIP calls.  Built in. Really?  It comes with a phone. It's not even.  Have you done it? Yeah.  Does it work? Yeah.  I mean, it does.  You know, it sounds like a VoIP call, but it does it.  And it does it automatically.  So there I mean, this is I think one of the things that Apple has done.  It's interesting has just as they did with the iPod,  where there's companies like I River that have to innovate  because they can't compete against the iPod head to head.  So they innovate.  I think the phone companies are going to start doing the same thing.  They've got this iPhone staring them down.  So they're going to they're going to come up with things that are better,  like putting VoIP on a phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think they're a little freaky about the iPhone.  The iPhone has, you know, the thing that might take off is that Palm  hundred dollar ninety nine.  CREO smartphone. That's the I like that.  A Centro. Yeah, the Centro.  I mean, because people always say, you know, the smartphones don't sell.  They don't sell. They don't sell.  They don't sell because they cost a fortune.  It's hitting the right price point.  Has anybody played with the Centro?  All of a sudden they sell.  Anybody played with it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I did last week at Digital Life.  What do you think?  I thought it was OK.  You know, like I said, we talked about it.  We did. Yeah.  Yeah, you know, it was pretty good.  I mean, like I said last week, you know, it really will appeal to the entry  level professional and anyone else who wants a little bit more advanced  functionality, but doesn't want to spend the like John said, the three hundred,  four hundred, five hundred dollars to have, you know, the newest and best smartphone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's no folio. That's all I can say.  I like the folio.  I was going to be the only guy to buy it, but I liked the folio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I like the neo note, too, but it's kind of pricey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. Dr. Jim Goodnight, who is the CEO at SAS.  He was a statistician who had some good ideas on using statistics  to help businesses make more money, created a company about, I don't know,  about 30 years ago called SAS done very well.  He says that he has one thing in common with about 47 percent  of the high school dropouts. School is boring.  He was it was actually on the fifth marking the 50th anniversary  of Sputnik, which, of course, no.  Well, we'll get into this in a second, but it is considered common,  received wisdom that Sputnik scared the U.S.  so much that the federal government for the first time funded science  and technology education in the schools and really drove a whole generation of of geeks.  And I think you can make the case that the technology revolution  we're going through right now partly is because of Sputnik.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I agree with that.  And the fact of the matter is that's when the science fairs  and everybody all jacked up about science.  And now, in fact, I was watching a really good special on Wired TV.  It was it was about how they nowadays,  as opposed to the olden days, you can't even buy a chemistry set.  And they're starting to lose.  People are losing interest in chemistry because when I was a kid,  we had I had a chemistry set.  I was blowing stuff up and making foam, you know, and driving people crazy.  But now you can't even buy one.  There's actually a museum that has all the old ones stored away  because half the stuff in there was, you know, is illegal by today's standards.  And the kids are dumbed down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I have to ask a question before we go further.  Kevin, are you running a illegal gambling concession in there?  I mean, what was that?  Was that a roulette wheel? What the hell was that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The bang there?  There were no that the sound like a roulette counting money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, it wasn't. Oh, that's my wallet.  It vibrates when one of the doors close.  I got I got this really cool shelf that's got my my American flyer trains on it.  And every time the one of the door closes, it rattles a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  See, they should ban those trains, too.  They're dangerous, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've tried to buy a chemistry set for my kids.  I thought, oh, man, this is great.  They're eight years old now.  It's time to blow stuff up.  And it's it's because of this crazy safety consciousness people have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And the guy that did this report, whose name eludes me at the moment,  but he's a really good. It seems like a really good reporter.  He points out the fact that these chemistry sets, if you looked at them  historically, they have, you know, the scientists that look like they're doing  important stuff.  And if you look at today's chemistry sets, which don't have much in them at all,  anyway, the scientists that's portrayed on the kits by the marketing guys  are goofy looking nut cases.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, you're right.  With their hair sticking out and big black.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they look like that.  You know, the Jerry Lewis on The Sims.  It's Jerry's and not your professor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's a friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, welcome to, you know, the way we we're operating nowadays.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's the idiocracy.  It's the dumbing of America.  We don't we don't celebrate that anymore, do we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You think I'd be dead ten times over all the things I did when I was a kid  that I can't do anymore. You know, I mean, amazing, amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Dr. Goodnights said kids today are ill served by old school schooling.  Today's generation of kids is the most technologically savvy group  this country's ever produced.  They're born with an iPod in one hand, a cell phone in the other.  They're text messaging, emailing, instant messaging.  They're on MySpace, YouTube and Google.  They've got Nintendo, Weez and Gameboys and Playstations.  Their world is one of total interactivity.  They're in constant communication with each other.  But when they go to school, they're told to leave those, quote, toys at home.  They're not to be used in school.  Instead, the system continues teaching as if these kids  belong to the last century by standing in front of a blackboard.  Is he right? Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  But there's also a difference between technology and science.  You know, science is much more, you know, they're not learning science.  They're learning technology, learning to end results. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But they're not even learning technology in school.  I think the point is trying to make.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  He's also saying that they're not they're not using any of these  fantastic learning tools at all.  They're just they're using the blackboard.  Now, on the other hand, I don't think you should plunk a kid  down in front of a computer and say, here, Johnny, here's the Internet learn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, but I think there's one significant issue here that,  you know, that maybe should be addressed in the fact that most of these schools  don't have the money to do it right now.  They can't afford a computer.  We have to make a hundred dollar computer so they can afford them.  Yeah. You know, I mean, the most schools don't have the technology  they really need to enter into the 21st century.  And I think that's where we need to start.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, Don, you're an upper New York state where they actually have  an education budget.  John and I are in California,  where we have our budgets lower than Arkansas per kid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And more the kids are starting to talk like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I brought my lunch pile, but I got to leave early.  Harvested tobacco crop.  I want to find out if I can get a job as a chicken plucker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, no, no, no, no, no.  We love Arkansas. Right, Kevin?  You're from Arkansas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, from New York.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, I actually do like Arkansas.  I just don't like the chicken pluckers.  Now, that said, I took a trip from one in Arkansas to the other,  like just a few years ago.  And I have to say, it's one of the prettiest states in the world.  They actually have some really nice wine growing areas, believe it or not,  up in the mountains in the Ozarks.  And there's a little town on the border between Oklahoma and Arkansas  called Buchanan, which is maybe one of the most overlooked gems in the country.  It's actually an antique Victorian little city that was built, I guess,  around the turn of the or before the turn of the century.  And it's been kept intact as kind of a tourist attraction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, I share that prejudice that a lot of a lot of us from the big  northern cities have about the southeast.  And once we started working for Tech TV, we made a lot of trips to  Louisville and Maloxy and Montgomery.  And that's really beautiful country, beautiful people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, a couple of weeks ago, in fact, I spent, you know,  I was I was in North Carolina floating around and it was I went to Asheville,  which is we got a bunch of hippies. It's weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. And I got my new radio stations in Asheville, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And Asheville is a really nice little place.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And Dr. Goodnights from North Carolina, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There you go. OK, so we made it up.  We made it up. Do we backpedal fast enough?  I'll tell you that there are people that still talk like this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nothing wrong with that at all.  That is the original American accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I went, you know, through North Carolina, I went since I was there.  North Carolina is well known for its barbecue.  And they have a thing that there's a club down there that has what's called  the Holy Grail Trail, which which takes you to every one of the great,  you know, definitive North Carolina style barbecue places, which is about  there's about four different styles within the main style.  And I have to say that now I can say for a fact that my pulled  or chopped pork is as good as anything in North Carolina. Really?  Absolutely. I've been working on this for years.  And I finally got the whole formula down where I can make it.  It's just a stunner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now, you said pulled or chopped, which is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you can.  It depends. You can take the way I make it with with shoulder is that you can take  and mash it up with a fork and becomes kind of pulled.  And it has it's got a stringer quality.  Or you can take the whole thing and then chop it.  And it has a slightly different, more chunky quality.  But essentially, the difference is minor.  The North Carolina North Carolinians, they like to chop it.  And the Georgians, when they make this type of pork, they like to pull it.  And they call it pulled. But in fact, it's kind of mashed.  I love pulled pork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Welcome to This Week in Barbecue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We could go on and on.  One of the advantages I think we have out here is that we they use, you know,  I think even though the greatest wood in the world is hickory,  oak and pork is just a phenomenal and there's so many different kinds of oak  and they all have their own specific flavors.  I have a tree that I've grown myself that has an oak flavor that is astonishing.  And that's what I use for my pulled pork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  You mean you cut down your own tree and dry it and use it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have a tree that when we when we take a few limbs off, it's a pretty big tree.  It provides enough wood for a couple of years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So, John, you don't have to worry about, you know, all this educational stuff  because you are a man of the earth.  You know how to you know, you know, we could lose my own trees.  You're smoking your own wood.  You're pulling your own pork.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm impressed. I need to grow some pigs then.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. I have a good friend who  kind of bemoaned education from a different point of view.  He wanted to bring into my daughter's junior high school.  He wanted to bring in a pig and slaughter it.  In front of the kids and and then cut it up and make cuts of meat and show him.  He said, look, this is this is where your pork comes from.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You need to know this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why don't you just take the kids to a meat processing place  instead of doing it in the classroom?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's a field trip. It's a field trip.  But he had no that's a very good point, though, don't you think?  And the other day I had a dream  that we had lost all power and it was never going to come back.  And I thought, what the hell am I going to do now?  I don't have any skills.  I couldn't do any of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I could even smoke my own hickory.  Yeah. No, you don't smoke the hickory.  You use it to smoke. See?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  See it. There you go.  I didn't even know that.  I should I going to go learn how to kill a pig.  I got to have something to do and go fish it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The power goes out.  You live out there in farm country.  You should have some ability to live without power.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This guy makes his own olives.  They're good. That's not that hard.  OK, well, let's do a tree.  All right. OK.  British Telecom is telling its customers that they want to  they want their customers to share their bandwidth.  They're actually offering these Fawn routers,  the routers that are designed to hook onto your Internet and  offer free Wi-Fi access to your neighbors.  And if you do that,  BT is going to sell you the router at a deal.  They're going to encourage people to do this.  I mean, Fawn's also I didn't know this,  but Fawn's also signed a deal with Time Warner Cable in the US.  I don't know if that's your cable company, Don, in Upper New York State.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But oh, yeah, all too well, it is.  Yeah. Have they turned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, why don't you give people some background on this?  Because I don't think everybody out there knows what you're talking about.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is a little this is a little controversial.  I remember people even thought this was kind of a scam.  It's a Spanish company, Fonera, F-O-N-E-R-A.  The Fawn routers are available at F-O-N.com.  And the idea is you get these little inexpensive 40 or 50 dollar routers,  their Wi-Fi routers.  You don't have to get rid of your own router.  You actually plug it into that.  So that way you're still secure.  You're protected because nobody can get into your inside of your network.  But you offer your Internet access to the outside world.  And you can choose to charge people or give it away.  But if you give it away, then you get an account with Fawn.  And you anywhere you go in the world where there are other Fawn routers  that are being put up this way, you can use them for free.  So it's kind of give a little, get a little.  It's actually, I think, a great idea.  There's another company doing something similar,  only they're using Mesh, which Fawn does not use.  You have to have a connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This sounds highly socialistic to me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, once again, it's the commies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  No, but I think the advantage is it saves them putting in more towers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. I think from BT's point of view, there's an advantage.  And certainly, I mean, it doesn't you don't use more bandwidth  because you put this thing in.  I guess you could. You could use slightly more, but.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, Leo, talk about time warning cable.  My router died on me about about a month ago, and I went down.  I told him I needed a whole new, a whole new set up and the whole deal.  And they gave me a wireless RCA router.  So I don't know if it has anything to do with this, but there's no way for me  to to get into the system without calling them and doing whatever they want me to do.  But, you know, it's open right now.  And I wonder, you know, does this have anything to do with it?  I could be wrong. And I've been wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They made a deal with Fawn.  They made a deal with Fawn to distribute these routers.  So it could very, I mean, very interesting.  Who makes the router? RCA. RCA.  Well, I think Fawn's routers are.  Yeah, I didn't even know they were in that business.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another high quality product from RCA.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think RCA is just a brand that gets tossed around these days.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They sold it to somebody. Yeah.  The French. The French own it.  Thompson. That's right. You're right.  Meraki is this other company, M-E-R-A-K-I dot com.  I actually have a Meraki router.  I'm going to set it up, but they they sell outdoor ones, indoor ones.  But the idea is it's mesh.  It's being used at San Francisco, Vancouver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're going to set it up. Leo, you're out in the middle of.  Yeah, but if any cows wander by.  Cows that are getting online.  I mean, who's going to be picking this up?  Strap a router to a cow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If any cows go by, it's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But the I think the idea is, and these are mesh.  So that means even if you don't have access, if you set one up  and you can reach somebody else who does, you can pass it along.  It's a very I think it's a I think these are very interesting.  They have solar powered outdoor antennas.  Meraki, M-E-R-A-K-I.  It's probably you're right. It's probably utopian. Never happened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm glad you're having fun.  That's good.  I think we're going to wrap this up, unless anybody has anything else fun  to talk about.  Going once, I think so.  Going twice. Hey, it's been great having you guys.  I appreciate it.  Don Risinger is a freelance author for ZDNet and CNET.  And is there any?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The last. It's only it's only CNET.  They syndicate every now and then the ZDNet.  That happens, but I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's their arch rivals, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I don't know. It was on there once.  The same company, isn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, is it? I can't keep track of it.  Well, Don says Google Risinger and you'll find him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Make your life easier. Just do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  R-E-I-S-I-N-G-E-R.  And I'm really glad we get you back on, Don.  Thank you so much for joining us.  I really appreciate it.  Kevin Creewell, is it Nvidia?  What do you do at Nvidia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, some strategic marketing stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  How is how's it going at Nvidia?  You're the kings right now, aren't you?  You're the guys on top with the fastest card.  You must love seeing these games come out, the Bioshock.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  And actually, right now is a great time because you have Bioshock.  You've got World of Conflict,  the Half Life 2, Red Box is coming.  And it's just a ton of great stuff.  Crisis comes out next month.  Crisis is going to be the latest month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you OEM your stuff to Xbox or PlayStation 3 or they do their own stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  We've licensed some of our technology to PlayStation 3.  So there's our chip, not a physical chip, but our license technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Man, I just saw, you know, on Heavenly Sword, they have a trailer for  Metal Gear Solid, whatever, 17 or 30 or whatever it is.  Man, does that look good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, where's Duke? Where's Duke Nukem forever?  Supposedly any day now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, they've been saying that for, what, 10 years now.  That's a great joke in the industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is anybody still working on it? I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I heard they were, I thought.  You're kidding.  They said they promised something at E3, and I don't know if they delivered.  I wasn't there. But I guess they who knows?  I mean, you never know with these guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  In its day, that was a fun game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was. It was a great game and pretty impressive for what it was.  I'm looking forward.  The new Metal Gear Solid is is at least judging by this  incredible trailer is going to be the game of 2000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I saw the goods.  It's like a movie trailer. All the good stuff's in the trailer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, you know what it is? It's kind of cool.  It's the designer, Japanese designer walking through it,  it actually playing it.  So it's not cutscenes and demonstrating some of, you know, how to play it.  And it is very strategic.  Not only does it look good, but the strategy is amazing.  It looks like it's going to be an incredible game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure Sony can't wait for it to come out either.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They need some ratchet and clank's not going to keep those coffers

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  filled with gold for too long.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Actually, I got skate, which is pretty good. Skates very nice. And  ratchet and clank will be pretty good.  Heavenly Sword looks good anyway, but they don't.  There you write there's a dearth of games for that platform.  It's kind of kind of depressing.  I bought it because it was the cheapest blu ray player on the market.  500 bucks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Leo, I went it was back in December.  I think I bought it. I got it.  I got the PlayStation 3 for eighty three dollars. What?  Yeah, I went to EB Games and they had some special deal going on.  They took two hundred dollars off of you traded in your old PlayStation 2  and to a working controller and a memory card.  And then I trade in a whole bunch of games and I walked away with eighty  three dollars. I said, I'll take it. Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Of course, now a year later, you're still wishing you had something to play on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, of course, it only has dust on it right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But you know, you know, it's the Metal Gear Solid uses the six axis control.  I don't even know that this controller was a spatial controller  like the Wii control.  I have no idea because no game used it.  But you know, you could tilt it and move it back and forward.  And Metal Gear Solid uses that.  It looks like it's going to be really cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
