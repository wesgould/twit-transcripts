Transcript:  It's time for Twitter this week in tech.  Sammable Sammable.  My car guy is here.  So is Brian McCullough from the Tech Meme Ride Home.  But it's not just cars.  We're also going to talk about floating objects.  Shelly Brisbane is here from SixColors.com.  We'll talk about the Chinese balloons, that tech payload they might have had and why six  Chinese companies are now banned from doing business in the US.  We'll talk about Sergey Brin's blimp.  Or is it a zeppelin?  I know it's a dirigible.  And this, chat GPT, Microsoft's all in on Bing and Google.  Well, they might have fumbled their launch.  That and a lot more coming up next on Twitter.  This is Twitter.  This Week in Tech, episode 914, recorded Saturday, February 11th, 2023, Autono, Washington.

Got lots of car questions for you, but we'll get to that in a moment.  First I want to say hello to Brian McCullough, host of the Tech Meme Ride Home podcast.  You probably listened to him in your car.  Hello, Brian.  Good to see you.  Hello, Leo.

Transcript:  And all three of you will be watching the Super Bowl tomorrow.  Along with me, I've been informed that we have 10 people coming over and that I will  be barbecuing.  So I'm glad I'm doing the show on Saturday.  For those of you watching, yes, a rare Saturday edition of These Week in Tech.  If something happens Saturday night, if there's another Chinese balloon discovered, we don't  know about it yet because we're off by a day.  Actually, there was another Chinese balloon discovered.  Yeah.  Right.  They're everywhere.  How many?  I don't really understand what's going on.  And of course, we haven't heard from the Department of Defense what they found.  They did recover the balloon they shot down over North Carolina.  I don't think we've heard anything about what was on that balloon.  Another one was shot down yesterday in Alaska.  And I guess there's another one.  They're attacking us with balloons.  What kind of technology could you put on the balloon that your 26 satellites wouldn't tell  you what's going on?

Start time: 293.98
End time: 299.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it harder to do listening of some kind?  Maybe.  From outer space?

Start time: 299.78
End time: 332.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It would seem like it would be easier because a lot of the signals intelligence, that stuff's  going through satellites anyway.  It's all encrypted.  Yeah.  So it would seem like the satellites should be able to pick that up without too much difficulty  and probably more consistently than a balloon.  The balloon, you don't really know precisely what its trajectory is going to be.  You know where the satellites are going to be.  And if it's geostationary, it's not going anywhere.

Start time: 333.10
End time: 354.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But that's also like the poker tell in this.  incredibly valuable because it's so easy to have been discovered.  And if it loses control because the wind blows it where it can be seen and stuff like that,  there must be something really, really useful that they're willing to take this risk of  discovery.

Start time: 357.51
End time: 360.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Or are we learning about how they discovered it?

Start time: 360.46
End time: 362.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Poke the bear and just trying to get us riled up.

Start time: 362.94
End time: 383.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There's also a possibility, isn't there?  Always not.  Why would you want to do saber rattling?  It's terrifying to me to think of us going to war with a nuclear power.  Why would you want to stir up trouble?  And this is, by the way, it's inevitable the balloons would be seen.  As you said, Brian.

Start time: 383.82
End time: 404.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and the reason that we know about it is because civilians saw them.  And I don't think the Defense Department has known about them for a long time, but they  haven't been sharing that with us.  And that benefits them from a propaganda point of view as well as just from not letting China  know what we know.  But people were seeing them, especially when it was up in Montana.  And so there came a point where they were like, okay, we have to talk about it and then  we have to shoot it down.

Start time: 405.34
End time: 443.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm bringing it up because I feel like there is a tech story here.  Obviously, whatever that three bus long electronics panel that was suspended from the North Carolina  balloon was, it was high tech.  I don't know if it was for surveillance or weather measurements.  We don't really know because nobody's said yet.  I guess it's unlikely that the Department of Defense will say, well, here's the bill  of goods that was on there.  They have banned some Chinese companies who they say provided technology used on the balloon.  So maybe we kind of do know something.  I don't know.

Start time: 445.10
End time: 466.75
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Biden administration kind of has priors for trying to out what's happening ahead of time.  Like remember before Russia invaded Ukraine, they were saying Russia was going to invade  Ukraine so that there couldn't be a false flag thing.  So if your theory is that this has always been going on, but maybe for whatever reason,  the US government is letting everyone know what's going on now.

Start time: 468.06
End time: 509.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe that's it.  So six Chinese companies were blacklisted yesterday for supporting the balloon program.  The companies that this is from, I think Reuters, the companies and organizations which have  allegedly supported China's aerospace programs to develop airships and balloons for intelligence  and reconnaissance efforts are banned from obtaining US items and technology.  They've been added to that entity list that Huawei is on and other companies so that American  companies can't buy from them and they more importantly probably to them, they can't buy  from American companies.  I don't see a list of the names of the companies because that would tell us something.

Start time: 509.84
End time: 531.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I always wonder when that happens, what tech initiative where is inadvertently affected?  I'm not saying it's good or bad that they were banned.  I'm just saying some company somewhere was doing business with a banned company and is  now going, oh, well, we're screwed now, at least temporarily.  In a way that you wouldn't expect or that probably wouldn't make the news.  Right.

Start time: 533.84
End time: 573.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  At least in the industry that I primarily cover, which is automotive, increasingly we're  seeing the auto industry trying to migrate away from too much dependence on China because  they're seeing what's been happening in these other sectors in chips and various other things  and telecoms over the last five years or so, five, six years.  They increasingly seem to want to diversify their supply chain and their customers away  from China and not be overly dependent on the Chinese market.  Reasonably, quite reasonably.  Yeah.

Start time: 574.24
End time: 624.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I mean, it's probably a matter of time before we get iPhones that are not made in China,  maybe made in India or Brazil or Vietnam, but I think Apple would like to move away  as promptly as possible.  I did get the list of six companies from Market Watch.  The Beijing Nanjing Aerospace Technology Company, China Electronics Technology Group Corporation,  48th Research Institute, the Dongguan Lingkang Remote Sensing Technology Company.  They didn't really try to hide what they do, do they?  The Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group, the Guangzhou Tianhai Xiang Aviation  Technology Company and the Shangxi Eagles Men Aviation Science and Technology Group.  Wait a minute, that's the same name, different company.  Okay.  So, aerospace companies.  Aerospace companies.

Start time: 625.04
End time: 628.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And sensors.  And sensors, yeah.  Sensors is a big one.  Yeah.

Start time: 629.04
End time: 634.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which could affect a lot of different industries or not.  I mean, I don't know what sort of sensors they are, but sensors are in everything.

Start time: 636.08
End time: 661.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's probably a variety of imaging sensors, both infrared and visible light imaging, and  probably, you know, maybe things like some LIDAR.  Some very high resolution LIDAR, which is often used for aerial mapping purposes.  So that may be one of the things that they're looking at is doing some aerial mapping with  LIDAR.

Start time: 663.62
End time: 720.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  NBC says the Chinese balloon had multiple antennas capable of collecting signals intelligence.  This is a State Department statement on Thursday.  The balloon maker has proven ties to the Chinese military.  So we do know now, I think, it wasn't a weather balloon, that it was some sort of surveillance  balloon, particularly communications surveillance, which would explain why you don't do a satellite.  Just as you said, it's closer to the ground.  Photos taken by high altitude U-2 planes.  See, we still got those.  I'm sure the Chinese have those too.  Confirmed the presence of the equipment, including multiple antennas, according to the State  Department, likely capable of collecting and geolocating communications.  Solar panels large enough to produce the requisite power to operate multiple active intelligence  collection sensors.  Inconsistent with a weather balloon.

Start time: 722.52
End time: 749.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's a funny thing to think about, because obviously the joke is we're using or they're  using such old technology, literally floating balloons.  Think about this also goes back to like, like a naval warfare, you had to have the weather  gauge.  Like if we wanted to do something similar, if we're like, we're going to retaliate and  send balloons over China, where would we couldn't float them from the west coast over there,  right?  If we had to float them from Russia, wouldn't let us do that.  Like Alaska.

Start time: 750.72
End time: 754.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You would probably lost them from somewhere in the Middle East.

Start time: 754.54
End time: 763.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, because the jet stream is going west to east.  That's my point.  It has to be somewhere west or east, no west of China.

Start time: 764.00
End time: 769.05
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is so old school that we can't do it in reverse because of the weather.  The wind doesn't blow that way.

Start time: 770.71
End time: 770.87
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.

Start time: 771.36
End time: 807.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is why it feels to me like it may not even be that they are after precise pieces  of information.  They're sort of beyond proof of concept.  Obviously they can do it, but you're going to see what you can get because you don't  care specifically about where you're targeting.  You're floating over Montana, then eventually you're over North Carolina and in between  you're gathering a lot of stuff that you can then later assimilate.  But it's more important that you be able to get here undetected or unshot down than  it is that you hover over a particular place to get a particular piece of information.

Start time: 808.92
End time: 818.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it seems like not the ideal way to do these kinds of spy efforts, but I guess it  can't steer itself.  It didn't have propellers.  It didn't have rudders.  It just could go up and down.

Start time: 821.12
End time: 845.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Is it possible that they have something similar to what Google was doing with their loons?  The loons, yeah.  Where they could adjust the inflation pressure of the balloon and adapt to the wind patterns.  Based on where the wind was, they could go up or down in altitude to maybe catch some  wind and have at least some modicum of control over the trajectory of the balloon.

Start time: 847.84
End time: 876.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't know.  Anyway, I guess there's a lot more questions than there are answers.  It scares me that we don't want to get in a hot war.  I don't even think we should get in a cold war with China.  I guess we should say knock it off.  I don't know.  What's the answer to this?  It's not good.  It's not good.  Do we send balloons over China from Turkey?  I don't know where we'd sign them from.

Start time: 878.56
End time: 886.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I have a hard time seeing why the US would need to.  We've got enough satellites covering pretty much everywhere.

Start time: 887.69
End time: 905.15
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  China has TikTok.  Don't they know everything anyway?  It has, by the way, it has distracted certain quarters, distracted people from TikTok.  More worried about the balloons now than they were about TikTok.  Maybe that was the point.

Start time: 906.78
End time: 929.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Some of the same people are very exercised about the balloons as are exercised about  TikTok.  That's what's unfortunate to me that it immediately became this political thing where if you're  on one side, balloons are fine.  If you're on the other side, balloons are going to destroy us.  They had AK-47s that they were going to shoot them down with.  It's just like, hello, this is national security.  Can we address it on a more substantive level, please?

Start time: 932.46
End time: 936.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  On the other side, after 20 years in service, the F-22 Raptor finally got its first kill.

Start time: 937.06
End time: 941.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Isn't that amazing?  That is an amazing plane, but yet we don't have anybody to shoot at.

Start time: 941.56
End time: 945.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A multi-hundred million dollar stealth fighter.  It shot down a balloon.

Start time: 946.94
End time: 952.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Imagine the pilot, he's sitting there and there's like, hey, you're going up today and  you're going to arm your weapons and you're going to shoot down a balloon.

Start time: 954.34
End time: 960.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Granddad, what did you do before?  I was the first F-22 Raptor pilot to ever get an air to air kill.

Start time: 961.10
End time: 963.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Does he get a little outline of a balloon then on the plane?

Start time: 965.38
End time: 967.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Maybe a patch that indicates that.

Start time: 969.62
End time: 976.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, you could probably, I would bet that whoever it was is trying to deny it.  I had nothing to do with that.

Start time: 977.62
End time: 981.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It was probably not allowed to say it.  It was a nice shot.

Start time: 983.22
End time: 989.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One missile, boom, the thing came down.  Nice shot.  Well done.  I don't know how they shot down the balloon yesterday, do we?

Start time: 991.64
End time: 993.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I would assume probably the same method.

Start time: 993.78
End time: 1091.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Now that we know that that works.  I think that was actually, I'm going to guess one of the concerns of the military is we  don't want to miss.  We don't want to.  That would look bad.  Yeah, like we can't get it down.  That would not be good.  So I imagine some of the delay was them researching it.  And now that we know, we'll take them in Alaska from now on.  Interesting, interesting.  I don't know.  Yeah.  And there, and as somebody in the chat room is saying, there are theories that China did  it just to see if we could respond, would respond and had the capability to shoot it  down.  Yeah, it was another Sidewinder X that was used on the balloon in Alaska.  Very interesting.  I don't know.  I feel like we don't know anything.  And it's anything we say is speculation at this point.  Here's some things we do know.  The robots are about to take over.  This week, both Microsoft and Google announced AI in search.  Microsoft started it all on, was that Tuesday?  Yeah, I think Tuesday they announced Microsoft is going to use OpenAI's chat GPT in Bing  search.  I attempted to use it.  In order to do it, you have to use Microsoft Edge.  You have to line up for Bing to be your default search engine.  You pretty much have to give your entire Windows machine over to Microsoft.  And I still didn't get access to it.  But some have, and we've seen some demos of it.  What do you think, Shelley?  You've probably, as most of us have, played with chat GPT.

Start time: 1092.62
End time: 1099.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure.  And I haven't done the Bing thing because I am a minus one Windows machine.  So we Mac users are going to be in the dark for a little while.

Start time: 1101.60
End time: 1106.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think they want you to.  I think they want you to.  I'm sure they do.  They'd like you to change your search engine to bing.com.

Start time: 1108.40
End time: 1169.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sure.  I mean, goodbye duck duck go off to Bing.  I am going.  I don't know.  I think we've sort of gone from, isn't this chat GPT stuff amazing?  To very quickly, which is what I would have expected to happen is this is going to be,  what does it mean to say this is going to be the next big thing?  What business application is it going to have?  The first one is search, which is why so much of the story this week has been the competition  between Microsoft and Google and the stories that say Google is wrong footed even before  it had the problem with their demo.  Google is wrong footed relative to Microsoft because Microsoft has access to chat GPT and  Google's trying to counter them.  And so it's sort of a weird mishmash of stories where some of us are amazed by this technology.  Some of us and we run the risk of being called Luddites if we say it out loud, some of us  are concerned about it.  And some of us are just writing cool business stories about chat wars and or AI wars.  And it's an interesting time.

Start time: 1169.80
End time: 1179.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Brian, didn't Google call a red alert when they found out that when Microsoft admitted,  yeah, we've put another 10 billion into chat GPT and we're going to use it in search.  Didn't this scare Google?

Start time: 1180.88
End time: 1301.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, absolutely.  And of course, the ironic thing is that this is all technology that Google created years  ago and open sourced the tea and chat GPT, I believe, is the part of the technology that  Google transformer.  Yeah.  So what I have heard from listeners that work at Google that can't be named, of course,  this was echoed in, I think it was TechCrunch had an article a couple days ago about this  too that what happened was, if you remember, there was the time when there was a lot of  controversy where, you know, certain AI people in Google were writing papers saying we shouldn't  do certain things, certain people were fired.  There was a lot of controversy around this stuff.  And also, so number one, you have like this was culturally divisive within Google.  So that's why maybe it didn't get productized.  Number two, you have the classic innovators dilemma of, well, would this kill the golden  goose?  You know, if you don't follow a link to get the answer you need, then we're not making  as much money.  But the thing that I heard that was echoed in the TechCrunch piece was that the way that  you get money for projects inside Google is to affix it to another big team.  Like, so for example, the chatbot team or the search team or the maps team or whatever.  And if you think about it, we've seen that the last three or four Google IOs have been  little little bits of AI added to maps, AI added to this, as opposed to essentially what  I've heard is no one had the constituency or the power to say, well, let's go and make  this a full product or a full division.  And so because of that, they were sort of drip, drip, dripping it into other little  things and then OpenAI comes in and just releases the whole product.  And that's what they weren't prepared for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Google went through, you're talking about firing Timnit Gebru, who wrote a paper called  Stochastic Parrots with other Google researchers.  She was in the ethics division of Google AI and in which she said, you know, this is  potentially problematic not only because of limitations in training data and so forth,  but also people trust computers.  And when a computer comes up with the wrong answer, it carries more weight than when a  human comes up with the wrong answer.  She got fired.  Then there was Brent LeMoyne, the priest, I guess you call him, who was working with  Lambda who said, oh no, it's gone sentient.  And then Google immediately fired him because it hadn't and it was ridiculous to say so.  Maybe LeMoyne had the right idea though.  Do you think Google was too judicious, Sam?  Do you think they should have productized sooner?

Start time: 1358.74
End time: 1396.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I don't think they should have productized sooner.  And I'm not convinced that OpenAI and Microsoft should be doing it now.  As you mentioned, the paper that Timnit Gebru and her colleagues did on the dangers of Stochastic  Parrots, Stochastic Parrot is defined as a system haphazardly stitching together sequences  of linguistic forms that have been observed in training data according to probabilistic  information about how they combine.  That's how it works.  Without any reference to meaning.  That is the key, is that these models don't really understand.  They are not intelligent.

Start time: 1397.36
End time: 1400.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They're not even trying to be factual in many cases.

Start time: 1401.10
End time: 1461.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right, they're sophisticated pattern matching mechanisms, but they don't really understand  what it is.  And this applies really across the board to most AI applications, whether it's large language  models or machine vision systems or anything else.  We throw around the terms AI, but none of these systems are actually anything close  to human intelligence, the way the human brain works.  They don't function the way a brain works.  It's a very, very rough approximation.  And from what I've seen, I think the best description I've seen of Chad GPT is that  But what was the phrase?  It's very confidently wrong.  It's a man's pointer.  It puts together strings of words in a sequence that looks really plausible.

Start time: 1462.72
End time: 1482.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's combined with very well done writing, not only just grammar and structure.  It can make a sentence, but it can make sentences that read well, which is why so many people  have applied it to making a document, write a news story, write an academic paper, write  this thing.  It can write code.

Start time: 1482.92
End time: 1484.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It can write runnable code.

Start time: 1485.08
End time: 1518.97

Transcript:  Right, but that's kind of a different issue because the syntax of the writing is one of  the things that always sort of alerts you.  You've seen plenty of spam emails that come to you from a non-English speaker or you've  seen stuff that was generated by some sort of AI, some sort of computer.  You think you can always tell.  I know that's not generated by a human or by a human that had a certain amount of education.  But you read this Chad GPT stuff and it reads as if it's well constructed and that gives  the authenticity and authority of facts that aren't there.

Transcript:  A month ago, I did an experiment and I shared it on the show where I tried to create two  entire YouTube videos from scratch using not only the video selected by AI, but the writing  made by Chad GPT and the actual voice itself.  Again, not my voice.  It was a complete robot voice or whatever.  Narrowing in on the Chad GPT part of it.  So I picked the real story of Robinson Caruso because that was based on a guy that really  did get marooned.  And then the Crystal Palace in the 1851 exhibition in London, blah, blah, blah.  Just two things that I had recently read about and so I knew enough about.  The interesting thing was is that, so like let's say you would say, give me a thousand  words on whether or not Robinson Caruso was based on a true story.  And it would give you a perfect third grade level essay about it.  But it would miss all the details that again, since I had just seen a History Channel thing  on it, I knew there were more details.  So I would have to go in and say, OK, but tell me about how he survived on the island.  OK, now tell me about how what happened to him after he was rescued.  Now tell me about how how Robert Louis Stevenson found out about this story.  So it was never wrong.  And again, think about the fact that I knew enough to know if it was doing the wrong thing.  But not that wasn't even the thing that was interesting to me, because obviously, you  know, if you don't know the facts, you wouldn't know if it was wrong.  But to get it to be a good enough sort of story, I also had to know the story like it  wasn't good enough yet to be as sophisticated as I wanted it to be just to make a five minute  long YouTube video.  And so, again, we're talking about people trying to train it to to do things that are  factual.  It was also like I felt like a conductor more than it was all prompt engineering.  And if you didn't know what you were talking about to begin with, it sure helped save  you time to write all the words.  But it's not like it did everything without me knowing word one.

Transcript:  It's a part. It's kind of what I was getting to before.  It's because those of us who are interested in tech and now even those of us who who might  not be but who have seen this thing do something that's, you know, on adult, it's amazing,  right? It seems amazing.  We're excited about it.  But then you have Microsoft and Google and all these companies that have to productize  it. Otherwise, why do it?  And even if Google didn't have the history with AI that it did, they have to productize  it because Microsoft is doing it, which is why we're forcing it into to search right  now.  And whether search is the best or worst application, they've got to find some way to put it into  products, which I don't think is good for us as humans.  I don't know. It may be successful for those companies.  It may in fact lead to better AI.  However, we define it.  I don't know whether that means accurate or what it means, but it doesn't necessarily  mean it's a good thing for us that we have more AI, but it keeps Microsoft and Google  afloat, I suppose.  Even in December.

Transcript:  This is a headline from the New York Times from December.  A new chatbot is a code red for Google's search business.  A new wave of chatbots like chat, GPT use artificial intelligence that could reinvent  or even replace the traditional Internet search engine.  So even back in December, this terrified Google.  And of course, Microsoft had the announcement on Tuesday.  And Wednesday, Google threw together hastily threw together its own event where they announced  they were going to have their own chat GPT like AI called Bard, originally apprentice  Bard be in Google search.  They didn't say when nor did nor did Microsoft, by the way, it's not available generally yet.  But they did show a animated GIF of Bard answering a question.  What new discoveries from the James Webb Space Telescope can I tell my nine year old about?  And it got it come wrong.  Two of the three answers it provided were correct.  But in the third, the third bullet point was, and you could tell your nine year old, we  got the first pictures of an exoplanet, a Earth like planet and another solar system  to which many astronomers, including one astronomer from the University of California, Santa Cruz,  said, I took a picture of an exoplanet 14 years ago.  What are you talking about?  So you got to wonder, was there nobody at Google looking at these answers or checking?  And that's certainly not a good way to announce your new chat for that we're using the editors

Transcript:  from CNET.  Right.  But now I think, you know, another another big issue with using search as the first application  for this as the first mainstream application for this is the fact that, you know, AIs don't  really learn on the these models don't learn on the fly.  You have to run them through your training data.  And every time that data set changes, you have to completely rerun that training.  That's why when you play with chat GPT, the chat GPT, the GPT 3.5 model was trained on  data back in 2021.  So it was current up through the time up through the moment that it was that they ran the training  in 2021.  But, you know, if you if you ask it about anything that is from the last two years,  it will almost certainly get it wrong.  And for a search engine, it has to be current.  It has to be kept current in real time all the time.  And you know, this is, you know, again, also one of the challenges with automated driving,  where you're trying to use AI, that it has the models have to be continuously updated.  And for something like a search engine that is so vast, there's so much data out there  rerunning that training continuously to keep it fresh, you know, in within minutes or at  least hours, which is what we expect today from a Google or Bing or Duck Duck Go.  You know, when something pops up on the web, we expect it to be found almost immediately  doing that with with a large language model seems like it would be both impractical and  use enormous amounts of energy and time to do that.

Transcript:  Yeah, people are already talking about the environmental impact of this chat.  GPT costs millions of dollars a day.  We know that because Sam Altman has said so he called it an eye wateringly large number.  And chat GPT when it was first released only was up to date through spring of last year  of 20 or no 2021, even older than that.  So to keep it running constantly, spidering the web as Google does with its its spiders  would cost kind of an unheard of amount of money.  Chat GPT plus is Google.

Start time: 1958.98
End time: 2026.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google has gone to enormous efforts to make their spidering mechanisms as efficient as  possible to minimize the amount of energy that's consumed for that.  And even that consumes a lot.  Doing this with a large language model would be far, far worse.  Now, there are ways to make AI models more efficient in terms of the at least once they've  been trained, you can optimize them to make them more efficient.  But then what ends up happening is you tend to lose some some resolution, some granularity  from that, which then has its own issues.  And there's a lot of work being done on making processors more efficient for for  processing this kind of data.  And I saw some some interesting stuff at CES this year on processor, AI accelerator chips  that they're trying to make, trying to really optimize the performance per watt on those.  But that's to do that at the kind of scale that you would need for a search engine.  I mean, they're nowhere near nowhere near that kind of capability.

Transcript:  There's really two questions or maybe more than two, but there's at least two.  One is, should we even be trying to do this?  Is it useful?  And third, is it is it cost effective?  A couple of researchers from a company called Semi Analysis, Dylan Patel and Afaza Mad are  quoted in Forbes saying how expensive it would be to to give Google like search  capabilities to chat GPT.  They said it would represent a direct transfer of 30 billion dollars of Google's profit  into the hands of the picks and shovels of the computing industry, probably Microsoft,  because one of the reasons Microsoft's invested in chat GPT is it's running on Azure.  They say deploying current chat GPT into every search done by Google would require half a  million A100HGX servers with a total of four million A100 GPUs.  The total cost of these servers and networking exceeds 100 billion dollars of capital  expenditure alone just just to build them, of which Nvidia would get a large portion.  I guess they make the A100s.  Yeah.  So Nvidia is going, they're rubbing their hands with Glee.  Microsoft's rubbing their hands with Glee.

Transcript:  Well, and so get ready for this.  Imagine the regulatory issues, because if the only way right now financially you can  make this happen is to sign a deal with one of the big cloud computing platforms.  And those are also the platforms that are investing in these companies.  There was an article I saw this week where people were complaining, I know of academics  that want to start companies, but the upfront capital cost is so huge that the only the  first conversation they have to have is they have to go to one of the big cloud providers  and sign a deal with them.  So don't you think that regulators, the Justice Department would look at that as a certain  pretty clear cut case of anti-competitive practice?  If there's a new industry, everybody has to go to the incumbents to sign a deal.

Transcript:  Google employees not thrilled about this rushed launch of Bard.  In fact, they called it there's an internal board message board in Google called Mean  Gen.  And according to CNBC, which saw some of the messages, the board filled with criticisms  of company leadership, calling it rushed and botched, comically short sighted.  Stock market didn't like it either.  Alphabet shares dropped nine percent.  How did Nvidia do this week?  I should have checked.  Interesting.  They've been up. They've been up a lot.  Yeah.  Ungoogly, according to some of the messages, Microsoft might have.  Pulled a little, you know, in football, since the big game is tomorrow, sometimes you'll  line up pretending that you're going to run in a fourth down situation, trying to get  the opponents to false start to jump ahead so you get a little five yards extra before  the punt.  Maybe Microsoft did a little a little faint to get Google to leap off the line.

Transcript:  Prematurely, I think it's it's strategically brilliant because if again, let's assume  that Google could have done this five years ago, could have done a chat GPT and released  it as a standalone product, but didn't again for the most obvious reason, which would be  they have their golden goose, which is search advertising.  And this obviates that.  So number one, Microsoft has gotten more people to talk about being in the last week than  they have in the last five years.  And they forced Google to rush products out that they had previously decided we know they  previously decided this isn't probably good enough.  And then number three, by that, they've they've moved.  If Google was hoping if we have to kill the golden goose someday, hopefully we can mitigate  that over a period of a decade or something like that.  So they're forcing Google to make decisions about whether or not to burn the boats sooner  than they maybe were ready for.  Interesting.  And and again, Microsoft gets nothing.  There's no negative to Microsoft out of this other than a lot of money spent on their cloud  platform. Yeah, right.

Transcript:  You probably take a look. I would be interested to know how the perception would have been  different had Google not had this giant fail, because the first headlines I read about  this and this is not to defend Google by or defend or attack them for me, honestly.  But had they not the first headlines said Google loses one hundred million dollars when  the first it stopped the first.  That was the first headline.  And so it was obviously on the level of great demo fails that we've seen from companies in  the past, including Google a couple of years ago when they made people crazy with the AI  based voice assistant that they were demoing and didn't work out so well.  And so I'm sure that there is a lot of internal concern at Google of the kind that kept them  out of chat out of AI previously because of ethical issues.  But I also feel like there's nothing like a pile on.  And I think the assessment that you guys have made about Microsoft position and all this  makes total sense. But I do think it's sort of easy to sort of pile on Google at this  point and say, well, they had this terrible demo, which proves they're doing a bad job.  And there may be plenty of other reasons to indicate they're doing a bad job.

Transcript:  Again, I've heard from everyone that Google actually has the better technology.  Right. And people are like, it makes chat GPT look amateurish.  It's just that they weren't ready to release it.  So I'm still until proven otherwise, I'm still willing to believe that Google has the  goods. It's just that they weren't ready to put the shine on the goods and present it  to the public, I think.

Transcript:  Well, there was a good Wired article that sort of gave some of the history of how how  we got chat GPT.  And we talked about some of it where you have this model from 2021 that the CEO of chat  GPT says of OpenAI says, let's release it to the public.  And an unsuspecting public is all of a sudden able to use this technology.  And it's all anybody's been talking about for a couple of months.  But it's old technology.  And it but it's a great big PR balloon to go back to balloons.  It's it's an opportunity to get into the public consciousness in a way that that  company and that technology had been before.  Certainly there was Dali and there are all the other things that have been out in  2022 that have to do with images, but nothing like this, nothing that captured the  general public's imagination.  And so Google's hand was forced.  And I don't think it's good for the future of AI.  And it's probably not good for all the incumbents involved with the possible  exception of Microsoft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So what do I know?  OK, or switching from Duck Duck Go?  I guess I guess for me, I have to figure out what it is that I want from search that AI  would give me. A lot of the searching I do has to do with my day job.  It has to do with finding sources for stories I want to write.  It has to do with finding new stories initially that I can turn into segments for the radio  show or for my podcasts.  And I have to ask myself, other than the sheer entertainment and technology enthusiast  perspective, what does AI provide me in terms of search?  And that case has it made to me as an individual.  Would I try it? Of course I would.  Would I give it all sorts of fun experiments to do?  Yeah, but I don't have a use case for it in my own life.  A lot of people are probably not in the same boat I'm in.  And I am a sort of a careful adopter when things like that come along.  But I'm not ready to change.  How about you, Brian? Would you consider changing to a Bing.com?

Transcript:  Well, I was going to say, I don't know if anyone read Joanna Stern's Hands On with the  Bing or maybe it was more with the Edge browser version of it.  But what she was describing was more the she like asked it for questions.  She was interviewing Sacha Nadella and she asked it for questions that a Joanna Stern  might ask Sacha Nadella.  And she's like, I didn't not all of them are good, but there were some good ideas in  there that I used. And she said, it's maybe we have to think of search in a different  way. Maybe it's not search in the way that we're used to it.  She said that I'm already using this tool to come up with story ideas.  It's not writing the story for me, but it's prompt.  Again, it's prompt engineering.  It's giving me ideas that I'm free to take or not take.  The conductor analogy is sort of like you use this tool to do the things and sing in  the right direction, but you're still in charge.  But as opposed to just put a keyword in, get a link to a page, you can use this in sort  of the Star Trek, the next generation computer thing to give ideas to steer in a different  direction.  And I think that's the key to that.  And I think that's the key to that.  To give ideas to steer in a different direction.  You know, the example Microsoft used for the browser was like if you wanted to craft a  response to your boss and an email and it had access to your email.  So it says, all right, give me the give me the status of the TPS reports.  And it would know the whole history of the TPS reports because it would have access to  your email and it would say to you, OK, do you want a hopeful response?  Do you want a skeptical response?  Do you want a humorous response?  And then you it's up to you to either cut and paste that or whatever.  But it gives you thought starters and things like that.  Like that to me is something that's a that's a type of computing that we really haven't  done a lot of till now.  How about you? I think that's a really interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. I think I think what Brian I think Brian's on to something there.  But I think that there's that brings up another problem, though, and that, you know,  one one thing we've seen over the last decade, especially, is we've become really bad at  media literacy, you know, at filtering through and picking out what are what are the  what's real, what's not, you know, picking through the misinformation and picking out the  genuine information that we should be paying attention to.  And I think. What what Brian's on to is is a really good idea of if if we can use  tools like this to generate those prompts in our minds to give us things to think about.  The problem is, I think it's going to require a whole lot of education for everybody in  terms of how to use it in a way that is going to be positive and and actually useful to  us and not create new problems.  Yes, it can definitely really go off the rails very quickly.

Transcript:  I agree with you. But sorry, I lost my point.  And I was I wanted to to point it to Shelley and give her ideas of where I think it might  be useful for her to create podcasts and things.  So another analogy I've heard people use is why do TV shows have a writers room?  Because it's like, all right, for this next episode, what are the eight things that could  happen to our characters? Or why does a magazine or in the old days used to have an  editorial meeting? What are the 10 stories that we could put in the next issue?  And so in essence, I think even Joanna might have said this, that, you know, what it  becomes is your own personal writers room where you can come up with jokes.  You know, it'll help you come up with ideas, story ideas and things like that.  And again, what I hear what you're saying in terms of getting the answers right, like  you wouldn't want your doctor using this stuff yet.  But for now, I am intrigued by that sort of level of usage where it is prompt based, it  is idea based, and then it's up to you to sift the wheat from the chaff.

Start time: 2833.28
End time: 2927.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, I take that point and I really do.  And I was thinking about, well, the example that came to mind is what if I got a call  tomorrow and I said the caller said you get to interview Sunder Bachai or Sachin  Nadella. You can interview one of those guys and you have an hour before the interview  starts. And I am in my own little bubble.  I mean, I know how to research. I can I would be panicking because I want to ask good  questions. I don't just want to ask.  So how do you think Microsoft is going to do this quarter or hey, what's up with  what's up with chat GPT?  I want to ask good, intelligent questions.  And I can see a tool like this giving me prompt.  I start by giving it prompts and it comes back with substance based on not only  whatever publication or podcast I might be working for in the sort of the approach  that we typically take, but what my own interests are that it would presumably know  and what my readers slash listeners are interested in.  And I can see that if there's a way in which it's actually really intellectually  stimulating to think about how you could ask more deeper questions than you could  ask just of a search engine where you're looking for a link in response.  And I think that's another aspect of media literacy where it's not simply that you  have to not trust things that are potentially lying to you or giving you bad  facts, but that you actually have to change the way you think in order to get the most  out of this resource.  And that's actually a really interesting educational discipline that we can see  down the road that I'd be sort of fascinated to be a part of.

Transcript:  Google's always said that this has been somewhat controversial.  People search for looking often search for an answer.  Sometimes you search for the nearest pizza place.  Sometimes you search to find out who is somebody.  But a lot of times I just want an answer.  And Google has increasingly given its search results as answers, which has  bothered a lot of publications because they're not driving traffic.  I did a search for who won the Grammys this year on Google, and it gives you a  knowledge graph with the there's the winners right there, obviously extracted  from somewhere. I don't have to go any further than that.  It's got an overview.  It's got nominations.  It also has a knowledge graph on the right that it pulls solely from Wikipedia.  And one of the things that's gotten Google in trouble with original sources is,  well, done, right?  I don't need to click any of the subsequent links.  In fact, good luck getting to the subsequent links.  That's a long scroll because Google's already extracted the answer that I want.  Google's answer is, well, that's why people search.  I'm going to show you.  I use another search engine called Neva.  Let me search for who won the Grammys 2023 on Neva.  Neva uses an AI.  It's generated this knowledge graph from four sources, BBC, New York Post, HuffPost,  CNN about who won.  Not as complete as the Google answer, but maybe for many queries,  this would be sufficient, again,  stopping me from going further, right?  Answering the simple question.  I think one thing that we're going to see that Google has not addressed,  Microsoft has not addressed is,  and this is the problem you've seen with Chat, GPT and StableDiffusion and other  AI, is by scraping original content, it's giving people no need to go any farther.  And it's, in effect, disintermediating sites like yours, Brian's,  like your podcast, like TechMeme, like Sam's podcast, like Shelly's podcast,  because they've extracted the information people want and they're just going to  provide it right on the search page.

Transcript:  And something like this actually just happened this past week.  There was a Twitch channel that was running a completely procedurally generated  generated  Seinfeld like it was terrible.  I made a show running continuously.  Not funny.  Yeah. That was generating the dialog and generating the animation.  But what happened was they for some reason that I can't recall exactly right now,  they had to switch to a different version of GPT from the one they were originally  using and very quickly within a day or so, it might have even been hours.  It started making transphobic and homophobic statements in that dialog.  And Twitch pulled it down because you had this varietal,  it switched to a different varietal of the AI model that just went completely off  the rails within hours.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  Not that its loss is mourned, but yeah.  No.  So really the question.  I mean, it's so, so funny because what's happened is these companies have almost  been panicked into rushing this stuff out.  They've been holding on to it for a long time.  Even OpenAI was really slow and judicious until recently at releasing its chatbots  or its art bots.  But all of a sudden there's this land rush and they're panicking and they're all  releasing it at once.  What do you think the outcome of this is going to be?  Are we going to finally all just say, you know what, it's a parlor trick.  It's stupid.  Forget about it.  Or do we buy into it as much as the big companies are buying into it and suddenly  idiocracy? What is the outcome of all this?  Shelley, what do you think?

Start time: 3297.42
End time: 3326.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, first of all, I think my biggest concern about all of this is not whatever  the initial thing is, whether we get some sort of AI generated search out of it,  but how, because it's generative AI, how we move forward and whether that's the  spam we were talking about or whether it's just a new normal on the Internet.  I don't know what that is.  And I don't know that we have the ability to sort of control it or process it at  this point.  Have we already lost control?  Really?  I don't know.

Transcript:  Sounds like a plan. Let's write that up.  We'll have the AI write that up.  But when Dali came out, it was easy for me to ignore the art stuff.  I mean, not not that I had I had great sympathy for artists who were concerned  about it, but it didn't seem practical in the same way.  Once they started talking about writing, then I cared all of a sudden.  But it feels like it's gone too far in terms of putting it back in the bottle.  And it obviously Microsoft and Google are so completely engaged in it.  I don't think it's going to come out the way they necessarily want it to.  I don't think it's going to be like a traditional we're going to Microsoft and  Google are going to battle for a while.  And then one of them is going to have  supremacy because of their superior technology or their superior marketing or  whatever. I think it's I think it's too early to predict it, to be honest.  I think we're in this sort of wild west.  How many metaphors can I jump into?  But I think we're kind of in the West World.

Transcript:  And when I say lose control, I'm not even talking about some sort of all  encompassing big bad, I think it's easy to sort of knock those worries down  because I will will Luddites or people who don't understand or care about  technology are going to always say something like that.  But I do think there are ways in which and I think we we always see it with  technology when some whether it's social media or whatever it is,  there are ways in which things grow and mutate in an unanticipated fashion.  And I think we're at the stage right now  where there's no sort of governors on how this stuff is going to change and grow  and evolve. And I don't mean regulation specifically, although that's an issue.  But just in terms of like how much is out there and how much technology that is  controlled by different people who want to fight each other for market supremacy.  Can I can I give you a best case scenario?

Start time: 3449.56
End time: 3539.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because we all know what the worst case scenario is.  There's a reason why in the Dune universe,  computers were outlawed and you had to have those guys in the tanks piloting the  ships. Right.  Here's a best case scenario for the near term.  And I have to credit Mark Andreessen.  I heard him say this on a podcast months ago.  But like, do you prefer an older doctor or a younger doctor?  An older doctor has more experience.  A younger doctor maybe is more up on the latest thing.  Do you trust when you go to the doctor that they're having a good day or a bad  day, maybe she is going through a divorce and is distracted or whatever?  Here's the best case scenario that 10 years from now you go to the doctor.  There's an AI ambiently in the background listening to the consultation.  You describe your symptoms, you know, it reads the x-rays, etc.  And it's not going to have a good day or a bad day because it's an AI.  It's late. It's up on all of the latest stuff,  even the stuff that was just published 30 minutes ago.  And it can give you a ninety nine point nine,  nine percent accurate diagnosis, etc., etc., etc.  In the same way that and Sam, you can speak to this, that in theory,  self-driving cars are safer than humans.  And so the role of the doctor becomes the counselor.  OK, this is what the AI says is going on.  Here are your options.  Here's the option recommended by the AI.  But let's think of these other things.  And it becomes more of a counselor thing than a diagnostic thing.

Transcript:  And I like where Brian was going with that, you know, as a best case scenario.  I think ideally, you know, having, you know,  something like an AI as a copilot, you know, to to augment human capability,  I think is fantastic.  I think I think that that that would be ideal, you know, to because there are,  you know, human memory is always flawed.  You know, there there are advantages  to, you know, things that we gain from human experience and the nuance of the way  humans think and process information that I think, you know, in that that role as  the counselor can be extremely valuable.  And if you can get the AI to the point where.  It can filter through the erroneous  information and keep that out of it, I think that would be great.  But, you know, I I'm I remain unconvinced that we can get there.

Start time: 3684.72
End time: 3828.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's that's the theory.  The the reality is, though, that when you have a system, you know,  whether whether it's just a mechanical machine doing something or a piece of  software that's doing something that works really well most of the time,  the closer it the closer that machine or software or the closer that mechanism,  whatever it is, whether it's hardware or software, the closer that mechanism gets  to 100 percent, you start to get into that uncanny valley where we trust it so much  that we cannot be we as humans cannot necessarily be trusted as the supervisors  to say that, yes, this, you know, this is OK or maybe this is a better solution.  We tend to then give up control to that machine.  We we are not good at retaining that level of control that we need.  And what we see with with some of the assisted driving systems out there is  that the better it works most of the time, then, you know, the more likely we are to  become complacent about it, right.  And then what we actually end up needing is more mechanisms to keep us engaged  in the process of supervising the original mechanism.  So you end up with something like GM Super Cruise,  where you have a lane centering and speed control system that works really well  most of the time, but requires human supervision.  So you add a driver monitor system to monitor the driver to make sure the driver  is still monitoring the other system.  And, you know, I'm not sure that it's necessarily improving things,  because it creates new new cognitive workloads for humans.  And it gets back to what I said earlier,  but it requires a whole new kind of education for the people using these tools,  you know, whatever, in whatever context to understand and monitor what they're  doing and to make the best decisions about, OK, is what this is telling me good or is  this nonsense, you know, and do I need to ignore the mechanism and go with my own  my own knowledge, my own intuition, or do I just follow what it's saying blindly?

Transcript:  It really is that dichotomy.  And on the one hand,  we want to we want these things to be as smart as possible,  trust them as much as possible, because it would really be a great thing to lift  the burden off of us and let us do things we're good at and not have to do things  we're not so good at. And on the other hand,  it looks like these things have the judgment and intelligence of a four year  old and nobody in their right mind would trust them to take over anything.  And we're stuck in the middle right now.  And I don't know if it's because of timing or because this is actually the problem  inherent in this. Let's take a little break.  I want to take a little break. We've got a great panel.  And we're not going to end this discussion because there's a Super Bowl  ad coming up about this very topic. Sammable Sam, it is here.

There's a country basket.  I don't know beef had fingers.  I don't. Yeah.  No, our show today is not brought to you by DQ.  This week at Tech is brought to you by Bitwarden.  Bitwarden. Bitwarden.  We talk to so many people these days who are ready to leave those other guys after  their horrific breach, their lack of concern and lack of communication for their customers.  Can I recommend the password manager I've been using for the last two years?  Password manager I trust and love Bitwarden.  It's the only open source cross platform password manager you can use at home,  at work, on the go and trusted by millions.  I think a great many of us have switched over to Bitwarden.  I'm happy to say I did that a few years ago.  Bitwarden is easy to use.  It's cross platform, but more importantly,  it's open source so you know exactly what's going on.  And when there is a better way to do things, people contribute.  And Bitwarden gets better.  Bitwarden will let you securely store your credentials across your business and your  personal worlds if you're using a personal account free forever, I might add,  across multiple platforms with unlimited passwords.  You can even store your vault on your own.  You can keep it out of any centralized storage.  And that's pretty nice.  Of course, Bitwarden doesn't track data in the mobile apps.  In fact, only crash reporting.  And even that is removed in the F-Droid installation.  If you're on Android, Bitwarden is open source.  It invites anybody to review the library  implementations at any time on GitHub to review the Bitwarden privacy policies  at bitwarden.com slash privacy.  It's the one I trust.  I love these guys at Bitwarden.  Protect your personal data and privacy with Bitwarden by adding security,  your passwords with strong randomly generated unique passwords for every  account, but you can go a step further because they also have a username  generator so you can create unique usernames for each account.  In fact, if you use one of the five integrated email alias services,  you can have unique emails for every account.  That kind of doubles your security.  Not only does the hacker have to guess your password, they got to guess your  email works with simple log in and not add a Firefox relay.  Our sponsor, Fastmail and now Shelley Duck Duck Go.  They will allow you to create a masked email address.  When you can use only once on one website, for example, forwards any email to that  primary email account when you get email at that address.  It's a really great way to keep an eye on people, see if they're selling your  email address off, use a unique email address with them, you'll know if anybody  else sends you email, they sold your address and it keeps your main email  address out of the databases of services and sites you sign up for.  It's just an extra security layer and it's great.  It works so well.  Bitwarden, great for business to fully  customizable adapts to your business needs.  The team's organization, the three dollars a month per user for a smaller  organization, if you're a big company, your enterprise plan, five dollars a month  per user, it adds new features to like sharing data securely with coworkers  across departments, the entire company.  The basic free account, though, for  individuals free forever for an unlimited number of passwords.  You can always upgrade to the premium account.  I did that just to support Bitwarden.  Ten bucks a year. Come on, man.  There's a family plan as well.  Gives up to six users all the premium features for just three dollars and 33  cents a month. Very easy to get data into Bitwarden.  If you're on another password manager,  it's so simple to export that data, import it in Bitwarden and you're good to go.  Look, you know you got to use a password manager.  If you're not, you're really at risk.  But it's important you choose the right password manager.  Choose Bitwarden, the only open source cross platform password manager you can  use at home, you can use on the go, you can use at work,  trusted by millions of individuals, teams and organizations worldwide.  Get started with a free trial right now  if teams are enterprise or free for all devices forever.  As an individual user at Bitwarden.com  slash twit, really there shouldn't be any reason not to use a password manager.  Make it easy, make it free.  Just go to Bitwarden.com slash twit.  Tell your friends, tell your family.  It's just the right thing to do.  Bitwarden.com slash twit.  We thank you for their support of this week in tech.  We thank you for supporting us by using that address.  They know you saw it here.  Bitwarden.com slash twit.  You don't want to put all your passwords in one steak finger country basket,  my friend, you want to spread it across or something.  I don't know.  That didn't really work.  I've got my mind still on DQ.  All right.  You know the name, I'm sure, Sam Dan O'Dowd.  He is a California entrepreneur, a billionaire who has been buying ads  slamming Tesla's full self-driving.  He's now going to buy a Super Bowl ad.  Now, he's not buying the full ticket item, the one you see coast to coast  nationwide, that's seven million dollars for 30 seconds.  But he is going to buy Super Bowl ads in all the major states,  in the state capitals in Washington, D.C.  He wants to speak to legislators, Austin, Tallahassee, Albany, Atlanta and Sacramento.

Transcript:  He does want legislatures to ban Tesla style full self-driving.  Right. Here's here's his tweet with video.  I guess this is 30 second ad.  This is the one that's going to run on Super Bowl and some local markets.  Tesla full self-driving.  There's a kid on a skateboard.  Boom. Got him.  There's a there's a Tesla hitting a stroller and a crosswalk just driving  right through it, not stopping for a school bus.  Elon says the guy's nuts.  What do you think is wrong?  Elon, you think this is credible?

Start time: 4394.18
End time: 4478.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Wrong. Yes, it's absolutely credible.  You know,  this is the Don project, which is, yeah, the Don project, which is  no doubt, current effort that that is doing this  is they're not the first or not and not the only ones to be creating  or to be doing this kind of testing and evaluation of different driving systems.  Luminar, for example, LIDAR manufacturer,  they've done similar demos to this showing that Tesla's camera only system.  The the thing that I doubt is against is a system like what Tesla is using that is  a camera only system that doesn't have some deterministic components to it.  It's not it's not safe the way Tesla has done it.  And particularly not only is their approach to the problem of automated  driving and driver assist not sufficiently safe, but also  the way that they marketed it and sold this capability that they call full self  driving to consumers for up to fifteen thousand dollars per vehicle.  And it is nowhere close to being full self-driving.  I've tried the FSD beta.  It is not capable of safely driving,  safely operating a vehicle without human supervision.

Start time: 4478.54
End time: 4481.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what should you call what should he what should he have called it?

Start time: 4483.00
End time: 4613.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I mean, if you want to call it something like driver assist driver,  system, I mean, there's there's lots of different brand names out there from  various companies.  GM has super cruise, Ford has Blue Cruise.  You know, they're they're they're driving  some something that doesn't imply that the system is more capable than it is.  What you know, what what's what what he's talking about here is a phenomenon known  as a ton of washing, which is a term that was coined by a woman named Liza Dixon.  She's she's a human machine factors researcher.  And she wrote a great paper on this on this topic a few years ago and coined  that term a ton of washing. And if you think back to the late 20,  late 2000s, early 2010s, you hear about companies greenwashing  where they were doing things that to try to  conjure up this image of being more green, more environmentally friendly than they  were a ton of washing.  The idea is that you are marketing or or talking about a system that is more  capable, you're making it seem as the system as though the system is more  capable of driving the vehicle safely than it is.  And and that's problematic because it gets back to what I talked about earlier,  where as humans see the system functioning a lot of the time, the more it  functions correctly, the more they are inclined to trust it and then to not  supervise it correctly. And then when it does hit those  inevitable limits of its capabilities, then you get into problems where  it can't properly detect a pedestrian or it can't properly detect how far away  you are from a fire truck that's sitting or a police vehicle that's sitting on the  edge of the road and runs right into it or can't tell the difference between  a traffic signal that is sitting on the back of a truck being transported by a  crew to somewhere for installation from one that that is actually at an intersection.

Transcript:  When full self-driving is enabled, your vehicle make lane changes off highway,  select forks, all the good things it does.  But you but you have to pay attention and keep your hands on the wheel.  Right. Because it might do the wrong thing.  If you watch some of these videos that were uploaded to YouTube  of mistakes made by full self-driving, you know, keep your hands on the wheel.  And who's liable, by the way, if you if you do you are past the school bus,

Start time: 4666.72
End time: 4700.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  the drive, the driver is Tesla does not accept liability for the performance  of their autopilot or FSD, which is different from other manufacturers.  Mercedes Benz, for example, last year  launched a system in Germany that should be coming to the US later this year  called Drive Pilot, it's a so-called level three system where the driver is not  required to watch the road.  So it's a hands off system and an eyes off system.  But you still have to be behind the wheel and ready to take over within about 10  seconds if it's reaching the limits of its capability.  What does O'Dowd want?

And the Federal Trade Commission should also be stepping in and saying, look,  this is false advertising.  This is not self-driving capability.  And you cannot sell you cannot sell this  as self-driving if it is not actually capable of driving the vehicle safely by itself.  Yeah.

Transcript:  Do not.  I was interested in this, though, because our legislature here in Austin, Texas,  which meets every two years for about six months, has just gone into session.  And so they might see the Super Bowl ad tomorrow.  I suspect they will.  And also keep in mind that Tesla has a gigafactory here in Austin.  And Elon Musk has been embraced by a lot  of the Texas political leaders because he is bringing so much of his empire,  not only Tesla, but SpaceX is here, the boring company.  Most of most of what Elon is doing has some Texas and Austin specific footprint.  We also have the GM Cruise  taxi's here in Austin.  And those have had some problems, too.  I understand that there are investigations into how those cars operate.  I understand when they initially started here, they always had a driver.  I believe there might be some.  I don't know much about the how autonomous they are.  Sam probably knows a lot more about it than I do.  But there have been some specific issues here in Austin with it backing  not staying in lanes properly and not parking properly.  And there haven't been injuries that I'm  aware of, but there have been a lot of concerns here in Austin on the local level.  And here in the capital city of Texas, our local and our state leaders are often  on opposite sides of things.  We have a fairly progressive local government.

Transcript:  Sure. The blueberry in the Sea of Red, as they often say.  And what that means is that sometimes  what we're seeing in Austin, whether it be through what's going on with Tesla,  with with full self driving or whether it be what's going on with Cruz,  it doesn't necessarily mean those concerns are going to percolate to the  legislature in the same way that they might.  But there's not as far as I'm understanding.  And we've done a lot of coverage of what's coming up in the legislature.  So far, there isn't really anything  filed or expected to be taken up that has to do with regulation of autonomous driving  or specifically with Tesla and self driving.  And given Musk's courting, a successful courting of the statewide officials,  my guess is a lot won't come of it.

So it's purely on the political side in terms of Twitter, in terms of the job  situation, SpaceX is very popular among elected officials, but it's not very  popular in Boca Chica, where there are a lot of environmental impacts.  So there's a there's a lot of back and forth in terms of how people regard Elon down here.

Transcript:  Yeah.  I had a Tesla Model X, didn't have full self driving,  but I knew enough not to trust it even to do a lane change and frequently had to  take control of the wheel.  I have a Ford Mustang with Blue Cruise right now, and I theoretically could take  my hands off the wheel, but I'm still keeping an eye on things.  I'm still holding on to the wheel just in case.

But just just the the adaptive cruise control was like, oh, yeah, that's all I need.  You know, so like really, I know I love adaptive cruise control.

Transcript:  You know, and that's that's exactly what the Mercedes drive pilot system does.  And there there are other systems coming over the next couple of years that will  have that capability for automated highway driving, because that's, you know,  in the world of automated driving, they they use a term called operational  design domain, which is what are the limits of where the system can operate?  And, you know, unfortunately, you know, one of the things that Tesla has done  wrong, I think, is say, you know, the ODD is everywhere.  You know, you can they're not putting any restrictions on where you can use it.  Things like Mercedes drive pilot, Jim Blue  Crew or GM Super Cruise, Ford Blue Cruise, they're limited to operating on divided  highways, and so, you know, we're going to see systems like this that allow you to  take your hands off. You still you can't take a nap.  You know, you've got to be still awake  and ready to take over within a reasonable period of time.  But you'll be able to read or watch a video  while you're while you're cruising down the highway.  And then, you know, when it comes, you know, when you set the navigation,  when it comes to the off ramp, you know, then it'll give you an alert, you know,  10, 15 seconds before and say, hey, get ready to take over control.  And then you'll do that.  So that that is going to be in cars over the next two, three, four years.  Oh, and one other thing to what Shelley  was talking about with the cruise robot taxis in in Austin.  Yeah, they are.  Those are operating without safety drivers, safety drivers in them.  They started doing that in San Francisco in June of last year.  And then in December, this past December,  they expanded that operation to both Chandler, Arizona and Austin.  But currently, they only operate like that at night between about 10 p.m.  and 5 a.m.  and only in a relatively small portion of the city as they they gather more data  and learn and get to a point where they have enough confidence to start expanding

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I have one.  I only use it when I'm in unfamiliar areas.  And yeah, as somebody who who does not drive, cannot drive,  the idea of self-driving autonomous cars has always been exciting to me.  And to be honest, I would get in one of those cruise robot taxis because I'm  just like I would like to be driven around by a robot and imagine.  Yeah, absolutely.  I think the same thing as I get older.  And the problem, you know, the problem with the problem with whatever Tesla's doing  and whatever is that there are humans interacting with you.  We talked before about  the systems of talking for when we're talking about AI.  We talked about how humans are involved.  Well, in theory, if you had autonomous vehicles, if the there were only autonomous  vehicles on the streets and we didn't have those pesky humans, pedestrians and  transit users and all that stuff, in theory, the system would be better for all.  In theory, I'm not saying that you ever worry as a pedestrian about getting

Start time: 5244.76

Start time: 5246.72
End time: 5264.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I also worry about electric cars that don't have motor noise.  So there's just plenty of stuff to worry about as a pedestrian.  I worry about human drivers just as much or more.  The only time I ever the only time I ever  made physical contact with a car while I was walking, it was driven by a human.  So, yeah, I wasn't knocked down, but it was very scary.

Start time: 5265.26
End time: 5359.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah. And to your point, Shelly, you know, in  cases like yours are one of the driving forces for automated driving to enable  mobility, freedom of mobility for people that either can't or don't want to drive,  whether it's because of a physical limitation or just getting older or the  young or people who just don't want to drive, having that ability to call up a  vehicle to take you where you need to go, not have to worry about parking and things  like that. I think there's there's a lot of potential  societal benefit out of that.  And if we can get it right, you know, the potential improvements in safety,  you know, these things should be able to see pedestrians way better than humans can  because, you know, if they're if they're done right, you know, which it means not  like Tesla, which relies only on simple RGB cameras, visible light cameras, you know,  the those cruise vehicles, Waymo vehicles, others, they use a combination of cameras  and radar imaging, radar sensors, high resolution radar sensors, LIDAR sensors,  thermal imaging sensors that should be able to help, especially help detect  pedestrians and animals.  You know, all of this this combination of these sensors is what's key to try to  generate a sufficient level of safety that is hopefully at least as good, at least as  good or better than human safety, which we haven't yet fundamentally proven that  that they are even as good as humans yet.

Start time: 5359.46
End time: 5396.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. And it's fair to point out the  pedestrians and animals are as unpredictable or more so than other vehicles on the road.  So you can count on certain things  with software about how other vehicles behave because there are rules governing  them. That doesn't always work, but it's less effective with a pedestrian who might  start out in front of you.  And I think that there have been incidents where when they traced it down,  the car, the automated car was at fault in terms of hitting the pedestrian that they  should have seen. But the pedestrian or the bicyclist or whoever is also not  necessarily guaranteed to behave in a way that the car expects, that the software  that's running the car expects.

Start time: 5396.84
End time: 5438.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that's that's actually turns out to be one of the hardest parts of developing  automated driving.  You can you can kind of break down, break down the problem into four parts,  sensing, detecting what's around the vehicle, prediction, then planning a path  through that environment and then actually controlling the hardware to do it.  That prediction turns out to be really one of the toughest parts, especially with  pedestrians and cyclists, vulnerable road users, because physics, the physics of a  vehicle mean that it's going to put some limitations on how fast it can change  direction, a human or an animal or a cyclist can change direction on a dime.  And that is really hard to figure out for software.

Transcript:  Oh, that's disappointing because the main reason I want self-driving cars is so I  can ride my bicycle more.  Well, that dream up in smoke as well.  Although as I get older, you know, I would love it that I don't have to.  I guess my wife will drive me around.  But until then or maybe after that, self-driving vehicles would be great.  I guess the other the problem really is that we have self-driving vehicles and  human driven vehicles on the same road.

Start time: 5463.94
End time: 5500.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. That's fundamentally what I see is the issue because I wouldn't  see the rules about how you arrange streets and how traffic works.  It's all around cars.  It's all about vehicles.  We're automated.  And if we, you know, I get on my my sort of red hat here.  But if we didn't have to have private car ownership, if I could just rent access  to a car when I needed and send it away, I wouldn't have to have a driveway.  I wouldn't have to have a parking space or garage.  If I wanted to pick up truck to take a load of stuff somewhere but never wanted  to see that truck again, I could do that.  And as a person with low vision, that's pretty attractive.

And then think of think of the snapback for if remote work  doesn't happen as much as people thought, you know,  there's there's so many factors in terms of.  The.  You know, you had the supply chain things as well.  And now you've got fears of recession dampening consumer demand.  It's like it is one of those perfect storm things where you could point.  We could sit here and talk for a half an hour about four different points that are  hitting the PC industry all at once and certain corners of the hardware  industry all at once. But all it really is, is that this was a sort  of black swan event that no one could have planned for.  People over plan.  And they got giddy about, oh, this could be a phase change in terms of how  consumers or even enterprises behave and what their demand could be.  And so it's just going to take time to unwind that.

Because the difference between a zeppelin  and a blimp is a blimp is basically just a balloon with a  the pod underneath.  I forget what it's called.  Gondola.  Yeah, gondola. Yes.  Thank you.

There'll always be something new, different  and interesting to talk about.  Tech meme ride home.  You get it right at Techmeme.com or subscribe in your favorite podcast player  and hear the news change right before your very eyes.  Sam, I will say that is also here.  Our car, my car, my personal car guy,  Wheel Bearings podcast is at WheelBareings.media.  Robbie's on that, too.  I love him. We've been trying to get him on Twitter.  And Nicole. Don't forget Nicole.  Nicole, too.  Great show for people who love vehicles, motor vehicles.  Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.  As the world ebbs and flows, jobs come and go.  You may want to know about Zip Recruiter  because there's going to come a time when you're hiring.  And of course, those vacancies always come along at the worst time.  You know, for us, we're a small company.  Somebody leaves.  That means we all have to work a little bit harder.  And we've got to scramble to fill that position.  Thank goodness, Zip Recruiter is here.  We use Zip Recruiter all the time to do our hiring.  And believe me, there are plenty of industries that are hiring these days.  There's in many industries a shortage of talent.  But don't worry, because no matter what industry you're in,  when you need to hire, you go to ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  You can try it for free.  It works so well.  We've hired some of our best people there.  When our wonderful Ashley got a better job,  she was in our continuity department and Lisa and I are going,  oh, what are we going to do? What are we going to do?  Lisa went to Zip Recruiter, posted the job opening right there.  And it's fast because you're posting to more than 100 job sites with one click  of the mouse, but it's also fast because Zip Recruiter looks at your requirements,  then looks at all the resumes.  They have more than a million current resumes on hand and will say,  they'll pick out people who match those needs and they'll say to you, hey, look,  here's 10 people who really fit the bill.  You decide whether you want to invite them to apply or not.  But I'll tell you this, too, when you invite somebody to apply,  they're so flattered, they're so excited.  It's a great beginning to a potentially fabulous experience.  When we post on Zip Recruiter,  we usually get somebody great within an hour or two.  Lisa will post at breakfast.  By lunch, she's going, oh, here's another one.  Here's another one.  And that is such a relief when you're a person down.  It really is great. That's how we found Viva.  Zip Recruiter uses its powerful matching  technology to find candidates for practically any role  that makes it very easy for you to process those applications because they don't go  to your voicemail or email inbox, they go into the Zip Recruiter interface.  They reformat all the resumes so it's easy to scan them.  You can create screening questions, true, false, multiple choice, even essay,  to eliminate people who just don't fit the bill.  You can narrow it down, rank them, screen them, rank them,  and hire the right one fast in one place. It's so great.  In fact, four out of five employers who post on Zip Recruiter get a quality  candidate in the first day. That's always been our experience.  It really is a relief.  You go, oh, we're not going to have to operate at half speed.  Find quality candidates fast.  Let Zip Recruiter keep your team growing strong,  no matter what industry, no matter what field.  Zip Recruiter is great. Go to ziprecruiter.com slash twit.  You can try it there for free.  Ziprecruiter.com slash TWIT.  They have been so great for us all these years.

What if I just wrote out the show and didn't have to edit it and process it?  Just yeah.  So I it's not there yet, though, is it?  No, but it's actually the 11 Labs is the  closest one because I did the Descript one a couple of years ago and it was  nowhere near the script.

Transcript:  This this adds like the breaths.  Yes, adds the pretty good sort of the emotion.  So if they could just add the dials where  I could add emphasis and with italics or something like that, we're almost there.  But I don't know if you've played with it.  But the other weird thing is if you if you say if you give it a paragraph and you  say generate, it'll perform it in a certain way.  Generated again with changing nothing.  It'll perform it in a completely different way.  It's like do it again completely different way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, well, I decided I don't know why I decided made this terrible decision, but  it had been going around in a podcast or Slack and a bunch of us have been posting  samples and I was due to do a Q&A on the radio show, which as a producer means that  I wrote the script and that I was going to talk to the host.  I wrote him some questions that he asked me and then I answered them.  And so what I did was I took that script  and I trained it on both of our voices and I was like, why am I putting myself out  of a job? I don't know.  But you can train it with multiple samples.  And so the first thing I did was I trained  it on myself doing something like I would do for the radio show, which is  essentially reading about a serious topic.  We were talking about disability legislation, the legislature.  And then I decided to give it a couple of samples, one from my podcast about  tech and one from my podcast about movies.  So sort of a different tone, sort of a different focus.  And I noticed as I added samples, this was my interpretation.  And maybe what Brian says is right, that you could read the same script and have  it come back with different different sort of tone or whatever.  But my feeling was that once I had given  it a couple of more of my voice samples, it changed and it got better.  It still wasn't me. I could absolutely tell the breathing was right.  The sort of emphasis, especially when I  because I made a couple of punctuation mistakes at first and I changed them up  and it was a little bit better, but it was sort of flatter and without  personality.  And I chose the clips from the movie podcast specifically where I'm sort of  excited about something or I'm trying to engage a guest and I've got energy.  So I'm trying to figure out whether it's going to transfer that to the clip.  And it didn't.  And it really did not do particularly well on my on my radio show host, where I only  put one clip of him in. But yeah, I was able to fake an entire radio segment.  I didn't put it on the air, but I had it.

Transcript:  Yeah, I don't think we have to worry yet.  But in fact, Brian, you put this story in my inbox.  Voice artists are worried about chat GPT and other AI  generators, I guess not chat GPT so much as 11 labs, whatever generative stuff  generative is scaring him.  And in fact, more than that, they're now being asked to sign away their rights.  Which is interesting.  This is the story from Vice.  It's disrespectful to the craft.  Actors say they're being asked to sign away their voice to AI.  When we do voice work, there's always a contract.  Usually it says something like we own this recording for use in every medium  conceived of to this point and anything that has ever conceived of in the future.  We use the same release, I believe.  But in any event, it's now becoming a little bit concerning.  We had this story a couple of weeks ago  that folks at 4chan had used 11 labs to create celebrity voices doing appalling  things.

Transcript:  Well, the converse would be I said this recently,  Morgan Friedman should sell the rights and perpetuity to his voice.  He'd probably be able to get 50 million dollars right now.  So like maybe he wouldn't have to do a thing.  Oh, well, maybe he'd have to go to a studio and record for a few days.  No, they have so much of it.  And this stuff is getting so good so fast.  Sign away your rights and perpetuity.  And then you'll never lose the March of the Penguins voiceover.

But if I'm a voice actor and I'm 30 years old and maybe I've even just had a hit,  maybe I had a big role in a video game or a movie or something like that.  And you're asking me to sign away my rights  to a specific piece of work that I'm about to create for you.  That's a really different situation.

Transcript:  Here is another story from Motherboard about chat GPT.  And for some reason,  you can put weird words in there and it responds in an even weirder way.  We think we know what's going on, though.  There is a subreddit called Count.  Where people are just counting them and doing it for five years.  They're trying to get to what five million one at a time.  And they have a list of the top.  Chat, chat, Reddit handles in count, and those are the words.  So something about the way chat GPT absorbed the count subreddit  has has given these people some sort of weird celebrity.  In GPT's token set is what Vice calls it, including solid gold magic carp,  streamer bot and the nitrome fan with a leading space.  Now, you probably can't type those in the chat GPT anymore.  I'm sure people have, you know, but the funny thing was,

Transcript:  Wow.  Hey, everybody, it's Leo Laporte, the founder and host of many of the Twitter  podcasts. I don't normally talk to you about advertising,  but I want to take a moment to do that right now.  Our mission statement at Twitter,  we're dedicated to building a highly engaged community of tech enthusiasts.  That's our audience and you, I guess, since you're listening by offering them  the knowledge they need to understand and use technology in today's world.  To do that, we also create partnerships  with trusted brands and make important introductions between them and our audience.  It's how we finance our podcasts.  But it's also and our audience tells us this all the time.  A part of the service we offer.  It's a valued bit of information for our audience members.  They want to know about great brands like yours.  So can we help you by introducing you to our highly qualified audience?  And why do you get a lot with advertising on the Twitter podcasts?  Partnering with Twitter means you're going to get, if I may say so humbly,  the gold standard in podcast advertising.  And we throw in a lot of valuable services.  You get a full service continuity team.  Supporting everything from copywriting to graphic design.  I don't think anybody else does this or does this as well as we do.  You get ads that are embedded in our content that are unique every time.  I read them, our hosts read them.  We always over deliver on impressions.  And frankly, we're here to talk about your product.  So we really give our listeners a great introduction to what you offer.  We've got onboarding services, ad tech with pod sites.  That's free for direct clients.  We give you a lot of reporting so you know who saw your advertisement.  You'll even know how many responded by going to your website.  We'll also give you courtesy commercials  that you can share across social media and landing pages.  We think these are really valuable.  People like me and our other hosts talking about your product sincerely  and informationally, those are incredibly valuable.  You also get other free goodies, mentions in our weekly newsletter.  That's sent out to thousands of fans.  We give bonus ads to people who buy a significant amount of advertising.  You'll get social media promotion, too.  But let me tell you, we are looking for an advertising partner that's going to be  with us long term. Visit twit.tv slash advertise.  Check out our partner testimonials.  Tim Broom, founder of ITProTV.  They started ITProTV in 2013, immediately started advertising with us and grew  that company to a really amazing success.  Hundreds of thousands of ongoing customers.  They've been on our network for more than 10 years.  And they say, and I'll quote Tim,  we would not be where we are today without the Twitter network.  That's just one example.  Mark McCrary, who's the CEO of Authentic,  he was actually one of the first people to buy ads on our network.  He's been with us for 16 years.  He said, and I'm quoting,  the feedback from many advertisers over  those 16 years across a range of product categories is that if ads and podcasts  are going to work for a brand, they're going to work on Twitch shows.  I'm proud to say that the ads we do overdeliver.  They work really well because they're honest.  They have integrity. Our audience trusts us.  And we say this is a great product.  They believe it. They listen.  Our listeners are highly intelligent.  They're heavily engaged.  They're tech savvy.  They're dedicated to our network.  And that's partly because we only work  with high integrity partners that we have thoroughly and personally vetted.  I approve every single advertiser on the network.  If you're ready to elevate your brand and you've got a great product,  I want you to reach out to us.  Advertise at twit.tv.  So I want you to break out of the advertising norm.  Grow your brand with HostRed authentic ads on twit.tv.  Visit twit.tv slash advertise for more details or email us.  Advertise at twit.tv if you're ready to launch your campaign now.  AI for video is coming.  The folks who did stable diffusion runway have a new model.  They call it Gen 1 that can create videos based on an input, a sample.  And then they can  see if I can get it to play back.  It looks like it won't play back in my Linux here.  But the top animated GIF gives you an example.  But you could give them a video of a real person doing something and then change  the background entirely. So get ready.  I mean, this is deep fakes paradise, isn't it?  Transforming existing videos into into new ones.  Let's see. Maybe here I can get it to play from the runway site.  So this is the actual video on the left.  It's a subway, real subway in New York City, but I can make it a cartoon using the AI.  It's a pretty good cartoon, right?  You can have a human being acting kind of silly in a park, but then apply it  to a magma monster and suddenly you've got a pretty good...  I mean, this is a lot easier than doing rotoscoping.  Here's another one.  They use blocks to...  Or actually, these are looks like these are runway manuals or notebooks set up  to kind of simulate skyscrapers in a road and turn it into skyscrapers in a road.  This is really impressive.  Give a dog some dots.  Research.runwayml.com if you want to see.  This is Gen 1.  It's going to allow you to do some very interesting things.

I'm like, OK, we we got to do this next segment with my AI voice.  We're all doing it.  If if I prepare the audience and I say,  I'm not going to do this forever, but for this one week, will you accept it?  And the interesting thing was, I did one experiment with different voice.  I did an Irish accent, you know, not my voice and people hated it.  But when I did it with my voice this week, people were like, oh, that's not bad.  So again, now, but again, what are the implications?  The implications are I'm not paying a  substitute host for a week to take over my show.  So

Transcript:  Last week, we had Kelly Funkhouser from Consumer Reports on to talk about they  recently did a bunch of testing on driver assist systems and had some interesting  results. And so we invited Kelly to come on and talk us through what their  methodology was, what they were actually looking for to to get a better  understanding of how they came to the conclusions that they did.  And so that was a really interesting  conversation. Tomorrow morning will be Nicole and Robbie and I will be recording  another one and we'll have some interesting content there as well.
