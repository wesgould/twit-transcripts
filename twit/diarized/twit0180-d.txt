We couldn't do twit without it.  It's time for twit, the show that covers all things technological.  Today it's a Super Bowl twit.  And so we're giving John C. Dvorak the day off so he can make the dip.  We've got two people from the Forbes Web Celeb 25 joining us right now.  Jason Calacanis of Mahalo.com.  Jason is busy right now.  He's trying to register a domain.  Yes, I'm almost there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But that's great to be on the show again.  Yes, for the Web 25 celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We're all wearing gold plated headsets today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yes.  They came with our gold plated MacBook Airs courtesy of Forbes.  It's so funny.  We're just on the list.  But have you ever been invited to Forbes big conferences or any of this stuff?  No, they're like you can be on the Web 25 celebrity list, but you're not coming to the  CEO conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a pretty down market list, let's face it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a little ghetto.  It's ghetto.  Yeah.  Present company excluded.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Also on the list, Mr. Pete Cashmore.  We've never had Pete.  I'm really glad to have him from Scotland.  Are you on vacation, Pete?  No, I'm not.  Well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You make your home there?  I mean, I grew up here.  I'm here for most of the year, I guess.  Oh, I didn't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because you're in San Francisco a lot for events and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.  Good place in San Francisco as well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pete's a young guy who founded one of the hottest sites on the Web, Mashable.com.  Love Mashable.  I was shocked to learn that you're just 24.  You're kidding.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  He's in 23.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kid.  He's a kid.  What a punk.  Punk.  When Jason, when you hear stories like this, I mean, you think somebody at 23 is this successful,  you can only imagine what it might be like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He was very successful in his youth, to give him his chip.  That's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Truth be told, I did Cybersurfer magazine when I was 23.  Print Magazine, 50,000 print run.  And I did Silicon Island Reporter when I was 24.  Well, there you go.  So I was a publisher as well.  And people hated me too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  When I was 24, I was pulling a Michael Phelps.  Did you say people hated me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no.  Nobody hates you.  I mean, when you're that young and you do a publication like that.  Oh, they get jealous.  There's a little jealousy.  You have a little jealousy around you.  Oh, I'm jealous.  People get a little jealous of you.  I'm jealous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've never felt any jealousy.  I don't think so.  If you think they're kind of obsessive.  I think there's a little.  If I think they're like, oh, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you weren't such a snappy dresser, I'd be jealous.  Okay.  But I think, you know, because you're such a good dresser, I feel like, you know, well,  of course, that's why he's successful.  Let it slide.  Yeah.  Yeah.  That's why.  If I dressed as well as you, I'd probably be good looking too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, but I'm in a hoodie today and I'm chill.  I'm not like, I don't like sitting around in a three piece suit, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't blame you.  I think the big story of the week happened yesterday when Google, I got up at seven in  the morning Pacific time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, honestly, why'd they have to be there at that time for us bloggers?  I was trying to lie in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well no, wait a minute.  You're in the UK, so it was later in the day for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know, but I worked crazy hours.  I slept till the afternoon then went and.  I was actually Twitter that stopped me from getting to that story.  I blame you guys.  Why was that?  Well, I was going to, you know, I hadn't listened to the show.  So I was like, okay, I'll get some exercise, sit the dog for a walk, listen to Twitter,  your pre Super Bowl episode.  And yeah, and then I got back and that was all over Twitter.  It's crazy.  So you got to listen to Twitter.  Do you want to get the story out before I kind of interrupt you though?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, you got to get, you got to get, you got to listen to Twitter the day it comes  out so that you don't, you're not listening to last week's news, Pete.  That's the problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just trying to find a way to get away from the fact that I missed the biggest story  of the week.  You guys don't call it a lion.  You call it a sleep in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Lion's good.  I like lion.  I'm going to have a lion.  It sounds so cultured.  What is that?  A lion to nap?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's a sleep in.  It's when you sleep until that time, like 3 p.m. or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm going to have me a lion.  Speak English.  It is the King's English.  Speak American.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I got up about seven.  I wasn't lying in and I go on Twitter and somebody's Twittered me, man, Google's saying  that your site twit.tv is spyware.  And I went, oh boy, that's not good.  So I Googled it and sure enough, but then I realized, wait a minute, everything is spyware.  All the way down the list, it says this site may be malware.  Even google.com was flagged as malware.  So it literally for one hour, you couldn't, you couldn't Google anything.  And it's like an Internet power outage.  I mean, of course there's other choices.  You could Google it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just would come up with that error, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then you have to click through.  It says you shouldn't be going here.  Right, right, right, right.  You get the roadblock.  You don't get the site.  You get a, I'll read you what it says.  It's actually pretty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it's the roadblock.  And the roadblock then you have to click through and it's like, okay, I absolutely understand  that this is dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It says warning, this site may harm your computer.  Suggestions, return to the previous page and pick another result.  No, that won't work because they're all that way.  Or try another search or you can continue to twit.tv at your own risk.  I mean, it's pretty bad.  So guess what happened?  This is the thing that I find mind boggling.  Marissa Meyer posted initially said, oh, it's a, it's this site we use called stopbadware.org.  They sent us a list and it was screwed up.  And then stopbadware posted says, well, no man, you don't use our list.  You make your own list.  Don't be blaming us, bro.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm not sure if Meyer's post, if you read it necessarily.  Oh no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She revised it, Pete.  You missed it because you're having a lion.  Because I was sleeping.  Yeah.  Her initial post, you'll never know this, but her initial post clearly blamed them.  And they put up a post said, wait a minute.  And then she updated her post, by the way, in what is considered bad form, she didn't  mark, oh, I've made a change.  She just changed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you strike through.  That was the, you know, stand we had at web logs, which was if you make an area, you strike  through or put an update on it or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Say I'm sorry.  Say I screwed up.  What is the policy in Mashable?  What do you do if you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, we do update.  A strike through is problematic.  I seem to remember we used it early on and it doesn't necessarily come out in all the  feed readers.  It just doesn't convert very well and it looks messy.  But update definitely right at the top.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Update's a good, a good way to do it.  It says, look, we've got an update.  Update I apologize.  I blamed our partner wrongly.  In fact, we screwed up is what she should have said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It turns out in her defense, she was very fast to react to kind of an emerging situation  on the weekend.  I mean, she reacted within a few hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, wait a minute now, Pete.  You're Google and the entire web is down because of you.  I think she probably got a few phone calls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that would be the appropriate response time.  I think Google's down.  The appropriate response time is immediately.  I think you don't get bonus points for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Maybe even Larry and Sergey and Eric might have called.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I've got Eric on line one, I've got Sergey on line two and I've got Larry on line three.  Who do you want to talk to, Marissa?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's sort of like ABC goes off the air.  Like somebody at ABC knows, you know, this isn't like, you know.  What was it? It was about 40 minutes, wasn't it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, she says it was 40 minutes.  So here's what I'll say what happens, first of all, because it's really kind of shocking.  So they have a list, which by the way, I didn't even know they were doing this.  And I think that Google really needs to make this a opt out thing.  This should be a preference.  But apparently they create a list with help from stopbadware.org and perhaps others of  sites that have malware on them.  Now, admittedly, it's a huge problem on the net.  There are lots of sites out there that if you go to them with an unpatched Windows PC,  you'll get a Trojan on your system without your knowledge, without you doing anything,  just visiting the site.  So they're trying to be a good Internet citizen.  I have some issues with it, but they make a list.  And apparently it's a human generated list, which is kind of interesting.  And the human added a line for a site that was just slash.  Now in computer ease, slash is a wild card, means everything, every site.  So every site was flagged as malware for, well, she says 40 minutes.  It was a rolling outage.  So it started at 630 a.m. Pacific and went to 730 a.m. Pacific.  So it was an hour.  That's a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It is a long time when you consider they're doing, I mean, how many million searches they're  doing per minute, per second.  Per second.  Yeah.  It's kind of, and I did kind of comment on that, the economic impact.  I haven't seen anyone complaining about lost business, but the economic impact could be  fairly major if you've got that kind of volume going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And most sophisticated users know, and in fact, I tweeted, I think Carol Bartz did it,  because most sophisticated users know enough to go to Yahoo or somewhere else and it still  works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I kind of find this story refreshing.  I'll tell you why.  It's nice to know that as huge and important as Google is, they can still make a bonehead  mistake and just take the whole thing down.  You know, like it's not so redundant and perfect that it can't be, you know.  What's this plug do?  Exactly.  Yeah.  I mean, it's nice.  It's nice to know, you know, in this world of raid, you know, being standard on computers  and redundant data centers and synchronizing my SQL servers that somebody could trip on  the plug.  You know, it's still pretty basic and take out rack space or whatever happened, you know,  like that's kind of cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And of course, Twitter worked.  Twitter worked marvelously at this.  I mean, this is how I found out about it.  This is how the word spread.  I mean, Twitter was the nerve system of this whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nothing ironic there, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Twitter's up and Google's down.  I don't know.  To me, it's a little scarier than that because it shows how vulnerable this whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, you would think there'd be a double check in this, wouldn't you?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or a triple check.  There is now.  I'm sure there is.  Sergi Singh, send that list to me first.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  So, really, like we do stuff at the company I work for, we have a development server area  and we push changes to the development server area and then people check it.  They test like, you know, the top 20 behaviors and then they push the changes to the live  site and then check those same 20 things again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, not this case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They didn't check it.  They should have just pushed it to the development servers and done a search for iPod and seen  that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  Can you, if you're like Google, can you, I mean, really, realistically, you have a  development server?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course, they must have development environments.  All they have to do is take the Google index.  They must have, they have multiple copies of it in different cities and stuff.  So, all they do is take a subset of it.  It doesn't have to be every single, you know, search result.  They just, you know, take a little cluster of search results, like even a custom search  engine, you know, if it runs off the same algorithm, whatever, just make a little small  subset on, you know, 100 servers and push the changes there, test them.  They must do that all the time for different features.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm sure they'll be doing it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, this seems, you know, this is, this is the unknown, unknown kind of era.  Right.  Like you would never anticipate that somebody would put the slash in there and you would  never anticipate that code today would say, okay, for slash, that means every single thing  in the index.  Like, it's just, it's like one of those little quirky things that nobody could anticipate.  It's like a double or triple cascading era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  To me, it's like, it's something a science fiction movie, like the, the, you know, the  Orban project Colossus is taking over the world.  Oh, but there was a slash and the whole thing went, hmm.  That was it.  Humans survived.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I just, I'm thankful that they didn't put the slash like in the latest pacemaker,  you know, firmware upgrade, you know, like 12,000 people all of a sudden like power down,  you know, not good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Good for Twitter though.  I mean, it really showed, Twitter's really, you know, I kind of poo pooed it.  I thought, oh, this is really an inside thing that only a few kind of San Francisco types  are paying any attention to.  And then Demi Moore and Ashton Kutcher show up and let the party begin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mrs. Kutcher, I got like the Twitter, because I know Ashton and by association.  That's really them, right?  It's really them.  Ashton is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can tell it's them because it's so mundane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're getting a little crazy.  You know what?  Let me tell you something about celebrities.  They have a lot of free time.  And as you know, when you have a lot of free time, the internet is a great place to get  yourself in trouble.  And so Ashton now has a quick camera.  He's like, oh, I should be doing shows on the internet.  So he did the show with Kevin Rose at Sundance and they had like people doing tasks.  I mean, and so then he's got his quick cam and his neighbor was making a bunch of noise  building a house next to his, you know, mansion.  Another mansion was going in.  So he took a bunch of like those, you know, those three dollar fruit juices, ato wallahs  or whatever they are.  What are those three or four dollar juices you get?  Five bucks.  Yeah.  You know, like protein this and, you know, banana crazy drink, whatever.  So he takes like three of those and I'm like, well, that's like nine dollars with a beverage  right there goes to his deck and he's quicking himself, throwing them at the construction  workers.  And I'm like, I know you're the guy from Pugs, but that's actually not kind of funny.  In some ways it's funny that you're crazy, but like you're like this guy worth all this  money in your mansion and like these two schlubs are working at seven in the morning, you know,  putting up steel, busting their asses.  And I don't know if I can say that or not.  And you're throwing drinks at them?  Come on Ashton.  I mean, it's not to make it a class issue, but I mean.  So what's his Twitter handle?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's, what is his?  He's no, I can't remember because it's not Ashton Kutcher is it?  No, it's really weird.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's his beard name.  I'll find it.  Mrs. Kutcher has a picture of herself, which is like 12.  I mean, what is that picture?  And then she's she's posting twit pics, which is really cool.  I mean, you're seeing them like in there.  It's like real life.  You see A plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, A plus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  A P L U S K.  That's just I don't know what.  Oh, A plus K. I get it.  It's his initials.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And she already had like 10,000 people, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah.  He's got 11,000 followers.  He has 15.  You know who really took off this week, though?  Stephen Fry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, Stephen Fry was on British TV talking about Twitter, which has made it quite big  here, actually.  It's got quite a lot of following.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's like the number four.  Usually got 100,000 people.  He added 10,000 people in a day.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, what he did was the equivalent of going on something like Jay Leno and saying,  oh, follow me on Twitter.  I mean, it's that kind of audience is basically the biggest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On January 20th, he had 50,000 followers.  He's now 100,000.  Yeah, January 31st, 92,000.  So that's a pretty big jump.  It must have been when he was on TV.  We predicted that when the celebrities came on, then the top 100 would be all celebrities.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's getting that way.  It's Barack Obama's CNN news break.  Barack's got 221,000 now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He could win the election with those kind of numbers.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, Steve Gilmore said something interesting.  I wonder what you think of this.  You said that Twitter won Barack Obama the election.  That seems silly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's a slight overreach.  I don't think it's that important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but it makes a good headline on TechMeme.  I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I guess.  Well, you say you can know Twitter stories to TechMeme as well.  Yeah, you direct tested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What did you think of that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, now you can beg TechMeme as well as Twitter followers.  Because they've got a human.  They have a human now, right?  Yeah, of course.  I mean, the algorithm is not going to work at scale.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Mashable has always been human generated.  It has always been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, what's happening is like TechMeme was becoming too much like, you know, Matthew  Ingram or whoever, like, you know, the same five people writing, you know, like they see  whatever story goes on top of TechMeme and then they write a 50 word story about it,  you know.  We've had our railings on TechMeme on the show before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, it's, I think it may be, it may even be more nuanced than that, that simply people,  I'm seeing people blog less to some degree and I'm seeing people, you know, those users,  a lot of them are going over to FriendFeed I'm seeing.  I don't know if you're sensing that where a lot of the discussions that used to happen  on TechMeme are now over on FriendFeed where they'll start a topic and have a kind of a  group conversation about it.  I kind of feel like this disaggregation is somewhat destructive to TechMeme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You're calling it disaggregation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah, point at which, you know, everything kind of atomizes into all these little, you  know, places like Twitter, like FriendFeed, like, you know, well, FriendFeed is an aggregator  of them all.  Like, I mean, Pounds has gone now, Plurk, all these...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's actually an interesting concept because, and I like where you're going with it because  what blogs did to mainstream media was it fragmented.  It would be a more interesting word, I think, or appropriate.  So you took the conversation that was like, you know, here is Walt Mossberg's opinion  on the new, you know, Macbook, and then it got fragmented.  Here is, you know, Peter Rojas and 20 other people and Leo Laporte's and everybody's opinion.  And now it's going to get fragmented at another level, which is search.twitter.com, FriendFeed,  etc. is opinion.  So it's a pyramid or a funnel, which are where you prefer to look at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But ultimately, it's the aggregation that makes that powerful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well the search tools, yeah, the curation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think, you know, TechMeme's an aggregator of blogs, and I think one of the problems  might be becoming that there's just less blogs out there.  Just the sense I get, there's just, the majors have stuck around, but increasingly we're  not seeing the people who used to blog on, you know, those kind of smaller links from  TechMeme.  We're just not seeing them so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Interesting.  The concept of being an independent individual blogger is going away, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What's this do to Technorati?  Is it in trouble too?  Who?  Who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  And they talk about a, well, I don't even want to get into, I hate to say nasty things,  but you know, like talk about blowing it.  Those guys had some decent offers to get bought, and you know, they just, you remember there  was like South by Southwest, or you know, like an e-tech conference five years ago,  where I always had this thing where I'd walk in a conference and I'd look at what's on  everybody's monitor, and five years ago it was everybody doing an ego search on TechCrunch,  at Technorati.  And now it's everybody doing an ego search on search.twitter.com or TechMeme.  It had Twitter-like, you know, early adoption, I think, Technorati.  The search results at Technorati are terrible.  The design of the website is horrific.  I mean, it's like...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, if blogs are dying, there's nothing left to talk about on Technorati.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, they could have had the whole market of this really cool website called  BackType.  I don't know if you guys have seen this yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, it's a comment thing.  It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm not involved with it.  I just met the guy at a conference and he was like, oh, check out BackType.  I was like, OK.  Basically, what they do is they're aggregating all the comments from every other service  out there.  They just did it for Mahalo Answers.  They're really on it.  They're doing every possible place where you post a comment.  Then you claim your comments on these different systems.  I did an ego alert on there for Calacanis, for different misspellings of Calacanis, for  Mahalo, whatever, for Leo, Laporte, NakedPix.  Anytime anybody says those things, I get an alert.  It's different than your Google alert because your Google alert doesn't go into the comments.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's more interesting as well.  Have you noticed how people are much more critical of you when they think you're not  listening?  Exactly.  People on other blogs, that's where all the critical ones lie.  That's a really a good thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a very positive thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because they're incredibly surprised when you go and reply to that comment that they've  left on some tiny little blog that they think no one's going to read.  I think it's incredible as a service and it's incredible that it actually works.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I use Disqus on my blog, but this is like cross-platform.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is a search engine of every comment on the internet.  They're pulling in all the message boards and Disqus and comment blogs.  Those things don't normally get indexed except maybe in the Google index, not in Google News,  not in Google Blog Search.  You wouldn't know that they're there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think what it does, it also, you were speaking Leo about Disqus.  The way they do it is obviously you sign up for an account and then all your comments  are aggregated and you can feed them into friend feed and stuff.  What Backtype I think does is looks for the email address.  As well as what Jason just described, which is like you can find all the comments about  you on absolutely any platform.  You can also go and create your own profile.  If you leave comments on virtually any blog and it doesn't have to be Disqus enabled,  you can pick those up.  It's almost better than what we had before, which were things like Co-comment.  There's one called Comments, like Co.ment.  That one's gone away now.  It's kind of an advance.  This actually does not support Disqus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It has intense debate, but not Disqus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's really interesting about it is I get an alert that somebody mentions my name somewhere.  I immediately go post a follow-up comment and they're like, whoa, Calakana says on it  and it blows people's mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, and that's a good idea.  I mean, if I were if I were Shaquille O'Neal or Ashton Kutcher, I would do that to protect  my name.  You got to be careful.  I'm out there.  I'm watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think Jason's right.  So it's an early warning you're about to say, which is like, you know, if someone has a  beef you can squash and go and yeah, before it's on Pollywag address it.  Apologize profusely for your mistake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm going to have to do this.  That's really cool.  This is back type dot com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not just so you know, like everybody's like, oh, you're promoting things that you're  involved with. I am not involved with that.  I do that service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I promote stuff.  That's all I do is promote stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I know it's had to be careful because people like every say, oh, with the dash,  you know, GPS or whatever, like, oh, you're promoting that.  I'm like, no, I just like it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, that was a sad story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, they're not making the hardware anymore.  It was making software.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It was a I really liked it.  They were getting their maps from somewhere goofy, though, because it steered me off a  mountain once.  But I didn't drive off the mountain, but we were looking for a hotel up in the Sierra  and I followed the map to the hotel and I ended up on a dirt road.  And there was a guy living in his car there.  So we asked him how to get back and he told us, I don't know, but go to the bar, man.  That guy knows everything.  And we got back.  But but yeah, but I love the dash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love the I save at least, you know, three or four hours a month because of the  dash. But where is it going to happen?  Well, what they're doing now is they're going to become a software provider because being  a hardware provider in a market where nobody's buying consumer electronics, you know,  let alone a second GPS, you know, a lot of cars have them.  So, you know, I have four cars.  Each one has three of them have a built in GPS and one of them and all four of them have  a dash in it. And so that's sort of bad.  Then you have to get to opinions.  Well, that actually, you know, that sounds crazy.  But I drove to Park City for Sundance and I put 10 hour drive.  I put the dash on and the and the regular car one and it was what if they fight?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, don't turn there. Turn here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's one good thing about the about the Tom Tom is has celebrity voices.  I have Gladys from Portal doing and she lies.  She says turn right when you're supposed to turn left and stuff.  It's really great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can you imagine a Dvorak GPS?  That'd be genius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's they have an actual they paid Dennis Hopper to do one.  And he goes, you're here, man.  But why would anyone want to go here?  It's really it's it's kind of fun.  There's a Mr. T.  And yeah, it's a.

Transcript:  That was good. That was really good.  So we're going to take a break.  There's lots more to talk about.  This is a this is a fun news week.  We've got Pete Cashmore here from Mashable.com.  Pete wants to talk about the twist of all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do want to talk about this west of all.  So we will talk about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We'll talk about the twist of all.  Well, let's talk about this.  We're talking about Google, the Google bomb, the famous Google bomb,  which took four years to fix.  Took about four days to fix for Obama  and a lot more, including a logic bomb at Fannie Mae.  Before we do that.  See, that's called a tease.  Also here, Jason Calacanis.  I don't need to tell you that.  He's a K.A. K.A.  Christopher Walken.  Uh, I want to tell you about GoToMeeting, our fine sponsor, Citrix.  They make two great products.  GoToMeeting and GoToMyPC.  GoToMeeting is how you save yourself a lot of business travel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is who are these people who are traveling everywhere? Crazy.  With the cost.  Jerry Seinfeld for GoToMyPC.  What's the point?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you do you love airline peanuts?  I don't know.  Go to GoToMeeting.com slash twit.  You don't have to eat airline peanuts.  You don't have to sit in the middle aisle.  You don't have to take off your shoes of security.  And you don't have to ride a bus, Mike Harrington.  You can you can stay where you are.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I took Southwest, but I was actually going northeast.  What do they do? Rename the plane.  Who what do you do?  What do you do? You go to GoToMeeting.  Right. Go to My PC.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  GoToMeeting.com. Here's the deal.  Here's the deal. Here's the deal.  By the time I'm finished done talking, you'll be you'll have this installed.  By the time Jason stops doing his impressions, you'll have this installed.  And then when you want to have a meeting, you can be on the phone and just say,  hey, go to GoToMeeting.com.  Here's the meeting ID.  Or you can use Outlook and click a link and it'll send it out to you.  They go to GoToMeeting.com.  They don't have to have any software installed,  but they're now suddenly seeing your screen.  So they see your PowerPoint presentation.  Or if you want to collaborate, you can open a document together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Web browser. Just surf the web. Show the site off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Exactly. You can even show video.  I mean, it's pretty amazing.  It's good for training, too, if you have a program that, you know,  you're training people in.  They don't even have to have the program.  They can use it on your system using GoToMeeting.  So here's the deal. 30 days free.  It's a good deal anyway, because it's a month of unlimited meetings.  You don't have to count the meetings or watch the clock for a very low rate.  I think it's 49 bucks.  I should have it in front of me. I don't know what they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you could do it for a month and just try it.  Try it free.  See if it actually works.  You know what? People should just try this, because I'll tell you what,  like five or ten years ago, whatever, when this whole category of software  came out, not just GoToMeeting, but I tried it and I was like,  oh, my God, this is not ready for prime time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. No, the early early attempts were terrible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was like your screen is skipping and doesn't connect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think a lot of people have that in their mind that this is what  and it's gotten so much better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now it's like they send you a permalink.  And then what I do is I make a tiny URL out of it so it's nice and short.  I can read it over the phone and I'm like, hey, tinyurl.com slash,  you know, A, B, seven, six, four bang.  They're right in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Or you can even name them now with tinyurl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you can name them, right?  You're like, this is Jason's meeting.  And then it's it actually works.  That's the thing about this technology.  It actually works now.  So people should just totally give it a second shot.  You're so nice, Jason.  It's true. I use it.  What am I supposed to say?  You're so great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, show up at technology.  Go to meeting.com slash to it.  That's all we need to say. Try it free in the next 30 days.  And we do thank him so much for supporting the show.

When your father died,  he gave to me your watch and said,  Jason, give this watch to my son.  It's so I put this watch  the only place I could to keep it from those Vietnam  those Vietcong, they wanted the watch.  I put it in my ass  and stayed there for two years.  And now I'm giving it to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You think he's making this up?  This actually what movie was that?  It's such a great movie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That was from wasn't Pulp Fiction.  Was it true romance?  What was that scene?  It's such a great scene.  Oh, you know what?  Other greatest scene ever he did.  Somebody in the chat room knows it's Pulp Fiction.  Yeah.  The other incredible scene is in true romance where he and Dennis Hopper.  It's I can't really do it here because it's a little too outrageous, but he's like,  you know, he plays a hit man and he's going after this guy.  He's trying to find his son.  And he's like, you know, you're lying to me.  There's 18 ways you can tell if somebody is lying.  And you're lying to me right now.  And then Dennis Hopper's like, oh, you're Sicilian.  No, the Moors, they conquered Sicily.  That means that your great, great, great grandmother was F'd by a B.  I just it's the crazy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I haven't seen that movie.  I have to get that movie now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, true romance.  True romance was written by Tarantino and directed by somebody else.  He couldn't direct or whatever.  He didn't have the cloud or something.  Somebody look it up here.  But, oh, man, what a great film.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, that's true.  Romance is awesome.  I love those great scenes, those scenes you just never forget.  There's just intense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The you've never heard of the Millennium Falcon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Fast enough for you.  Old man.  He wasn't in that movie.  Oh, sorry. He was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He should have been.  He should have been. That was good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've never seen the Saturday Night Live where they have Christopher  walking doing the screen test.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, my God. No.  How funny. That's got to be on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's can we get back to technology instead of kind of see this great

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  with no Dvorak, we can completely go down a rat hole for hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know. And he's like, you know, we're talking about Twitter for the 15th time.  The show would drive him crazy.  I'm never going to join Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's busy watching some girls sing on the Super Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's like, two years, I'm never going to join Twitter.  And now he's like, can you retweet and get some more followers?  I'm falling down the list.  The real shaft.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Hey, what's with retweeting?  That has become a huge meme now.  Yo, the retweet is on kid to retweet.  And there's even a website, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The tracks are retweeting it right now.  I think Jason and I are the top.  So what is that site retweeter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're using Retweet Radar.  Retweet, wait, are that retweet?  We tweet, wait, are we?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We were finding friends in the mountain of information.  Oh, well, we tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, Jason's winning. I'm second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a wasco.  A wasco. Look at that. Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jason Mashable, Mayhem Studios, Gary Vee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Live.tv is the top thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, so this is somebody uses the word retweet or RT.  Is that what happens? Yeah.  Yeah. Oh, because I said, please retweet the live dot whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, that's other people using it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So retweeting actually makes sense is a great way to spread your  your people's awareness.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Your meme. And also, we were talking about that Forbes list of top  web celebs, you know, one of the things they used to rank  the top Twitter list, did you see that?  And they put Guy Kawasaki at the top.  And the way they rank that one of the ways was based on retweets.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How did I was really wondering how they rank that?  Because I just barely squeaked on at the bottom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I know. And you have a bunch of followers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I wasn't on last year and I was on at 17 the year before.  I don't understand it. I think it's BS every now.  This is a time when I would like to have John on because John,  who also made the list above me, John loves to poopoo these lists.  And I would really love to see if he would poopoo this one with him on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You see, this is how these lists are made.  You get a bunch of editors that have last year's list and they have the year before's list.  And then they just take off a couple of people from each year just to stick it to you.  Exactly. And to show that they're maybe paying attention, but they're just taking it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So do you know, Pete, though, that they did more than that?  There was some algorithm in this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, I mean, I think that seeing as I was above both of you guys on the Forbes  top web, I think it's perfectly perfectly valid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  God, you're killing me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  What? I don't know why I didn't make it.  I actually did a what number are you like six?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's real high. It validates the list right there.  He's real high. No offense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He he he he.  We'll give you the whole because it's cruel.  But Harrington's I only invited people this week who are on the list.  Right. I thought, well, we could just do a whole show.  But only two of you showed up.  But eight of the people in twenty five have been on Twitter many times.  Perez Hilton, number one.  OK, I'll grant that Mike Harrington, number two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, press Hilton.  Why? Because he's got the reach.  Yeah, I guess. OK, fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's got a nice God save the Queen shirt.  And he's of all the people on the list.  He's the only one normal people have heard of.  Yeah, which gives him some clout.  Mike Harrington.  Kevin Rose.  OK, Frank Warren, number four.  Oh, what? I don't know.  He's the post secret guy, isn't he?  Oh, yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's been. I don't know if many people know that Frank Warren runs it.  But it's a.  Oh, post secret is where you post your secret.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, now there's two other secret, which is I think even more fun than post secret, frankly.  Post secret blogspot dot com.  Post secret blogspot dot com.  I don't know if a guy with an address at blogspot dot com should be number four on the web celeb list.  But OK, OK.  Corey Doctorow, number five.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That wasn't that wasn't meant in any particular way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I just want to say, Jason, he feels the same way about you.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  We hate each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could tell you stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He does not like you.  And, you know, I was going to invite him and then I remembered, oh, no, I don't think they get along.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just think he's pompous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's just.  Then the good looking Pete Cashmore.  Mm, charming.  You look like somebody in train spotting or something, you know, like the Colin Farrell thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They all do with them.  They don't shave in England and they get the hair and Scott, whatever it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Like they squint their eyes.  How did you get the idea for Mashable, Pete?  You founded it when you were 19.  So I tech grudge.  Oh, hey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you got me deep, Calacanis.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  True.  It's what you're.  You can't tell me it's not.  It was four years ago.  I know.  But tech grudge was the inspiration.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You can't say it's not.  Was it around four years ago?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Of course it was tech grudge for around for six years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Both sites launched in the same year, which was I don't recall when would that have been  like 2006, I guess.  No, 2000, mm hmm.  So around then they launched in like the summer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But was it or was it inspiration?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think tech grudge was certainly an influence, whether it was the inspiration, I don't know.  I think they I think you can certainly credit them with having to find the market for coverage  of startups.  I think the markets have moved on since then.  And I think all the blogs have kind of diversified a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But Mashable has become more about social media than anything else, right?  Right.  I think that's a great pitch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say that, you know, I was working on a startup at the time and I was like, hmm,  how am I going to get into this?  How am I going to, you know, network with everyone in this space?  And I started writing.  Especially in Scotland.  Yeah.  And that's kind of how it took off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Number seven, Beppi Griot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, really big in Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Really big.  I'm big in Italy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's another place where if you if you look at Technorata, even though you're saying it's  dated, he's actually quite high up on there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Beppi who?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Beppi who?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Beppi what?  Beppi Lapeo?  Am I saying it right?  B-E-P-P-E-G-R-I-L-L-O.  Beppi Griot.  Beppi.  He's the oldest guy on the list by one year over John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a little like affirmative action there.  They wanted to get an international in there.  Maybe.  Beppi Grillo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think he is because I go to YouTube and his videos are on the front page.  Oh, I know this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I take it all back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He has a fair bit of influence.  He just doesn't have influence in this stage or anything.  He's kind of funny.  I just put him in the chat room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Kudos to them.  You're right.  Maybe that's affirmative action, but that's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He got the international card.  Is there somebody who's number 26 to 50 in the United States who's more deserving?  Yes.  But do you want to have diversity in some people outside the US?  Yes.  So it's not it's tokenism.  That's fair.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  More than affirmative action.  All right.  Deuce.  Heather Armstrong.  Deuce.  Deuce is I think Deuce deserves that.  Yeah, Deuce is huge.  Huge blog.  Huge blog.  Huge.  Blogger.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mom.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's pretty much it.  Guy Kawasaki, number nine.  See, you beat him, Pete.  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Guy Kawasaki, number nine.  Famous for doing nothing.  That's a schtick.  No, that's a schtick.  He says I'm famous.  I've done nothing in my career.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, he's done some stuff, but Altop is not what I would call a war.  I mean, he's doing well, I guess.  It seems like an odd.  He's kind of saying it's a magazine rack.  Is Trumors still going?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Trumors was an interesting idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think it's still going.  I don't know if it really took off, but it was a great idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  He's promoting Altop a lot more now.  Yeah.  You know, I think Altop's interesting.  I think he's a pundit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's a pundit.  He's a pundit.  There's the lovely Jason Kalakandeson at number 10.  And they got a beauty shot at you, Jason.  Oh, yeah, they got the Vaseline on the lens for something or something.  It looks like you're in a foggy room.  It's beautiful.  And you've got a dreamy look in your eyes.  I got to find...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't even know what this list is.  No one knows where it is.  It's one of those lists as well.  This is a page view generating machine.  Oh, it's totally what it is.  You have to go to his slideshow.  This is designed to get page views.  It's totally what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should have gotten this on devorek.org slash blog.  Yeah, I'll give you your page here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'll paste it in.  It's totally what it is.  It's totally what it is.  It's totally designed about...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There is actually like a single page with the full list on it.  But then once you go into the list, you have to go through the slideshow.  You go 20 page...  It's 25 page views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, are they ripping off the people who are buying ads on those pages?  Hell yeah.  Nobody's stopping any of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think people have said that page views are dead for a long, long while.  I actually think that traffic might be dead as a concept and unique visitors.  I think we're moving on to engagement.  You bet.  As a concept and influence.  A lot of people are saying, okay, we've moved from page views now, but it's uniques that count.  Well, uniques don't really count.  If banner ads don't work and CPM ads have less influence than they used to,  then you're really talking about back to engagement and what that means and what influence means.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't really have to worry about it, Pete.  The bottom line is what happens with these systems is the advertisers take...  The marketers just, they back it out themselves.  So if you want to sell it based on uniques or page views or whatever,  they're going to look at the Forbes thing and say, okay, 25 pages got us this percentage click through.  And then somebody who has one long page at Mashable got us 25 times that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're really shooting themselves in the foot, aren't they?  Because that kind of stuff gets on dig and people just bury it because they're going to be bothered with getting redirected every second to another page.  On dig, they did a funny thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They're like, their dig users are so vicious yet intelligent that they're like, lame, 25 page views.  And they put the list there in case you want to see the lame list, not go to the website.  And not only do they block the ads, they're like they're blocking the site.  They're like, here's what's on the clink.  Please don't click on it.  Click block.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They linked the print.  There's often a print page button.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, I looked for the print page button on this.  They're smart.  There is none.  There's no way to get that list in a single link.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Those are the same exact people who don't click on ads.  So it's yeah, they're ripping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, there's not, you know, Mark Cuban had an interesting post on blog maverick.  The great internet video.  Lied.  You guys read that?  I did not actually put this in the book.  I heard about it.  I did not read it.  Basically, I could summarize pretty quickly.  He's saying that the problem with this whole idea of streaming video of people watching  the Super Bowl, let's say on the internet is it doesn't scale.  It's too expensive.  Unlike broadcast, you pay per person.  And there's just no way you can deliver large audiences.  And my response to it is exactly what you just said, Pete, is it's no longer a numbers  game.  People are not, you know, the future going forward is not quantity.  It's quality.  So they're much less interested in, you know, 18 million Seinfeld viewers, much more interested  in a targeted number of people who actually might buy the product and who are really listening  to the program or paying attention to the web page or engaged in the community.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and that's what's really intriguing about Twitter and these various microblogging  platforms, is that you get an immediate response and you can see how engaged people are.  I mean, retweeting is a perfect example of engagement.  Yeah, no kidding.  It's an example of how much influence you have.  And these various graphs as well where you can track, you know, not only, okay, how many  followers does Jason Calacanis have, but how many followers do his followers have?  And you end up someone like Jason Calacanis has millions of people who he influences every  time he speaks.  So, you know, I think that's worth tracking more so than page views or unique or any of  these things.  But it always takes ages for the advertisers to catch up.  I mean, we're still selling banner ads.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, agencies are not notorious for being forward thinking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And then it becomes that whole problem of, okay, where do you draw the line?  If you want to get advertisers into the content and into the stream, and if you want to start  crossing over between those two, I mean, like, you know, you do ads where clearly it's designated  as an ad, but by the same token, you're kind of endorsing it.  And then you get all these kind of church stage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's a prediction for 2009.  Guaranteed YouTube goes to pre-roll.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I find those little lower third pop-ups, those are annoying.  Don't you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would rather sit through a 15 second pre-roll than those bottom lower thirds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You're trying to click the X and then you just know you're going to hit the ad accidentally.  It's such a scam.  Zach.  How many people clicking those are just accidentally clicking them?  Of course, 90%.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the same people who take, like, you go to like the Pirates Bay and like if you miss  click like that, not that I've ever done this because I would never use BitTorrent, but  if you were to go to Pirates Bay and click on like the Torrent, like if you miss the  Torrent icon by, you know, two pixels, you're like boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, seven, like,  you know, porn sites immediately open.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But see, these guys are really doing the whole Internet as a service because it's quickly  going to become apparent that none of this stuff works and eventually aren't advertisers  going to abandon it and say, look, banner ads didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm hoping they're going to abandon it faster now because the economy sucks.  They can't afford it.  Hopefully they're going to suddenly say, okay, how much of my advertising budgets wasted  and go for engagement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think one of the reasons our advertisers are not leaving, in fact, they're coming to  us is because of that engagement and because we produce results and we're doing something  very different.  You know, we're not doing banner ads, but you're right about the church and state issues,  Pete.  And that's a big issue for us is this notion of where's the editorial line.  I mean, I try to make the ad very clear.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not an issue for me.  I love all these products equally.  Well, that's the other thing.  When are we going to get to Audible?  Okay, let's do it.  Wow.  Listen, I wanted to, true story, I wanted to do War and Peace on Audible.  They wouldn't give me the book to read.  They said my voice was too jarring.  Is that true?  True story.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Christopher Walken reading books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not going to happen.  Didn't work so well.  LeVar Burton actually, and I've connected him with Audible, is interested.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think this is a, well, maybe I shouldn't say it.  I don't know if it's a secret, but he wants to do pro bono readings of public domain stuff,  which I really admire him for.  I think that's such a great idea.  It's a reading rainbow.  Because he's into that.  You know, he's into that spreading the word about reading and stuff.  We stopped, we stopped at the 25 list at number 10.  We're not going to go below that because Jason's number 10 and Robert Scoble's number 11,  so we don't want to go any farther.  Robert's sitting there going, you didn't get to 11.  Go to 11.  Hi, I'm Robert Scoble.  Who are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's the first line of every video he does.  I know, I like it.  Hi, I'm Robert Scoble.  Who are you?  It's like, okay, he's the guest on your show.  You're supposed to know his name.  Who are you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My name is Steve Jobs.  What do you do?  I'm Robert Scoble.  I did ask Will Wheaton to be on the show and he couldn't do it today, but he will be on

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  next week because he's also on that list.  Awesome.  He's awesome.  Love him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nate Silver.  I'm really admire Nate.  He did 538.com and became an instant star, instant pundit.  I'm going to go to the next one.  I'm going to go to the next one.  He's the guy who was the baseball statistician.  Oh, Malek, of course, deserves to be on that list.  Respect.  Real journalist.  Yeah, a real journalist.  That's the first, by the way, on the list.  Old school.  Old school.  Matt Drudge.  Whatevs.  Next.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Never gave me a link.  I'm just saying.  You know, you could have had your moment.  You give me one link to Mahalo, I am going to be singing your praises on this week in  tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Matt Drudge.  I would love the Drudge.  I would love to.  Owen Thomas.  Mech.  He didn't quite get the beauty shot that you got, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well that's because he's not good looking.  It's kind of a funny picture.  That's the source material right there, man.  It's kind of a funny picture.  Have you ever met Owen Thomas in person?  He's like 800 pounds, shaved head.  Oh, well then this is flattering.  It's a trainer, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Then that's flattering.  Dave Weiner, number 19.  My pal.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Seth Coden.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're actually having lunch.  We're having lunch, Dave.  I love Dave.  We're working out.  Everybody hates him.  Every time Dave's on the show, I get more hate mail than I do for you, which is saying  something.  That's an accomplishment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know what though?  I tell you something.  I'm looking at the chat room today.  I'm batting like a thousand people who love you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're loving the Calacanis.  Seth Coden, number 20.  Brian Lamb, number 21.  Ryan Block got pushed off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It sounds very, very blogger focused.  The question is really what's a celebrity?  I think they've missed out a bunch of YouTube celebrities who would be far more recognizable  and visual.  Whereas even like, dare I say, like Tazonde or someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Huge compared to any of these people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Would anyone recognize us if we were actually walking down the street?  No.  I mean, come on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where are the YouTube celebrities in all this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's an interesting question as well because then it becomes what's a celebrity?  I think increasingly in these micro celebrities, it's really who is the most connected person  in your network of friends rather than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The whole notion of celebrity is dissolving.  When you see Ashnick Kutcher and Demi Moore on Twitter...  Ashnick Kutcher is less of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at his Twitter follower numbers compared to someone like Jason or you.  You see that he's less of a celebrity within this niche than he is in the mainstream.  But it's just a different flavor of celebrity.  Different flavor.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Where's Tila Tequila in all this?  I mean, she's like...  Tila Tequila.  Tila Tequila has got a gazillion people on MySpace.  How many friends does she have?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But MySpace is so down market, we're not paying attention.  Yeah, exactly.  This list...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's Forbes.  So Forbes is not going to go there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I think they missed the boat entirely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think they got on the boat and sailed it out of the harbor.  I think they did perfectly.  Really?  I think it's a wonderful list.  Just because you're on it.  I say it's...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's your first time on a list, Pete.  Pete, you're going to have many more lists.  I know it's your first time.  Don't get too excited.  Don't get too excited.  It's not going to change your page views.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're so mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I'm just joking with him.  He knows I like him.  I know.  It took four years.  I read his stuff.  You've got good stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, you're a good writer.  I like when you write good stuff about us.  It counts for something.  I read Mashable.  I love Mashable.  I'm not crazy about the design.  You know when I first met...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, well, that's changeable.  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not a slam on you.  You redesigned and it got...  But it's just...  I don't know what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The blue or something.  The blue.  The blue.  The blue.  The blue.  I don't know what it is.  The blue or something.  The blue.  What color would you prefer?  I don't know.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Red.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Leo, it's called RSS.  It doesn't matter.  Nobody goes to the site.  You're right.  I rarely go to the site.  I read the RSS.  You're absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Then you just find all the headlines, pick an interesting one.  I mean, people really don't read blogs in the way they used to when we started anyway.  They skim in Google Reader and then they find what's interesting or they...  Increasingly, they look at the Twitter headlines and then they just wait for something that  appeals to them.  It's really changing.  This whole...  You can't underestimate how much Twitter has changed what we do.  I know people complain that we go on and on about it, but it's fundamentally changed the  model for bloggers.  We were just talking about how blogging is kind of condensed into just this semi-professional  thing, whereas before it was personal.  On so many levels, it's changed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really fragmenting in some very interesting ways.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was going to say actually, when I first met Jason...  I think we've only met once, Jason.  No, we've met more than once.  Have we?  I believe so.  I remember...  Remember I saw you outside the Palace Hotel in San Francisco.  This is going to be very inside baseball.  And I was like, oh my God, it's Jason Calacanis.  And you were on your phone or something.  You were like, whatever.  Yeah.  Remember that?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Whatever.  Don't remember.  Whatever.  There was about 8,000 people come up to me and say hello.  Whatever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I know this is the thing.  It might have been very meaningful to you, but as a web celebrity on the list...  Oh, please, Jason.  And now look what's happened.  Look what's happened.  Now look what happened.  Now you're above me.  This proves how meaningless the lists are.  Hey, it's Christopher Walken.  I do remember meetings.  I remember meeting you.  I remember meeting you.  The problem was I was meeting Christopher for lunch.  Calacanis, web 2.0.  I couldn't get a ticket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I called Patel.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Obama...  Well, let's see.  How long was it when you...  If you Googled miserable failure would take you to Bush...  Are we onto actual news now?  Yeah.  I've kind of changed gears.  Sorry about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You need to alert me when we do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I know.  Whiplash.  It took four years for Google to address the Google bomb that took you to George Bush's  Whitehouse.gov when you searched for miserable failure.  Same thing, of course, when Whitehouse...  Even though Obama's inaugurated, the Google bomb still takes you to the Whitehouse.gov.  Four days later?  It took him four years to fix it for Bush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Two, four days.  Is the allegation that Google is somehow more supportive of Obama than...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that would be the allegation.  And not much of a surprise.  I mean, Eric Schmidt was out there campaigning for him practically.  I think he was, as a matter of fact.  He was, yeah.  I don't know if you're following this, but you're not so far off.  IRCOM, which is an Irish internet service provider, has done a deal with the music industry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Have you followed that story?  I have not followed that story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  For a while they held out, but eventually they've settled with IFPI, which is the group  IFPI that's the RIAA of Europe, essentially.  They run 90% of Ireland's music market.  It's a voluntary agreement, but basically they're saying, we'll just cut off anybody.  We'll disconnect them if they go to BitTorrent, if they download files.  As soon as the music industry sends us a copyright notice, boom, they're gone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hate to say it, but if you stole something in the real world...  That's true.  Well, is it safe?  It sounds crazy, and it's going to be unfair because there's going to be a lot of...  They're going to cut off a lot of people who weren't doing something else.  That's the issue.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In the real world there's something called due process.  But here it's just, hey, we assert it.  We know already, at least in the States, that the recording industry has asserted piracy  wrongly many times.  But IFPI comes along and says, this guy's stealing.  Boom, you're turned off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have such an easy solution to all this.  When you sign up for your ISP, they should have a $5 a month option that says unlimited...  If you have a subscription to one of the five services, or you spend above this amount of  money, we're not going to turn your thing off or whatever.  Just like when you buy cassette tapes, a portion of that goes to...  In Canada it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you buy DAT tapes in the US, it does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just come up with something like that where they can say, if you've got a subscription  to a patient...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why they don't want to do that?  They did it in Canada.  And as a result, everybody in Canada says it's legal.  It's legal to pirate.  And so even though the Canadian recording industry, CIRA has said, no, no, no, no, it's  not legal to pirate.  But they've never been able to pursue a case.  And finally a Canadian judge said, it's the same thing as having a Xerox machine in a  library.  It's legal.  And that was that.  That's why the RIAA would never do such a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I see.  We got to hold the line or else the dam is going to come down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, the dam...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got news for you.  Yeah, right.  You're swimming in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a little late to put a finger in a dike, so to speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Moving on.  Quickly.  Fast, fast, quick.  Get another story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I want to speak about this one.  You sent me over this Wiki answers thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, let's talk about this because I'm sure Jason has an opinion on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's Mahalo answers, isn't it?  Which is very interesting too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So Jimmy Wales has created...  Actually apparently this has been around for a while.  It's called technically Wikia Answers.  And it's basically a Wiki Mahalo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a Q&A service as Wiki.  Answers.com has wiki.answers.com.  They've had it for a couple of years, like two or three years.  It's doing really well.  Is it?  Yeah.  The problem is the answers actually turn out to be terrible.  Which one are we talking about?  Yahoo Answers.  Oh, Wikia Answers.  Answers.com launched wiki.answers.com.  Which they call Wikia Answers.  Which is wiki.answers.com.  Then Wikia has wikiaanswers.com with no dot for the subdomain.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, Wikia claims that they started this before Wikia Answers did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The end result is all of the content winds up being cut and pasted from somewhere else.  Because nobody has ownership of the words and it's all anonymous, you really don't want  to take the advice from there.  But they can become huge SEO businesses because what they're doing is they put a thousand  Pokemon questions in day one.  One of my people looked at it and none of the questions have answers.  So they're basically going to put in like here's a thousand questions about Pokemon,  a thousand questions about Call of Duty, and then get all the SEO traffic until Google  says, oh, this is kind of a little bit of a scam.  And then they get pushed down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Are you talking about Wikia or Answers.com doing this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think I know Wikia is doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Wikia.  I think it's because people Google questions so often.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why is this better than Wikipedia?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mahalo Answers is doing quite well.  What happens is people sometimes want to type in a specific question and get a specific  answer.  So, you know, I want to go to San Diego with my kids.  What time of year should I go?  My kids are aged these ages.  And then you want to get like a more customized answer.  And people like to do it in a community.  And then what happens is if somebody types in San Diego with kids or San Diego vacation  with kids, that page is going to come up.  I mean, how many times do you stumble upon a Yahoo answer?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And this is why Google answers almost lost out.  Well, did lose out to Yahoo Answers because they were essentially an open system that  was free and they thought, OK, we're going to get the search.  Yahoo Answers, by the way, is hilarious.  Have you seen some of the questions that end up on there?  Yeah, I was bad before.  We've got some up here.  This is a good one.  I live in Georgia, but I don't see Russia nowhere not even hear sound.  But it says there's tanks.  Should I be worried?  This is someone talking about the invasion of Georgia.  And then someone corrects him and points out that it's the other Georgia.  It's not actually your Georgia.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Type in how is Babi formed?  Yeah, that's a classic one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the class here.  It's a video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I've got up a list of good ones.  How to turn computer monitor into mirror question mark.  Does anyone know if it's possible to use a background that would essentially turn my  computer monitor into a mirror?  Scanning a mirror does not work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, we'd like to thank everybody for this week's tweet.  How do we do better than that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Here is how a baby how is Babi here is how how is Babi form?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Don't play.  Is it really foul?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, it's incredible.  It's just it's just play it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is from is this from answers.com?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is from Yahoo Answers.  And it's somebody asked how is Babi form, but it really meant baby.  But the answer was as bad as the question.  And then it's become a meme.  It's a meme, but just play it.  It speaks for itself.  It's everybody should listen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's not doesn't seem to be actually playing.  I'm not sure what I've done.  It's on YouTube.  I'm looking at it on YouTube.  DSL Extreme.  You have a you have a link.  Here it is.  Oh, it's on YouTube.  I'm looking at it on YouTube.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  DSL Extreme.  You have a you have a link.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's on YouTube.  You have a link.  Oh, here it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah.  How is Babi formed?  How is Babi formed?  How girl get pregnant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They need to do way in stain mother who killed their Babi's because these Babi can't fricks  back.  It was on the news this morning.  A mother in awe who had killed her three kids.  They are taking the three Babi back to New York to lady to rest.  My barrier with the father who lost his children.  I am truly sorry for your lots.  How is Babi formed?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  How is Babi formed?  How girl get pregnant?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  They need to do way in stain mother who killed their Babi's because these Babi can't fricks  back.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Okay.  Okay.  Okay.  I got it.  So these are real answers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, yeah.  And that kind of points to the problem.  Yeah, that points to the problem.  They're kind of...  It's four year olds answering you.  What's the incentive for Yahoo is to get as many search results as possible for those  terms.  They're not really incentivized to give brilliant, amazing answers.  People who are on that obviously aren't incentivized to...  Well, aren't really that kind of community that's going to give great answers.  If you're an expert on how is Babi formed, you're maybe not going to be hanging around  Yahoo Answers anyway.  So you're going to get an answer back from a 12 year old and it's problematic.  It's not problematic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's hysterical.  It's problematic only if you want the answer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I do wonder to some degree...  It's not real.  Whether people are now...  Because it's become such a meme, people are now just creating those questions because  there have been a few.  I've seen a few from inverted commas, Pedo Bear on dig.  You want me to give you a...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You checked out Mahalo Answers, right?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Briefly, I've heard of it.  Mahalo is something ma-what?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, we did answers and we put a currency on top of it.  Yeah, it basically makes it higher questions.  But somebody's like, I don't understand.  Why do you not have all the stupid stuff here?  Whatever.  And two secrets.  Number one, we delete the stupid questions and we delete the stupid answers.  And then we tell people, by the way, you can only give an intelligent answer.  We'd say it nicely.  And then number two, we look at all the answers that are making it to the homepage and we  correct the spelling and grammar errors.  That's smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's very smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Somebody told me that the homepage has got seven spelling errors in it.  So change them.  They're like, well, is that wrong to change somebody's spelling error?  I was like, if I made a mistake, I would want to change it.  So change it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that's editorial.  That's making it add value.  But nobody does this.  Well, because they don't care because they're looking for the hits.  They don't really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And also, you know, the typos are actually really valuable to search traffic because  people make typos when they search for stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Sure.  So people are searching for how is Babi formed.  So they're going to find it.  If you're searching how is a baby made, you're not going to find it.  So it's good to have.  Do you think the typos kind of cluster around the same errors all the time?  Yeah, they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, you could do that.  I mean, yeah, that's interesting.  Did you mean?  Yeah, I mean, of course.  But you know what the thing is, you can't really build a large, sustainable brand and  business around that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, no.  But who?  But obviously, these people aren't caring about that.  Yeah, it's a hit and run kind of a thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, and the inverse model really doesn't succeed because Google had a system where  experts would pay for their answers and closed down.  So didn't work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I think that's why we're doing a hybrid one.  You know, like we you can ask somewhere in between and then it works a little better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And yet, I would say your branding and your your kind of place in the market does seem  to be kind of mainstream, more mainstream than I'm saying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's absolutely mainstream, but mainstream and intelligent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Is it trending on like, because it's obviously, obviously not targeting people like me and  Leo.  Is it trending towards like, I don't know, like middle aged?  Is it trending towards females?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Actually, Jason gave me a good case that this would be something I would use.  If I said, what were the topics covered on Twitter 180?  Somebody could answer that.  In fact, it worked quite well.  Who did that?  Was it for news?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I put it in myself.  I did it for you.  I put it into Mahal answers.  I said, make a minute by minute, you know, like transcript or something of this week  in tech.  Worked great.  I offered like five, five bucks for it.  And then like people did it immediately.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It worked.  It was really well done.  But you know, it inspired us to create our own Wiki and get the same, basically the same  results in a Wiki.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Yeah.  Here, I'll, I just put it into the chat room and DSL, but I just said, yeah, somebody make  a, you know, for seven bucks, make a timestamp of, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  In fact, the real issue was too many people trying to do it.  So you had to figure out a way to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I gave the tip to two people.  I just tip two different people.  It's like, I let them split the tip or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's really, I mean, it's really well done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There are, there's one thing I've noticed is, is a group of people who have more time  than money and a people, a group of people have more money than time.  And typically as you get older, you have more money than time, quite literally, because  you're going to be dead soon.  And when you're young, you have a lot of time on your hands and you know, you need to get  some cash.  Right.  And so what you do is you trade off one for the other, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So this is, this should be my retirement plan.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Are you saying that most of your questions are being answered by children?  Is that what I'm to take?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or old folks?  You get a lot of, you get a lot of college kids, stuff like that, or graduate students.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think the best people answer the questions though.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, a lot of the questions, I would say, we've been studying the questions and  about a third of the questions are like opinion kind of stuff.  Like, what did you think of this Super Bowl commercial?  What did you think of that?  Then, you know, I would say only 20% of them are like, really, you have that firsthand  experience and the rest are like, you could research it on the internet if you took 20  minutes or an hour.  So what that means is 80% of the questions anybody can answer if they're a decent researcher  online.  It's only the top 20% that you really need an expert.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Does Amazon's Mechanical Turk kind of fulfill the same need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's for repetitive things.  So if you wanted to say like, I want to know the email address of the top 500 bloggers  and I'm willing to pay 25 cents for each one, you go set them on that task and you get,  you know, a pretty good return rate depending on what.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, recently it's been getting a bad rap because it's used just for cheating and  stuff, you know, polls and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  There was somebody did this.  Was it Bose or who did it that they, somebody do a search before I just.  What they do.  They told, they said, write a rolling review of your product on Amazon and we'll give you  a dollar.  So using Amazon's Mechanical Turk, oh, it's Belkin.  Somebody in the chat room.  Thank you Joe, 005.  It says Belkin.  Yeah.  And then Belkin immediately was like, oh, you know, we're sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a pretty bad thing to do.  And you get caught right away.  That's the, that's the really.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Mechanical Turk seemed like it had a lot of potential though and it really didn't go anywhere  yet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know.  Are people using it?  I mean.  Yeah, some people use it.  like that.  And there's people who, you know, we have people working in Manila who make like three  dollars an hour, you know, cleaning up errors on Mahalo.  And it's like three dollars an hour in Manila is huge, you know?  And then we can't even find people in America to who want to go and fix dates and, you know,  typos and stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's true.  That's true.  But the trick in the user generated kind of content era is to figure out a way that people  are really incentivized to do the work, you know, tagging, tagging Facebook photos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I like blended, you know, like where they get recognition, affiliation, and then maybe  a little something else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Look at all the work we're doing for Twitter for free.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I always said this about dig, you know, the top 50 users on dig, if they gave them 500  bucks a month or a month and it worked.  I could I'll take 500 bucks for Twittering.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, I wouldn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wouldn't do it.  No, no, I'm talking about people who do actual content creation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're talking about kind of incentivizing people to do things.  You say if Kevin Rose said the top 100 people are, I don't know.  I mean, it's a really flexible issue on dig though, because I mean, people are already  convinced that the top users are treated as kind of an elite.  I think I think that might steer it towards being even worse, surely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is the thing.  It's like a bribe.  You know, if you allow people to make a living.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You say it works, but if it worked, why is it?  Why am I not on Netscape right now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, because they only have three months to work on it.  But it was it was trust me, it was working.  The thing is, the people who.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So why didn't they continue with it?  Why did they just blindside you and say, oh, no, you know what?  That's working great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But I left.  I mean, and there was nobody there to defend it.  But, you know, the thing is.  Right. But the stats speak for themselves, surely.  Yeah. The stat we're showing that Netscape, you know, got like two million more  unique visitors a month when we when we changed it over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So I can't believe we've got four thousand people watching this conversation  while the Super Bowl is going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, he's certainly all they don't.  They must be all from Scotland.  And trust me, this is much more interesting than a stupid ball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're going to take a break. Come back.  We have three stupid, interesting.  I think stupid is the right word.  Stories coming up. The Fannie Mae logic bomb.  Wacky and zany, wacky and zany.  Also coming up.  Dell wants to do a phone.  OK, wacky and zany.  What? And finally, yeah.  And finally, Congress wants to make cell phones click.  But intriguing.  I mean, required.  But we'll talk about that in a second.  Right now, we're going to talk about something far more intriguing to you, Mr.  Jason Calacanis. I'm talking about Audible.  Oh, yes, I am.  You know how much you love Audible.com.  We all do. I got a deal for you.  This is the Audible Platinum deal.  Go to Audible.com slash twit to the number two.  And what you'll get is you get to sign up for the Platinum,  which gives you two books a month.  Audible is a library of fifty one thousand and growing all the time.  Titles of all kinds.  Great stuff. And, you know, I have to search to see if Christopher  Walken has ever read anything on Audible, because that would be hysterical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's a very well read guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, no, actually out loud.  Audible.com slash twit to when you sign up for the Platinum plan,  you get credit towards two, two books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Two books. Two books.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm so excited.  I can't type fast enough on the Audible side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Toe free books. Toe free books.  And then I'm going to give you another one from Stephen Covey's  The Great Seven Habits of Highly Effective People.  We've got a special twit deal we've been going on.  This ends on the 15th.  So you get a couple more weeks. Audible.com slash twit habits.  Now, I have to in deference to Pete and others who are not in the US.  Both of these offers are US only.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, US only.  Audible is doing. Hold on a second.  I'm going to call an Audible for Audible right now.  That's a Super Bowl joke.  I get it. I love it.  OK, anyway, how do you as a non-US person,  Pete, get around the IP things?  Like if you want to watch a Hulu show, you know how to do it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There's various ways. I don't really care for this.  This is a problem they're facing, and I don't know if it's generational thing,  but I don't really care for that content that much.  I mean, it's long form.  I have a really short attention span.  What do you know? I love Hulu.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But how do you get around the IP filter?  Somebody in the chat room.  It's easy to do. You do a proxy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, use a proxy server and you go around.  Hot spot shield.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So we would never tell you to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But that won't work with Audible because you have to have a US credit card.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, do they take PayPal?  They have a US credit card, so there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to have a US credit card. They got you on that one.  But let me tell you, this is believe me, Audible would love to do this with everybody.  The problem is the way publishing works.  You know this.  Yes.  That every country has its own.  Yeah, every country has its own publisher for every book.  In fact, many countries don't have audio versions of their books  that are licensed for that country.  So many of the many of the offers in the books we talk about are available internationally.  I'm not saying none of them are.  But just, you know, as a blanket disclaimer, we don't promise that.  So, you know, try it.  It might work for you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And my audible pick of the week is Christopher Walken  doing children's nursery rhymes.  No.  Uh huh.  Yeah, we can play a sample right now.  Just say hit play there, Leo, if you will.  Wait a minute. Are you kidding?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, here he goes.  This is on audible.com.  Christopher Walken doing nursery.  Unbelievable. Listen to this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mary had a little lamb, little lamb, little lamb.  Mary had a little lamb.  Its fleece was white as snow everywhere that Mary went.  Mary went everywhere that Mary went.  The lamb was sure to go.  And followed her to school one day, school one day, school one day,  and followed her to school one day, which was against the rules.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It made the children laugh and play.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, you know what?  I was in Pulp Fiction. I don't need to do this.  That's how good it is.  I'm an agent. I'm out of here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's the variety.  You'll never. It's amazing.  Audible.com two offers audible.com slash twit to you get two credits.  If you haven't signed up for Audible, you really got to give it a try.  Costs you nothing.  You get to keep the books if you decide not to stick around.  And then, of course, if you're already a member,  whether you join today or if you joined years ago, audible.com slash twit habits.  T.W.I.T. H.I.B.I.T.S.  for the Stephen Covey Seven Habits of Highly Effective People,  which is a much must read book, just a really great book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they also have you have queued up.  There is the Jerry Seinfeld doing Great Expectations.  Oh, I'd love to hear that.  Yeah, yeah. It's right there.  If you just hit play.  Oh, you put the link in the chat room. Let me click it.  It was the best of times.  It was the worst of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who are these people?  If it was the best, it was the best.  If it was the worst, it was the worst.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It sounded a little like Christopher Walken.  Oh, sorry. I have to switch.  I think you hit the wrong button.  I pushed the wrong button. I'm sorry.  Hit the right button. You hit the Christopher Walken.  That was the outtakes.  It's poisoning you.  It's leaking into your speech.  Absolutely. Absolutely.  You got to be careful there.  Moving on. Moving right along.  Three more stories. We all love Audible.  We love the.  Thank you, Audible, for supporting this week in tech.  We do. We do love Audible.  Now, see, I think, Pete, that that's clearly an ad.  But you're right, it crosses the line.  But but it's also an I mean, we only take advertisers that we use and we like.  So I don't you know, I agree that that does raise a church and state issue.  Truth be told, I don't get paid for this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  It doesn't with Jason.  He just with the exception of the Mahalo ad in the middle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He just does it.  Well, let's do actually let's talk.  Let's give Pete an ad.  Twistable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twistable. Wait a minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Pete's gone. Hold on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's gone. What do we do?  What do we do? No wonder he was twice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He got very quiet there.  Let's add him back into this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're going to have to ask you to do that.  To do the impression again, you miss the whole thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, man. No, that's all right.  I'm sorry. I was actually walking, wasn't it?  This is yeah, it wasn't impression.  But this is the thing, Pete, we had to give you something.  So when you walk your dog next week, you have something to do.  OK, something to listen to.  So actually, I wanted to talk about twistable.  Yes.  Twist twistable.  Ha ha ha ha twistable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So super dog loves twistable.  You're very good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what? Twistable makes me happy.  Jesus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Where did I lose control?  Where exactly did this jump the shark?  I can't even spell twistable.  I'm trying to type it into.  We just go to Mashable.com.  It's the number one story.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So twistable is  some February 12th and they're basically holding an event  that's going to bring together Twitter people in 175 plus cities,  kind of a global gathering, and they're trying to raise money for Charity Water.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if you go to you go to a tweet up in your in your town.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So you can go to twistable.com, find tweet ups.  I mean, they're everywhere, literally everywhere.  I mean, there's a few in Britain.  There's obviously a bunch in the US and really diverse.  And they're, you know, all volunteer, 100% profits going to Charity Water,  which is building wells for people who don't have access to clean water.  That's a great that's a really good.  Testing this.  You know, this is social media for social change.  And they're trying to, you know, essentially use Twitter.  I mean, Twitter is really the core social media tool right now  to bring people together to raise a bunch of money.  And it actually does really well.  I did. They had a thing in September, like if you have a birthday in September.  So last year I did that and I got like 10 K in from  just people on the Twitter feed just donating.  It's insane how viral it is.  So I think they're going to raise, you know, hundreds of thousands quite easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I'm going to commit right now to go to the event February 12th  in San Francisco, which is near me, and I'm sure there's one in L.A.  near you, Jason.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think they're on this as well.  And we're at festival.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We're going to host festival at Mahalo, I think.  Oh, yeah, that's great.  I just checked my email.  This guy Christopher Darbo, I guess.  Dana had asked me to do it.  And so I think maybe we'll do it at Mahalo.  We can hold 250 people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, how does how does getting together  fund Charity Water?  Are you asked to donate?  There's going to be donations.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, apart from ticket sales to those events.  There's really two ways on that.  This Amiando is selling tickets to all these events  and all the Amiando have kind of waived their fees.  So everything you give in ticket sales goes direct.  And also this tip joy, which can be raising money through Twitter directly.  So you'll be able to donate and, you know,  blast out on your Twitter stream that you've donated and how much you've donated.  So maybe if we have a stunt of some kind tied into it, we could say, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  if you donate money, you know, I'll do something crazy or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. Jason will do an ad for you on Twitter.  Hey, that'd be fun.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's a great idea.  The highest bidder gets an ad on Twitter with Jason custom by Jason.  Jason and let's work that out, Jason.  That will do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But you're not eBay, like eBay, it off or whatever.  People could just bid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I bet we raise a lot of money.  It goes to Charity Water, which is a great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Totally. I like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I love Wikia search.  Jimmy Wells is a great.  Hi, this is Jason Callentown.  Wouldn't that be funny?  Latest book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How much does Jimmy pay to get you to do an ad for Wikia search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'll totally do an ad for Wikia search or for Cory.  Jimmy or Cory Doctorow.  Hi, I'm Jason Callentown for Cory Doctorow's book.  Now, you've never heard of Cory's book.  That's OK. Not many people have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  However, so it's available.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So that's great. OK, so you agree to do it.  We'll put you on what day is.  Let's see. Let's say February 12th is a Thursday.  So the following Valentine's Day  tweet episode, you know, you're talking a couple of hundred  thousand people hear this ad, so it's worth a lot of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I'll Twitter it. I'll Twitter the ad.  There you go. I'll Twitter the ad.  Perfect. Yeah.  There you go.  Somebody's going to pay 50 bucks for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. I mean, it's the ads.  We sell the ads for quite a bit of money.  So Cory Doctorow, I guess it should go for quite a bit of money.  Well, I'm glad the smoke alarms going on.  This is such a hot idea.  You've set off our smoke alarm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We're on fire. We're on fire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  On Fuego. Giving it all away ads on Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So how are we going to what are the what's the mechanics of this?  You want to handle this, Jason?  I'll just give you the free ad time and you can figure out how.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, I'll put something up my blog or something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All right. I think that's a great idea.  Story two, Fannie Mae logic bomb.  Planted by a former engineer at the mortgage finance company  would have literally destroyed all 4000 servers at the company,  millions of dollars of damage.  A prosecutor say it would be it would have been down for at least a week.  He was indicted in federal court in Maryland on Tuesday for computer sabotage.  He planted a logic bomb on October 24th, the day he was fired.  This is what every company fears.  The malware was set to detonate yesterday,  January 31st at 9 a.m. instead, Google went down.  No, no, it was discovered by an engineer five days after it was planted.  Thank goodness.  So he was fired because of a scripting error he'd made earlier in the month.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right, wait a second.  So this guy's name is Ron Jen Drish, no boobaha,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Makana will get back to you on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm trying to pronounce it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just Rajan Drush.  And I wouldn't try either.  I skipped it. You notice.  I love it when you when you tune in CNN and they have to say the name.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that's always great.  And you see the book of terror.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It comes up on the proctor.  They go, oh, God, I knew I should have pre read this. Oh, OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be Rajan Drush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Boobaha, like they have that look of like almost to the finish line.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah. Rajan Drush and Babu Babu Bna.  You can't you can't sight read that.  You cannot say that Babu Bha.  Anyway, that's that is everybody's that is every company's worst nightmare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, somebody will actually know that would be the second biggest nightmare.  The first nightmare, sadly, is the guy comes in and kills the CEO and the HR  manager, which is what happened, sadly, like two months ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's right. So you're right. It could it could be worse.  Yeah, I mean, it could be worse.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People are suffering.  I mean, I just I know we're having a fun time on the show, but I have to say,  oh, I know my heart is like broken about it.  I this week, I was like, oh, this, you know, you're an entrepreneur.  Like I need to get people to work at my company.  And I was like, oh, this is great.  We're getting all these resumes.  You know, the market's down.  I'm going to be able to find salespeople.  And so then I started doing interviews with salespeople this week.  And I did about a dozen interviews and I would say out of the dozen interviews,  there were 10 people I would in a hot market hire on the spot.  And the other two, like one was not so good and one I could work with.  And I'm just thinking to myself, like these people should not of the 12,  probably six or seven of the type of people who are so good  that they get recruited out of companies.  They're not the type of people that are available on the market. I know.  And I just at a certain point, I started talking to people about it.  I say, how long you been looking?  They're like four months, three months. How's it going?  Well, there's no advertising there for people don't need salespeople.  And they're like, I really want to get this job.  Listen, I know my last base salary was high. I'll take it for less.  I need to get benefits. I got a family.  I'm just like, what is going on?  I mean, this is a really serious situation in terms of the unemployment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tens of thousands laid off this week alone.  I mean, it's do you think it's going to get worse?  Is it is is this or are we kind of seeing the worst of it now?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's you know, the thing is, see, the stock market is a predictor of the future.  Right. So the stock market crashed in the fourth quarter,  or, you know, from the summer into the fourth quarter.  And that was saying 2009 is going to be a disaster.  Layoffs are a trailing indicator, which means, you know,  when you see layoffs now, that means the pain is coming  because the people who are running the companies are saying, oh,  this doesn't look good in the future.  They're proactive. Right. Exactly.  So they're saying or being conservative, whatever.  They're just saying, I don't need this many people because 2009 is going to really suck.  So it's just there's still a couple of million more jobs to be lost,  according to the stuff I've been reading.  And so that means this is going to go on through 2009.  Bill Gates said this week that he thinks it's a four year down market.  So if you figure we started in 2008, we got three more years.  I mean, yeah, we got three years of this in 2011, according to Bill Gates,  which, you know, as you kind of think that that's a smart person to listen to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  So, yeah, by no means is it both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so all the all the you know, it's interesting.  Remember Leo on the last tweet I was on with Kevin Rose?  I brought up and I feel bad about it, but I brought up like I said,  how many people do you have over at revision three?  And they were like, oh, we have this many people.  And then the woman was on the show, I guess, who was there.  I got fired that I got fired the next day.  I felt terrible. I was like, oh, and I'm poor Kevin.  And then I have it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's a that's a difficult situation to be in.  I mean, what could he do? What could he do?  You can't even know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He knew. But I mean, well, I don't want to.  I'm not going to forget. Maybe he did.  Maybe maybe he knew there was stuff coming and he said specifically to them,  I don't want to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, it's an awful situation.  It's a horrible situation when you have really good people and, you know,  or you have really good people applying and you just can't take them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Looks like, by the way, so you'll feel better about it, Jason.  It looks like we're going to hire Sarah. That's great.  Yeah, she's really a nice person, very talented.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And and see, that's what takes you out of the cycle is someone like you says  someone like Sarah says, you know what?  I'm going to take the pay cut. I'll work for, you know, halftime or on a contract  basis. You say I'm going to take the risk and you get some risk  taking going on on a very small level like that.  If you and her take the risk and something pops and then a sponsor takes the risk,  all of a sudden her halftime job turns into a full time, her full time job.  You know, the show expands.  Audible says, you know what, we want to get on that, too.  And then your Audible deal goes up 50 percent.  They say, you know what, we need to we need to get another person on the show  to do the editing because, you know, whatever.  We're going to hire another editor, as a matter of fact.  Yeah, well, that's and that's how the cycle unwinds.  But what has to happen is, see, you were a small,  you were a small business that was very lightweight.  Always, right? Yeah, now, you know, right.  So what that does is it positions you that you can go only up, right?  You can't cut many people from your operation.  But there's nobody to cut. There's nobody to cut.  And so what that means is you are perfectly positioned for growth.  You know, Adam Curry's company or, you know, even revision three,  they are cutting to try to get back down to a baseline to then build up again.  So they've got to. I noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Dig said that they're going to hire their own salespeople that  because I guess Federated years ago, Federated's not doing very well.  I guess they're not making the money out of the Microsoft deal  that they thought they would.  So they're going to start selling themselves.  Is that a sensible strategy? You said it's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's any publisher who anybody who wants to be a real publisher in life  has to have their own sales force.  They have to take care of three constituents.  The the content creators, right?  The talent. You got to take care of the advertising.  You got to take care of the people who consume the content.  That's the three, you know, circles in publishing and, you know, tech crunch.  A lot of these other folks were doing their own.  What we're giving the ad sales for 40 percent to Federated Media.  And I told these guys, are you guys crazy?  Like they're you're one of 20 clients.  You're making no relationships.  This is the worst possible way to go about doing business.  And I told Mike Arrington that, you know, like heart to heart.  And that's no offense to John Patel.  It's just that, you know, ad networks are never going to do a good job  for a publisher and then never going to do as good a job as the publisher themselves.  So unless you're one person with a website,  you know what I call dude in a website market  and the dude in the website market.  I'm very close to the dude in the website market.  No, no, no, no.  When you start having the traffic you have and you have three full time people  and you're clearing a million dollars a year and ad revenue or whatever,  you're not a dude market.  But, you know, I'm assuming you guys make a million or two million dollars.  Whatever you have to confirm it.  But imagine you're making two million dollars in ad revenue just to pull a number out there.  Maybe it's not that much, but make it a million.  If you give away four hundred thousand of it, then you say to yourself, wait a second,  I can hire a salesperson for one hundred thousand dollars a year.  Give them a fifty thousand dollars bonus.  It's funny that you should say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's exactly the exactly the process we're going through right now.  In fact, send some of those good resumes up our way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Actually, when you hit four hundred thousand dollars a year in revenue,  which is, you know, whatever, across that a while ago.  Yeah. You know, which you can cross pretty much immediately.  Yeah. You have no business outsourcing it.  You're really we like our agency, though.  They've done a good job for us. Great people.  What they should be doing is backfill.  You should tell them we're going to be the primary.  You can sell it to us.  You were 40 percent. Now we're going to bring it out to 25 percent.  It's optional. You know, only if you want to add us. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Peter, are we learning something today?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think it's more complex than you want than that.  And I think that, you know, publishers really do want to focus on publishing  and they don't want to. That's my problem.  That's exactly my problem.  They're not publishers.  You go to.  If you go to say, you know, big names, if you go to Adele and say,  hey, I have this many billion pages,  you know, it's it's it's very difficult to sell a single site in that sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, not true. One hundred percent wrong.  Trust me, I did that. I wouldn't.  Well, I really don't. It's 100 percent wrong, Jason.  I would. It's 100 percent wrong.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is how Jason wins friends and influences people.  I'll tell you why.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The ad networks have you diluted into thinking that's.  Oh, I think, you know, I think there's a case for both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Do you do you use an ad network, Pete, or do you do you sell Mashable?  We do both. You do both. Well, there you go.  So you must have thought that was a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean, federated contracts are not, you know,  but everybody is lazy and they let you sell your own.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, but everybody is lazy.  I know. But most most people are.  So this is the problem I have with today's publishers is they're not real publishers.  They're they're just the content people, you know,  and they don't really do the business side.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And then they never become a glorified content guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's all. Yeah. But you know what?  You actually, you know, will have a sales force at some point.  And then that's when you you become a real business.  And I think you take care of your advertisers.  You're not a real business. It will never be a major business.  It's just the truth.  And we have this whole yes, that you cannot go into those large clients.  I went in there with Engadget and Auto Blog and, you know, I think we're making that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We're making that. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I sold Texas Instrument, Engadget, Sonos, Wood, all these people.  They I met with all the agencies.  The agencies will meet with you. They'll all meet with you.  But I don't want to be doing that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's probably the principle that your aim should be to get to that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You disagree that your aim should be to get to that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I agree.  And in principle, that your aim should be to get to that point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, moving on.  Dell, go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, you're going to speak at the Dell phone.  I'm looking at this wired thing about phones having to make a clicking noise.  When can you believe this?  So this is a US a US congressman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And by the way, apparently this is the law in Japan and Korea  because they have a lot of upskirt problems.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, this is actually I know this sounds crazy, but this clicking thing  could be a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The guy, I think it's Pete King, he's a congressman, says  what we want to do is we want to make sure that every phone clicks,  every camera phone.  Oh, wait, this is stupid. Yeah, this is stupid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, I figured out why it's stupid immediately because you can use a camera.  Well, because people if you were at a concert and you're, you know,  or at a wedding and the guy's taking pictures, you want to hear beep, beep, beep, beep,  every time they take a picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And and this is called the Camera Phone Predator Alert Act.  And it's it's answering a problem that isn't a problem in the US, apparently.  Nobody, in fact, that anybody's ever talked to says it's a problem in the US.  Maybe it's a problem in Japan and Korea.  It's it's it's come up. It's anecdotal.  In fact, even the Center for Missing and Exploited Kids said,  we think it's a good idea, but but it's all anecdotal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I think this is a great story if you're a blogger,  because what you can do when you structure the story  is you can put the threat of possibly camera phones having to click  and then you read down to the bottom here.  Chances are the bill will pass in the US in its current form near zero.  It has no co-sponsors, no traction, yada, yada.  I mean, it's essentially one guy's proposed this is ridiculous.  It's going to get, you know, it's not going anywhere.  And it's not going anywhere, but it makes a great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it's a great story for us.  It's like the guy who's up.  It's like the New York  senator who wanted to pass a law against crossing the street with an iPod.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But it only takes one guy to do that, to make a story out of it  and to get us talking about it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But it does, you know, it does bring up, you know, this issue, like  of hidden cameras, smaller cameras, audio devices.  People just have to get used to.  They're always going to be recorded.  They're always going to be on video.  But, you know, the stupid thing about this is the people who are the real criminals,  like if you're the guy who wants to do upskirts or down blouses  and all this other nonsense, like you'll figure out a way to turn it off.  Oh, yeah, you just take you know, you just disable it.  You're going to turn off the speaker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just annoys everybody who's not a crook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly. Everybody suffers except for the.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Although Michael Phelps  might have appreciated a little clicking sound.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, Michael Phelps likes the.  Hey, I'm not going to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't even want to. It's not even a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's well, whatever it is.  I tell you why it's, you know, whatever.  Well, he's an athlete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, but you know what? I'll tell you something.  It explains why he ate those big breakfasts every morning.  Yeah, dude.  I'm so hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And I get another dozen rags.  I'm so hungry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, seriously, dude.  I think I won like nine Olympic medals, dude.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, here's the thing.  The a lot of the NBA players smoke weed  and they even like the last couple of years, up until a couple of years ago,  they didn't have drug testing for marijuana.  And what they were doing was Alonzo morning.  You can type in Alonzo morning and kidney or whatever.  They they were taking anti-inflammatories like large doses.  They wanted to cover them.  And the kidneys were failing and they're getting kidney transplants.  If they want to smoke a little weed instead of, you know,  getting rid of the pain from doing this kind of professionalism,  which your body does swell up and you are in pain.  I mean, it's probably I'm no scientist, but I got to think  that smoking a joint is a lot not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not exactly a performance enhancing drug, is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, but he's doing it to relax or come down,  which athletes use it for.  They use it because their bodies are so beat up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Why is it? Why is it even a story?  I don't understand.  Why is that story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I wasn't going to do it and I only mentioned it because it just.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, no, it's a top story everywhere today.  It is. Everybody's talking about it.  It's no Pete.  It's a picture of him taking a man.  I've seen it.  Yeah. Well, we live in the United States where this is a big deal.  I mean, everybody in the United States is pot.  And yet somebody else does it.  And even the president,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the president says I smoked pot.  President was doing lines.  No, we don't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, not to my Bush.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No. OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did Bush admit to cocaine use or is that can somebody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think that's a mahalo answer.  You insured on this one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hold on a second.  This this is I'm pulling up the Wikipedia opinions of the Twitter panelists.  Sorry, opinions of their own.  I phrased it as a question.  I phrased it as a question.  OK. OK.  Bush has a few specular about his drug years.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But I think I think he admits to having a drinking problem.  But I don't think he ever admitted to the cocaine was a rumor  that was never confirmed, I think.  Anyway, back to the final story of the day,  Dell wants to get in the smartphone business.  Is this a good business for Dell?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yes. Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, look, I mean, if they're in the enterprise.  Well, here's possibly where it's a good business.  If they're in the enterprise, they're already making the servers.  Maybe it is kind of something they can go after Blackberry with,  you know, and say, hey, this, you know, you got the Dell server, get the Dell phone.  But boy, of course, I said the same thing with Apple.  When Apple said, we're going to make a phone, I thought,  you don't want to get in this.  This is a buzz saw, this business, and Apple's done very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  You know, your question wasn't, is the Dell phone  going to be more successful than the iPhone?  I mean, obviously not. No, no, no, no, no.  The question is, if you're a computer maker, is the smartphone  the next evolution of the computer?  Ah. Yes, it is.  So I think I think in the in the high level trend,  why wouldn't they get into that market?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  The question would be, why wouldn't they?  If you're saying that, then everybody who makes computers  should be looking at small portable computers  in the form of a smartphone.  Yes. Well, that's what it is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  More interesting is research in motions.  Market cap is 31 billion and Dell's is 18.  Well, that's interesting. Wow.  You know, I was like, I wonder if this is like a prelude to them  trying to buy because everybody talks about Microsoft buying RIM. Right.  And that would be a genius move.  I mean, wow. I love my iPhone.  I'll never give up my BlackBerry.  Screw it. I mean, I like to get work done.  You know, I like to type, you know, so does the president.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's got his 8830. He confirmed it today before the Super Bowl.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Absolutely. I mean, if you if you are a serious,  just like if you're a serious publisher, you have advertising.  If you're a serious, like, you know, business executive  who has to like you cannot live off the iPhone  because you can't write more than a sentence.  What do you carry, Pete?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't.  This I actually do want to get BlackBerry, though.  I'm fed up with the keyboard.  You honestly can't get email done.  No, you can't. It's gorgeous thing.  It's a it's a really nice device. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's a I carry both.  I think this is anybody who's a guy like you, Pete.  You got to be on the move.  You got to be in different countries.  I understand you're a player.  You're on the top 25 list now.  Get both.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's nothing more nerdy than carrying two phones.  I know. There is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Just carrying two phones in a belt.  That's more nerdy.  You can just pull them out.  How you carry them is important.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  My blazers can't afford to have two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Now, I have a BlackBerry curve, but I don't really care.  And I have a G1 from Google and an iPhone.  But I just the iPhone's enough for me.  But then I don't do email on my phone.  I just do texting and Twittering and that kind of thing.  It's fine. 140 characters is fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm glad we decided to do a one hour tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  OK, the game's not over.  We're ending it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  OK, no, that's totally cool.  I think Pete's a good contributor to the show.  I like Pete. I love Pete.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm so glad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Very quiet.  I'll get better, I'm sure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  No, you know what?  We're having a little difficulty with Skype.  And that's the that experience helps on that because you just get used to  not talking over each other because Skype really doesn't handle that very well.  But other than that, I think it sounded great.  And I was really glad you're both here.  Thank you very much for joining me on the Super Sunday.  Super duper. Super duper.  It looks like it's seven.
