The All Things D conference.  I'm glad you were there because you can tell us all about that.  It's a good show.  Yeah the Tim Cook talk got a lot of attention.  We'll talk about that in a bit.  Also here and I think this is your first time on Twitter if I'm not wrong Doc Searls.

Start time: 186.30

End time: 204.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So great to have you back Doc.  Thank you.  Searls.com.  Doc is an internet visionary.  One of the three authors of the Clue Train Manifesto now more than 10 years ago.  There were four.  You David Weinberger.

End time: 224.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But yeah there are four of us.  I like Doc because he used to be in radio.  That always makes me feel good about somebody.  And his new book is called The Intention Economy.  You want to tell us a little bit about that?  What is that?  There it is right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Okay.  Of course it looks backwards on my screen.  It's from Harvard Business Review Press.  I've been hanging out there.  It almost reflects.  For the last six years I've been hanging out at the Berkman Center at Harvard where I've  been working on a project to encourage development of tools that help customers help themselves.  Make them independent of sellers that want to trap them and follow them around and the  rest of it.  Basically trying to improve markets from the customer side rather than from the seller  side.  And we've got about 40 developers so far doing really good early work I think.  And so the book is partly report on the work they've been doing and partly the blue sky  at the end of the cycle that I see coming.  So it's, you know, one of my theories is that, you know, a free customer is more valuable  than a captive one.  If you listen to business talk to itself, yeah, that we, when I say we, I mean business  and on the business side, tend to talk about customers as these things that we want to  lock in and own and manage and control.  Look at Apple.  They do everything they can to lock in.  You're acquiring customers like they're slaves or cattle.

Start time: 294.29

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Churn is the worst thing possible.  It's a customer leaving.  Oh my God, we've, it's a churn, right?

Start time: 299.58
End time: 345.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right, and we've, you know, spent, we being business again, spent about $18 billion a  year on CRM systems, which by the way, customers have nothing to do with.  I mean they're trapped in those things too.  They just basically give you call centers and junk mail.  So, you know, how can we control things on the smart side?  If I want to change my address once for all the entities that I deal with, how can I do  that?  If I want to set my own terms of service?  If I want to advertise what I'm looking for without having to go to one site to do it,  I can do it across many and respect that the relationships I already have, for example,  you know, so let's say I want a certain kind of arcane car.  I can let, I can do it anonymously with everybody but the outfits that I have an actual relationship  with and I can control that relationship.

Start time: 352.32
End time: 361.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This is the case really is in many ways what you predicted with the ClueTrain manifesto  that the internet would really transform consumers and markets.

Start time: 361.20
End time: 377.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It wasn't fast enough.  I mean, so, you know, everybody's had a genuflected in the general direction of ClueTrain and  went ahead and did the marketing as usual.  Like, hey, markets and conversations, we can talk at people now, you know, we can follow  them with cookies and tracking beacons and then get social with them when they least  expect it.

Start time: 379.75
End time: 390.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's true.  You really only hear from a company when you say something bad about them on Twitter and  then they appear magically.  Yeah, exactly.  Oh, we care now.  I just went to Italy this week as a matter of fact.

Start time: 391.81
End time: 406.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's great to have all three of you.  It's a big week.  There's lots to talk about.  I guess we should probably start with, because I see Rafe using it, the wonderful Windows  It's great.  Consumer preview shipped.  What, you don't, you're not thrilled?

Start time: 407.63
End time: 419.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's hard.  I'm trying to get excited about it.  It's just not happening.  I think if I had a tablet, I might be a little less meh.  But on a laptop, I mean, obviously the laptop, the desktop is dead.

Start time: 419.82
End time: 429.89
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Would you call it as this guy here an unmitigated disaster that could decidedly hurt the company  in its future?  Did I say that?  Unmitigated disaster.  I was thinking about it.

Start time: 430.24
End time: 436.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was actually driving when I said unmitigated.  That's the word I want.  It's the only word that makes any sense.  It's a gutsy move.

Start time: 437.11
End time: 440.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is a tablet operating system stuck onto a laptop.  It's a focus group move.

Start time: 443.32
End time: 449.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I think it's a brave thing for Microsoft to say, look, we're going to cut off the past.  We're going to cut off, yeah.

Start time: 449.34
End time: 453.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Cut off or whatever.  Cut off something, that's for sure.  And we're going to try something completely new.

Start time: 453.93
End time: 470.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They said we're going to reimagine Windows.  They did.  You can't deny that.  They reimagined it.  It's risky.  We were talking on Windows Weekly with Paul Throat, Mary Jo Foley this week.  And they said, I think what a lot of people are saying, which is business will just ignore it.  And the next business upgrade will be Windows 7, and they'll stay with that for years.

Start time: 470.62
End time: 501.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I was hoping, because I had played with the dev version, that I could hang out in the desktop.  And I didn't have to worry about this Metro idiocy.  But no, no matter what you do, it's just going to throw you back into the Metro interface,  whether you like it or not.  And then it keeps bouncing into desktop for me.  I try to stay in Metro.  Well, give me your system.  I'll have to give you mine.  And anyway, the thing that kind of the whole thing is kind of, by the way, I ran Chrome on the desktop and it killed the whole system.  Oh, good.  Yeah, I think that was on purpose.  Windows ain't done until Chrome won't run.

Start time: 504.28
End time: 505.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Anyway, that's an old Lotus joke.

Start time: 507.28
End time: 524.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know.  One of the things that struck me, I don't dislike it.  In fact, I think I think geeks might kind of say, oh, this is cool.  This is different.  This is new.  This is innovative.  They're trying stuff.  It's not.  It doesn't.  It lacks some charm.  It certainly has charms.

Start time: 524.28
End time: 550.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It has no.  Those are called charms.  It has no soul.  It's a soulless, cold product.  It has no feeling.  Unlike Windows 7.  Windows 7 is at least got some, you know, modicum of friendliness.  This thing is just minimalist, cold, screw you.  From that perspective, it's beautiful.  From a minimal.  Yeah, well, from an art perspective.  You're collecting art.  Well, they call it Metro because it's supposed to be like subway signs.

Start time: 550.28
End time: 561.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's supposed to be kind of iconic.  And it is.  No frills.  One thing I do like is they've abandoned the skeuomorphism that Apple keeps saying.  I'm not going to use that word.  What?  Apple is sinking into skeuomorphism.  It's non-skeuomorphic.

Start time: 561.50
End time: 563.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what they've been saying about you, Leo.

Start time: 563.20
End time: 573.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Is that how you pronounce it?  Say it.  I have no idea.  We have no idea.  We just like the word.  It means leather stitching on your calendar app or torn off the remains of torn off calendar  pages.

Start time: 574.20
End time: 575.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think another guy talked about this.

Start time: 576.55
End time: 597.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a ridiculous idea.  Apple has gotten more and more into it.  Which is, by the way, I think Johnny Ive this week implied that he thought it was stupid.  The chief designer at Apple doesn't like it.  Good for him.  And I think this is what Microsoft's doing is they're eliminating the frippery.  But what it is not is it's not discoverable.  There's moves on this.  Like if you move the arrow.  Yeah, there are secret moves that you have to make.

Start time: 597.92
End time: 605.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And like the desktop is down here in the corner and the charms are over here on this side.  And you've got to move the mouse just right.

Start time: 605.20
End time: 613.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why would you know this without?  You wouldn't.  So why is it mezzo named after the simplicity of the subway system?  Right.  There's no map.

Start time: 613.22
End time: 616.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You need a map.  So watch this.  Type CMD.

Start time: 616.20
End time: 620.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Type it without doing anything?  CMD.  Oh my goodness.  It launches.

Start time: 620.68
End time: 625.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  There's how you get to a command line or anything as you type the first few letters and you  hit return.  How about format C?

Start time: 626.70
End time: 628.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_06

End time: 637.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, there's an app directory here.  It's non-discoverable.  It's non-discoverable.  But neither is Apple.

Start time: 637.20
End time: 643.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Neither is OS X.  Well, at least you have a menu bar which you can browse.  But there are a lot of hidden things in Apple that are totally non-discoverable.

Start time: 644.47
End time: 648.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But the point here is that the learning curve, especially in business, is going to be miserable.

Start time: 648.40
End time: 667.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But there are no business apps here.  All the apps that run on Metro are the Metro apps.  There are things like news.  Full screen travel.  Full screen sports.  Full screen news.  Full screen messages.  Right.  You won't say it.  The business apps, if you want, still run under the whole desktop UI.  So you've got this weird operating system.

Start time: 668.20
End time: 670.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Full screen crap we're going to abbreviate to FAP.

Start time: 670.58
End time: 679.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mentioned this in my column and you said it on your other show.  You've got a 27-inch screen and you hit one of these things and boom, the whole screen's  got the weather report.

Start time: 679.96
End time: 683.46
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's fine on a little laptop, but on a giant screen it is a tablet operating system.

Start time: 684.34
End time: 685.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a tablet OS.

Start time: 685.20
End time: 719.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yes.  You're enforcing it.  Now I've been trying really hard.  I like that logo on the shirt.  How do I get back to where I was?  You just got me into this thing.  I don't know how to get back.  Press the Windows.  Oh, you don't have a Windows key.  Press your Command button.  Function, Command, Y.  No, just Command.  Oh, that did it.  Command always brings you back to the start.  Oh, thank you.  I can help you use this.  Today on Windows.  I want to like it.  Okay.  We'll give them like it.  And I want to give Microsoft a little bit of credit for doing something new and different.  But I think I agree with you.  This will be an unmitigated disaster because I can I just think people are going to look  at this and go, what the hell is this?  Why?

Start time: 720.20
End time: 729.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, because people you'll be able to buy a Windows 8 tablet for 200 bucks, which will  be way under what you can get a Mac.  That's right.  Apple tablet for this is a low end product.  Worth every penny.

Start time: 729.38
End time: 732.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You could buy the Kindle Fire for 200 bucks.  Do you want it?

Start time: 732.67
End time: 735.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  People want the iPad.  It's not different.  It's the same.  Cheap is cheap.

Start time: 737.37
End time: 762.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I do have to say there's a debate going on.  According to Paul Thurotte, there's a debate going on at Microsoft about whether when you  launch this for the first time, you get a movie about how to use it.  And some people do not want to do that.  And some people do.  Apple did that with a change the scroll.  Yeah.  They would not let you use OS 10 Lion until you watched a movie about how scroll works  and demonstrated broke scroll.  Yeah.  And demonstrated that you knew how you actually had a test.

Start time: 763.12
End time: 772.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That should be a rule.  Every time you break an operating system, you have to put a blocker video in place that  people have to pass before you can use the operating system.

Start time: 773.18
End time: 778.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's why some people say, no, no, we shouldn't do that.  But I think it's an admission.  You just load the operating system.

Start time: 778.22
End time: 783.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Meanwhile, somebody's breaking into the house.  You got to get to the computer and call the cops over one of your VOIP lines.

Start time: 784.28
End time: 794.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Doc, this may be an example of a company.  You're shot dead.  Not listening to its customers.  I don't know.  You have, I mean, obviously you don't really care.  You're not using Windows.

Start time: 795.38
End time: 798.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't care.  No.  He doesn't care.

Start time: 799.24
End time: 800.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He thinks the whole thing's a joke.

Start time: 800.18
End time: 827.37
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But the interesting thing though is that Rafe is right that Apple is just as obscure about  some of that stuff.  I actually bought one of those trackpad things as a mouse.  Oh, those gestures.  Yeah.  It's impossible.  I couldn't use it.  I mean, you use four fingers for this or three for that or you wipe left and right.  And it's all like everything.  Every gesture is cleaning the thing.  I mean, that's kind of what it is.  You have a very clean trackpad.  Yeah, you get an excellent trackpad.  The dust does not settle on it.  I gave up and went back to a mouse and I gave it to my kid.

Start time: 828.74
End time: 831.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But did you, well, here's the test.  Your kid knows how to use it.

Start time: 832.14
End time: 842.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Oh, I'm sure he does.  Yeah.  He hasn't gone to it.  But he has the magic mouse too.  And that has some of that same gesturable business on the top with no physical sense  of what it's doing.

Start time: 842.96
End time: 849.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Why are these companies that are successful companies going down this path?

Start time: 851.06
End time: 890.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  to do is really hard.  Making something that does all this stuff that is instantly understandable and usable  with a common library of commands and gestures is unbelievably difficult.  Apple still doesn't have it right.  Every time they come up with a new OS, they change the desktop or the spaces or the dashboard  or whatever.  They keep mixing it up.  They still haven't figured it out.  They haven't figured it out.  Microsoft now, this is a 1.0 of a completely new UI paradigm.  They're not going to figure it out for years if they ever do.  Chrome OS didn't figure it out.  They thought they'd have a full screen system that's like, no, that's not going to work.  Now we're going to have Windows and Chrome OS.  Android, I don't even want to go there.  I mean, nobody has figured out how to make this complex stuff work.

Start time: 891.86
End time: 903.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Paul Therotte also points out...  Worked fine before.  ...Microsoft has been furiously ripping legacy code out of Windows so that companies that  want to make products, for instance, that re-enable the start menu, can't.

Start time: 904.20

Start time: 914.12
End time: 929.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Nice to see you.  They are working so hard, I don't know, I just noticed.  They are working so hard not only to change this but to lock you in like, oh, don't let  anybody have a tool that will bring it back to the old ways.  We're going to strip that code out.  Are you getting more like Apple every day?  It's time for Linux.  It's very Apple-y.  It is time for Linux.

Start time: 931.14
End time: 935.74

So first of all, we get the revelation that Stuxnet, which was a virus that kind of took  over the world a little bit, was actually created by the United States and Israel.  We kind of knew this because it was originally targeted.  We suspected it.  We suspected it.  It was targeted at the Iranian nuclear plants, nuclear refinement facilities.  It actually was designed to bring down the centrifuges there.  I like Joe Biden's quote in this New York Times article.  Apparently, it was modified in some way and escaped.

We think there was a modification done by the Israelis and we don't know if we were  part of that activity.  They don't know?  Blame the Jews.  They're briefing the president?  Blame the Jews.  Mr. Obama, according to officials in the room, asked a series of questions, fearful that  the code could do damage outside the plant.  The answers came back in hedged terms.  Vice President Biden fumed, it's got to be the Israelis, he said.  They went too far.  What are you reading?  New York Times.  Oh, geez.  No wonder.  New York Times.  So the way they got it in, first of all, the Israeli, I mean the Iranian nuclear refinement  plant was air gapped from the outside world.  Right.

Start time: 1310.68
End time: 1325.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

The fact that the Rockefeller Foundation came out with a report with five or six different  scenarios for the end of the next few years, including a scenario about the Olympic Games,  which includes 13,000 people being killed in the stadium by a terrorist attack, which  is one of the reasons that the British overmanned it.

The National Defense Authorization Act specifically says that if cyber warfare is committed on  the United States of America, it's an act of war.  So how is this not an act of war?

You know, once a virus gets in there, it's, and no country is more dependent on computer  control of infrastructure than ours.  I would think Japan, but apparently I'm wrong.  It's us.  So that's the other risk is the fun doing as soon as you open this door, we're the ones  who could really be in trouble, especially once these viruses leak out.

Oh, right.  Okay, yeah.  So whatever you want is in that code.  And so you can send it after anybody, anywhere you want, if you can get a hold of it.  And that one is targeted at also Iran.

Oh, that's nice.  So you have a nice database on there because it needs somewhere to store all the passwords  and stuff it's collecting.

Start time: 1631.69
End time: 1660.71
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I wonder if there's a front end for it.  You know what would be cool is you write this thing so it needs a, it has another module  that doesn't, it's not included, but you plug it into this front end, which allows you to  program it to do different things.  Then you send it out into the wild where it latches onto some system and starts doing  its thing.  That's how botnets work.  Well, that's why I know, but I'm talking about something that...  Command and control.  A botnet, it usually has a centralized location that tells these things what to do on the  fly outside.  But I'm thinking of taking the actual code and then customizing it with another piece  of code.

Start time: 1661.26
End time: 1688.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, you're actually right, John, because that's one of the weaknesses of a virus is  if you can look at the code and see where these servers are going to be, these command  and control servers, you can shut them down.  In fact, exactly what Flamer did, it encrypted them and modified them, it changed them based  on date and time.  And it would, the authors would know ahead of time what the server was going to be, but  there was no way that you could look at the code and determine what the server was going  to be.  So they, in fact, did exactly what you're thinking to obscure the source of the command  and control botnets.  It's very clever.

You know, it's sort of the...  It's happening at...  And at the same time, I think maybe as Ralph was saying earlier, there's a bit of hypocrisy  involved here because we're...  Or John.  John was saying that, you know, if we have a rule that says if you're doing a cyber attack  on the US, it's an act of war.  Well, that was an act of war.  Obviously it was an act of war.  Yes.

Malaysian Defense Minister, Ahmed Zahidah Hamidi said a cyber arms race is already underway.  He urged members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations to pool their resources to tackle  increasingly complex cyber attacks.

It's inevitable as you build products that are technologically based, you attack them  with technology and to think that we shouldn't be doing it because it's wrong...

Transcript:  Just to drive it in a complete absurdity, we agree to not use biological weapons.  We agree not to use poison gas.  So there are some weapons in war that we have kind of universally agreed they're so devastating,  so horrible.  Like nuclear weapons.  Well, we do use nuclear weapons and we haven't agreed not to, although there is a nonproliferation  pact, but that's not exactly the same.  It's more like, we'll keep those.  You don't need those.  You do have a point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do have a point.  But there are weapons that are so horrendous we don't...  It's very difficult, I think, to draw the line between cyber and non-cyber because war  is increasingly technological.  The weapons are based on machines and technology and computational stuff.  So where do you say we're not going to attack those with the things that they're made out  of?  I don't know how you can possibly draw the line.

Transcript:  We're going to take a break and come back with more.  Mr. Needleman, we shall speak to you next about the Schwag.  But first a word from Gazelle.  Hey, if you've got some stuff in that Schwag bag you'd like to sell.  Gazelle it.  Whether you've got an iPhone, an iPod, an iPad, a Samsung, a Galaxy 2S, S2, whatever  it is.  If it's taken up space in your drawer, some people have gadget drawers.  You know, the old gadgets go in a drawer or closet.  There are people who have storage lockers filled.  There are hoarders.  You know, that stuff's not getting more valuable.  In fact, I'm pretty much sure it's never going to gain value.  Sell it now while you still can.  And Gazelle's the best way to do it.  Visit it right now.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  Just like the antelope, right, that runs across the African veldt.  Gazelle.com.  If you click the drop down you'll see they've actually reduced the things that they buy  because they found out most people just want to sell these.  iPhones, iPads, iPads, Apple TVs, laptops, desktops, displays, Blackberries, HTC, Motorola,  Samsung, LG, Android phones, or Nokias.  Let's say, all right, let's try.  I got a second generation iPad I want to get an offer on.  So this is how easy it is.  That's one of the things I like about this now is it just you click a button.  Was it a Verizon or AT&T?  It was AT&T.  I wonder if the price is different.  It's Verizon.  Now here's the deal.  They'll send you a check.  They'll PayPal you.  But little pro tip here, Amazon gift card gets an extra 5%.  So that would be my recommendation.  G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.  Don't sell it.  Oh, they said don't say that.  Why not?

It's a great piece of hardware, but you buy the thing for I don't know what it is, $100,  $150, and then in order to actually use it, you have to subscribe, which is another $100  a year.  I think they have a free...  They have a free thing, but that's why buying the free thing is no good.  Yeah, because it doesn't send you alerts or record videos, stuff like that.

Oh, let me write that down.  He taught us all of life is fragile.  He's a visionary too.  Steve?  Yeah, Steve.  On Apple TV.  Now, he said some interesting things.  He said, for instance, the Apple TV is...  Now, please parse this because you were there.  You saw him.  You saw his expression.

Transcript:  Well, Apple needs to move into new markets in order to become the trillion dollar company that everybody wants them to become.  They need to move into new markets and TV is it.  And apparently the set-top boxes, even the uber-simple set-top boxes like the Apple TV and the Roku, they're just not making an impact.  He sold 2.7 million of them.

What Apple wants to do is blow up cable.  And they're too dependent on cable.  But that's what you have to do.  If you're going to move TV past the logjam it's in now, you have to move off of the 500-channel world where there are all these bundles and it's an awful system into something that looks like the net.  And I think that's what Apple kind of wants to do while owning the show.  And they're only going to be able to do that by doing their deals.  And I don't know what that's going to be, except it will probably involve Disney.

And in the technology industry only Apple has the pull and the chutzpah to pull off a move like that and to really upend the TV industry the way it did with music and the way it did with the telcos.

It doesn't matter what it is.  They're going to make it as easy as they possibly can and they're going to do their deals.  But you're going to pay for it.  Whatever it is you're going to pay.  Right now it's too much.  I mean people don't want to pay.  Why shouldn't we pay for content?  It costs money to make it.  I don't think most people have a problem with doing that.  Apple proved that with iTunes, you know, ten years ago.  The question is how can they make that work with video content?  How can they do that?  And probably what they do is they're looking at YouTube and saying,  well that's all the free stuff and we're going to have the good stuff.  And you can get the free crap on YouTube and you get the good stuff on our thing.  And it's not just going to be TV.  I wouldn't be surprised if they make a screen that exceeds the dimensions of 1080p  because that's what the iPad is.  That's interesting.  You mean a 4K screen for instance?

Start time: 3251.60
End time: 3275.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Because if Apple's going to do a television set,  it's got to do something different.  I mean, it's a commodity at this point, right?  Samsung, LG, Sharp, Sony.  What's the difference?  There are minor, minor differences.  These are commoditized products at this point.  So Apple doesn't want to join that parade.  But what do they do that makes it unique?  Is it user interface?  Is it higher resolution?  It's both.  It's content deals?  It's the deals.

Start time: 3630.70
End time: 3694.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  One is that, you know, obviously they're successful at doing what they're doing in terms of...  Facebook is, yes.  Well, in terms of the social side of it, I mean, that works to the degree that a zillion people are involved in it.  But the advertising is actually remarkably bad.  It's remarkably often.  It is.  And I'm saying that with their algorithm supposedly knows about you, it's remarkably off.  Most of it's really way off.  And it's surprising.  Now, I've talked to a number of people who have advertised on there and who have said to almost a person that it doesn't work very well, if at all.  However, I spoke to somebody today who absolutely swears by it.  So I don't know.  I mean, I guess in some cases it does.  If it's really narrow, if you're already loved to some degree and you're just trying to enlarge the love that they have for you.  In this case, it was a radio station here in Boston.  But, you know, the NPR podcast Planet Money had a really good thing on a pizza place in New Orleans where they did everything by the book.  And they're already loved by a zillion people.  And they got like not one response, not one.  They paid nothing.

On the main site, you don't go to Facebook because you're looking to do research.  You go to Facebook to keep up with your friends.  And that's why ads don't work.  Because I don't care how many ads I get for Bonobos pants, which is all the time.  I'm not in the mood to buy clothes.  For what?

Problem two is they don't make it, it doesn't work on mobile because there's no bandwidth  in real estate.  And everybody knows that.  That's one of the reasons their stock is doing so badly.  But where Facebook can win is if they go from advertisements on Facebook to advertisements  elsewhere and compete with Google directly for advertisements on the internet.  To be like AdSense.  To do an ad network.  Well, that's their future.  That's where Facebook has to go.  Yeah, yeah.  That's where the social network, that's where the social proximity will actually work.

And of course, they've stopped developing it, you see, because they did a deal with  Comcast that the feds aren't investigating where no commercial company is developing  fiber right now.

Start time: 4091.06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Isn't that ironic?  So, in fact, John, you said this.  You said Fios was just going to be a showpiece that they wouldn't roll it out.  They surprised us all.  They rolled it out much more widely.  But now they've said, we're not going to do any more Fios and sell somebody.  It's like a club.  You can't go in until somebody goes out.  To form a corruption.  And it was a deal.  You're saying, Doc, it was a deal with Comcast?

Start time: 4110.10
End time: 4179.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, they're not calling it that, but it was very coincidental.  And I'm not remembering exactly the thing.  But they want, it's a combination of they want spectrum for wireless because that's  where they're making the big money right now.  And I guess Comcast was sitting on the spectrum or somebody was sitting on the spectrum.  They announced that they were not going to continue developing, rolling out Fios at the  same time as they went for this deal with the cable guys.  So it's, I mean, just watch, follow the money, as the movie said.  That's, and it's all this backroom dealing.  And they, they're all in this thing that Bob Franksley calls the regulatorium.  There's, it's a, they talk about the free market at work.  They never met a free market.  They own the market.  The zoo, there's zoo animals in a regulatory zoo that they run.  So, you know, and so in the meantime, they're at every, almost every state, they're lobbying  hard to prevent the munis, municipalities from doing any kind of a build out.  So, so as a result, nobody's doing any anything other than the carriers and the carriers aren't  doing it.  So we're falling farther and farther behind the rest of the world.  And that's the free market at work.

Transcript:  Well, it's interesting.  What we're seeing, and I hope people remember this, is the exact result of an experiment  that was performed on us, the people about 20 years ago, where our government decided,  no, we need to protect these incumbents so that they will build out.  And the premise was we will get faster, better internet because we're going to protect the  incumbents.  We're going to give them a chance to make the money back for laying all that copper,  laying all that fiber.  And in Europe and in Scandinavia and other countries, they didn't do that.  And who's got the better internet connection now?  We now know the result.  Our free market works.

In the rest of the world, there's an understanding that there's a symbiosis between government  and business.  And here, there's not.  It's government versus business.  And so you get the big policy people on the left and you get the big business people on  the right, and neither one of them really want the marketplace to work.  One doesn't get the marketplace.  The other gets how big business can run the marketplace.  And that's our choice.  It's really creepy and bad.

Did you know that if you had used stamps.com, they would take it, they would come and they  would get it?  You could actually schedule a pickup free from the postal service.  Did you know that?  Count me in.  I think you should.  This is an amazing thing.  You don't have to go to the post office anymore.  You print your own postage.  You can print it right on the envelope, which looks really good with your logo and everything.  You can also mail packages.  The rule, what?  What is this welcome Leo Laporte listeners on their home page?  That's because I, I don't know, somehow it thinks that I'm Leo Laporte, but let me, if  I can go to the front page.  See, every time it does this, this is not what you will get if you go to stamps.com.  You'll have to do some special things to get that.  Let me tell you about that.  You're going to see there's a, there's a microphone on the right.  You click that and you enter in the offer code, twit.  And what happens magically that special offer on the front page is $80.  It goes to $110 because we give you more postage coupons, $55 of free postage coupons.  We give you a free digital scale worth 50 bucks.  You just pay shipping and handling.  You get a supply kit, you get a four week trial.  The scale is cool because they plug it in to your computer and then you throw the thing  on there and the software does it all.  In fact, this is really kind of, it's our typing elimination program because if you  use eBay or Amazon as a seller, it'll just fill out the forms for you and print it all.  If you do international mail, same thing, you don't have to type in anything.  It will, if you use QuickBooks, it'll take your address book from QuickBooks and you  do invoices, you don't have to type in.  We use it, we actually ended up buying two scales.  We have, because we were fighting over it.  Stamps.com is a great deal and this special offer is available right now.  If you go to stamps.com, don't look at me like that.  What are you shipping?  I can tell you're looking at me like that.  What are you shipping?  Stuff.  Oh, okay.  Things and stuff.  Stuff.  What do we ship, John?  We ship, we ship stuff back.  Panties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What could you do?  I mean, I'm tempted to go to this event, but I just don't know...  Is it one of those events you go to and you go, well, that wasn't that interesting?  It's going to be 3D.

Start time: 4861.00
End time: 4874.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They could make the product better on Android.  I mean, it's all about mobile.  It's all about Android because they can't do anything on iOS because Apple is going  to drop them.  So they've got to make Android Maps better.  But they're already pretty freaking awesome.  So I don't know what they're going to do.

Start time: 4875.62
End time: 4898.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They're already making them better because they're doing this passive aggressive thing  where, for example, you don't get verbal instructions on iOS.  You do get them on Android.  You don't get the revised recalculating thing that you get with most GPSs on iOS.  You only get it on Android already.  You think that's Google being passive aggressive on Apple?  I'm not sure it is.  If Apple is doing that, I'd be surprised.  And they're already traffic aware on Google?

Start time: 4898.38
End time: 4910.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the traffic aware thing which I use is amazing.  This is the best navigator you can get.  I know you're a big fan.  This phone, as old as it is, has not got a single scratch on it.

Transcript:  It turns out, finally, a federal judge ruled this week that authors and photographers could  go forward with a class action lawsuit over scanning with Google Books.  Google asked the judge to remove the authors guild and the photographers group from the  lawsuit.  They said a class action wasn't appropriate because many authors were actually in favor  of scanning.  Right.  And they should be.

End time: 5147.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would hope they do.  I can tell you how handy it is when doing research to be able to look inside a book.  And I've still bought a zillion of them.  And Clue Train, by the way, still sells well.  It's been online for free forever.  It's been online for free for years.  In fact, it's being online for free has probably helped sales.  I agree.  So I think it's, I understand their complaint, but I think it's misplaced.

Start time: 5148.50

I don't know, what?  Go check it out.  Put it up on the screen.  I've never tried it, I don't know.  Actually, Alexis Madrigal, who I really like, she writes, is it she or he?  It's a he, actually.  He's a senior editor at the Atlantic, writes for the Atlantic Magazine, has been doing  some really good pieces.  He's got an article on the case for Facebook.

Start time: 5358.32
End time: 5367.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Start time: 5372.06
End time: 5392.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was an overpriced IPO.  People are all up in arms because the stock went down and Facebook managed to extract  the maximum possible value they could from the IPO.  By the way, good job, Facebook.  Which is what they're supposed to do.  Their CFO deserves a pat on the back.  Now it's not good overall for other IPOs.  No, you know who's mad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They were hoping that there would be this big retail, Jim Cramer was calling it, over  the trance of purchases by normal people who didn't realize the Facebook norms.  They call them Muppets, which is actually probably better.  I'm going to call them Muppets.  So that's what they call us.  Not you because you're sophisticated, but me.  They call them Muppet because they were hoping the Muppets would come in and bring that stock  price to 40, 50, 60 bucks.  They could sell before the end of the day, get out, watch it crash, and that's why they're  really upset.

Start time: 5446.48
End time: 5482.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was more traffic in Facebook shares than there has been ever for any stock.  Then NASDAQ normally has an entire day for all its stocks.  Facebook shares were that many more.  So the Muppets did buy, but I guess the Muppets didn't buy.  And then they sold, and then they bought, and then sold.  It was a disaster.  They just didn't have the bandwidth.  Anyway, Facebook is still a valuable company, as Alex points out.  They have lock-in, they have photo sharing, they have everybody who's connected to whom,  and they'll eventually have an ad network, I believe, outside of Facebook.  So it's still a valuable company.  The question is, is it as valuable to the tune of $38, even $30 a share?

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  One of the things people were complaining about was that Facebook's price to earning,  its valuation of the stock market was overblown.  Right now, it's at $88.  I think at the peak it was $110 price to earnings.  Not Brocks, but price to earnings.  PE ratio.  PE ratio.  Amazon is $171.  The PE ratio is $171?  I don't think so.  And that's what I find interesting, is that nobody's saying anything about Amazon being  overvalued, and they're worth twice as much.  That may be a reflection of a bad quarter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, I don't know.  It has been for a while.  Oh, you're right.  The earnings have been down.  You're right.  Maybe it is.  It's just some of these things, you know, are just transitory.  Wow, is that P2E?  Yeah.  Apple is 13.  Yeah, that's 13.

Start time: 5576.20
End time: 5610.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, well, that's about right.  Google's around that too.  That's because they don't expect...  The earnings per share should reflect the growth rate of the company, generally speaking.  These are older companies.  These are older companies.  But Amazon's as old as Apple.  So, 101 means it's going to be doubling every year in earnings.  So, if it thinks 13, it pretty much means the company's stabilized.  Right.  It's not going to double, although you don't know.  You don't know.  If they came up with that TV set, which a lot of people don't think is going to happen.  Some people do.  I don't.  I'm very spectacle.  I'm very much...  You're spectacle?

That'll do it.  We'll take you to the Berkman Center and Doc's blog.  We're brought to you this week by audible.com.  You know what I was listening to on Audible and I think it's apropos, I was listening  to a brand new history of the Second World War.  And you were mentioning duplicity and how you wouldn't expect the government to state  its intentions.  In fact, some of the things governments say may be intended to mislead.  Yes.  Yes.  Hitler did that.  They all did.  Hitler did that.  It's over.  It's over.  Godwin's Law has been invoked.  There's so many great books on audible.com, over 100,000 now.  And I was listening to Stephen King and I wanted something, an antidote, not an antidote,  an anodyne, something to refresh the palate, a mousse bouche in between books of the stand,  which is a very, very long book.

It's software that you then can take bits and pieces of different genomes and create  a new genome.  And then he brought a friend who's making a genome printer, basically a maker bot for  genes that you would then inject in cells.  And the cells would create the thing.
