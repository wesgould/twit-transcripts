Transcript:  This is TWIT This Week in TWIT.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A show that covers...  That's recursive.  It's a recursive show.  A show that covers itself endlessly like...  What is the worm, Baratunde, eating his tail?  No, I think it's Orobus.  Orobus.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know what you're talking about.  You know what I'm talking about, man?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you with me there?  Baratunde Thurston is here.  He is of course the host of Popular Science on Discovery.  Is that right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did I say that right?  Popular Science's future of.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Future of.  I forgot the future of.  He is the future of new media.  Let's put it that way.  How about that?  Aw, thanks.  Also here, kind of I would say a partner in crime, Heather Gold.  HeatherGold.com.  She's a comic.  She's Jewish.  She's a lesbian and she's drunk.  So I think it's going to be a great show.  And to keep us all well grounded, John C. Dvorak.  What are you wearing there?  That looks like a nice scarf.  A little polka dot scarf there.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Oh.  Dvorak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  A channel, Dvorak.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry, I didn't mean to wake you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, these are actually three...  This is interesting.  I just saw these on the lane here.  It's three ties, actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's wearing three ties.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think I'm going to start making that a fashion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I felt bad when I saw a man with three heads until I met a man with three ties.  That doesn't work.  That proverb doesn't work when you tell it that way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So we can all expect this to be a fascinating show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it's good so far.  I don't know about you, but I'm having a blast.  So get this.  And you're not going to...  We talked a couple of episodes ago about my Farmville problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have a Farmville problem?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have a Farmville problem and I...  He's addicted.  I was addicted, but I gave it up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought it was going to be like you needed some...  I need some cows.  ...pharmaceutical assistance.  Does anybody have some cows?  So you can really deliver.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have you ever played Farmville on Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't played...  Isn't this Mar Pincus' deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He makes hundreds of millions of dollars a year by Zynga, Z-Y-N-G-A, sucking people  into these stupid yet somehow bizarrely addictive games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think animals is pretty much you can't lose if you do anything with animals.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's got animals and fruit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And well, fruit or food?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Food fruit.  You can raise artichokes, you can raise beets, you can raise wheat, rice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a winner right there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And the way he makes money is you pay him cash for virtual farm bucks so you can buy  a fence.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm all about virtual stuff.  I want cookies.  We could be doing it right now with our shows.  Virtual, fun little things to give each other.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I've kind of mocked this whole thing, but I did.  I literally...  I took Farmville off my Facebook page because I was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Cold turkey.  Cold turkey in your farm.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I miss it.  I miss it.  I wonder how the artichokes are doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mel Brooks, his 2000 year old man, always said we mock the thing we are to be, Leo.  You mock the farm.  I am Farmville.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are Farmville.  There may be a Twitville in my future.  However, get this, for all the noise and attention Twitter gets, Farmville is bigger than Twitter,  than all of Twitter.  A Facebook application...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  All as measured how?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It has...  They have 16...  Get this.  Get this.  How addictive this sucker is.  They have 69 million active players.  It's the largest Facebook app by a factor of two to one over the next highest competitor.  Daily active players, 26.5 million.  And it's not surprising because in order for you to do this, if you plant artichokes, you've  got to come back tomorrow or they turn brown and shrivel up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Okay, see here's the thing.  We used to have, be a nation in the US of farmers and agricultural people.  Tell it.  One percent now.  Just a percent of the people playing Farmville with such a dedication were to go to their  rooftops or their windowsills or their front or backyards and actually plant a real thing.  Thank you.  We'd be so much better off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I really thought you were going to say, shout, I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take  it anymore.  But that's a better idea.  You put that into planning an artichoke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I fully support Baratunde and then you save yourself some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You mean plant an actual artichoke?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, a real thing.  A thing that grows in the ground.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You get dirt under your fingernails and there's snails.  I don't want to do that.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Welcome to the new America.  A virtual America.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to put an entire picture of virtual America.  John, you're old enough to remember real farmers.  You remember those?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember them.  I am one.  I think that's a joke there somewhere.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Farmville is, okay, number two is Causes, which I also have on my Facebook page.  The Cafe World, Happy Aquarium, Mafia Wars Zynga, Fishville Zynga, Pet Society, Texas  Hold'em Poker Zynga, Yo-ville for people of your color.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What?  Not you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, Yo-ville.  They decided that Farmville might not appeal to African Americans and other urban.  Because they didn't farm.  Because other urban types and they made Yo-ville.  Without the force.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Do you just say Yo all day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yo.  I don't know.  These are the top ten apps.  With 69 million monthly active players, that is estimated to be bigger.  Nobody knows how big Twitter is.  I think it's much bigger than the active user group at Twitter.  That's a lot.  69 million.  There's only 300 million people in the US.  Really?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  69 million.  It feels so much bigger when I'm on the internet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that racist for me to say that Yo-ville?  Oh, absolutely.  It was cute.  It was cute racist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was like confusing cute racism.  It wasn't malicious.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the confusion was I pushed the button for Heather's picture.  That's what really confused me.  That's what really confused me.  Because you were trying to challenge the stereotypes.  Exactly.  I was breaking down.  You're some person of racism.  Exactly.  Breaking down fences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, Leo, you talked about this a few weeks ago and people are starting to belly ache  now that you're just moaning, we're not talking tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, not tech.  Let me think.  Not tech.  So, you're talking about a application on a website that is the biggest website of all  time and the biggest application on that website.  How is this not tech?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They want it to sound less human and more like...  It's not tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They want me to talk about motherboards and processors.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They want welding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't like touchy feeling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They want an accelerator and stuff being exploded and stuff like that.  Am I right?  Am I right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that what you guys want?  They're engineers.  I want defragging.  Defrag.  Defrag, please.  Did you enjoy Farmville or would you rather me hold a soldering iron?  And I've got clippers and now I'm going to rewire my microphone while we do the show.  Now is that tech for you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, I'm thinking that it's tech the same way that discussing a YouTube video that happens  to be about something that's not tech is tech.  Because the game itself is not tech.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a path for me.  All right, all right, all right, all right, all right, all right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's kind of tech biz to think someone's passing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's tech biz.  I give you that.  It is tech biz.  But we're not talking about the business aspect of it.  How much money does this guy actually make from this thing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No one knows.  At least a quarter of a billion a year.  Possibly three times that.  The company's valued at one billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, valued at.  We all know how useful that is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yearly sales are one billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Really?  So your value is what you make a year?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, that typically.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I thought it was like four to one or something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no, that's for sale.  You might sell it four to one, but if you do valuations, it tends to be the stock price  multiplied by the number of shares outstanding or one year sales.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It depends what year you're talking about.  I remember when valuation in the late 90s was they'd take the number of members and  multiply it by credit.  We still do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That is a calculation that's valid.  That's the Calakannist calculation.  We call it the Calakannist.  Generally speaking, it means you can sell the company tomorrow for that amount of money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think your value lies in your heart.  It's impossible.  You know what I love is that Baratunde is more lesbian than I am on this show and I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  love everything about that.  I am a lesbian.  Good job.  I give up.  I give up.  Let's go farm and it's what's in your heart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right.  Tell me, John, is this a tech story from Ars Technica?  Bandwidth hogs join unicorns in the realm of mythical creatures.  An analyst has had it with internet data caps.  Bandwidth hogs, that thing that Comcast promoted as a way to say, don't use Comcast.  The Pacific bell at the time.  The Pacific bell, yeah.  He said don't use Comcast because that's bandwidth hogs.  He says it's a myth.  Caps simply penalize heavy users who, John, this is something I've been saying for a long  time, cause no problems for others.  Now he's throwing down the gauntlet and challenging ISPs to turn over some data.  He says, let's see.  It's Benoit Felton.  He's with the Yankee group.  He covers fiber to the home issues.  Okay, I admit he's in Paris, but his bandwidth hog challenge is a product of his personal  blog fiber revolution.  He's kind of with me.  He says there's plenty of bandwidth out there.  This bandwidth hogs thing is a stalking horse for merely blocking competitive technologies  like Skype, BitTorrent, stuff that would put Comcast or AT&T or Verizon out of business.  The bandwidth hog is an imaginary creature for a digital age.  Is that a tech story?  Yeah, don't you think it is?  Yeah, it's what we've been talking about for a long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, Dvorak, why is that a tech story?  He's coming up with an imaginary creature.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He likes unicorns.  I know this about John.  He's always liked unicorns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So, hey, I'm only the messenger here about the tech stories, okay?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Imagine that some of these crazed downloads are BitTorrent fiends and that they have their  clients set up to do most of the downloading in the wee hours as a BitTorrent fiend would  do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think there is such a thing as a bandwidth hog.  I see the effects of it.  For example, here at the house, my son cranked up something the other day.  I was trying to do Skype and it just killed the whole network.  That's an in-house bandwidth hog.  I think the Yankee group historically has always used hyperbole to get attention to  itself.  It's a very common phenomenon with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It worked.  Right.  I think what this article also reveals is maybe a need for at least more transparency  whether or not the claim is true.  We can't tell.  With something as important as an internet network, whether we're talking long haul or  in a metro area or in the last mile or in John's house, we need to have some insight  into this because it's becoming such a public good and a public infrastructure.  We should know what its conditions are and whether the claims of those operating it are  valid or simply anti-competitive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It speaks to the net neutrality issue because if you're going to create a regulation for  net neutrality, it's in response to the notion that these companies are using bandwidth hogs  as a kind of a stalking horse for what's really going on, which is they want to keep people  from using Skype and stuff.  Or BitTorrent because they try to sell you movies and that kind of thing.  I'm with you.  I think what we need, if we want to have an informed conversation about net neutrality  was we need numbers from these guys from Comcast.  Well, how bad is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Show me your bandwidth.  Show me the bandwidth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  All the time, real time, numbers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think they have numbers.  They don't understand themselves.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is the conversation you and I have had for quite a bit, John, where my position is  there isn't really a lack of bandwidth.  There's plenty of bandwidth out there.  That's not really what they're worried about.  I think caps are a huge stupid idea and that's what this guy's saying also.  I don't mind tearing.  I think it's reasonable to say, for instance, you pay 50 bucks, you get 10 megabits.  For 70 bucks, you get 100 megabits.  That's fine.  Pay for your bandwidth.  But I don't think paying for the amount, it makes any sense at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I mean, of course, you're right.  We have talked about this for the last 10 years.  I'll bring up my argument again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Okay, you might as well because we're rehashing.  So go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So in other words, what you're saying, it should be like water.  So when you turn the faucet on, you get a bunch of water and you don't pay for using  extra water.  You just pay one flat fee.  So for five bucks a month, I get all the water I can drink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, it doesn't work that way for water either, does it?  You pay for the amount of water you use, but there's no cap.  Which is why they're charging by the bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's saying there's no limit, but if you're a big user, you're going to have to tier into  a separate tier level.  I'm saying that scarcity is not real.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  At some point, a scarce resource.  Bits are not a scarce resource.  We'll make more, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But management of those bits at certain critical hours, peak hours, can be a scarce resource.  The final tenacity of distributing bits might be a scarce resource.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it's an artificially created scarcity is my point.  That there isn't a scarcity, that there's so much dark fiber, there's so much bandwidth,  that it is not a scarcity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It costs money to light that stuff up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I admit, there's a fixed capital cost.  We've had this conversation.  There's a fixed capital cost.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What about the baritones put about the management of it, which is a human issue?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, but the management is fairly cheap.  How many people does it take to have a billion bits a second go across a network?  Not that many.  I don't need five more people because it's 10 billion bits.  It's like a radio station is charging for how many people listening to it.  It doesn't cost you more to have a million listeners to a radio station because you're  just putting the bits out there.  I think, yes, there's capital cost to building the routers and the fiber, which is, by the  way, all laid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It costs you more on a radio station because you have to have a transmitter.  No, you don't.  Wait a minute.  You can't do a half a watt and get a million people listening to you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Unless they all live within a block of the station.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You have a transmitter that covers a metro area.  If every single person in the city listens, it doesn't cost you any more than if one person  in the little city listens.  Bandwidth is like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the way you see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm Leola Port and that's the way I see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's the way Sue sees it.  That's the way Sue sees it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's the way Sue sees it.  We're talking Glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Hey, I'm a lesbian.  That's the way I see it.  I'm going to get bogged every time I see lesbian.  Wait a minute.  Wait a minute.  Are you telling me you guys watch Glee?  Oh yeah.  Isn't it great?  It's the best.  The bomb.  It's the gayest show on television.  It is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's wonderful.  And it's the nerdiest show on television as well.  It is.  It's about nerds.  It's a complete nerd fest.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Glee?  Glee?  Glee.  Glee is a Glee club.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, Glee.  It's a wonderful show.  I can't watch that crap.  I'm hooked on it.  You can't stop watching it.  Love it.  You can't stop watching it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Especially because of Jane Lynch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She is brilliant.  Unbelievably funny.  That's the way I see it.  What does that mean?  Is that like C is like C?  Her last name is C.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Her last name is C.  So it's her cute little sign off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's so god awful.  You guys are to hopeless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I saw the other day?  Speaking of TV, I thought this was very interesting.  HP doing an ad for a printer with apps.  HP obviously very...  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Have you seen this, Baratunde?  It looked like an iPhone jammed inside of an HP printer.  There's an app for that.  There was a Google Maps inside of my printer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's very...  I think it's interesting.  I think you see apps everywhere because look how well Apple's done.  There's an app for that.  It's clearly created this notion of small little applications.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's focused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Very focused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Twitter used to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, like Twitter used to be.  The ad that I saw was for Fandango.  So you could print a movie ticket on your printer.  So you press a button.  The printer knows what movies are showing.  Pick a movie.  Big picture.  Looks really cute.  Push the button.  It charges you somehow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So is this like a...  Is this either...  Is this a mini browser or are these basically widgets whose output you might want in paper  format?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  And by the way, Ford...  They may not know themselves.  Ford, we do ads for Ford Sync, which I'm about to do in a second, and Ford has announced  they're going to open source Ford Sync.  They're going to have an SDK and they're going to allow people to write apps for the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Car apps?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a car app for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Will there be an app that drives the car?  There's like a look of Glee from the guys in the studio.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We can have the Ted Kennedy app.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are you feeling in the dumps?  Are you depressed?  You want to end it all?  There's an app for that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are there apps in the car?  Yes, there's apps in the car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think this is great.  I just love this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's the app...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I think navigation could get really cool with car apps.  You can do a lot of trip planning at home and you want to get that inside your car,  but you don't want to fumble with your phone.  Are you tired of juggling your phone while you're driving?  Well, then pre-establish your route.  Have it let you know where coffee shops are along the way or augmented reality type things  that might prompt you for a pull over here to do X, Y, Z.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want a heads up display.  Actually, Mercedes showed this at the LA Auto Show.  It was like a split screen display.  It looked like it was heads up.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Ford's got something like that too, by the way, on the drawing board.  I think it's so cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, let me do the Ford...  Split screen?  What?  I'm trying to imagine.  You're driving, you're looking at multiple screens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So the whole idea of heads up though...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Like right now, I'm looking at Skype.  I'm driving like this.  Right.  But...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Through it, you see the little old lady crossing the sidewalk, so you can stop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So while you're watching your TV show on your windshield, you will hopefully see the old  lady.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What?  Here's Baratunde, a little old lady is walking across his head and you go, oh, I better put  on the brakes because somebody's walking on Baratunde's head.  No, no, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Better, better.  There's an app for detecting old ladies.  You don't have to worry about it.  It has access to your visual frame of reference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, with the new radars that they have, you'll be able to watch the TV on your windshield  while looking for the old ladies.  But if you don't see the old lady, the radar will stop the car anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Brad Templeton, who is, besides being the chair of the EFF, is also a scientist and  a researcher and he was...  And Canadian.  And Canadian, of course, as all good people are.  That's right.  Are you wearing a tuque?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This isn't quite...  It really qualifies as a tuque.  But we can have...  It's tuquish.  I don't want to get you off the car app.  It's tuquish.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Anyway, I talked to Brad.  It's a tuquette.  Brad is an expert on exactly the subject, which is autonomous vehicles.  And he said we're very, very...  He has a whole blog on this.  Seriously?  He said we're very, very close to cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh yeah.  It's coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I drove one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Well, I should say one drove...  No, in future of?  Yeah, we did a segment.  It's a Junior.  It's a car at Stanford University that won the DARPA Urban Challenge recently.  And this car has hyper-accurate GPS.  It's got a crazy lidar, like 3D light-based radar system.  It can read road signals and land changes.  It can detect other vehicles that actually swerve around a car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You don't need the road to be intelligent and have stuff in it for the car to be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was no intelligence embedded in the road.  They taught the car.  It had enough scanning systems and processing power to interpret quickly enough.  Wow.  This is my lane.  This is not my lane.  That's a person.  This is not a person.  Cool.  Isn't that cool?  That's hard to even...  And you can do your makeup with no contact.  We've now designed cars to let us text.  It's like Boston drivers since 2008.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  However, it's the political will that's going to stop it because people are...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's going to freak people out.  It freaks people out.  The idea that you're looking at something else, which people are doing anyway when they're  driving, but that they're going to acknowledge...  No, the car is more like a living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It is.  Where everything is in a circle and you're all talking to each other, you're eating lunch  and whatever in the car.  It just takes you where you wanted to go.  You just say, car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's like a mobile living room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like a mobile home.  Oh my God.  Bucky Fuller, what would he say?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The sad thing about Bucky, he designed that great car.  It looked like a teardrop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I saw that car.  It was gorgeous.  That Dymaxian car.  Yes, Dymaxian.  It seceded 11 people with three wheels.  The turning radius, incredible turning radius.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it was perfectly aerodynamic, so it was super efficient.  Unfortunately, the first guy who drives it gets in a fatal auto wreck.  Kind of kills the interest in the Dymaxian car.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Make sure your early adopters are competent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He forgot the seat belts, I think.  Or superhuman.  Superhuman would be good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Would you ever get in a moving living room?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Who wouldn't?  That's the future.  There'll be whiskey.  Now, here's my prediction.  The future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  That's the future.  Moving living rooms.  Let me write that one down.  Forget flying cars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want living rooms on wheels.  No, but here's the thing.  Watch carefully because everybody, look, the technology is imminent within the next couple  of years.  Everybody knows it.  Everybody also knows there's no way those old men in the Senate are going to make this  possible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right?  You can't let a car drive a Chelsea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  My dear.  That's what Winnebago is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What happened to people farming?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We get a lot of money from the petrol industry and they like the cars being driven by Marz.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So watch because what I think will happen is if somebody very clever is out there is  the gradualization of this.  And I think Ford's saying things like this.  How do you gradualize this?  You gradualize it.  How do you gradualize a living room?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They've already done it.  You just put an ottoman and you don't notice it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Parking.  They park themselves.  That's how it starts.  Heads up.  Radar systems in cars.  It's already starting.  Collision detection systems already in cars.  So the car acts autonomously on it.  We couldn't get cars made out of aluminum.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How are we going to get cars that are this amazing?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you got it.  Volvo has this bliss system, which is actually in Ford's Taurus SHO, that will tell you if  somebody is in your blind spot.  The Prius will slow down if you drift out of your lane.  Right.  It's going to change the braking.  All of this stuff is here and it's going to gradually, I think, be so people get comfortable  with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And somebody in the chat room just said cruise control, which is a great system that's been  there for quite some time.  I don't actually see the massive opposition to this that you do, Leo.  If it's sold right, people can sell this as safer because the machines are quicker.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The only opposition Baratunde would come from if it threatened the oil business.  That's what you have to worry about.  It's not going to come here.  And if it doesn't threaten them, then it has a chance.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This encourages driving by saying, look, you can actually do your homework or your office  work in your car, just like driving a, you know, riding in public transit.  If anything, I encourage people to keep their cars rather than doing something else because  they're not wasting time anymore, quote unquote.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  GM's new lobbyist, Baratunde Thurston.  That was very convincing.  I can sell anything.  That was good.  It's really good.  Well done.  You really have me.  One minute I'm planting an artichoke on a roof and dancing in this circle at the moon  and the next minute I'm like, GM needs cards.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love it.  I am actually watching Disney's Future of Transportation.  It's fascinating.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Disney would know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Disney would know.  This probably is something that they played.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What's Disney?  Is this on the Disney channel?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no.  It's 1958 Disneyland TV show episode called Magic Highway USA.  You can see it on YouTube.  Okay.  An exploration of the possible future.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So that was what?  51 years ago.  And how far have we gotten?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We got Ford's sink.  Look at traffic density.  Slow.  It slows down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  51 years ago.  Yeah.  And what have we got in the car that parks itself?  I think that's pretty good.  Have you?  You know, the thing about the car that parks itself, I'd like to know, can you take your  driver's license test with that car and push the button?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's great.  That's how they're going to sell it?  How?  They're going to say, they got to get the DMV to say, okay, if you have a self-driving  car, you don't have to take the test or we'll just let the car drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, wow.  You don't have to go to the DMV.  It's the only place where people meet each other than the ice cream shop.  Otherwise, our culture would never mix.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  DMV, horrible.  You're right, though.  That's all we got.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's what we got left is the supposed democratic complex culture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I was in the DMV.  I didn't know people like that were alive in this world.  It's one of those, it's like you feel like everybody there is alien, like from another  planet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And I think that about you, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you think so?  Do they look at me and say, I didn't know he was in this area?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  People who think someone isn't like them, they can't handle it, whatever that thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is.  It's because of those hats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the toots.  I honestly wear my alien this right here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's the toots.  All right, let me take it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happened to your love boat?  What happened to your thirst and howl, the third scarf, Dvorak?  Where did that go?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, Lovie, where's your scarf, Lovie?  I'm wearing a scarf.  You should be wearing a scarf.  Come on, Lovie.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Let's take a break.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the voice I'm looking for.  It's time for me to make some money.  I don't know about you, but I'd like to make some money with this show, so I'm going to  talk about Ford Sink.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Look at that.  It's amazing.  It's actually, it is kind of what we were talking about, is the precursor to all of  this.  Ford Sink, the idea behind Ford Sink is it's a hands-free system that lets you keep your  hands on the wheel and your eyes on the road, and yet do so many of those things that are  distracting normally with your voice.  It's great voice recognition.  Of course, the first thing you do is you pair your Bluetooth phone to it, up to 25 different  phones.  I've got my Droid and my iPhone paired to it.  It will play music from the phone using Bluetooth's music profiles.  Is it A2DP?  It might be A2DP.  It will also, if your airbags deploy, call 911 for you.  It has, the Sink has its own GPS, so it will send the GPS coordinates for where the car  is.  It will also, if your airbags are deployed, give you a chance to say, help me, help me.  Can you get vehicle history reports?  This thing is amazing.  Now, that's just kind of the utilitarian stuff.  There's also, they call it Travel Link.  I was playing with this yesterday, and I was just showing my wife, I said, watch this honey,  I pressed the button, I said, Travel Link, and then it goes, boom, and I say, five-day  weather forecast.  I get a five-day weather forecast.  I say, football scores, NFL.  I get the NFL scores.  I say, how's my fantasy team doing?  It'll tell you that.  Movie times.  It's got GPS.  You say, I want to go somewhere.  It gives you the destination.  It's not a big, expensive GPS unit.  It does it itself, turn-by-turn directions through your voice and the Sink voice.  And I like the Sink lady.  I'm getting a little crush on her too.  I want you to take a look at Ford Sink.  You've got just, I think, a day or two more to win a new Nano or a Zune by going to Sink  My Ride Podcast dot com.  Sink My Ride Podcast dot com.  You can learn about Ford Sink there and you can enter to win.  All you have to do is tweet with the hashtag Sink My Ride Podcast.  Something like, I'm listening to a car wreck on Twitter this week, Pound Sink My Ride Podcast,  and you'll be in the drawing.  They've got 15 Nanos or Zunes to give away.  Contest ends December 9th.  Your chance to tweet and win.  We thank Ford so much for their faith in new media.  Let me tell you something.  That's a pretty big deal when a company like Ford buys ads.  And it's not just by the way on the Twitter network there.  I see their ads on Dignation and all over the place.  I think they really get it.  They say, you know, this is real.  So thank you, Ford.  And folks, do me a favor.  Sink My Ride Podcast dot com.  Just check it out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can see the reality show next.  What's that?  You know, Pimp My Ride.  Sink My Ride.  Sink My Ride.  The crazy apps, robot destroying app you've come up with for your car.  Are we going to have cars that attack other cars?  Will the injection see something?  It's interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was talking to Chris DeBona of Google.  He was on our Floss Weekly show.  He's their open source guy.  And he says, yeah, I've actually been talking with Ford about this.  And their concern is they don't want people to write apps that would tweak the fuel ratios  or change...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They don't want to make the car more fuel efficient than they did?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They're going to over drive what people do with their computer processes.  Overclock.  Overclock it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  Make it a richer...  You know that, John.  Aren't you a hot rod guy?  Oh dear.  I thought that you did that, Leo.  That's John.  There's a voodoo doll in John's window.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I used to be a hot rod guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So wouldn't you enrich the fuel mixture to make it go faster, something like that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You get some nitrous oxide and pump it in straight.  There you go.  Did you do that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Blow up the thing.  Did you ever drive a nitro-fueled funny car?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.  Watch John C. DeVorek around the 15-mile oval as his nitro-fueled funny car goes round  and round and round.  Oh, the humanity.  Was that you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tom Campbell.  Oh yeah.  Top of the Hill Daily City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, he did all the funny cars.  He also had that voice that you just did.  Sunday, Sunday, Sunday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I love that stuff.  I grew up on that stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Whatever happened to him, I wonder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wonder too.  He was kind of an interesting guy.  He was a DJ in San Jose.  He did very famous ads in San Francisco for a stereo store called Matthews, Top of the  Hill Daily City.  Somewhere around there out takes of this because what he would do is he'd go to the Matthews  store and say, hi, Tom Campbell here for Matthews, Top of the Hill Daily City.  Then he would start talking to people as they're going, what did you get?  People would say rude things and he'd just keep on going.  He was also famous for having people call his show and give him sob stories like, I  got a hot date with my girlfriend tonight and my car broke down and he'd give him the keys  to his car.  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, no, he had actually perfected the networking thing.  He had phones in his car.  He had early mobile phones.  He had old car phones, the old analog ones and all kinds of weird stuff.  You could always get a hold of him somehow.  He was just basically working 21st.  Kind of like you, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Or Barrett Tunde, who I don't know how he managed to tweet as much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is he a super tweeter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I tweet a lot, but it's very hard to keep up.  Barrett Tunde is not only tweeting at all times.  He's always tweeting as we speak.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's on multiple platforms.  I don't think that's exactly what Mamet said, but it's close.  He's updating him for the 21st.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Pretty much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I went to a Mopar alley once and saw small cars and they had, there's this one car with  a record player in it before there was cassette tapes.  That wasn't just put in aftermarket like it came with the car.  And they played upside down?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, well, it would skip otherwise.  It was humongous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, the very first, because they didn't, actually this is quite famous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they talk about it in Empire of the Air.  Before there were car radios, people wanted, before radio was common, people wanted music  in their cars.  They tried putting Victrola's in the cars.  It wasn't a good idea.  Which is kind of like a lot of web video shows now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You remember that, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You remember hearing about it.  You don't remember actually driving it.  I didn't ever have one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I remember hearing about it, yeah.  I do remember though when they had the early cartridges, they used to have those, like  a cart that you have in a radio station, they had those in cars that were pre-8 track.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They weren't 8 tracks, but they were like 8 tracks.  No, they weren't 8 tracks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, no, they were like the radio cart that you get in the station.  You have a cart and you pull a lever and it makes the thing go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It would go chunk.  Well, the reason was until transistors came along, you really couldn't put a radio in  a car because it had vacuum tubes and stuff.  It would just shake loose.  So it wasn't until the 50s when the transistor came along and radios came along, they put  radios in cars.  So they had to figure out all sorts of ways of doing it.  Talking about these apps, there's an article in the, did you want to start another thought,  John?  Go ahead.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I was going to start another topic.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Go right ahead.  You see there's quite a few of them here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think we should be talking about the Google public DNS.  This is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is interesting.  I'm an open DNS fan.  I use open DNS.com.  Do you use it?  Yeah.  Oh yeah.  And you know why I use it?  Open DNS, it's a replacement for your DNS server from your ISP.  Right.  Have you tested it?  Yeah.  It's faster, more reliable.  And one of the reasons I started using it is about six months ago there was a significant  DNS flaw, security flaw, and many internet service providers did not fix it, but open  DNS not only had it, was it fixed?  It had been fixed before the flaw was discovered, so it never had the vulnerability.  It is faster often.  And they also have a nice feature.  If you create an account with open DNS, you can use it for filtering.  So I keep my kids from playing Farmville with open DNS.  So it's got some nice features.  You keep them from Farmville because?  No, I don't actually.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So Preston Gralow wrote a story in Computer World, and he said that he tested open DNS  against Google DNS and found that open was better and you should just skip the Google  DNS.  But I find it hard to believe that anything could possibly be faster than Google with  all the bandwidth they sit on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think open DNS is better because they've been around longer and they understand it  better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And then the Google servers, I mean they may not necessarily be physically closer to your  home.  If they just started this, maybe they haven't fully deployed it across all their massive  Google infrastructure.  So it could get faster over time is something I'm guessing because I read that same story  and it looked like Google had no real speed advantage even though the point was supposed  to be speed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's a really interesting question.  Why is Google doing open DNS?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Obviously, because they're good people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We talked about this yesterday.  Twigs.  What did you say?  They're just being nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they're just nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, crap bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, why do you think they might be doing it, John?  Market research.  Yeah, they could find, they could know everything about where you go.  Yeah, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Jarvis made the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't think they care about where you go.  I just want to see trends and where people are going in general.  The idea that they're tracking any one person into any extreme I think is kind of a...  Is not what they're...  They're tracking you, John.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're the only person they want to know.  They might track you, yeah.  They might track one person they hate.  Oh, I think it's you.  It's you.  I've asked them to do it because I need to know what you're up to at all times.  Because I need to know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, can I track Taylor Swift?  That's all I want to do.  No, I'm just kidding.  Taylor Swift.  Just kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Taylor Swift.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The...  I think the truth is that Google does track you, John.  If you look at your Google history, you log into your Google account, they know exactly  where you've been everywhere.  You've been everywhere.  They know everything.  You've searched for the last five years.  And your phone company has...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Then they will get in touch with me when they need to talk.  When you have...

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  We will talk.  We will call.  You need not call us.  We know where you live.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The only advantage of Google DNS...  Go ahead, have a drink.  Enjoy yourself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just going to say, and your telephone company has all of your voicemails, John.  And someday those are going to be really fun to hear.  Isn't that great?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because that's one of the reasons I don't have a machine on my phone.  I don't use voicemail at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've just learned that Taylor Swift is underage.  I have not been tracking Taylor Swift.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She's 19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's just welded with Kanye West in my mind for all time now.  She's 19.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So sad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's over before it begins.  That was...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole thing was a setup, right?  I don't know.  What do you think, Martin?  They have the same agent.  Oh, I didn't know that.  Whoever heard of Taylor Swift before it happened, now she's huge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And they were hoping she'd cross over into the urban audience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And it sure didn't hurt Kanye.  Everybody, you know, that's Kanye.  Everybody loves Kanye because he's that kind of guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And he got publicity from Obama.  First of all, I don't know anything.  That never stopped me from sharing my opinion before, but I just want to throw that out there.  I don't think that this is a setup.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because you're a brother, you might know what really happened.  Well, we all know each other.  Let me tell you about Taylor.  Isn't on the grapevine...  Taylor has a history of weird behavior.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And I'm looking for the tech angle on this, but just since we're talking about it...  They used a microphone.  He's an unstable, egomaniacal, troubled person.  And so this doesn't quite seem out of character for him.  He has a history of interrupting folks and just being sort of a bad person during award shows.  And he's trying to steal the spotlight because he's full of himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But don't you think it was a little odd that they sat him so close to the stage?  Yeah, with the same agent.  This has happened before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  This is like three agents for all the people in that room.  So I don't think that was a...  That's a good point.  Do you really think you guys think that agents actually do any work?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do you think they spend any time trying to make things better?  Yeah, that's the work they do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They come up with schemes just to get publicity.  They scheme.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, agents don't deal with publicity.  That's a different kind of person.  I don't think agents spend their time trying to get publicity.  I think a publicist might...  No, they don't care.  Do you have a manager?  I wouldn't give them that kind of credit.  Do you have a manager, an agent?  This is the agent you have.  I no longer have a manager.  I have a couple of agents.  But I don't have a manager anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bertunde, do you have a manager, an agent, and all that stuff?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I recently acquired managers and I'm working on an agent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know Dvorak has a book agent.  Yeah.  Is that something you need?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And Bertunde, are you finding the managers are helping you?  Because you seem like you could manage your managers probably.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, I went for a very long time without any official infrastructure.  It was like me and Google and word of mouth, a physical and virtual word of mouth, hooking  me up with gigs.  But it got to a point where I couldn't handle just the flow of demand and gigs and everything.  And managers have been pretty helpful in having somebody to shift things off to as well as  just helping pick up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Exactly what you just said.  And I think this scales all the way up to Taylor Swift.  These kinds of folks are great when you have inflow coming and you need somebody.  It's like outsourcing.  It's like you're India, your personal India.  Basically, they're not going to come in and say, let's change your.  I mean, they're just not that good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Most of the time, I would say they're not that good.  Spy phone app steals personal data from all iPhones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Was this in the app store?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I want this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  If Apple approved that, that'd be awesome.  What is this story?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is bizarre.  This comes from Tarranfx.com.  I don't know the site.  Who was that someone shouting loud that only jailbreak?  It's not in English.  I don't know what language this is.  That's only jailbreaking makes iPhones insecure.  They're talking about the Australian virus that took advantage of jailbroken iPhones  and the fact that people weren't installing it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This phrase has jailbreak, virgin and leak in it.  It's a little disturbing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You should skip to the second graph in this story.  A Swiss phone developer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Thank you.  Thank you.  Is this an onion joke?  Is this an onion article?  I think it might be.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, we're much better than this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  A Swiss phone developer has unveiled a new app that is capable of harvesting huge amounts  of personal data from iPhones using the public API exposed by Apple's SDK.  Now, in order for a spy phone to work, doesn't need jailbreaking or any exploits.  It relies, it says, on the iPhone's usability and depth of features once an application.  But see, you've got to get it on the iPhone.  He's posted the source code.  He's given a talk.  He says, you know, you can do this, but this is, this is, frankly, this is Apple's argument  for why they're so tight in their application approval process because you're not going  to be able to get spy phone without jailbreaking your iPhone because you can't get it through  the Apple application store.  That's an interesting argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's, that's Steve Jobs argument.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We want to make a secure phone.  That's why we check every application before we put it on there.  So this, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But, you know, you could say the same thing about computers in general.  I guess we wouldn't have a virus-laden environment within the Windows community if it wasn't  for the fact that everything's open.  Microsoft should have an app store.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's actually going, a really interesting choice that IBM made back in 1981 when they  released a PC.  They didn't hold on to it.  They didn't patent it.  They didn't patent the bios.  They allowed people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They didn't take it seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that why?  Because without that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, they were just, you know, kind of, there was guys in Boca Raton that developed all  this stuff and the big boys up north.  They didn't think this, you know, okay, whatever, you know, and, you know, why should we, they  didn't want to take it too seriously.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They screwed up.  They should have.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, I think that PC's gone places.  AT&T ranked last in Consumer Reports best cell phone service survey, an annual survey  of wireless customer satisfaction.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How do you need even a survey to know that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't believe it.  This is some, this is some Verizon app, right?  It can't be true.  Unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In a canvas of more than 50,000 readers spanning 26 cities, the carrier that had the lowest  customer satisfaction in 19 cities was AT&T.  Can you guess who number one was the best satisfaction?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Verizon.  Verizon.  Verizon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Which droid is, right?  Droid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Droid.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Apple's, it's almost enough to get me off the iPhone.  I hate AT&T.  Everybody does.  Everybody does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple's iPhones are the top smartphones, said Consumer Reports in our ratings among the  best of all phones we tested period, but their exclusive carrier AT&T was middling at best  in satisfaction.  If you are readying, I love how Consumer Reports writes, there's a certain style.  If you're readying to buy Apple's iPhone, prepare for possible disappointment with its  service and expect to love the phone anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  A guaranteed disappointment.  Yeah.  Guaranteed.  Well put.  That's part of the arrangement you make when you get this phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're guaranteed to be disappointed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And yet it says despite the network problems, a staggering 98% of iPhone users in our survey  were satisfied enough to say they would definitely or probably buy the phone again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because they're comparing the phone to what they had before the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So what you're saying is that Verizon's ads would slam AT&T.  I just saw another one.  True.  Santa's going out to the barn and all the reindeer are in there and it's cold and he's  got his lantern.  He says, okay boys, you're ready.  And they all have maps pop up from their heads.  This makes no sense.  Maps.  They got the Verizon coverage maps coming out of their head.  And then Blitzen, for reasons no one understands, has AT&T's map coming out of his head.  And Santa says, really Blitzen?  Really?  Or no, he doesn't say that, but something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is that really a commercial?  I would have thought it would have been Donner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, it was always Donner.  What happened to Rudolph?  Rudolph, oh no, Rudolph's beloved.  You can't mess with Rudolph.  Rudolph has his own stall.  He's not in the stable with the rest of the guys.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The Jews don't even have a map.  They won't ask for directions.  They're just lost in the desert.  There's no Santa coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  AT&T.  Donner, not Donner, sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Donner and Blitzen.  Donner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Donner.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Donner.  This means it's a German word for thunder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So how long are we going to be stuck with AT&T?  Are you still on an iPhone, Berton, have you left yet?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You almost called it Barack.  I thought that was cute.  You didn't call me Barack.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I did not.  You projected that entirely, Leo.  Rewind the tape, ladies and gentlemen.  You be the judge.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I heard it.  Not even close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I referred when AT&T has been bad for a while and I say they're sort of the civil liberties  violating crap network operating billing company that occasionally moonlights as a telecom service  provider.  I reluctantly got this iPhone because the Google Android phone wasn't working out so  well.  It just couldn't handle what I was throwing at it.  So I'm enforced.  I'm still pretty happy with the iPhone though.  Part of me hates myself for who I've had to get in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's exactly what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  So is there any way, you know, I know Esme Voss, what she does is she uses T-Mobile.  She buys, she just uses the iPhone on, I don't even think she uses the phone.  She uses the iPod touch over Wi-Fi because she's all about Wi-Fi.  And then she just gets like an all you can eat little really inexpensive plan for some  really old school phone for the phone service.  That's a good idea.  That's a great idea.  And then you can get most as long as you can get Wi-Fi somewhere, you're kind of, you know,  I can't get the Skype app to work well enough.  I would love to go all Wi-Fi.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I use Skype in China over Wi-Fi.  The Wi-Fi in the hotel was so good, I was able to Skype home for free for my iPhone.  It was awesome.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It was, it was, it was really great.  I mean, that works if you're in an environment where you don't move very much or you don't  mind going back to a pay phone model where you're looking for these occasional spots  to connect to the world.  Right.  And then you have to be like a phone phone and this other phone that sort of defeated  the purpose of an integrated device for me.  And I'm not trying to switch to Verizon now for the joy.  It's just, I'm done for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's kind of ironic because in China they block Twitter, FriendFeed, Flickr, but you  can use Skype.  Here you can't use Skype, but Twitter and FriendFeed all you want.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, it's more communist to use Skype apparently over Wi-Fi.  That's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they don't like AT&T either apparently in Beijing.  AT&T's response to the consumer reports findings, quote, we appreciate them.  You suck.  We're suing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, they're going to sue every consumer who reported on their bad coverage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We want that.  They subpoenaed the surveys and they'll be calling you.  We appreciate and value all customer feedback.  We learn from it and it helps us serve our customers better.  Without question, the surest indication of customer satisfaction is churn or turnover.  But the last quarter our postpaid churn, wow, was just 1.17%.  That means 99% of iPhone users stuck with it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What they don't mention is that probably their contract exit fees prevents a lot of people  who would churn from doing so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It might help that it costs $175 to churn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And the way they tier their pricing is so freaking irritating.  It's like we give you all these, you know, I should never drink before it.  I never drink before you stand up and I tried today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Have a cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'll have a cookie.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We have actually a broad variety of beverages set aside for you, the Sarah Silverman and  Lesbians.  We've got Takati, we've got vodka, we've got Dan Aykroyd's Crystal Head Vodka.  Isn't that gorgeous?  It's autographed.  It's actual size.  That's how big his head is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I hate that they give you this pricing so that they try to make it sound like they're  giving rollover minutes.  You can't even use them because you're forced to buy an enormous package you'll never use.  I can't believe I just said that.  Strike it rich.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's a mistake.  Strike it rich.  It's just said something enormous package you'll never use.  I heard it.  Wonder what she meant by that.  Strike it rich in the chat room pointed out that as soon as AT&T loses its exclusivity  on the iPhone, he said then watch the churn and he's absolutely right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  We've gotten to this point.  I mean churn used to be a lot higher in this country when cell phone service was still  relatively new and people were shopping for deals.  There was a massive difference in plans.  We've gotten pretty mature at this point.  People are locked into family plans, they're locked into certain operating systems or devices.  So I think overall industry churn is a bit lower.  What I would be curious about is if Verizon's churn is lower than AT&T's, I doubt that AT&T  revealed that in their response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't think they know, but Verizon's churn is pretty good.  I'm very happy with the drug.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I have to say I had Verizon first and I had horrible incorrect billing from the  edge of my own experience for a long time.  I had much better experience with T-Mobile.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's face it.  T-Mobile does have good customer service, but let's face it, all cell phone companies  suck.  They're all awful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Can we just get some other geek around?  I like the track phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think they do a good job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What kind of phone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Track phone.  What's a burner?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  When you call them up, you get a couple of minutes.  You use the phone and you throw in the garbage.  Fantastic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The choice of dealers everywhere.  Track phone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Track phone.  By the way, here's a story that's piqued my interest.  Google Schmidt.  Schmidt.  Fragmented newspaper execs just looking for someone to blame.  Yeah, this is on my interest too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I thought we'd talk more about it this week in Google.  Did you read Kara's decoding of Eric Schmidt's Wall Street Journal piece?  It's pretty funny.  Kara Schwisher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're the one drinking it.  I can't say Kara Schwisher.  Kara Schwisher.  Kara Schwisher in All Things D, man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's like the big story for a change of the week in the media business that the newspaper  publishers and the traditional publishers are freaked out and Murdoch's saying they're  going to try to de-index from Google everything in his empire.  What a joke.  It's a complete joke.  They're not going to benefit.  And it just happened, although Jeff has explained that the first click story was not a response.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's talk about the first click thing because I think that's got to ... Google has changed-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trying to bring it back, guys, to the tech.  I just want everyone in our city to know I'm trying to geek it up for you.  Two points to the girl in the two.  Even though I really want to talk about Murdoch and Ariana again.  But anyway.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You do have very good Ariana.  How's it going?  Well, I think it that way.  Yeah, she's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, she does an Ariana?  Oh, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't heard this.  Oh, that's right.  Why are you not listening to me yesterday, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He doesn't listen to the shows.  It's close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You have to do ... It's close.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Schmidt says, Herr Schmidt says it's understandable-  Why bother?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why don't you do this in an agree-  No, you got to do that voice.  Come on.  Give me some time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go into this.  Keep time at the story.  No, that makes you Leo.  He's got to do the Schmidt voice.  Ariana has a problem with you, John C. Dvorak, because you think you're all that like Mr.  Rupert Murdoch, but you're not.  You're not.  And I'm becoming Jacques Jagabor.  It's morphed.  It was my fault.  I had her nailed yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I brought up the Jaja, and that's twisted you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Herr Schmidt says it's understandable to look to find someone else to blame, but as Rupert  Murdoch has said, it is complacency caused by past monopolies, not technology.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That has been the real complacency caused by monopolies that has been the real threat  to the news industry.  Well, that's hard-hitting.  They're complacent monopolists.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  They are.  All monopolies are complacent.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I guess Eric Schmidt is saying, you know, we are the non-complacent monopolists  because there's so much more stuff to go out there and take.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says, we send online news publishers a billion clicks a month from Google News and  more than three billion extra visits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The 100,000 missed opportunities.  Am I right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is that what's in there?  Yes.  From our other services, that's 100,000 opportunities a minute to win loyal readers and generate  revenue for free.  It does seem like they're giving them something.  Rupert, you are off of your game.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What happened to Mr. I control the world?  What's been interesting about this story for me is watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's always fun to watch the media talk about the media, especially if they're also talking  about the media talk about the media within that.  And this whole idea that we're going to delist from Google and we have to demand these new  features.  There have been so many options open to publishers for years.  First click free where you can send someone to a registration only even subscription site  through Google and they can still read that story, but not other stories.  They could have been blogging for the last 10 years.  Publicly available.  You can always use the robot exclusion protocol to not let Google scan your works.  Publicly available to their help files.  So a lot of this is posturing and negotiation.  And I think it's very interesting that Murdoch, one of the most hated people in the media  is now aligning himself with newspapers who have generally not wanted his involvement  in their business.  This is a good way for him to be friends with them by putting out this common enemy that  they all share.  That's a great angle.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's a different angle than we had in contemplating yesterday.  I love that.  But do you think he's really trying to be friends with anyone?  It's not because Murdoch is trying to do business.  I don't think he wants to be a friend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think he's trying to be a successful business person, grow market share, make more money.  And part of that is politics.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  How is he going to make more money?  I don't see how he can make more money out of this though.  I don't see the money for him in this.  Where's the money from Murdoch?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there's maybe not money.  You're saying, Baratunde, you think that it's cynical on his part that he doesn't believe  Google is ripping him off?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I don't think he believes Google is ripping him off.  I do think he believes there's an opportunity for a wider range of publisher Google relationships  that don't necessarily involve all free access to all content for anything that your news  outlet produces.  And so what he probably wants is some subscription based system that still benefit from Google  sending them that traffic.  Yes.  He wants the best of both worlds.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He doesn't want to be treated just like you or any blogger.  He wants some specialties.  He's a classic Hollywood approach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That makes sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And maybe even...  He's the language of theft.  It's a lot of hype, but I do think he would like to see wider business models.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think you hit it on the nail in the head, but it's always so entertaining having worked  in the entertainment business.  Just the psychology of that business is so much about special relationships, but it only  works a special relationship if you're in the club.  There's no incentive generally unless you think there's something wrong with you.  The tech business is not nearly as club oriented.  No.  And the dynamics work differently.  I just saw Peter Goober at Supernova give his whole talk the other day.  All of his assumptions about business were completely 180 degrees from everyone else  in the room.  And yet he couldn't pick up on the fact that the kind of dollars also he's talking about  are actually small compared to the kind of dollars people in the tech business are working.  So I think it's a big psychological shift that they just haven't made because they think  you'll think the way I think.  They don't see themselves well enough.  We're all special, right?  Because here we are at Sun Valley.  Aren't we important being special together?  I know they basically are not.  I mean, those guys, I mean, whatever, Twitter's new, but they don't really get the tech guys.  They don't think they make sense.  And they're trying to get to still play the special deal game.  And the tech guys couldn't care less about that.  That's the thing.  It's like the free out of people from the nerd table is that you learn to opt out early  and you don't care.  And then the special deal game doesn't apply to you.  And that's true whether it's in high school or it's a ten billion dollar business.  I mean, why?  What incentive does Google have to do a special deal with Murdoch?  None.  They don't need to.  There's no dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So this play is I was going to make a comment on Heather's long diatribe there.  One too many conferences.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, you know, I was I was a paid performer there, John.  So I listened before I.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's getting money for this.  So there you go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, that's the way to do it.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'll go to conferences if they'll pay me.  Isn't that what we're Murdoch's really saying?

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  It's right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Really? Give me some money.  Give me some money.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, I think it's really but you're saying bartend is really astute.  I just don't see how it's going to work because I think he's operating on assumptions  don't apply to the people he's trying to negotiate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think you're absolutely right on.  That's very interesting.  It's a culture gap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think so.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. And a generation gap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because he thinks because Microsoft, who's desperate enough and they're the player  in the game with Bing that hasn't been mentioned yet, they often did this with music, too.  They try to line up everyone in L.A.  and say, well, we'll pay you for you to use our technology.  So for now, you're going to get one cash payment for Microsoft.  Well, this system works for a little while.  Happened with Windows Media Player, too.  So isn't that the deal with Bing?  We want to get paid by Microsoft.  They want Bing to matter.  They're going to pay us all.  But part of the deal with Microsoft is we've got to get out of the competitor.  That's what happened when I was at Apple and we dealt with everybody in the music business.  They wanted to push away QuickTime so they could go to to Windows Media Player.  It didn't matter in the long run because QuickTime was already out there and broad enough  that it just surpassed it anyway.  Not to mention at that point, real player and whatever else was going on.  So I don't know.  That's my guess is we can get a payment this week for Microsoft.  But I don't see Microsoft paying them for a decade.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah. Get it while you can, because it's not going to last.  OK, we're going to take a break.  Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.  What do you want to talk about?  And then we'll tease it.  How about that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, I think we talked about the Crunchpad.  We didn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And this is the most dramatic, wonderful story, which we'll get to in just a moment.  Well, for you.  No, I'm not.  I love Mike Harrington.  I have nothing against him.  I'm just curious what you guys think about this very strange story.  And I mean, weird.  But before we do that, I do want to mention our friends at Citrix and the folks who do  Go to My PC.  This is remote access done right.  I haven't talked about Go to My PC in a while.  I hope you've heard me talk about it.  And if you haven't tried it, I hope you will try it.  Go to My PC is very easy to install.  You know, in most remote access programs, it's complicated.  You got to figure out what operating system you got to figure out.  If you've got what it needs, you've got to often, you know, DMZ  your computer or open port forwarding and your router.  And this is so much easier.  Go to My PC.  It just couldn't be simpler.  All you got to do is go to the website, Geo, Tio, M Y P C dot com right now.  Actually, go to Go to My PC dot com slash twit.  So we get credit for it.  Go to My PC dot com slash twit.  And you'll within two minutes, you'll have it installed.  No configuration, nothing more.  And by the way, secure, if you've been worried about the idea  and a lot of these remote access products do have security issues,  maybe of you know, this is like a VPN.  This is like 128 bit SSL encryption.  So if you're in an Internet cafe or someone somewhere, you want to get to your office  computer and surf or get some files, you don't have to worry.  It's absolutely secure.  End to end encryption.  Easy to set up. Takes two minutes.  PC world gave it their world class award for best remote access software.  I mean, and they've done that year after year after year.  It's just the best.  So go there right now.  Go to My PC dot com slash twit.  Install it. Have it ready on your system.  Now you got some travels coming up.  You're going over the river and through the woods to grandmother's house  for the holidays or you want to get out of town or maybe you just want to spend  some time away from the office at home with a family.  All you have to do any time you need to access the office computer  is you go to go to my PC dot com.  You log in with your secure username and password.  You've got a 128 bit encrypted pipeline to your PC.  You see it on your screen just like you're there.  The menus are all there. All the applications.  You can send and receive email, anything you want to do, just like you're there.  Try it free for the next 30 days. Unlimited use.  When they first started doing the ads, they said, we'll give you an hour a month.  They said, no, no, no, no, no. I want 30 days, 24 7.  And that's what they gave you 30 days, 24 7.  Use as much as you want now through the new year.  Go to my PC dot com slash twit.  I thank them so much for their support this week in tech.  John, you want to summarize the Crunchpad story?  It's a bizarre story.  First of all, about a year ago.  Mike Harrington at TechCrunch announced that they were going to,  and I think this is kind of really admirable, create a tablet,  open source, use Linux, work with people in the industry  and make a pad, make a tablet.  Uh huh. Was it a good idea? Was it a bad idea?  John, what was your reaction when you heard about the Crunchpad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I thought the whole thing.  Well, looking at in hindsight now, I'm thinking the whole thing  may just have been one giant publicity stunt  because, I mean, he got Kanye West, first of all.  And of course, this never happens.  But it seems as though he got his Wall of Washington Post article  and he's probably increased the circulation by 10, 20 percent.  At least for the short term.  So what happened is that earlier this week...  Well, the way he tells the story, I mean, it's on his blog,  he says these Indian partners that he worked with decided  to essentially drop him out of the equation  and go off and do it themselves.  Two days before the public debut.  Mm hmm.  So what...  Does this make any sense to anybody?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, here's a couple of problems that come up right away.  How could they... How do they even think they could do this?  It's called the Crunchpad. He owns the rights to that.  He owns the design.  He said even on his blog posts, as if Foxconn two days  before the iPhone comes out, says, Apple, we're going to sell it ourselves.  Thanks, though. We really appreciate the help.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, if he's going to do the whole thing open source, he's got no patents.  He has trademarks, obviously, because Crunchpad would be his trademark.  I'm sure he did that much.  But there's zero patents in the whole thing.  Just kind of open source.  There really is no reason to keep him around as a partner  unless they have some written agreement that these guys, you know, I mean,  you have to write these contracts with these vendors in an ironclad fashion.  Mike is a lawyer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, Mike does what he's doing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why is Mike developing products?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Questions. That's what makes me think it's a publicity stunt, by the way.  That question you just asked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The way the way I see it is, you know, he probably did this because it was fun,  because you can.  And the cautionary tale for me is one is probably universal,  which is always be careful of who you do business with.  You can't anticipate everything ahead of time.  But also, it seems a lot of this was so dependent on our super globalized,  like just in time supply chain, outsourced partners within outsourced partners,  within outsourced subcontractors world.  And part of the price to pay is you don't.  Synergized leverage.  Right. That you could get such aggressive pricing and favorable terms.  Maybe part of the price of that is, you know, the uncertainty that these people  will actually honor the agreements you think you've entered into with them.  I don't know. Obviously, no one knows everything except the parties involved.  But based on reading all those posts on his site, I just got thinking like, wow,  like this seems so easy and maybe it was too easy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Charles Arthur writing in The Guardian  points out that nobody outside of TechCrunch really seems to have laid hands

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  on a Crunchpad. So maybe this thing is complete like publicity stunt.  Hello, JT Leroy of Tech.  Who's JT?  Leroy is not a reference. It's going to read this crap.  JT Leroy was a was a literary figure.  And there's your problem.  You wrote a book called Sarah that Gus Van Zandt was going to make a new film  was a big deal and sort of the lit world.  But no one had ever seen this mysterious author.  And when they went out sort of like Lady Gaga and drag and then turned out that it  was this woman kind of putting other people out and drag as this character.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But you have a famous story. That's a story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I sort of created invented this fake author whose life was so fascinating  and interesting and was like turning tricks at, you know, truck stops.  It was a great article.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think was the Bay Guardian wasn't that covered this thing.  They do really well. Very interesting story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It was it's really pretty fascinating story.  But this idea of her and it created in this case a fake author and that will sell  the books, which are well written, but it's pretty hard to break through.  In this case, Mike already has the so-called bully pulp.  But he's got the well-known blog.  But maybe he creates the opposite, the fake product.  I don't know. But did it does it look plausible, like a fake product?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think it could also be a dry test.  You know, you can do that legally.  You can announce things.  And I mean, I think they built something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think they built something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes. His photographs of a birthday party with someone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, there's a cake involved.  He says I'm a cake that did it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you saw the cake.  I'm convinced there's a cake.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a cake. Charles Arthur continues on.  I'm still puzzled how TechCrunch thought it was going to handle everything around  the Crunchpad. Making a successful product is only a small part of making a product  successful. You need pricing, marketing, sales channels, customer support.  None of which, you know, anybody had done anything about.  I think there is a point to be made that this was doomed to failure.  I don't know, though, if Mike.  Faked it. Is that what you're implying, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm saying the thing may have been a publicity stunt designed as such.  Maybe he thought he was going to do something like this and kind of dicked around with the idea.  I don't know. The whole story is pretty fishy.  If you ask me, bizarre, it's a bizarre story for a guy who is a lawyer who should be able  to close these kinds of things so you don't get screwed by your vendor or your supplier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, he says the lawsuits will fly.  But what's interesting about Mike.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I don't get any feeling that there's any lawsuits that are going to fly unless they bring  something out.  What's interesting about him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He says he's suing him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He posted legal letters and things earlier today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, did he?  OK. It looks like Baratunde actually did real work on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, yeah. I didn't actually look at the TechCrunch site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I just read the links.  I went through some, but I only went one or two layers down.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm kind of meta that way.  I don't like to read original sources.  I just want to see what's.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It just seems odd.  He would decide to make a product and then the last minute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I have to say, I think Mike, it's not unusual for Mike to take his ball and go home.  And I think that that's part of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He's not something about that.  He gets well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I did that myself.  But he's but he's kind of the he's kind of the guy who will get mad and say, all right,  screw you and walk away.  And Jesus, what does that sound like?  Well, just screw you.  You learn from the master.  Yeah, I learned from the best.  He makes other people do the same thing, actually.  Is sometimes the way he acts anyway, crunch pad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He likes a kind of pale and like end to things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He does.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He says a drama queen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's exactly.  Crunch pad litigation imminent.  It's been a busy week for our imminent for our former partners on the credit.  No, it happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We don't need this imminent crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, listen to this.  The company has deleted their corporate blog, hired a PR firm and scheduled an event Monday  morning to give their side of the story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So it's like a soap opera.  It's like a textbook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's totally here's what you get when you do something like this.  You get never ending drama.  Now, what's more interesting than the product itself, which might not be that good if it  came out, you get a fabulous ongoing drama story.  We get to see what happens in India with these guys.  Next thing you know, we'll have a kid.  We're not sure if it's his.  It'll be incredible.  We'll never stop watching his son in law was going to pose naked.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is William Randolph Hearst quality pot stirring is what this really is.  It was a product that would probably never would have been released.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We all love to talk.  How what gets you going like a blog and look at all the hits and attention is getting out of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think he generally wanted to make it.  But I also think there was never a chance in hell of it being made.  And this is just exactly the kind of result he wanted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Anyway, if he really did it, it's a lot of time.  I mean, it's a lot of time to get.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We may never know.  I got to call Mike and see if he'll come on the show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Now, I haven't come on the show, Leo.  I could get him on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sounds like that's what he wants.  I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you have to say screw you at the end on 10.  And I have stickers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't have to say it anymore.  I swear you don't listen.  Remember kids, Uncle Leo says screw you.  I had one, too.  I need some of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Here's my kindle case.  You should make business cards out of that little thing.  There's a lot of these with me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, no, actually, I have no animosity towards Mike at all.  You have no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, I have to tell everybody out there to know this.  Leo has no animosity towards anyone.  He's the nicest guy in the world.  And he's honestly nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And coming from that's incredible coming from you.  Wow.  You're not just nice.  You're like literally the nicest person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He just wants that Intel XM X25M.  I know.  I know what's going on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm getting it, John.  It's no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We are.  We did.  We was our house.  It was our door prize for whatever host came to visit.  It was an Intel X25M solid state hard drive worth over $500.  John did have his dibs on it, but he declined to show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have dibs now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Heather, go.  It's pouring rain.  I'm stuck here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, golly.  You need one of those self-driving cars here, John.  Yeah, that could park.  Mini Nova.  You guys know what Mini Nova is?  I'm sure you do, Barry Sunday.  Yeah.  It's like a small Lisa Nova.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's really tiny.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, after Pirate Bay disappeared,  it was the largest torrent site on the internet.  Last week, the site's founders decided,  after being threatened with fines,  to pull off all the illegal torrents  and say, we're going to be a legal torrent site.  They deleted over 1 million torrent files.  By the way, torrent files are not the pirated stuff.  They're a small meta file that says how to get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  That's right.  A pointer, if you will.  A pointer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I don't know.  You're the lawyer here.  But it seems to me that that's a marginal on the lawyer.  Yeah.  You studied in law school.  You went to law school.  I know what they're like.  You're a lawyer like I'm a college graduate.  Nice.  OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you want to know if it's OK to point to it?  Yeah.  It's pretty hard to not.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's what Pirate Bay always said is,  hey, we got no illegal stuff on our site.  We merely have torrent meta files.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Well, criminally, you'd have to prove intent  for it to be criminal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, the intent's criminal.  There's no doubt about that.  What are you talking about?  They're saying that they're helping people pirate.  And I think that's where the prosecution in the Pirate Bay  case came from, which is you don't have to store the files.  You're telling people how to steal.  It's like if you have a bomb making manual  and you put it online, you don't have to blow up a bomb.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's tricky with the whole First Amendment-y thing.  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's no First Amendment when it comes to BitTorrent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If I publish a whole how to murder somebody  article on my post.  Is that legal?  That's what I'm saying.  I don't intend to kill anybody in particular,  but I'm explaining away.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We need to get Cory on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, don't get Cory started.  After five years of a-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm a big fan.  My response to law school in general and this issue  is usually it's what can you do.  The law is so slow.  Right.  It takes so long to catch up with you.  And the way the law gets put into effect  isn't about what's right or wrong.  It's whatever you can afford and whoever  wants to handle pushing that forward.  So usually just practically what is going to happen  doesn't matter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what's a good example in that?  Happy birthday.  I'm just going to leave it like that.  After five years-

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Let me say something about this topic.  Just as the story just broke this morning,  there's a bar in England, and I think it's on ZDNet UK.  A bar in England had a Wi-Fi connection.  A guy came in the bar, used the free Wi-Fi  that was in the bar.  Nice.  Downloaded something.  And now he's apparently instead of suing the guy who  did the bad deed, they're suing the bartender.  Right, because he's in the bar.  Money.  That's why.  They were fined $13,000.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  8,000 pounds.  $13,000 because somebody illegally  downloaded copyrighted material on their Wi-Fi hotspot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is the tail wagging the dog again,  but I think there's more to it than that.  I think they would love to get to that point  where they could sue the manufacturers.  In other words, sue the messenger.  That's what's next.  I mean, you know where it's going to lead?  This is that argument about sue the gun manufacturers  for somebody using one of their guns.  Well, I'm behind that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's OK.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, I know you are.  Yeah.  That's why I brought it up.  I'm a liberal.  But then this is a liberal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  I'm against it.  I'm against it.  All right, so that's story number one  of ridiculous, appalling, bizarre copyright police.  Got another one for you.  It happens in Chicago.  It's outside of Illinois.  Chicago's still in Illinois, I think.  It's in Illinois, yes.  Illinois, just outside of Chicago.  I think that's what I meant to say.  Just outside of Chicago, small movie theater.  A young lady decides, and I think she's 22 years old,  decides to have a birthday party for her sister.  So they go.  They go to the movie theater.  They're showing New Moon, the new Twilight film.  I bet you love that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I so am not seeing New Moon.  If you love Lee.  I know that you forced yourself, Fertunda,  to go through this experience.  And I followed your tweets.  I followed your tweets.  Vampires.  How can I not love sexy vampires?  Well, you know, they're not my flavor of vampires, if we can.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't they have female Twilights?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Are there women vampires in this?  Are there girl vampires?  Yeah, there are.  Oh, well, but they're, it's teen.  Now what do you think?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Now what do you think?  Possibly.  Now how do you like me?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Possibly, but it's like, isn't it kind of a pretty sexist movie?  I don't know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's a horrible movie.  You should check out this great mashup, Buffy versus Edward.  I like Buffy.  This male feminist dude did a beautiful sort of comparison,  humorous take down of the images that Buffy stood for  and the images of stalkerism and fear and creepiness  that Edward Cullen, the chief vampire stands for.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm not into chicks getting their power  through the creepiness of the dude they're doing.  You know, anyway, what's the story here, Leo?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This Twilight phenomenon is the beanie babies of this era.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Ooh.  Oh my god, you got it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is Buffy versus Edward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is Buffy versus Buffy.  Right on.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here comes Edward.  He's very pale.  Oh my god, she sees him.  He's walking into Sunnydale High School.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He needs his brows shaved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He's so white.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Sex.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The sex drive.  Is that Harold Ramis?  I thought the same thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Hello?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She just seems like mildly annoyed by him.  This is a good mashup.  You know, I'm going to get in trouble for playing this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm not saying that.  Is it OK, Bart?  Are you going to be my attorney?  I'll be your attorney.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's all good.  Me and my Twitter followers will defend you.  It's news, right?  I forced myself to watch New Moon,  and I did what I call a live hate tweeting experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I enjoyed that.  A live hate tweeting.  Yeah, I mean, I've done something

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  where you live tweet something that you know you're going to hate.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm getting you 30 times over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, do something about that.  You're blaming me for that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Hello?  In the chat room, are you guys good with my sound?  I feel like it's a poor connection.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, no, no. I'm sitting here.  I got headphones on.  Everything's fine.  It's just John.  He doesn't understand how the internet works.  Look at him.  He's a baffled, baffled man.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you did your live hate tweet on the New Moon, you were saying?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, yeah, that was just the point.  Just trying to do a little Twitter innovation.  But it was also, I had read the books sort of under pressure  and wanted to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Why did you read the books?  Blunt for punishment.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not that I mean, it was a group activity.  You know, I was, I would put it this way, I was married when I listened  to these books on a long road trip.  I'm no longer and I'm not going to blame Twilight.  Twilight broke up your marriage?  I'm not saying that I'm just going to lay these facts out in a certain order  and let you know that the live hate tweeting was a very cathartic experience.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Twilight ended Baratunde's marriage.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's the fault of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, my God.  See what it does?  There's some perfectly good lesbian vamp.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Go watch Hungry.  You want to see good lesbian vampire stuff.  Go watch Hungry.  Yes.  There's a good movie.  Catherine Deneuve.  Catherine Deneuve.  It's the way it should be done.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're hungry for each other.  Or even anything that what's your name writes.  The story is and it began...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Is there some defragging we can bring up?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's a story.  No, there's a story here.  So this 22 year old wants to throw a birthday party for his sister.  They go to a movie theater.  New Moon is playing.  She happens to have a camcorder.  It's a birthday party.  Oh, yeah.  She pulls it out to take some pictures of her sister and the cake happens to be a couple  of frames of New Moon and get in the shot.  And Usher comes down the aisle, grabs her, brings her out to the lobby.  The movie theater owner calls the police, presses charges.  She spends two nights in jail.  Jail.  In jail is now...  This is real?  This is real.  This is America.  What town?  This is...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  America 2009.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Chicago, just outside of Illinois.  Just outside of Chicago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  We have to find this theater and shame them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know the theater.  In fact, Chairman, would you give me the name of the theater?  Because we will say the name of the theater.  In any event, she is facing three years in prison for a felony charge because she accidentally  got pictures of New Moon on her camcorder.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I have a point of inquiry here.  So this birthday party was happening inside of a movie theater?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes.  You've never had a birthday in a movie theater?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Baratunde, the idea is...  With a cake?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yes.  No, I've never seen...  I go to movies all the time.  I never see people having other events inside of a movie theater.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, if you hadn't left your wife, you would have had children and you would know  about this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In the Midwest.  You know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm sorry.  Baratunde, I love you.  That was mean, Leo.  I love you.  I take back what I said earlier.  I'm so sorry, Baratunde.  It's just something about you that brings out the worst in me.  I'm so sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I love you too, Leo.  Everything is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Touching the screen, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I think the world of you.  Seriously.  The Muvico Theater in Rosemont, Illinois.  Thank you very much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  M-U-V-I-C-O.  Great.  And the last time the chat room put the information in, they gave us a phone number as well.  But I'm not going to give you the information.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm still married, although thanks New York State Senators, not really in New York, but  we didn't see New Moon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why I think.  Where can you be married?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm married in four states in Canada.  I got a Canadian story speaking of Canada.  I'm one of 18,000 special couples married in California.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So they grandfathered you in?  They had me, Portia de Rossi Allen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Our grandfathered in?  Yeah, we're allowed.  Huh.  Then anyone else who's in a peep show booth, they're allowed just for the time they're  in the booth.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because we like to watch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, and then Iowa.  Massachusetts.  Iowa.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's where my food comes from.  New Hampshire.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Okay, back to the topic.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So-  Canadian Magician, oh, you want to say some more about New Moon?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, this woman is going to jail.  I can't believe this is the point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  She's in jail.  She spent two days in jail, which by the way-  How can we get her out of jail?  You have an army here?  She should not be in jail.  She's out of jail now, but she's going to go on trial for a felony.  That's insane.  Now, presumably the judge is going to, somebody here with some brains-

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, no, no, no, for a criminal, you have to have mens rea.  You have to have intent to commit the crime, to be convicted of a crime, a civil count maybe,  but not a criminal count.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But the theater owner can't be expected to know that.  Police can't be expected to know that.  They have to go to trial, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but they would throw it out right away if it's an accidental thing.  Of course the judge will throw it out, but she's already spent two days-  Not necessarily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, she's already spent two nights in jail.  John, why not?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Because some of these judges, they don't understand what's going on.  They got pressure on them.  There's a law, it's very clear, and sometimes the judge might want to get into the case  like this because it gives him or her some publicity.  There's a million reasons.  There's no guarantee they're going to throw it out.  If they were going to guarantee to throw it out, they would have already done so.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I hope she has a good lawyer.  This is just a travesty.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Don't take the law for granted.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You guys, there's people, I just want to say in the IRC room, saying that if I mention  anything about being gay, you're losing your PG rating.  I just have to say that that's what's coming out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're insane.  Go watch Glee.  It's crazy.  Go watch Glee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's actual homosexuals.  How are you going to lose your PG?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're the most PG gay person I know.  They don't have to say anything.  For existing, I apparently ... Apparently, you're not okay.  I'm a walking X-ray thing for existing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Just ignore them.  They're trolls.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's meaningless.  It's the hair inside that huge hat that has everyone really baffled.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I think the tuque is really the problem.  Is it a tuque?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  To be honest with you.  They take it off?  Oh my God.  Usually people pay big dollars.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My God, Heather, you're beautiful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh, we thought you had a huge head.  No, it's a tiny ... It's a tuque.  I'm not bragging for the people.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm upset that this person's in jail.  I am too.  We got two stories that are incredibly upsetting.  I'm upset that this person's in jail.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I am too.  We got two stories that are incredibly upsetting.  A copyrightули It doesn't make any sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can tell you guys I was on the other side of this copyright thing once upon a time when  I worked for New Line Cinema when I was doing legal stuff for them.  I didn't understand my first tech job.  I remember the one coder.  It was like, information wants to be free.  I was like, you're crazy.  You're never going to have an IPO.  I don't know what you're thinking.  Who knew that information had desires?  Exactly.  No, but it's just not workable.  It makes no sense.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  One of the interesting tech angles on this, especially to the Mennonove case, when the  Pirate Bay was shut down, there was no noticeable, measurable drop in BitTorrent traffic.  So Mennonove's site traffic is down 66%.  Searches are down 90%.  There's no such thing as a legal BitTorrent site.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Nobody wants it.  What are you going to get?  A Linux distribution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, aren't there folks though that distribute their own well-known musicians and filmmakers?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We distributed the show in the early days of Twitter because we didn't have bandwidth  provided by AOL or Cashfly.  We used BitTorrent very successfully.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Once you take your sense of how to make business out of it.  I mean, you're a comic bar attorney, don't you?  I am too.  I put my stuff out there at Creative Commons, don't you?  I mean, you're trying to make a career a different way, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  I just released this movie.  It's called New Moon.  I encourage everybody to go to BitTorrent and download it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Bring your camcorders, kids.  Well, look at the success.  Actually, today, look at a successful band's invite tapers in.  The Grapefruit Dead started it.  But if you're a smart band, you bring in tapers or even better, people like Umphreys McGee,  they offer you a tape at the end of the show.  They say, yeah, you don't have to tape because we've got CDs.  I mean, come on.  Here's a smart musician.  This is from, he's from Saskatoon, but don't hold that against him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Hey, yay Saskatoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He knew, I don't know how he knew, his name is Nate Heegee.  Somehow that the Google car, the Google Street View car was about to come by and shoot his  street.  So he made sure that he got his guitar out and a music stand with the name of his new  album and posed himself.  And he's on Google Street View promoting the album.  When they shot, when they were capturing his street.  That guy, I need to see now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to buy his album just because he did that.  That's enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Now that's the new media.  The best marketing there is.  I love this guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's give him credit.  Nate Heegee.  You're Canadian.  How do you pronounce that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Heegee.  He's from Saskatoon.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  His album is called Fear Salesman and it's great.  It's really great.  Yeah.  How did he know though?  Well, it says he learned the pattern of the street view car.  He was really geeky.  Yeah, he actually spotted it himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  He's seen the thing and then they get in their car and they track it down and then they get  in front of it and try to have their picture taken over and over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you keep showing up over and over and over.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, you just shoot in front of the thing and then you park or whatever and let the  thing go by and then you shoot in front of it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There was a street view flash mob.  Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The parade and the fili, I think.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Was that, you think that was fake or you think that was real?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I think that, I mean those are real people.  No, no, I know it's real but I mean.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I guess by fake I mean.  They're not zombies.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Fake like that phony baloney thing they did in Grand Central Station?  That was fake.  You're talking about improv everywhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Improv everywhere is real man.  That's a real flash mob.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's not fake.  Ha.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You don't think that's real?  That thing looks so phony.  Earless.com has the top 10 moments caught on Google Maps Street View.  Here's Viking Quest in action.  There's a couple of guys having some sort of samurai battle.  Drunk dude passed out on his lawn.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I love that one.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tech TV guy.  They're not Patrick Norton.  House on Fire.  Wow, you'd think they'd stop and try to put it out but I guess it was.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I went to a record store with my kid about five years ago and I said, let's go get some  records.  He said, what are those, Dad?  That's when you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, God.  My, Julian, my little seven-year-old pal, he saves it.  He does chores so he can get money to earn.  He spends all the money on iPhone apps like the second he gets it.  It's all he wants.  Really?  Yes.  It's all about iPhone apps.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If you can play a game on it, maybe.  He wants the games.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you don't want to stand in front of your printer and play a game?  That's weird.  Just sad.  Maybe while you wait for your printout, I guess you stand.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It reminds me of when Cisco decided they were going to put computers in your fridge and  you were going to spend all your time in your kitchen.  I think sometimes people...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to do a quick audible ad and then we're going to get a couple more stories, wrap  things up.  I'd like to ask you to participate in...  Actually, I can tell you that right now we're doing an advertiser survey at twit.tv and  I'd appreciate it if you'd take it.  We're not trying to get personal information about you.  We won't collect any information.  We're just trying to get a sense of who the heck listens to this crap.  So if you'd go to twit.tv and click the link...  Is that you, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Did you make that?  Yeah, it was a sound effect.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That was good.  That was good.  I want to recommend an audible book.  Audible.com is the place I go to get all my audiobooks.  I love audible.com and I know you do too because people have been supportive, very supportive  about our audible advertising and audible knows that this is the number one way people  sign up for audiobooks from audible.  We got a special audio deal for you right now.  We're giving you a thank you present from audible.com.  Anybody ever read Larry Niven's classic Ringworld?  Yeah, all three nerds in the room love it.  The engineers love it.  It is one of the great science fiction books of all time.  It is huge.  The ring is built out of, I think, a planet like Jupiter, like a gas giant.  And they build a ring...  For the world, it's 93 million miles in radius, which is one earth orbit.  The walls are huge.  Thousand feet high walls at each rim let in the sun and prevent air from escaping.  You've got to keep the air from getting out of the Ringworld.  It's stronger than any planet before it.  No need for a roof because it's going at 770 miles a second, which creates a gravitational  force.  Ringworld is one of the great sci-fi books of all time.  Hugo Award winner in 1970 for best novel.  Nebula Award for best novel in 1972.  Ditmar's award, the Australian science fiction award.  And you can get it free through December 13th because this is how we thank you.  You don't even need a credit card.  This is so great.  Audible is giving you this book.  They actually asked me, they gave me about 12 books that they could give away.  And I chose Ringworld.  I just think this is the one everybody, if you haven't read it, even if you have, listening  to...  You know, everybody's read it, but now there's an audio version of it and listening to it  is so fantastic.  This is, by the way, not just for our U.S. listeners.  This is something new.  I know sometimes I get complaints, people say, oh, you know, I can't do...  In the U.S. and Canada, go to audible.com slash twit free.  It's in the U.S. and Canada.  We did that just for you, by the way.  I hope you appreciate it, Heather.  W-W-W...  I do appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Canadians do appreciate being included.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, I know.  I get so many complaints from people who say, we can't do the...

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's very Canadian to complain.  So you might not get nearly as many complaints as there are Miss Canadians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  More people are thinking it than saying it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's right.  They just think it inside.  That's how you do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Canadians complain a lot.  audible.com slash twit free.  It's a huge honor.  In the U.K., audible.co.uk slash twit free.  In Germany, audible.de slash twit free.  audible.de slash twit free.  And in France, audible.fr slash twit free.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All of Germany is Körner Klink.  Körner Klink.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All of them are high.  audible.de slash twit free and audible.fr slash twit free.  No credit card needed.  Not every country...  Can you get this?  But their suggestion is try the URL of the country closest to you.  In most cases, you should be able to get this.  Audible, that is fantastic.  You've gone worldwide, Leo.  We're global, baby.  I just finished...  I came back to audible recently and read...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Look at the book I'm reading.  I might want to finish it on audible.  What's the book?  Let me see here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is it Cleaving, a story of marriage, meat and obsession?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism by Lenin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Vladimir Ilyich Lenin.  I don't think they probably don't have any Lenin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I want to read the Cleaving book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  This is...  You remember Julie and Julia?  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Julie Powell's new book.  I love the movie.  What about Lenin?  Love the movie.  Nora Efron.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love her.  It's a new book about...  She decided to become a butcher.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Did you see that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I love that.  She became a butcher.  She was trying to avoid...  She was thinking about her...  Like she was falling in love with a guy.  Did her marriage not work out so well?  She fell in love with a guy.  Why do you say baritone day?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Because you were making it a thread.  I'm trying to play the thread.  Sorry.  Maybe there'll be tips for...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Moodle Comrade, Nikolai Lenin, Great Blunders in History, The Russian Civil War, Times Magazine,  Times, Magpie, A Walk in Prague, The Greatest Speeches of All Time.  No, they do not have that.  I'm sorry.  Baritone Day, do you have a book for us?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I do.  I just finished Stephen King's Under the Dome.  Oh, yeah.  You were reading that last time.  I started reading it a few weeks back.  I finished it a week ago on a walk home.  It was really fun.  Weird book set in Maine with weird people, but a very kind of science-based show, actually.  I think a lot of the tech audience, he spent a lot of time researching what happens in  the circumstance that he set up and had an assistant, sort of a co-writer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You said you finished reading it on a walk home.  Yes.  In New York City.  How does that work?  It's an audio book.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  You listened.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You finished listening to it on a walk home.  Oh, don't start being...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He can think about that.  I think I remember that from earlier.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He read it.  He read it.  When you're listening to an audio book from Audible, you're getting the book.  I'm just saying, I just wanted to buy one of them.  It's not like you're walking around reading a book while walking, which is dangerous.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I'm just hoping he didn't hurt himself.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All the words that are on the printed page go into your ear and they stay, unlike printed  page, when sometimes they go around your head.  They go into your ear when you listen to Audible and you get the entire book.  I'm going to give you away...  Okay, I'm going to give you three free books today.  Nice.  First of all, Ringworld from Larry Niven.  Nice.  Second of all, if you go to audible.com slash twit2, twit in the number two, you can sign  up for the platinum account.  First two books are free.  Get Under the Dome.  That's 34 hours of great Stephen King material.  And then I'll let you pick anything else you want.  I'm listening to...  Hitchhiker's Guide?  Hitchhiker's Guide?  They have it all.  Nice.  Even the new one.  There's a new one that just came out.  Really?  Douglas Adams obviously is no longer with us, but there's another Hitchhiker's Guide.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be kind of intimidating to try to write Douglas Adams without him.  I don't know that I'd want that.  I know.  It's like covering sitting on the dock of the bay.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Mistake.  Go to Audible.com.  Or John.  Boy, that was a mild laugh.  That was about the mildest...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Do you get laughs like that sometimes, you guys?  You probably do.  I've read about such things.  It's like...  Yeah, right.  Under the Dome, a novel.  That's one of our free books.  Go to Audible.com slash twit2 and make sure...  Yeah, slow clap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Make sure you go to Audible.com slash twit free to get your free copy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No credit card.  You should all be going there, right?  I'm going to go to Audible.com slash twit2.  I'm going to go to Audible.com slash twit3.  I'm going to go to Audible.com slash twit4.  I'm going to go to Audible.com slash twit5.  I loved it.  I actually just started, not finishing.  It's a long book.  Audible.com.  Thank you, Audible.  This is a free book, even for Canadians.  Nice.  That's a great book.  You know, I'm a fan of Audible.  I don't know if you've read it.  I've read it a few times.  I love it.  I'm a fan of Audible.  I'm a fan of Audible.  I'm a fan of Audible.  I'm a fan of Audible.  I love it.  I'm a fan of Audible.  I love it.  It's a great book.  Audible.com.  This is a free book, even for Canadians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nice.  They could use something free because they're stuck paying Rogers all of their money.  There's a joke for you, Canadians.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know, Rogers just did something kind of interesting.  There's no Hulu in Canada, as you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  A tragedy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But they're doing a Canadian Hulu, basically, if you're a Rogers subscriber.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you can see the old episodes of the Beachcombers.  Anything I'm going to refer to is going to make no sense to anyone.  It's Degrassi.  They love Degrassi.  Degrassi.  I love hockey night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Great Cup.  Just thinking of Canadian things.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There's lots of great Canadian things, but I just don't think they're going to...  Corner Gas.  This week has 22 minutes.  Just sent a great comic up to go try to interview Sarah Palin and totally pwned her last week.  It was awesome.  Did she actually do an interview?  Yeah.  Well, she kind of got her mic into her face.  Like outside, she had to run around.  It was awesome.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Who was it?  Was it Jerry or which one?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The one with Marge, the conservative character.  Oh, yeah.  She's good.  She's really good.  She got her to tell conservative Canadians to keep the faith.  We can privatize your healthcare system.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I want to do an update on a story we did on Twig yesterday about Etherpad.  We were talking about...  Right.  There is a good update.  Really good update.  Yeah.  Google's crappy acquisition of Etherpad, which is everybody's...  All the geeks love Etherpad.  It was kind of a collaborative, web-based collaborative editing program.  Google bought them this week and closed them down.  Just with no notice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Why?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What was the point of this?  Why did they buy it or why did they close them down?  They were the engineers.  They bought them because it's a better wave than wave.  They actually needed...

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  So they bought them to close them down so they could make their stuff so there would  be no competition.  This is illegal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Exactly.  I don't know.  Maybe they wanted the engineers.  I thought the same thing.  But in any event, they obviously heard the moans because Google and the Etherpad folks  have said, okay, sorry.  Whoops.  My bad.  My bad.  They say, we're going to plan to open source the code to Etherpad, the underlying AppJet  web framework.  We're going to continue maintaining new pad creation.  They've turned on new pad creation again until we've open sourced it.  And we're working with the Google Wave team to get all Etherpad users a chance to try  out Google Wave within the next couple of weeks.  So talk about making it good.  Complete turn on the time.  I saw a few people's comments saying, well, we'll see if they really open source it.  But at least Etherpad lives on and you can still use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What was the primary way that people were using Etherpad?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, there's a lot of ways.  Programmers were using it to do coding.  Writers were using it.  There was a lot of really interesting, innovative ways to use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It sounded like from what Gina was saying yesterday was almost having more success than  Google Wave in the sense that people really...  And I don't know how four or five people could work on a blog post together at the same time,  but apparently they were.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It was very cool stuff.  It was a web-based sub-Ether.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it's good that they responded quickly to the backlash.  Google did.  It's amazing.  Yeah.  Maybe they will see the twig yesterday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We give them props for that.  Speaking of flops, the cable card, FCC now says, yeah, it didn't work so well.  Boy, I have to say Julius Genachowski again on the side of the angels on this one, the  cable companies in the US offer a cable card which would allow you to use your computer  or maybe a cable card enabled TV and bypass the set-top box, give you the functionality  built into the hardware that you don't want an extra box, right?  But the cable companies would put it in the back.  They never tell employees about it.  They had to offer it, but boy, they sure didn't offer it willingly.  FCC says, all right, it's been an abysmal failure and they're looking for new ideas  for a new set of rules in order to open access to video streams from cable and they say IPTV operators.  I'm going for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I had a cable card in my, I had the Series 3 TiVo HD for a little while and went through  the cable card setup.  It took, first of all, it took a lot of time for my tech to actually install it.  He kept calling back to the cable operators, getting codes on his magic little box.  And the idea is great because we have so many boxes plugged into our TV.  How smart does a cable box have to be to process video signals and do some two-way interaction  for a program guy that is video on demand?  My Xbox should be able to do it.  My computer should be able to do it.  My Apple TV should be able to do it.  So for a greener world and a more efficient household, we should certainly have this.  But yeah, that didn't quite work out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Because they didn't want it to work out, Baratunde.  They really didn't want it to work out.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm sure there was another more legitimate reason than that, Leo.  These cable guys, one thing they like is...  They're on the side of the angels, yeah.  On the side of the consumer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What do you guys...  Real quickly, we'll wrap up because we got to go.  But what do you think of Comcast buying NBC?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was just thinking that as you were talking about the cable story.  I mean, I guess we're just going to have less and less...  I mean, why, once again?  No.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let them all collapse.  Let them all conglomerate and merge.  I don't care.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's a good thing.  It says Leo from his central cottage of power.  I've got my studio.  I don't need them, baby.  I mean, the thing is, this is really the future for them.  And they have no idea that this is happening.  Do they even know that you're happening?  Like something...  No.  This is working?  No idea.  You have a working media business that you're happy with with an awesome army of people  you're responsive to and you do a great job.  And this is not what they're thinking about at all.  No, they're thinking...  Because how can they make money off of this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  How can we merge Comcast and NBC?  It's crazy.  John, any thoughts on them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I like the idea.  I think it's about...  What happened to my...  What is this color?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're in the special zone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You're in the dark room.  So anyway, I think...  John's in the fifth circle of hell, actually.  NBC has got problems.  They need to merge with somebody.  Comcast likes the idea of having content.  I don't see that as a big deal.  I think of nothing else, it'll probably change the politics of NBC a little bit so they won't  be so ultra-liberal.  But for the most part, I don't think it's going to make much of a difference.  Is Roberts...  There were boneheads running NBC.  They put this Leno every day of the week.  I mean, give me a break on this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  By the way, that's been a huge flop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  That's shocking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sorry.  Isn't Leno beloved?  Isn't he like Johnny?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Not by any more by comics, anyway.  He end-stopped with the funny a while ago, but he was like the late night...  He played nice.  He was too nice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  He was like me.  He was like the Leo of late night.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  No, no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's different nice?  Different nice.  You're actually relevant, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  The Achilles heel on the Leno show is the fact that...  It wasn't portable, was it?  ...a 10 o'clock spot across the board taking legitimate dramas off the air, which pay the  bread and butter for a lot of actors and actresses and directors.  So they boycotted him.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, that's interesting.  John, they want to get rid of actors and actresses if you haven't been watching television free  TV for a while.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Are we excited about Avatar, speaking of no actors and actresses?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I don't know if it's good.  I'm going to go.  Of course, Niagara Falls.  John, am I from my hometown?  John Cameron?  I don't know.  I hope so.  Is John Cameron from Niagara Falls?  He is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  There's like three people from my hometown.  If it turns into gnarly, then I'll hate tweet it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Otherwise, I'll happy tweet it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I won't make a habit of live hate tweeting movies in their opening weekend because that  is a good way to make enemies of the world.  I didn't care because Twilight can't be spoiled any further than it already is.  On the Comcast deal, I actually really don't care.  I think what I care more about is Apple buying Lala, which was just confirmed today.  So I'll just throw in my last second thought on that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple buys, I haven't used Lala.  If any of you use Lala, it's a music service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm a huge champion of Lala.  So you must be sad today.  I'm happy if they continue to exist because maybe they get much needed money.  I'm sad because Apple is not the most open company.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Describe Lala.  What is Lala?  Is it like Rhapsody?  What is it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Is it like Last FM?  Lala is a couple of interesting things.  So the first thing it does is it mirrors your local iTunes collection in the cloud by two  methods.  So they do instances for millions of tracks.  So they just do a quick check to see if they already have it.  Now you have web access to it, including all your playlists.  If they don't have it, then they'll upload it in the background from your computer.  So think of it as a portable, streamable access to your personal iTunes library.  Wow, this is a throwback.  Is that they let you buy web only access to songs for 10 cents.  So you don't necessarily want to own the file, but you want web access to the song.  I'm always online at home.  Why do I need an MP3 file?  I can stream it.  So for 10 cents, I can buy the rights to play that song an infinite amount of times.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Infinite times for 10 cents?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Infinite times for, well, until Apple bought them.  Now I don't know what happens to that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So I think they want them to put them out of business or they want to some.  I think they want to take that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I mean, isn't it like they actually executed Mobile Me for music properly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, they did agree.  I mean, they made iTunes better, which is what Apple has failed to do in so many ways.  So I think they're integrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think Apple, I mean, the other people I know got bought by Apple that integrated.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Apple's not notorious for acquisitions.  When they buy something, they use it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They really use them.  Yeah, they'll use it, which is good for us.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Woohoo.  Lala for everybody.  Right on.  Lala.  What I've done often, I'll do like crowdsource playlists.  So I'll just ask folks like, hey, I'm looking for a sad song.  What do you think?  And so I ended up getting over 120 submissions, cost $12 to build it, share it back out to  the world.  Boom, instant playlist shared.  And you can embed those things.  I don't mean to do a commercial for Lala, but I really do like the service.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm glad we talked about it.  I don't know.  I think we have to absorb the, I don't even know.  Has it confirmed that they did or is it still just a rumor that they did?  I thought it was confirmed that they did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The New York Times confirmed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The Times has confirmed it.  All right.  So we'll talk about it on MacBreak Weekly on Tuesday once we've absorbed it a little  bit.  All right, Tunde, thank you so much for being here.  Really appreciate it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So there won't be any tech in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There'll be tech in it.  There won't be defragging in it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No defragging involved.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  But if you'd like to build apps or a platform that maybe really works where people can connect  with each other, understanding how coming people before the system, serving people,  better us than us serving the robots, yes.  It's the future.  It's the anti-Matrix show.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The future is here now.  John C. Dvorak.  Guys, if you don't watch the video, you're missing something.  I don't know what.  Please watch.  What happened?  Live.twit.tv.  He's turned bright red.  In fact, his whole environment is turned by red.  He's in a dark room, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  But how come the microphone's the right color?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, John.  You're messing with us and we don't like it one cotton-picking bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's because of something in the cameras, not me at all.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John C. Dvorak at channeldvorak.com.  Of course, dvorak.org slash blog.  You can catch him on no agenda.  Tech5, Cranky Geeks.  And there's somebody who looks a lot like him as if he were old and had a long beard  on the Tech Grouch.  Tech Grouch, that guy.  All of that's at channeldvorak.com.  I hate that guy.  Oh, he's a pleasure, Leo.  Thank you, sir.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Thank you all for being here.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Don't forget the Twitch survey at twit.tv will help us understand our audience better  so that our advertisers can extract more coin from you.  And that's very important to me because I want to be the richest man on the internet.  Actually, you know what I did this week?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You want to be the richest man on the internet, seriously.  You're going to smack down Gary Vee.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, you know what I did this week that's actually counter to that?  We've taken for a long time, we've asked for contributions to Twitch.  In fact, that's how we got started for the first two years.  We had no advertisers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm going to do the same thing, tunnel vision.  I think it's a brilliant idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We had no advertisers at all and it really got the network started.  But then we started getting advertising.  Because we have advertising now, people have asked, well, what is the role of a contribution  in an ad-supported network?  And I thought, well, you're right.  It's kind of muddied.  I mean, certainly the money we very much appreciate is very helpful to us, but it's not clear  where it's going.  So I decided this is what I'm going to do.  I'm going to stop taking a salary from Twitch entirely.  I didn't take much out to begin with, but I'm not going to take any money out of Twitch.  All that money will continue to pay the staff, improve the infrastructure, pay for bank,  and with all the other existing costs with doing this kind of thing.  And my salary will be paid by you directly through your contributions.  So from now on, when you do contribute to Twitch, you can either give us one time a  couple of bucks or there are two, five, and $10 a month recurring subscriptions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Do they get special prizes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They get nothing but the goodness of knowing that they're keeping me off the streets.  Nice.  So, and if you hate Twitch, please use this as an opportunity to send a signal by canceling  your contribution or taking money out of the kitty.  No, we don't have a way to do that yet.  That would be kind of interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo, can I throw something in here really quick?  Sure.  I've been a $2 a month subscriber for many years.  Thank you.  So I hope you can buy some cup of noodles with that.  Thank you.  And I want to just publicly thank the chat room because they saved me on the sound.  They're the ones who figured out what was going on.  So IRC lives and is strong.  I love you guys.  The chat room is phenomenal.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I really think you guys are great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't get enough credit really.  They're always there.  There's 823 people in there.  If you are listening to Twitch or any of our shows as downloads, we do encourage you once  in a while to stop by live.twit.tv.  You can watch it happen live before we edit out all the bad stuff.  And you can be part of the chat room.  And we watch the chat room the whole time and interact with it.  So that chat room is IRC.twit.tv, but you'll find all the links at live.twit.tv.  This show is done every Sunday at 3pm Pacific, 6pm Eastern, which is 2300 UTC.  But we have shows all week long.  And the chat room is always there.  We really appreciate it.  Thank you everybody.  We appreciate your being here.  Thank you for listening.  And thank you for keeping me off the street.  Another Twitch.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah.  Round the board.  Alright.
