Transcript:  Let us also go with this. This is going to be an international show. Maybe  Carrie Swisher might join us from Germany a little later on. She's headed  towards Switzerland.  Apparently they're nearby.  Joining us right now from Toronto, Canada, Matthew Ingram, writer for Giga Ohm.  Hey Matthew.  Hey, how are you doing? Very well. Thank you for joining us. Good to have you.  This is kind of starting...  And I guess the Rogers data cap has been reached. Oh no, that's good.  Matthew's also a regular on TNT, so he's trying to turn it into a TNT fest.  Also here we're very glad to have from South Africa, Simon Dingle. Hey Simon.  Hello. Simon's a podcaster and you're at...  Right? What's the name of your show?

Start time: 187.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  ZE Tech Show.  That's the podcast I do.  I'm also a technology editor at Fernwick Magazine in Johannesburg. I should probably mention them.

Start time: 195.04
End time: 234.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should give them a little plug, why not?  And only Matthew knows what ZE is, because he's from Canada.  We say Z here in America.  ZE-A.  So great to have you all.  I think this is your first time on Twitter, both Matthew and Simon, am I right?  It is, yeah.  I mean you've been on the network obviously, but it's your first time on  this show.  Don't worry, it'll be painless, it'll be easy. John C. Dvorak isn't here, so you're okay.  Apparently there's a football game going on.  That's why we wanted to do an international show.  We figured if we got people from around the world, they wouldn't care that there was a big football game.

Transcript:  People who play rugby.  Actually, I will not be here in two weeks. You'll be hosting the show, Tom, because I'm on my cruise.  Because you're going to be watching football? Oh, on the cruise.  Now, Eileen wrote me this note, and I find it cryptic, but perhaps you can explain, since you seem to know her better than I.  Matthew has one T.  Matthew has one T.  That's what it's supposed to be. The little smiley face is an arrow.

Start time: 261.80

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does she not afford the other T?  I can't decide.  This was the week of CEO bingo, and I cannot decide which is the bigger story.  Steve Jobs saying, I'm going to step down because of health temporarily once again.  Or the real shocker that we got on Thursday when during their earnings call, Google announced that Eric Schmidt was stepping up.

Start time: 300.86
End time: 306.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I would say Eric Schmidt's the bigger shocker.  Maybe Steve Jobs going on medical leave is the bigger news.

Start time: 307.18
End time: 325.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'll tell you what the stock market reaction was.  Google stock went up a couple of bucks.  Apple stock went down like the 5 percent.  So that tells you something.  Obviously, the stock market believes that Steve Jobs is a lot more important to Apple than Eric Schmidt is to Google.  I bet we'd all agree.  Matthew?

Start time: 326.98
End time: 346.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I would definitely agree.  I was just going to say that Google's always been run as sort of a triumvirate.  You know, Larry and Sergey have been in the background a bit.  Eric's been the front man, but they've been involved in all the decisions.  Certainly Larry Page has.  So I don't think losing Eric or having him move up is really that huge a deal.

Start time: 347.56
End time: 350.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It might be.  Well, OK.  Was he fired?

Start time: 352.94
End time: 366.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Certainly.  I mean, Ken Auletta says he was effectively fired or that, you know, mutual decision or whatever.  It sounds like they kind of that Larry wanted to step into that role and Eric was happy to move.

Start time: 366.60
End time: 390.23
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Happy or no choice.  Or not so happy.  He got a hundred million dollar bonus.  So that's that make me happy.  He's worth billions as it is.  You know, that takes some of the sting out of it.  We were we talked about this when it happened.  It sure felt to me, especially the tweet that Eric Schmidt put out, that adult supervision no longer needed felt a little bitter, a little.  What do you think, Simon?

Start time: 391.70
End time: 423.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, the bigger news for me was the results that came out of both of those companies now.  You know, Google's looking good, but nowhere near as good as Apple at this moment in time.  And if you look at which CEO did more things for their company in the recent months, then you have to go with with jobs as departure being of more weight to his company than perhaps Schmidt for Google.  Google, I mean, the results are good, but they they haven't been hitting it out of the park like Apple has did in the last quarter.

Start time: 423.28
End time: 434.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, there is one difference, which is that Steve could come back, but Eric probably won't.  I think Steve probably won't.  But we don't know.  I mean, we don't we can't tell and I don't want to speculate.

Start time: 435.66
End time: 483.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  All the stuff that I've been reading and hearing about implies that this is not a negative move.  It's not a firing for Eric Schmidt.  It's something that they expected to happen, but that there that it rose out of the dispute over China, that it started when Eric Schmidt said we need to stay in China.  And Sergey and Larry said, no, Eric, we're not we're not going to censor anymore.  This was a bad move. We shouldn't have done it.  That was last year, though. That was a full year ago that that decision.  And that this idea of Larry eventually taking over has always been in the works.  It's just this is the thing that pushed them to decide to do it now.  And so maybe there's a little bit of frustration, but that these guys actually all do get along.  And Eric Schmidt has always felt like, you know what, I need to be involved in order to get people to give the company respect until Larry can come in and take over.

Start time: 484.08
End time: 496.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I have to think it has a little bit to do, though, with Eric Schmidt's kind of infelicitous.  I mean, the things he said, I wasn't in Gadget or Gizmodo that published the top 10 stupid things that Eric Schmidt has said.

Start time: 497.32
End time: 500.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I mean, he was really an inspiring speaker I've ever seen.

Start time: 500.20
End time: 503.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And when he and when he does say something, he puts his foot in his mouth, doesn't he say?

Start time: 503.76
End time: 505.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, right.  Humor does not go over.

End time: 521.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I saw him speaking in Barcelona last year.  I lost it about 15 minutes and I had to leave.  It was just so dull. So boring.  This is because he didn't say anything stupid.  Well, yeah, exactly.  I just found him incredibly uninspiring.

Start time: 522.00
End time: 547.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John Gruber of Daring Fireball Nut Nets said Eric Schmidt was the creep executive officer at Google.  So some of Eric Schmidt's creepiest quotes.  I think judgment matters.  If you have something that you don't want anyone to know, maybe you shouldn't be doing it in the first place when asked whether Google invaded people's privacy.  It was a joke.  Yeah.  Oh, I'm laughing. I'm howling.

Start time: 547.60
End time: 566.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you don't like Google Street View, we drive exactly once so you can just move, right?  That's a joke.  That was a joke.  That's obviously a joke.  But at this point, he said so many other crazy things.  Well, exactly.  He made number three on my top five stupidest statements from Tech Big Wigs.  That's pretty good.

Start time: 591.58
End time: 607.85
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  Maybe he does.  In fact, his last acts, he's going to be out April 4th or two petition governments to go to Washington to go to governments around the world.  And fight for Google.  Maybe that's the job.  Maybe he's the suit in DC.

Start time: 609.00
End time: 632.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, Kevin Marks said on Tech News Today that they've had this plan that they've talked about in the past that they would all stay together through 2024.  None of them would leave.  So we'll know if this is a firing or not, if that plan falls apart and Eric Schmidt actually leaves in a year, or if he sticks around as executive chairman and keeps  pounding the pavement up on the hill.

Start time: 635.38
End time: 676.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You've got to think, though, that it's a little weird.  It's kind of upstream.  Very common in a tech company.  You've got the founders, they run it.  They bring in venture capitalists who say, no, you've got to have a professional manager.  They bring in a professional manager.  That was Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Novell.  But you never see it go the other direction where the professional manager then moves on and the kids come back and run the show.  That's a little unusual to have the founders running the place.  Although I have to think that Larry Page probably is the right person to run Google if anybody's going to run it.  Look what happened with Steve Jobs.  Steve Jobs, when he was forced out of Apple, the company tanked.  He comes back and turns it around.

Start time: 676.84
End time: 683.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But that's the question, right?  Is this like Steve Jobs in 1997 or is this like Jerry Yang in 2007?

Start time: 684.78
End time: 687.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jerry became CEO because nobody would take the job.

Start time: 689.18
End time: 692.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They have validly said he's not keeping it.  Don't freak out, stock market.

Start time: 693.04
End time: 695.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They were dying to find somebody, but nobody wanted it.

Start time: 697.18
End time: 704.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  But I think there's also some pressure for Larry.  I'm wondering whether this is a job he wants to do or if this is a job he kind of has to do.

Start time: 704.96
End time: 735.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think he wants to do it.  I would guess, first of all, he doesn't have to do anything.  He can walk away.  He's got plenty of money.  He's got more than one jet.  He's got a yacht.  I mean, he's fine.  He's done.  He's got a yacht.  He just bought a $45 million yacht, right?  He doesn't need the job.  So he could walk away.  I think this is what Larry probably always wanted to do.  I think Larry may have been saying, OK, I'm going to watch Eric.  I'm going to learn.  I'm going to study business.  And then I'm going to come back when it's time.

Start time: 736.40
End time: 747.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  There have been suggestions actually that he was getting a little not bent out of shape,  but that he wanted a bit more public profile.  Oh, that's interesting.  He was basically hogging the spotlight.

Start time: 747.32
End time: 764.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And not doing such a good job.  I mean, remember that ice cream truck ad that they showed at Times Square?  That wasn't good for anybody.  And maybe that way, maybe that way.  I remember Eric was very hurt by that.  Maybe he said to Larry, I can't take it anymore.  I want out.  Seems unlikely, doesn't it?

Start time: 765.66
End time: 776.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder though.  You know, Larry, the thing about Larry is we really don't know very much about him.  I mean, he's had virtually no public profile.  So we don't really know.

Start time: 777.28
End time: 778.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We know he's very smart.

Start time: 779.56
End time: 787.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  We know he's very smart.  We know that for sure.  But what is he going to be like as a sort of the public figure that you are when you're  in a CEO job?

Start time: 789.10
End time: 808.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Well, that's what I meant by had to do.  I mean, you'd expect one of the founders to kind of I mean, with with Eric going away,  everybody's going to wonder who's going to take over.  And that's why I get the feeling Larry kind of has to be that guy, because, you know,  I don't know who would be the other runners for that job.

Start time: 811.60
End time: 863.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Let's talk about Steve Jobs as long as we're in this and a very interesting post by John  Brownlee writing for Cult of Mac makes a pretty strong case that Apple knew Steve was going  to leave when he was going to leave.  In fact, may have planned it all along.  He says since 2007, Apple's always chosen to report earnings during the last week of  the month.  You know, there's some technical reasons why that's the best time for 14 quarters.  Apple has used the last week of the month.  They moved it.  In fact, they moved it to right after a three day weekend.  And it sounds like they knew Jobs was going to announce that he was going to take a leave  of absence.  He did it right before the three day weekend, giving the market three days to cool.  He says at minimum plans must have been drawn at least since mid December, maybe even  earlier.

Start time: 864.72
End time: 897.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think that makes sense.  And I think the tip off is that Steve Jobs did not show up at the Verizon announcement,  which at the time I thought, well, of course he's not.  It's not their announcement. Why wouldn't he?  But if you kind of back through it, if he were starting to feel ill and planning to  take medical leave, that does take some planning.  And I think he says, look, I'm not going to be doing that, Tim, you go out to do that.  They also postponed the Hearst announcement, which was set to take place last week.  The Murdoch announcement.  Yeah, I'm sorry. The Murdoch.  The Daily. That's right.

Start time: 897.42
End time: 903.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Jobs was supposedly going to go to the Museum of Modern Art with Rupert Murdoch.  They didn't really say why that was postponed.  Now we know.

Start time: 904.16
End time: 911.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, exactly. And so I think I think they did know this, you know, maybe a month ago  or more.

Start time: 911.28
End time: 921.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Isn't it weird that in the analysts call, both the Google and the Apple analysts call,  the analysts are asking all sorts of questions not once in the Apple analyst call that they  ask a thing about Steve's health.

Start time: 922.80
End time: 939.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think it's because at this point it's become a personal issue.  And it's also obvious.  And they're like, you know what, they're not going to tell us anything we don't really  know. They knew they wouldn't get an answer.  The only answers they really want to know are is he coming back and when?  And there's no answers to that right now.  They don't think, though, it's material.

Start time: 939.50
End time: 960.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, if you're an investor in Apple and Apple's saying invest in us and you're  the CEOs, who's very clearly more than any company I can think of in history, the most  important person at that company, and he's leaving.  Don't you think that as an investor, you should know at least everything Apple knows?  Maybe they don't know anything.

Start time: 961.12
End time: 1009.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think so. I think so.  In fact, that's why I was hoping that Kara was going to be on so she and I could have a  fight about it, because she's been arguing that, you know, it's it's none of our business.  It's a personal thing.  You know, Steve is sick.  We should respect his privacy.  And I totally agree with all that.  But at the same time, your point is a good one.  This man is more intimately connected to the value of that company than just about  anyone else I can think of.  And so it is a it is a crucial fact for investors to take into account what is happening  with him. And Apple has been totally non forthcoming with that information.  It isn't until basically people beat them up publicly that they're willing to admit that  something's going on, which I find troubling.

Start time: 1011.18
End time: 1020.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I just say you're a publicly held company if you if you.  You know, if you're not public, you could do anything you want.  But if you're publicly held, I don't think you have the you know.

Start time: 1021.28
End time: 1024.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  But what are they going to say?  I mean, they've said he's going out on medical leave.

Start time: 1024.62
End time: 1029.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And we know what I guess it presumes they know more about than they're saying.  Maybe they don't. You're right.

Start time: 1029.58
End time: 1049.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  At this point, the analysts would would want to ask, like, well, how serious is it?  Right. You know, it's we all know.  I think so.  A legitimate question.  I'm guessing that the analysts know that it's serious.  They know there's a chance he won't come back.  And because we've been through this a couple of times and they may even have some  inside knowledge from friends, in which case there's really no point to asking any  more questions. Right.

Start time: 1050.16
End time: 1059.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well, we could we could at least try.  I mean, last time they didn't even admit that he was sick enough to require a liver  transplant until after the fact.

Start time: 1059.54
End time: 1061.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They don't have exactly the best track record of of.

Start time: 1062.62
End time: 1067.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah. So I think we're right to be suspicious that perhaps they know more than  they're saying. Right.

Start time: 1068.32
End time: 1070.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, they were talking about analysts versus journalists, too.

Start time: 1071.62
End time: 1083.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, but those are the ones who should ask the questions.  Yeah. The analysts are trying to gauge the value of Apple so they can make a  recommendation for their customers.  Don't you think whether Steve's is coming back is everything to that question?

Start time: 1084.16
End time: 1092.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently not. You know, you hear from analysts on calls all the time.  Great quarter. Right.  That's their first question.  Like, that's that's what you get from a lot of these guys are tame.

Start time: 1093.40
End time: 1118.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  In other words, they're they're they're in the pockets of the companies.  That's why I don't like to get too too close to these companies, because.  You don't want to, you know, I mean, you have to be a little brutal to say, well,  Steve, are you OK?  I mean, this is brutal.  You know, he says, I want privacy and you have to be a little brutal to say.  Well, yeah, but OK, are you coming back?  Are you dying? That's brutal.  It's mean. I almost hate to bring it up.  But at the same time, it's germane.

Start time: 1120.32
End time: 1121.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And that's that's what a journalist does.

Start time: 1122.48
End time: 1124.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, journalists are, you know what I'm saying?

Start time: 1124.88
End time: 1127.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, they're asking a lot of questions.

Start time: 1129.58
End time: 1131.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And if they're not, they're not doing their job.

Start time: 1132.08
End time: 1134.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They're asking whole questions.

Start time: 1134.10
End time: 1186.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  That's why people hate journalists, by the way. Yeah.  All right. But, you know, hey, OK, let me say this.  I mean, Steve is a problem.  One of the most important people in our industry.  Without Steve, we probably, you know, I don't know what would have happened  in the personal computer industry.  He he launched the most important products in the personal computer industry,  including the Apple one, the Apple two, the laser writer, the Macintosh,  the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad.  I mean, this is an amazing track record.  A lot of credit where credit's due, and that's why it's important.  And he'll be missed.  And I don't want to write his obituary today, so we're not going to.  Let's hope he's you know, he gets better and he comes back  because I think we need him.  Now, Apple did sell 10 billion.  Apps.

And she didn't.  That's right. And so just assumed that this was some kind of telemarketer.  You're talking about. Oh, yeah.  Of course, I've already won. Thanks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So so what's amazing is that 10 billion downloads in two and a half years.  In the last year alone, seven billion apps are downloaded.  And, you know, you've got to think that the app store, the new app store  on on Macintosh is going to be equally popular.  And and it's the appification.  Of computing, right?  I mean, this is this is what this is what the world loves.  They love being able to push a button and install.

Transcript:  Interesting thing is it takes me all the way back to  the way I was installing applications in Linux like eight years ago, right?  From a central repository where it was kept updated.  And now finally, I can I can do that on my Mac.  I wonder if they're using apt get in the background.  I was going to say, yeah, it's apt get.

Transcript:  They probably are. And and look, it's, you know, the update.  So here's, you know, and I check this periodically and there's an update  and you just do it. It's very easy.  But there's a few issues.  There's a couple of things I'll tell you that are different.  Oh, now I have to enter my password. Excuse me.  There are a couple of things that are different from Linux.  For one thing, there seems to be some consensus that the  it's the app stores inconsistent with the GPL.  In which in which case you ain't going to be seeing  any of them Linux apps on here anytime.  That's the problem with VLC getting you.

End time: 1384.93
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, I don't want to sound whiny because I complain about this all the time.  But it just seems to me that this unfortunately is everybody loves it.  Developers love it.  Users love it.  Apple loves it because they get 30 percent of everything that's sold.  And the only people don't like it are cranky open source advocates like me  who say, this is not right.

Start time: 1385.64
End time: 1409.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But I'm not sure developers.  I mean, I think developers have a sort of love hate relationship  with the Apple App Store, at least some do, because they get virtually  no communication from Apple.  I mean, it's your app is denied.  You know, it's like the Wizard of Oz. Your app is denied. Why?  Get just get out of here. Stop talking. Don't ask.  We don't have to tell you.  Submit it again and try and correct the things that we didn't tell you were wrong.

Start time: 1410.30
End time: 1445.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  Submit it again. But do they not approve 97 percent of all software  submitted to the store within one week?  Is that what the I mean, are you reading from a press release, Simon?  That was that was that was the claim.  I just it's so strange that we've we've entered this realm  where you can buy software that is taken however long to develop for one dollar.  And people are OK with it not being trials because I'll just buy five  one dollar applications and find one that works OK for me.  And are we going to see the same thing happen on the Mac?  I mean, did you see what Apple launched Aperture at on the $80?  It was like, yeah, $80.

Start time: 1446.44
End time: 1467.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I mean, it's it's a it's a $200 off.  I didn't even need it and I bought it.  I just thought that's a deal.  And it's one freaking click, which is really what gets you in trouble.  It's too easy. I do like and I have to say it again.  I think we're going to get Matthew back.  Rogers has disconnected him as I knew they would.  Rogers likes Apple. Yeah.

Start time: 1468.04
End time: 1482.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So saying no, you're not allowed to do that.  And Rogers is getting involved. No, you can't do that.  But I I think that the the app store on the phone is has much more of an impact  on our lives than the app store on the on the laptop.

Start time: 1483.94
End time: 1501.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think I do think that because you can install, you know, $80  and it's installed on apparently, I don't know if there's a limit on all your app,  on your all your Macs.  And so, you know, I have a laptop, a desktop, a desktop at work, a laptop.  That's four machines and I just I can install it.  I don't think there's a limit.  So, I mean, that's that's a really good deal.

Start time: 1501.74
End time: 1524.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a good deal. There's no doubt about that.  But there's also the same problems you have with with the app store  that you wouldn't have if you if you just had a free open source software.  Right. You know, which is, oh,  I can install that on my machine, but then I have to be logged in as me to  authorize it.  So if I want to put it on Eileen's machine, well, then I have to go  log into my version of the app store and I'll, you know, even though she's in my family.

Start time: 1524.08
End time: 1546.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And I had an issue because I had different accounts, different iTunes accounts,  and I foolishly downloaded a program under one account  and then logged into the other account.  And now I have to log into a different account anytime I want to update.  It's very annoying.  But those are little minor things.  I think my fear is that it's too good.  It's so good, it's going to eat up the ecosystem for regular applications.  And that's too bad.

Start time: 1547.94
End time: 1561.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  And that is looking more blindslide than ever.  It is it is just so easy.  I mean, I bought a MacBook Air for somebody who works with me  and just getting up and running and starting to install applications now  with the app store, it's ridiculous how simple things have become.

Start time: 1562.08
End time: 1577.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean, that's good.  That's one of the reasons developers love it. Right.  Yeah. It's like, wow, sure, we've got all these restrictions  and we might get rejected, but it's so easy to develop for.  And it's so difficult for other platforms.  I'm speaking more in the mobile space here than the desktop.  But I think it's going to I think that's going to translate.

I haven't talked about this in a while.  If you if you think remote access to your PC or Mac is too complicated for you,  think again, Go To My PC makes it as easy as can be.  I wonder how long before they start doing this kind of thing in the app store.  I know it's pretty easy.  You just go to go to my PC dot com slash tweet  and download it in about two seconds. You've got it.  The advantage is it is always up to date, which I love.  And you can use it for free for the next 30 days when you go to that particular spot.  Go to my PC dot com slash tweet. What will happen?  Will you install it? Just take a second or two.  Now, wherever you go. And I'm going on vacation.  I'm so thrilled. I've got this at anywhere you go.  As long as you can get online.  You log in, go to my PC dot com with your account and there's your computer.  You can do anything you could do if you were at work.  You could send and receive emails, access any network resource, run programs.  It couldn't drag and drop files from one computer to the other. Couldn't be easier.  It is as simple as can be.  And it's a great product from the folks at Citrix who make great products.  Go to my PC dot com slash tweet.  I'm going to be in South America, February 1st through the 21st.  I have four speeches to give and I will make sure that, you know,  all the relevant material is on a computer with Go to My PC.

Yeah, I think it's more of the. Yeah.  But that's a good way to run Windows on a Mac, actually.  Come to think of it, I put I put  the keynote speeches on my MacBook Air, but also my iPad.  So I have like I can I can do the presentation.  But you know, it's kind of it's kind of a nice way to do a keynote  or presentation is on an iPad because it's the touch is really good.  It's kind of natural.  You just touch the screen and you go, it's just kind of natural.  It's also a great way to modify it.  Touch is good for certain apps.  That's that's an app where I was actually very pleased to see  how good touch was for for slideshows.

The beginning of every show, I had to get from this part of the set to that part of the set.  There was a big pole, the camera couldn't go around it.  So we just said, well, just walk around the pole.  So if you ever see the show, I'm going, hey, welcome to the show.  And then I walk and there's Basil, the cameraman, who has to back up into a corner so I can get by.  There's the pole, there's the cameraman, and let's get the show on the road.

So they created a board seat in the process,  but they essentially took everyone who had any kind of involvement in the investigation  of Mark Hurd and got them off the board so that they can create a new investigation  of people independent to look into what actually happened, what they told Mark Hurd  because Mark Hurd is disputing some things and they want to get to the bottom of it.

We don't want anyone who was involved in getting rid of him investigating this.  And the only two people who weren't is Leo Appletecker, the current CEO,  and one other board member, Ray Lane.

So they believe they're going to get, I mean, you know, that could be anything from eight hours  to five hours, but I, you know, if they get five hours, isn't that enough?

Like, am I really going to carry that and an iPhone or a really big Android phone?  I just, the keyboards are too small at seven inch to be functional.  I can type perfectly happily on an iPad at 10 inches or nine inches or whatever.  Well, but some people get down to seven.

It's not a, it's not a, but you know, the keyboards,  even on an iPad as big as it is, is still not a good,  could you feel comfortable typing on that for any length of time?

Like a laptop, Firefox browser. And then anything you can do in a browser.  It's Chromium.  Which you can do a lot.  It's CR48. It's Chrome OS.  You can do in that Firefox.  And then all of your actual phone apps and everything are available,  but they're available in a smaller window.  It's not actually turning the phone into a full laptop.

Transcript:  I think that's kind of cool though.  Cause you have a little inset window that is your phone size and that's kind of still there.  I know.  You could just use a Bluetooth keyboard.  Yeah. I don't, to be honest, I don't think that, I think this is cool,  but I don't think it's going to be a hot seller.  I do think the idea of dual processors is going to make these things very compelling.  The one thing iPad 2 will have of all the rumored stuff is a camera and a dual core processor.  I don't think it's going to have a higher res screen.  I don't think it's going to be much smaller because you need the battery space.  And it's not like there have been any breakthroughs in lithium ion technology this year.

End time: 2898.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, I'm not saying it won't be higher resolution, but it won't be a retina display.  It would add too much to the price.  Apple has to keep it at 500, too.  It's not just Motorola that has to hit 500.  Apple has to hit 500.  They've set that as a benchmark.  And they're running out of displays right now.  Kevin Rose very coyly Instagrammed a text message conversation.  Didn't say who it was from.  Didn't cut off all the rel...  All of it said was it will not be a double...  iPad 2 will not have a double resolution display.

But I think it's going to be later than we think.  I did speak to an accessory manufacturer pretty close to Apple.  And they claim to have cases ready to go for the iPad 2.  And I saw a picture one of these cases.  And it had on the one corner, it had like...  I need to go to inches now, right?  So like an inch and a half slot opening that kind of looked like about the size of...  On the original MacBook Air, the flip down USB port.  But it could have just been the SD card slot.  I don't know.  I don't know if I believe that.

Because they make a lot of iPhone accessories.  What the form factor says, no, we get it the same day you get it.  And we scramble to modify our designs.  So I wonder if all...  I'm pretty sure that's the way it works.  Yeah, we saw a lot of iPad 2 cases.  But I mean, I think what they're saying is, hey, when there's an iPad 2, we will have a case.

Now we have listeners all over the world.  In fact, we have hosts from Canada and South Africa tonight.  So I should mention that the books that we recommend on audible.com are US, sometimes US only.  The publishing world is still very national.  But Audible is all over the world and there are great books on every Audible  national store.  Great stuff at Audible.  Either .co.uk or probably .co.za or z-a.  Audible.com here in the States.  Audible.ca in Canada.  All over the world.  Just Google Audible and you'll find your local Audible store here in the States.  75,000 books.  And in every category, it is a great place to go.

Many of his books intersect with The Dark Tower series.  I think there's seven books now total and man is it good.  Man is it good.  Now, here's the deal.  I can get you two books for free and I think it's good if you're going to get two books for free  to read a series.  This would be a great one to start with.  The Dark Tower series, the first book in the series is The Gunslinger.  It's a nice easy way into it.  Although, in some ways, this one's kind of slow because he's just chasing the man in black.  Yeah, but it has such an atmosphere.

I mean, if you like being sucked into that mysterious world where you're  learning about this strange off-kilter universe that Stephen King has created,  you're going to love it.  Have you done this on Sword and Laser yet?  Are you thinking about it?  No.  We've used it as a, we have Audible as a sponsor there and we've used it as a pick,  but we haven't done it as a book.  Problem is, series like this are hard to do.  Right.  You can't.  Because sometimes you could do the single, like Ender's Game is a series.  You could do Ender's Game.  Just do Ender's Game.  Because it can stand alone.  The Gunslinger, I don't think it really stands alone because as soon as you're done,  you're ready for the next one.  You want to find out what's going to happen next.

You go to audible.com slash twit2 and sign up for the Platinum account.  These subscript, you can get books a la carte.  You can buy books one at a time and they're yours to keep forever.  They become a part of your library.  You can download them at any time, unlike iTunes.  In fact, I just was, I wanted to have a complete set of all the books I've ever listened to  and I just downloaded and completed them all.  And it's almost 500 books I've read in the last 10 years on audible.com.  You know what I love about that?  Those are books I would not have had a time to read, but I was reading in the car at the gym.  Those times when you can't normally read, I get so much reading done.  It just keeps me up on what's going on in the world and I love it.  Fiction, nonfiction, science and technology, sci-fi.  When I first started with audible 10 years ago, they didn't have much sci-fi.  Now they are unparalleled because they've made a very concerted effort with their  audible frontier series to record all the great sci-fi.  There are now almost 4,000 sci-fi and fantasy titles on there.  If you love sci-fi, audible is a great place to know about.  Look, just try it.  Your first two are free.  You can cancel at any time at no cost to you and you can keep them forever.  So we got a couple of things to look at.  Stephen King's Dark Tower series would be a great one.  Or the Void series from Peter F. Hamilton.  audible.com slash twit two.  We thank them for their support.

Transcript:  Comcast NBC merger.  Actually, it's technically a joint venture approved by the Federal Communications Commission  and the Department of Justice, despite the vigorous protests.  Now, I know in Canada and South America, you probably don't even know or care who these people are,  but Comcast, for those who don't know, not only the big cable company in the US,  the single largest internet service provider in the US, and therein lies the rub.  NBC, of course, is one of our big national networks.  The companies together have, Comcast has 16.7 billion, I'm sorry, million broadband subscribers,  23 million cable customers.  They will get MSNBC, CNBC, Bravo USA, as well as NBC.  Four to one approval from the FCC.

Start time: 3494.32
End time: 3503.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  You know, it's weird.  There was also some talk that they were going to require every NBC show to be available on any  video service that ABC, Fox, or their other competitors had videos available for.  The restriction ended up not being quite so tight, but they essentially do have to  offer their shows.

Start time: 3537.50

I'm not bona fide.  But Apple would be.  I think you're bona fide, Liam.  What does bona fide mean?  Faithful bone?  Yes.  Okay, just checking.  Faithful to the bone.

Start time: 3576.80
End time: 3615.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think what happens is that Comcast is essentially a monopoly everywhere it offers internet service.  And because of that, they now can start looking at ways to force you into viewing their content.  In fact, I'm really against a lot of these restrictions that they put on Comcast because  I think the problem is not that Comcast is owning NBC.  The problem is that we don't have a choice.  We can't say, you know what, I don't like the fact that you're forcing me to watch  NBC programs on my ISP or you're blocking Fox or whatever they might do.  And I'm going to go to another internet service provider because if you want anything over  30 megabits per second, you can't go to another internet service provider.  Right.

Start time: 3615.98
End time: 3649.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  FCC also, this is interesting, required Comcast to offer broadband internet access  as a standalone service.  In other words, you can't compel people to buy your cable television.  Which they didn't.  They never did.  But they would charge you 10 bucks more if you didn't have TV at reasonable prices,  which of course that's meaningless, with sufficient bandwidth, also meaningless.  Yes.  So customers can watch video online without having to subscribe to cable TV.  I like the thinking behind this, but I question whether it's enforceable or  even whether the wording...

Start time: 3650.42
End time: 3665.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I was just going to say it's fine to have all those requirements.  Governments do that regularly when they're dealing with companies like Comcast.  But are they going to follow up and make sure that Comcast is doing that?  And if it's not doing that, are they going to come down hard on them?

Start time: 3667.80
End time: 3687.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Comcast can say, well, to find sufficient bandwidth, what is reasonable pricing?  Oh, I mean, Comcast could say, well, reasonable price would be the same price  it would cost you to get HBO.  It costs 100 bucks for your cable bill, we'll give you 100 bucks worth of internet access.  They could easily do that.  That would be reasonable from Comcast's point of view.

Start time: 3687.99
End time: 3692.95
Speaker: SPEAKER_04

Transcript:  He doesn't like it.  He says, Comcast is trying to whack Netflix.  He was talking to Netroots Nation gathering in Minnesota.  He says, net neutrality is the free speech issue of our time.  He said that before and I agree with him.  He does say that the net neutrality rules the FCC has enacted are not strong enough.  He says the FCC is allowing discrimination on the internet.  They will essentially create two internets.  He said this before, but coming up on the Comcast merger, he said,  as you probably know, I hate this merger.  Not only will it raise prices on TV subscriptions, it will give the combined entity  incredible power to stifle competition from online sources like Netflix.  See, Comcast doesn't like Netflix because they ride on Comcast's cheap internet.  You can watch movies there instead of paying for their expensive HBO.  We're going to let Tom Merritt go.

When it comes to content, we are seeing telecommunications companies trying to  develop content strategies because they obviously see that as important going forward.  Those are some of the things we'll discuss on the ZA Tech Show.  We're launching a new website this week.  We're also moving into new studios tomorrow night.  We've decided finally to start doing video properly.  It's something I've been scared of.  I'm a radio guy.  Video is not my forte.  But we're going to start doing that.

I was on Regis on Tuesday and they said, no, we can't tell you when.  We can't tell you how much.  And then they released when and how much.  March 27th, $250.  Then Europe on March 25th.  Actually, it's the other way around.  First Europe, then the US.  I don't know about Canada.  So I looked at this thing.  We had it in my hands.  And did it seem 3D to you, Eileen?  It's what's called lenticular.  So you have to hold it just in a certain...  With a little thing like that, that's not such a big deal.  And then it has a slider that lets you turn up and down the 3D effect.  Yeah, I think it's pretty cool.  It's the same...  Isn't that the same price as the regular DS?  You're getting one.

And these guys are in trouble in the medium term.  I mean, they're doing pretty well at the moment.  But my oldest kid is five.  He's never touched...  I mean, he played with the DS for half an hour and found it slightly amusing.  But he's all about the iPhone and the games that he has there.  And you look at how easily he gets hold of games and what they cost compared to the DS.  Nintendo needs more than 3D to save this in the long term, I think.  Yeah.

And there doesn't seem to be any indication that we're going to see newer systems,  that the systems are going to be improved.  Have we...  I mean, is there any incentive to create a new console at all?  Nintendo, if anybody has that incentive, and yet they were on Christmas,  at least in the States, the best-selling console.

Transcript:  And how old is that Wii hardware?  It's ancient.  It's been around for...  Yeah.  It's not even high-def.  Microsoft's refreshed the Xbox.  They obviously are not thinking about a next-generation console yet.  No, especially with Kinect selling like it does.  Yeah, there's no reason to.  They don't need it.  But you know what I find slightly disheartening is that PC gaming is so far ahead of console  gaming at the moment.  And yet PC gamers are kind of punished in this whole paradigm.  You know, a game will come out for Xbox or PS3, and the PC gamers who've got the serious  hardware or the guys who really invest in gaming with their heart and souls have to  wait months, sometimes longer, for these games to finally come out for their platform.

But also AT&T does not like you bringing unlocked iPhones onto their network.  I had to hack carrier settings and use the iPhone configuration utility to load them.  And eventually I got it going, but it wasn't easy.  And if you just put an AT&T SIM card in an unlocked iPhone like we have in South Africa,  I mean, our iPhone carriers in South Africa you can do tethering with.  They've already said they'll support the Wi-Fi port on the iPhone in 4.3.  And apparently, AT&T does not like all of that happening on the network.  So for a variety of reasons, I just found it really difficult to get my phone  working with a local SIM card in the USA.  I'm very curious.

And if I know in England, you can buy it from everybody, I think.  So I just wonder how long.  So it's Bell, Tellus, and Rogers.  So it's three carriers.  Yeah.  So I just wonder how long before that happens in the States, before T-Mobile has an iPhone.  By the way, let me just correct myself real quickly.  Angry Birds is on Windows.  It's just not on Steam.

Johannesburg.  Johannesburg.  He's at simondingle.com.  And more coming up in just a little bit.  I just want to briefly mention our great friends at squarespace.com.  They say the secret behind exceptional websites and I would concur.  There is no easier way to design a website.  My friend Alex Lindsay is a big Squarespace fan.  A lot of the Pixelcore sites use it.  He loves it so much.  He was in a restaurant.  Asked the restaurant, why don't you have a website?  They said, well, it's too much trouble.  So before he had left the restaurant, he had gone to squarespace.com,  clicked the try it free button, set up a website.  It's very easy.  You don't need a credit card.  Just the site name, password, email address and the capture.  And that's great because he literally did the whole site at dinner and then said,  hey, here's your site.  If you decide you want it, here's the password.  They can go in and they can make it their site.  Now, the reason he could do that so fast is among other things.  These incredible professionally designed styles from name brand designers.  But each of them has point and click control over every single element of the design.  So you can move gutters, move windows, make it absolutely your own.  Alex has become an amazing pro at doing that.  It's fun to watch him.  Then, of course, once you've got that site up and running,  you can watch your stats.  You can use your iPhone or iPad to post and moderate comments.  You can put up beautiful photo galleries, forms.  Very easy to post, very easy to maintain and import  and export all your data from all the major blog APIs,  movable type, WordPress, type pad and blogger.  And that includes not just the content, pictures and text,  but also all the comments and all the links continue to work.  It's a great way to try Squarespace for free.  Go to squarespace.com slash twit, click that green button and do try it for free.  Works with all the social networks.  There's a Flickr photo display, a Twitter widget, Google Maps.  It's just got all the things you'd want.  Because it's hosting plus software, it's always up to date, always secure,  and never goes down no matter how much traffic you send your site  or we send your site.  Squarespace.com slash twit.

And Watson won.  That's amazing.  Well, it is amazing.  And Ray Kurzweil wrote an article for PC Mag that highlights why this is a big deal.  He was the guy who theorized in the mid-1980s that a chess playing computer would eventually  be humans.  He was right.  He actually predicted it would happen in 98.  It happened in 97.  He says the key here is you can say chess is kind of completely mathematical, okay.  But understanding language is much more difficult.  And especially the nuance of a Jeopardy, the way Jeopardy works is a quiz show in which  they give you the answer.  You have to give them the question.  Already that's tough for a computer, right?  It has to be stated in a question form.  And you have to understand context.  You have to understand meaning.  Of course, if the computer can parse the sentence, it's going to win every time because  it's got an infinite database.  Although I don't believe Watson-

But the thing is it had to parse and it had to do it fast because  the humans are sitting there on the button, has to parse that sentence, understand it,  find the answer and then put it out as a question.  I mean, I think that's a hard thing to do.  I think that is kind of, it's not the Turing test, but it's close.

It was a great trip because we also went to the headquarters in Armunk and I got to speak to Sam  Palmisano and Mark Lowridge, the CFO, and just spend some time with IBM and see what they're doing.  I mean, that Watson Research Facility, they are guys working on everything from DNA transistors  to growing carbon nanotubes under electron microscopes to, I mean, the coolest stuff,  if you're a nerd, but it's just amazing the amount of stuff that IBM has done and continues to do.

Transcript:  They made so much money on their patents and they come from that same era as the Xerox Palo Alto  Research Center, PARC, where these big corporations have poured tons of money into blue sky research.  And it's funny because PARC, Xerox very famously invented the GUI, among other things,  but never, and laser printers, but never, and the mouse, but never capitalized on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Google very much wants those 20% projects to reap fruit, although many of them are  in open source and other areas where they can't possibly benefit.  WikiLeaks back in the news.  Swiss whistleblower.  Say that three times fast.  Swiss whistleblower Rudolf Elmer has given WikiLeaks information about bank accounts  of more than 2,000 prominent individuals containing information about tax evasion  and more, according to the BBC.  The data is not yet on WikiLeaks, but Elmer gave two discs to Julian Assange at a press  conference in London earlier this week.  As WikiLeaks traditionally does, they vet the contents before they release it publicly.  Once we've looked at the data, said Assange, there will be full revelation.  The data covers a period from 1990 to 2009, concerns companies and individuals from many  countries, including the UK, US, and Germany.

Start time: 5064.12
End time: 5074.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_08

Transcript:  In the United States, WikiLeaks is, I think, round.  There's massive debate about whether they're traitors and treasonous or whether they're  doing the work of the angels.  Outside of the US, I imagine that...  I know when I was in France for LeWeb that everybody was excoriating the US corporations  for blocking WikiLeaks, for PayPal for shutting them down, Amazon for taking them off EC2.  How do people feel about WikiLeaks in South Africa?

Start time: 5123.91
End time: 5170.54
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I think the debate is the same.  I mean, ethically, everybody wants to say, well, the information should be freely available  and this is in the public interest and we should be able to read this stuff.  But part of you goes, I'm looking at a list of sensitive sites for the USA around the  world.  Maybe publishing that stuff's not so cool, but it's an all or nothing ethical debate.  I kind of tend towards the side of, well, the information should be out there and should  be available and organizations, whether government or private, should be thinking about how they  store things and what they store.  But I can't say I've made up my mind completely.  I think the debate in countries like South Africa is probably the same as it is in the USA.

Start time: 5174.06
End time: 5209.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say so.  I mean, I think there's, you know, my personal view, which I've written about, is that  WikiLeaks to me is a very valuable player now in sort of forcing transparency whether  governments want it or not.  And I think, you know, on the one hand, you could argue, and I'm sure our government feels  that that tends to make it harder to engage in diplomacy, which consists of saying one  thing publicly and saying completely the opposite in private.  And so, you know, maybe that is the case.

Start time: 5209.82

Start time: 5212.14
End time: 5224.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 5225.88
End time: 5249.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, and you know, it's funny because if you take it out of the realm of government  secrets, spying and diplomacy, and you put it into things like Swiss bank accounts,  most people would say, yeah, right on.  Let's see those bank accounts.  There's no debate there.  Yeah, let's find out who's cheating, who's using Swiss bank accounts to shield themselves.  Yeah, you know, the only people who don't like that are the 50 people who are going  to be exposed.

Start time: 5251.00
End time: 5256.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  I just find it interesting that there's a debate around WikiLeaks intentions when really  WikiLeaks is supposed to be as objective as it gets, right?  It's just a platform and what gets shared on it is up to the people sharing that information.  So for me, the notion of going for WikiLeaks and going for Assange is a ridiculous one  where the problem you have is with the people spreading the information, right?  Right.  I don't understand why the platform is like that.  Shoot the messenger.  Yeah.

Start time: 5289.08
End time: 5334.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And it's not just WikiLeaks.  I mean, you've got already one of the people who was involved in WikiLeaks has set up  another organization called OpenLeaks.  Right.  That's going to try and, you know, maybe get away from some of the sort of the fact  that WikiLeaks is all Julian Assange try and be more open, more distributed.  You've got, I think, two or three other similar organizations devoted to different types of  documents.  I just read today that I think the Guardian got a ton of documents from Al Jazeera about  Israel and Palestine.  As far as I know, WikiLeaks isn't involved in that, but it's the same type of phenomenon.  I think you're going to be seeing a lot more of that coming from lots of places,  not just WikiLeaks.

Start time: 5334.62
End time: 5343.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah.  The real problem is that the world is becoming more transparent and there are people who  don't like that.  But I think in the long run, transparency is not a bad thing.

Start time: 5345.85
End time: 5368.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  I guess the problem with WikiLeaks is that, you know, while WikiLeaks itself is not necessarily,  you know, subjective, Assange seems to be.  All the information we see refers to US companies, the US government, and not much from,  I don't know, Russia, Brazil, China, India, anywhere else.  And I guess therein lies the rub, right?

Transcript:  And I did, I spoke to Birgit Jan's daughter from Iceland, Icelandic MP, who was an early  volunteer, in fact helped produce the video, a collateral murder video.  And she was talking about how she still supports WikiLeaks and still supports the effort and so  on.  But she had a sort of very public falling out with Assange over his role.  And she was of the view that the leadership of the organization should be broadened.  And that in fact, he should probably step down because of some of the things.

So that's okay.  And maybe we'll save this for next week because we are running out of time.  But I read a fascinating article from the EFF, actually EFF linked to paranoia.dubfire.net.  It came out a year ago, but I hadn't seen this about  the information phone companies are revealing, particularly well-wired companies are revealing  to U.S. law enforcement.  There is a report every year given to Congress on the number of wiretaps going on.  And the number of electronic wiretaps, strangely enough, is going down.  It has been going down since 2001, which just seems counterintuitive, doesn't it?  Until you find out that there's something called a, what is it, a pen order that is basically  not warranted, does not require a warrant.  In fact, it's so common that all the wireless companies have entire departments of  dozens of people and charge for this.  Sprint has an open website that law enforcement can go to and get customers GPS locations  from their phones.  And they charge a couple of bucks for that.  Eight million requests between September 2008 and October 2009.  They have a web portal for law enforcement.  The guy who wrote this went to a conference about the event.  About this kind of wiretapping.  The wiretapping and interception industry conference in Washington, D.C. called  ISS World America's Intelligence Support Systems for Lawful Interception, Criminal  Investigations and Intelligence Gathering in Washington, D.C.  There it is.  In October of this year.  And they were talking very openly about the fact that there's a price list that every  Verizon, Sprint, T-Mobile all have a price list for things like location, who people  are calling, email headers that they sell to anybody in law enforcement without a warrant  anytime they ask.

Start time: 5608.70

I mean, it's anti-Google propaganda, but if anybody's wondering why you should care  about this stuff, I think it's just don't track us, well, don't track dot us.  And they give an example of what Google knows about, you know, an average Google user and  what that leads to with third parties.  And I get scared when it goes mobile and it's more than just what I've been searching for  and where I've been searching for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't know.  We know, we knew, I mean, I knew anyway, that all of this information was being sent out.  The thing that, the thing that's been revealed also in this is that all of these law enforcement  agencies also get this information from Yahoo, from AOL, from Google, and they have a price  list too.  You know, this is how much it'll cost you if you want this information.  And this is, we knew this.  You click on a Herpes search, you're going to get a Herpes ad.  Of course we knew that.

It's a hundred innovations in a hundred years.  What's cool about it, and it really kind of will bring home how fast this stuff is happening,  is that the person who was alive at the time of the innovation introduces the innovation.
