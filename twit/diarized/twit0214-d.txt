Every single week, starting with today, our my good buddy, my old friend, Mr. Patrick  Norton from Tekzilla.  He's on from his, it looks like it's a, you got one of those big snap on toolboxes behind  you.  Is this your garage?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, it's actually an Ikea cabinet, corner of the dining room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nice red, red metal and animal steel.  It looks smart.  Yeah, it's very attractive.  Thank you.  Yes.  Thank you for joining us today.  Also here, very glad to have Mr. Kevin Rose.  Hey, Rose.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thanks for having me.  Okay, Rose.  I just want to say big congrats to Brett Farr for his win today.  Thank you.  Is that a big one?  Who did he play for?  Minnesota.  Remember?  Really?  They picked him up.  Yeah.  They beat the 49ers.  They beat the Niners?  The undefeated 49ers?  At the last second.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Touchdown pass.  I congratulate that miserable team.  That guy, by the way, Farr will be probably not even playing by the end of the season.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, because he's missed games in the past.  So I can see why you'd say that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That third voice, the disembodied voice of John C. Dvorak from channeldvorak.com.  Channeldvorak.com.  Yes.  Did I say that?  Channeldvorak.com.  Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm without camera.  I screwed up and I forgot my camera.  I don't care.  That's all right.  Nobody cares.  Nobody cares.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, if I were like a real television station, I'd put a big ugly picture of you  up on the screen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So that would just be my picture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The best thing would be if I could get a picture of you, John, yeah, in the still store.  If I get a picture of you, John, holding a phone and I could say, you know, on location  in Caracas.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Exactly.  With a map superimposed behind me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, a little dot, a little pin in the map.  I think it would be kind of fun to do this stuff very retro, like just old school TV.  Just kind of fun.  I can make it black and white.  I don't know if that's good or not, but I could do that much.  Certainly retro.  Yeah.  I just feel like Edward R. Murrow.  Good night and good luck.  Did you see Google misspelled its name on the website today?  Really?  Two L's.  Google.  But there's a reason.  That's really, it was really funny when it first happened to see all the people on Facebook  and Twitter going, Google, what's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What is happening?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And then everybody realized, oh, it's Google's 11th birthday.  Oh, see, LL is like 11, get it?  So now I wonder, I should try this.  If you went to G-O-G-L-L-E, would you, would they smart enough to reserve?  No, they didn't reserve that.  So that would have been cool.  But they didn't do that.  Happy 11th birthday.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  They have the extra O, I think.  Yeah, they have the extra O.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Like a 3-0 Google, they own that?  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Oh, that's cool.  I'm surprised they didn't do 0-1-0-1-1.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would have been cool too.  They could have turned it into, yeah, it happens or something.  Google is 11, although nobody agrees on exactly when Google was started.  Google's decided to make the 27th its official birthday.  I guess that's when they, I don't know if that's when they went live or filed for the  name or I can't remember why it's their 11th birthday.  And if you, by the way, if you Google, you know, you click the thing, you can't, that  doesn't have any information on it.  But happy birthday anyway.  Do you remember, you were at Tech TV, I think, all these guys when Google started.  You remember our early coverage of Google at all?  I don't remember it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sort of snuck up on everybody.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I kind of remember first using it.  John, I remember you would ask people what, when Google was, you know, became big among  the geeks, you'd ask them what search engine they used and if they said Yahoo, you would  come, I think less of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, actually, it's a good test.  When I was doing Big Thinkers, which was, could have been named Big Stinkers, I would,  oh, they'd have all these different people come on and ask every one of them what they'd  use.  It's kind of the last question of the interview.  And they'd all said Yahoo, without exception.  Very innocently you would ask that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Waiting for one of them finally to say Alta Vista, the true search engine of choice.  To stumble, to stumble and say Alta Vista.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, anyway, happy birthday Google, we're now 11 years old and that just means we're  getting older.  That's all that means.  Google introduced, and I'd love to know what you guys think of this, this Side Wiki thing  and got a lot of howls from the internet.  The idea is you go to a webpage and if you have the Side Wiki, actually, if you have  either if you have the Google toolbar installed or down the road, Chrome is going to support  this, that's what's really scary.  So if you're using Chrome and you go to a website, you'll see a little button on the  left and you can open that sidebar and it'll have comments from people that are not hosted  by the website but hosted by Google and that the owner of the website has no control over.  It's not a Wiki but basically it's a third party commenting system on websites.  It's a kvetching system.  Yeah, ask Seth Godin about that because these things are always tricky.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Take it from the dig bar, which also had comments that you could fold down on top of other people's  sites.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You got a lot of heat for that and the framing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, there's good and bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I first saw one of these things back in the late 90s and then Microsoft was going to do  something similar and these things get rejected by the public.  They're annoying.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The thing that will make it a little more concerning is if they build it into Chrome  and you're using Chrome, you just get it kind of automatic.  I'm not going to install Google toolbar.  Who wants to install Google toolbar?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Have you guys heard much about the Facebook browser and when that's coming out?  They have a browser?  I don't know that they have a browser.  Yes you do.  I was just a little something I heard.  I don't know.  I heard it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Oh, that's just stupid.  I'm enjoying my coffee now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I heard all about that.  Does that mean you're now thinking about the dig browser?  I heard all about that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You're going to build it on IE, Kevin?  I do.  I love Facebook.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be my last choice.  Yeah.  No, I love Facebook.  Well, Google did that.  Did you see that was the other thing Google did.  The Wave team finally got tired of trying to make Wave work in Chrome or Internet Explorer  because it needs HTML5 and IE has no HTML5.  So they just made a Chrome insert for Internet Explorer.  So now when you go to a site that needs HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It launches Chrome inside of your browser to play HTML5.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It says, yeah, the site can say, you know, you need a little add on and it puts a Chrome  frame inside of IE.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  What it should also say is on the crop to that is your browser sucks.  Try something else.  That's basically it.  I got to say, I got to say Internet Explorer has been has been lower in resource usage  IE8.  Firefox and to a lesser degree Chrome and the whole multiprocess thing in Chrome has  started to drive me insane.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really you know, I like the speed of Chrome.  I miss the Firefox extensions, but Firefox seems to be turning into a pig.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Now Chrome is built on WebKit, right?  Say again?  Chrome is built on WebKit, right?  Yes, that's right.  So we have Safari and Chrome now on WebKit and of course Safari on for the iPhone.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think though that the Chrome is a fork of, I don't know if it's, I don't know this actually,  but I would guess it's a fork of WebKit.  In other words, that it's separated now off of WebKit.  I don't know if they fold new WebKit stuff back into it or if any, and this is more to  the point, if any of the features of Chrome get back into Safari.  That would be the, you know, if that were the case, that would be great news because  Safari and Chrome would kind of be on a par.  Does anybody know that?  I don't know if they're a fork or a kind of a related to the project.  Sure the chat room knows.  I'm looking in the chat room as usual.  They're busy talking about something else.  They have no idea.  Eric Schmidt says Google is back on the acquisition trail, which surprised me because I didn't  know they were off it, but apparently they had slowed way down on buying stuff.  They didn't buy Dig.  That might be a sore spot, Patrick.  I'm not sure I would raise that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Enjoy this coffee again, Patrick.  Thank you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A little bit of a sore point.  I know that Mike Harrington thought that was going to happen.  You can tell us now, Kevin.  Was Mike right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I can't.  There are documents.  I will say there are documents that prevent me from telling you this type of stuff.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay, so Mike was right.  I'm going to guess.  Google bought DoubleClick for $3.2 billion last year.  YouTube for $1.65 billion in 2006.  It's not like they haven't been buying anything, but now he says, Eric Schmidt says, we have  $19 billion in cash.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  If they were smart, they'd buy Twitter right now.  You think?  Oh, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Twitter might be expensive now.  They got another $100 million round.  At least that's the rumor.  That values them at $1 billion.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's more than $19 billion in money sitting around earning what?  2% interest?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  5% of Google's cash fund.  What would you do if you, let's say, okay, this is good.  Let's say you're Google, Kevin.  The first thing you say is, all right, let's spend a little bit of this money.  Let's buy Twitter.  Do you do anything different with Twitter?  What do you do with Twitter now if you're Google and you have it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You use the data, obviously.  If you think about the way that PageRank works, it's based on humans going and creating links  on web pages and then publishing those pages to the web.  They crawl it and they can determine rank and relevance based on that.  Twitter is essentially the same thing, but more real time.  You have people sending out links.  Those humans could then have a people rank applied to them.  They'd have a more real time search.  I think that's where Twitter's going.  They've hinted in that direction for a long time now.  You can see how quick they're able to break things with their trends and other things  they have going on.  If they folded this into search, it would be a huge win for them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You said an interesting thing though, because right now with Twitter, this is the problem.  You get these trending stories, but there's no karma.  There's no ranking of the people, so you get stupid trending stories.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You get good night around 11 o'clock Eastern time.  All of a sudden that becomes trending because everyone's saying good night to everyone else.  There's a lot of other stuff going on behind the scenes with this data.  People are starting to look at who these individuals are, how professional they are, how good they  are at finding links that eventually become very popular.  We might be playing around with that kind of data.  There's a lot of people that are going to leverage this stuff for a more real time web  here very shortly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  One of the things that people often talk about, do you think this is valuable, is mapping  ... I hate using these terms because it's very jargony, but mapping your social graph  to this search, which means in a sense, these are the people I care about.  Twitter does this very well because those are the people I follow.  What do they say about a topic?  Both are valuable.  I'd like to know what the community at large is saying about Iran, the elections in Iran,  but I'd also like to know what those handpicked 300 people that I follow say about Iran.  Right, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think that this is baby steps in eventually being able to ask questions of the social  graph.  Being able to say, okay, I'm looking for a dentist in San Francisco.  It's not who is the most followed dentist, but based on people I trust and I put weight  into their opinion, who are they following and who do they think is relevant for me and  can the graph provide me that answer back?  It's early days, but it's all stuff that people are trying to make sense of right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I keep hearing people talk about this and I just wonder what the world's going to look  like.  Does Google feel like if they don't do this, if they just stay a stale old index the web  search engine that they're going to miss out, you think?  Is this real-time search going to be more important in the long run?  Or is it just another form of search?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  In my mind, it's just an evolution of the way things are going.  Like I said originally when you were creating web pages and that's where you were placing  your weight in actually linking something up, it's the same thing that's happening all  the time.  Millions of links per day are being sent out and linked up on Twitter.  It's a more real-time feed than actually waiting for someone to go and blog about something  or someone to go and publish a web page about something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  The whole idea is that if you survey a group, the group's choices tend to reflect around  what becomes an accurate answer.  There's a phrase for that when you're doing futuristic and political science and stuff.  Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Pick up the book, The Wisdom of the Crowds.  It's all about that.  That's the one.  It's amazing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  James Surowiecki.  Yes.  You hadn't read that when you started Digg.  Actually, I don't think it was out when you started Digg.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe.  I know it was out within the first six months to a year because all of a sudden reporters  kept asking me, have you read the book?  Have you read the book?  I'm like, no.  I'm kind of scared now to read this.  It might change or shape.  My feelings on the topic.  But I read it and then I was just like, wow, this all kind of makes sense now.  It's a great read.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  However, in hindsight now, you've been working with The Wisdom of the Crowds for seven years.  In hindsight, are there some pitfalls, some things that maybe have you learned?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They tend to open a lot of pictures of Anna Kornikova or try to.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have dug a few of those myself.  Now, seriously, I don't think that Digg is a true wisdom of the crowds.  When you sort our upcoming section or stories that are about to get on the homepage, you  kind of see which way the crowd is leaning.  You see the number of Digg's.  You see what people are commenting on.  You see who the submitter is.  True wisdom of the crowds is done on an individual basis where they have no information about  how the rest of the crowd is weighing in on that particular topic.  We have a little project coming out in a few weeks that is going to get away, get us a  little bit closer to that goal of having it be an individual going out, checking something  out and saying, okay, does this really matter to me?  Is it something I want to vote on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do this to me every freaking time you're on the show.  I'm sorry.  Kevin always has.  Well, maybe it's just a measure of how many new products you have coming out.  But you're always saying, and in two weeks we've got something really exciting.  Is this a big, I got the sense from your interview at TechCrunch 50 with TechCrunch that this  is a big announcement coming.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, this one is going to be a smaller feature that will be rolled into a much bigger redesign  that's coming a little bit later.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You do have a big redesign on the way.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, the problem, you know, honestly, is that my SQL can only go so far and we've kind  of hit those limits now.  We're doing right around 40 million uniques a month and we've had to completely refactor  the back end.  And so a lot of that work is almost done and then we can apply a new redesign and a bunch  of other new stuff onto the site.  So we're using some of the infrastructure stuff that Facebook is using called Cassandra  and a few other projects out there for storing data that's different than our old MySQL back end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you guys work pretty closely with Facebook?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We contribute, we now write code back and contribute source code back to Cassandra and  we've helped them out.  They help us out.  We do, you know, we were over at Twitter a few weeks ago doing a little project together  where we all write code and share it back.  So I think that these engineers, we're all buddies with each other, you know.  So it's very common for big tech companies to get together and say, hey, let's, we all,  we're all, you know, working on the same problems.  We're all having the same scalability issues.  Let's all get our heads in the same room and try and figure them out together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think that's great.  It's the way to do things.  It is the way to do things and it's a very new way to do things.  I can't imagine Ford going over saying hi to GM saying, what do you think about these  engine mounts?  I mean, I just can't, maybe they did.  I don't know.  It doesn't seem like the way business was done 50 years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I agree.  It's really cool to, to, that everything's going the open source route and that, you  know, these guys will get together and it's, we don't share like product visions, like  six months, what we're planning on doing.  No, of course not.  But if there's certain things that can be done that, you know, just benefit everyone,  you work together.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And Cassandra is an open source project, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right.  Yeah, absolutely.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  From the FriendFeed chat room is telling me that WebKit is, it's the same WebKit for Safari  and Chrome and they're both part of that development.  So things flow back and forth much the same way that you were just talking about back  and forth.  It's interesting because you and Digg and Facebook and Twitter are both kind of pushing  the upper limits of, Bear's telling me our system and upper limits of what these servers  can do.  So really what you're finding out is what happens when you get, what happens when you  get 22 million visitors?  What happens when you get 200 million visitors?  What's what's what happens next?  Nobody's scaled like this before.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, it takes it takes a different type of engineer to work on it, you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No kidding. It's pretty impressive.  Let's see, I'm going to take a break.  We got a we got a number of spots.  I want to just get a couple in or get one in anyway before we get to it.  I want to ask you about the Fitbit, Kevin, and also about TechCrunch 50.  I know you were a judge there and you saw anything really cool.  Sure, people were really happy to have you in there.  But first, let's talk about backup with Carbonite.  You've heard me talk about this.  In fact, one of our hosts just got a Macintosh.  She's brand new.  Switched to the Mac from Windows and she said, all right, it's a laptop.  I know I got to back it up.  What do you recommend?  I said, well, it's kind of a no brainer.  You got to get Carbonite for a laptop because Carbonite backs up over the Internet.  And this is the beauty of it.  With Carbonite, if I can go there right now, C-A-R-B-O-N-I-T-E dot com.  If you use the coupon code TWIT, you try it free even without a credit card.  You don't need a credit card to sign up, so you can just install it.  And you'll see what it starts doing immediately is backing up to the Internet  all your financial records, your photos, your email, all the stuff that you can't afford to lose.  Don't don't worry about security.  It's using AES 256 bit encryption, really, really strong encryption on the drive  before it sends it and then SSL on the way.  So it's double encrypted.  So your privacy is absolutely protected.  But then it's safe in the cloud.  So even if the worst happens, fire, flood, a hurricane, tornado,  and everything's gone and flattened, Carbonite's got it backed up.  And you can get it back.  You can even go to your Carbonite account from any computer and get those files.  So you never lose data again.  This is how I got to know Carbonite.  I lost a couple of podcasts about three or four years ago.  Ten gizwizes.  I had to call Dick and say, would you mind recording those again?  And then we had interviewed, I think it was Brian Aker.  I'm trying to remember somebody from the maybe it's from my SQL.  And I interviewed him once with Chris DeBona for Floss and lost it.  Interviewed him again, lost it.  I had to send the guy a gift basket before we got him back on.  That's when I said, I need Carbonite.  Now I don't have to worry.  And the beauty of this is it's unlimited backup, everything that's on your hard drive.  So I don't have to think, oh gosh, those podcasts, that's gigabytes.  It just does it.  Backs them up in the background.  Always up to date.  And unlimited backup for less than five bucks a month.  That's the beauty of this.  Mac or PC, $54.95 a year, I think.  But try it free.  Go to carbonite.com.  Use the coupon code TWIT.  And if you do that, by the way, and then decide to buy, you get two free months.  You have to use the free trial first.  It's a little confusing.  You can't just buy it and use the coupon code and get two free months.  You have to use the trial first.  Tomorrow, if you want to buy it, you'll get the two free months.  Carbonite, backup, done right.  I heard somebody leave.  John, did you go somewhere?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, no.  Okay, I heard a door slam.  Must have been someone else.  Okay.  You've been quiet.  Or it could be my daughter scampering in and out looking for a USB drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Have you guys been watching the USB 3?  Did you cover this on Tekzilla yet, Patrick?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  We've been poking around on it, waiting for something really solid to come up to talk about.  Because remember when USB came out, about two, four years later, it was on every PC bay.  Then about six years after that, the iMac, what was the original gumdrop?  Was it an iMac?  It's been so long, like 98.  Yeah, the iMac.  And then suddenly a year after that, there were actually USB peripherals in volume.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it'll go faster this time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think it will go faster this time, but I'm not expecting a real rush at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And it's USB 3, it's four gigabits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's stuck in the middle of nowhere.  What?  You don't think?  No, I think it's going to go faster than Dave finally.  I mean, somebody's stalling on it.  The thing is not going to show up.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, now they're saying the first hardware is going to come out this year.  Computers with it are going to start coming out.  Patrick, you're sounding like John.  You're very skeptical, aren't you?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Here's the...  Partially it's because like, did you know that 802.11n, the spec was finally officialized?  Finally, finally.  So they released the potential spec for this, for USB 3.0 back in November of 2008.  I have nothing against a faster, better USB.  I'm just kind of curious to see how they're going to implement it.  And more importantly, what's actually going to come close to using that,  unless they expect people to do a lot of outboard flash-based hard drives,  which within 18 months could be a reality.  Sort of an outboard flash-based raid could be really interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right. Well, get ready because the next thing is light peak.  Intel at the IDF this week, the Intel Developers Forum showed this new 10 gigabit connection.  It's basically fiber optic.  It's a little thin thing.  So small that you can build a surface mount connector on the motherboard for it.  They showed it first at IDF.  It turns out now I'm looking at a number of news stories that say,  just as Apple shepherded Firewire out, and SCSI too really,  Apple's also behind this light peak thing with Intel.  So if you thought four gigabits wasn't fast enough with USB 3.0,  well, don't worry because we're going to have 10 gigabits.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's actually engineered to go to 100 rather easily.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So what do you use this stuff with?  This is bogus.

Transcript:  Flash-based memory.  I mean, John's half right. It's half bogus.  It's also half future-proofing because it looks like flash-based hard drives are going to go  mainstream probably inside of two to three years and are going to be pretty affordable options  by the end of next year.  By the end of 2010, I think flash-based hard drives and notebooks are going to be relatively common.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I put one in my MacBook and I'll never go back.  It's amazing.  Which ones you get?  I think it was an OCZ.  You don't need to get the X25, the hot Intel.  It's nice.  It's nice, but it's very pricey.  You get a lot of the benefit from OCZ.  I mean, my boot time is almost instantaneous.  Once it goes through the memory and the post stuff,  when it actually starts hitting the hard drive, from the time it starts hitting the hard drive  to the time it's ready to use is literally three or four seconds on the Mac.  It's not normally that fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It's like an order of magnitude faster on a lot of machines.  We actually had a Nan from NanTech.com.  We were talking to him about some of the stuff at IDF and for a separate thing,  interviewed him.  He was the guy who uncovered a lot of the flaws in the early SSD drives.  He's a huge, huge fan of going to solid state.  It was kind of funny to hear him.  He's obviously not as grouchy as John C. Devorak or as pessimistic as I am,  but it was fun to watch him.  SSDs are amazing and everybody's going to want them.  They're not exactly cheap yet, but it's astonishing the kind of performance  boost you get out of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie It was Alan Malventano, who's my SSD consultant.  He does testing for PC perspective.  He's the guy who found the fragmentation issue with the Intel drives.  Intel denied it at first and then they said, oh no, you're right.  They upgraded it.  But he recommended the Corsair S120.  That's what I bought is 128 gig Corsair, 400 bucks, I think something like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John C. Devorak A lot of my league at this point, but a nice hard drive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie But then I only have 128 gigs.  So I'm an idiot.  I bought, I took out my super drive and I bought this thing that mounts another.  So I have two hard drives in my MacBook.  John C. Devorak Why?  Trey Lockerbie Because then I can put more stuff on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Because he's adding another 92 gigabytes in podcast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak No, I filled it up.  John, so the boot drive, which is the SSD is really fast boots.  And then all the data is on the second 320.  It's actually, I think was, yeah, I think it was a 320 gig drive.  It's the original Apple drive that I took out to put the SSD in.  And no, with pictures, with music.  But then I also got a external drive, a terabyte or 750 gig external.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John C. Devorak So wait a second, Leo, you're saying all  this is on your MacBook?  Leo Dion Yeah.  John C. Devorak On your Mac?  Wow.  Trey Lockerbie It's kind of stupid.  It's my main computer.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie No, but it's my main computer.  I don't, you know, I don't use a desktop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John C. Devorak It's your main computer.  Look where you're sitting.  For one thing, you're in this office.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie Well, I'm surrounded by 14 computers,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  but I can't take these home.  John C. Devorak John, you've been slagging flash drives  in your column.  I love flash drives.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Really?  John doesn't like them?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John C. Devorak John, John wrote a big column for PCMag.com  about how flash drives for the beginning of the end of all humanity  and that they're going to kill us all.  Trey Lockerbie Have you ever actually used one in a computer yet,  John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John C. Devorak I have a machine right here that has a flat,  that has one of the Intel drives as a matter of fact.  Trey Lockerbie And you don't like it?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John C. Devorak You don't see a performance improvement?  You don't enjoy it at all?  It doesn't increase productivity or-  Trey Lockerbie It's because it's Windows.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I don't think Windows gets as much benefit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John C. Devorak I'm actually running Linux on it.  Trey Lockerbie Oh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And you don't see a speed improvement?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Well, yeah, because it's a small,  it's actually a machine that's kind of weirdly architected, it's running an Atom.  Trey Lockerbie Oh, no, no, then you won't get it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I put, no, I, you know-  John C. Devorak That's fine.  Trey Lockerbie No, no.  You won't get the benefit because these Atom motherboards  don't have the throughput on the motherboard. You won't see, you wasted your money on an X25  in that thing. That's nuts. You should put the stupidest-  John C. Devorak I wasted my money?  Trey Lockerbie Well, not your money. Whoever gave it to you is money.  John C. Devorak All right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Trey Lockerbie I need some clarity here. I have a MacBook Pro. Tell me which drive I need to buy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak So what you do, it's very easy in the Pro.  You can just take out the cover and you see the battery there. You also see the hard drive on the  new unibodies. It's a couple of screws to take the hard drive out. They do screw it in. I bought  the Corsair S128. I don't know what the price is now. It's probably under 400 bucks. Not even one  bounce to launch an application. It doesn't bounce at all. It's just boom. I promise you,  Kevin, you will really be glad you did this. Kevin Devorak The less bouncing, the better for me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm happy with that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Actually, Alan says the X25M is a good choice for the MacBook because that bus will  take advantage of it. But the Atom motherboard buses won't. I put-  Alan Taylor So I just basically get hornswoggled.  John C. Devorak Yeah. You're not seeing the benefit of an SSD.  Alan Taylor Well, it's performing better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John C. Devorak I got one of these drives. I can take it and put it somewhere else.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Yeah, that's what I would do. I'd pop that X25 out of the netbook and put it in a

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  real laptop and you will- Alan Taylor It's actually not a netbook. It's a net pop.  John C. Devorak What? A net pop?  Alan Taylor It's not in a netbook. It's in a little bitty, small form factor desktop box.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Okay. But yeah, the Atom motherboard, because I had the same issue  and I asked Alan and he said, well, the issue is that those, the bus speeds on those motherboards  he told me the details and I can't remember the details. I'll have to ask him again. He's in the  chat room. Just don't take advantage of the speed of the SSD drive. But you absolutely do.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John C. Devorak I'm good with the unibody 2.8 GHz.  John C. Devorak Oh, yeah. Oh, Kevin, you're going to love it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak All right, sweet.  Alan Taylor It is probably the best upgrade I ever made. I think better than putting more RAM in.  It's a great upgrade. It doesn't, Malventano says it doesn't use the full SATA 2 speed.  So what you want is a motherboard that goes full SATA 2 speed, which is what, three gigabits?  And it doesn't go to three gigabits. So you're just not seeing the benefit. You're seeing the  reduced access time. There's two benefits to SSD, virtually zero access time, because it's  random access and faster reads, but you don't see the faster read benefit.  Okay, well, I'm glad you're all.  John C. Devorak I'm in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm in. I'm in. I convinced you.  Alan Taylor I'm in. I'm in. I'm in. I buy whatever you're selling there, Leo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak French parliament may mandate full Photoshop disclosure. If you use Photoshop,  you will have to put it in writing on the advertisement. I think this is actually a very,  I don't know, it's not a bad idea. Over 50 politicians in the French assembly say that  any time a picture has been modified, Photoshopped in effect, in an advertisement,  in a news story, in product packaging, you'll have to put the footer,  photograph retouched to modify the physical appearance of a person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But you'd have to do it in French.  John C. Devorak So that all the years and years of air brushing that went on and all the cutting  and pasting and modification of photos that went on for years and years and decades and centuries,  for all we know, that was okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Alan Taylor But now that he's Photoshopped, no. You know what's interesting? This is something  that would come out of the- John C. Devorak Because it's an American product,  the French hate us. Alan Taylor  That's probably it. No, this sounds like something that would come out of the Berkeley City Council.  This is their rationale. John C. Devorak  Totally. Alan Taylor  It says Photoshopped images can quote, lead people to believe in a reality that it does not actually  exist and have a, they might as well just put a ban on unicorns on the boxes too, and have a  detrimental effect on adolescents. Because they're worried, you know, body image.  I don't know. What do you think? Good idea?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John C. Devorak I think it's a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Patrick, Photoshop warnings on all boxes?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John C. Devorak So everything it's like if they've added a little flag, just like for objects and  people- Alan Taylor  No, just people. Just people. John C. Devorak

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just people. Everything is photoshopped. You go to a movie.  John C. Devorak Especially if you're a professional,  you're always going to photoshop it. John C. Devorak

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So this is going to stop anorexia and bulimia because now-  John C. Devorak You'll know the truth.  John C. Devorak You're going to be unmodified. So the peak of-  John C. Devorak No, people will be modified, they just have to tell you they're modified.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John C. Devorak In what, four point type at the bottom?  John C. Devorak What does modified mean? What about changing the complexion of somebody?  John C. Devorak Exactly, I was going to say-  John C. Devorak You know, open up the colors a little bit.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John C. Devorak The number one thing they're going to do is just mess around with the colors,  right? And everything is going to be- John C. Devorak

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Every picture I take goes through Lightroom. Every one of them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Did you see that picture of Carmen Electra without makeup on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak No. Is she a dog?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John C. Devorak I'm going to IM it to you. No, it's amazing.  John C. Devorak She's gorgeous without makeup?  John C. Devorak I just sent you on IM without makeup. She decided to take this picture to show  what it's like without makeup and it was pretty impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Well, that's why she did it, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Maybe it was bold. Maybe it was BS. Maybe it was a scam.  John C. Devorak Well, yeah, but John, surely-  John C. Devorak You scratched on her face to see if she had makeup on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John C. Devorak John, have you ever walked around the street  and seen a spectacularly beautiful woman? John C. Devorak  Yes. John C. Devorak

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Never. I have never done that. John C. Devorak  Was she photoshopped? John C. Devorak

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I don't know if she had makeup on because some of these women can put makeup on, you would  never know it was makeup because we're guys. We haven't got it.  John C. Devorak What are you saying? That we should have-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  people should hang a sign around their necks that said I used makeup to modify my image on the street.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak You know what? She looks like she's 18.  How old is Carmen Electra? She looks completely different.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John C. Devorak I know. It's crazy.  John C. Devorak I'm skeptical.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak What do you mean? No, she's definitely got no makeup on.  John C. Devorak John's a hater today.  John C. Devorak How can you say that from a photo?  John C. Devorak Oh, you mean she's got like different makeup on?  John C. Devorak Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Her eyes look like they're done.  John C. Devorak You know what? I always-  John C. Devorak She's definitely got mascara on those lashes. There's no way that's natural.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak I always think when I see pictures-  John C. Devorak You guys are just buffaloed.  John C. Devorak I always think when I see pictures like this, that's what she would-  that's what it would look like if you woke up next to her. That's what she would look like.  John C. Devorak You hope.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John C. Devorak You guys are horny as hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Hey, they should put-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John C. Devorak I woke up next to Carmen Electra. There'd be a pile of tequila bottles and probably  a warrant for my arrest. So- John C. Devorak

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You're not going to kick her out of bed for eating crackers, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak I think she's beautiful. But see, of course,  if somebody looks like that without makeup, no big deal to publish that picture. Now,  on the other hand- Jeff Hickman

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Somebody in the chat room pointed out that Carmen Electra is 37. She's born in 1972. You tell me  she's got no makeup on. John C. Devorak  Look at her. She looks like she's 18. Jeff Hickman

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But she's from, you know, she's not exactly the middle of the bell curve. She's from the high end  of the bell curve. She's got great genes. John C. Devorak

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You guys can believe whatever you want. Jeff Hickman  I think in France, they should put a statement on everything. Anytime a model wears makeup,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  this person has been chemically enhanced. This is not how she looks.  John C. Devorak Hey, we used to wear makeup as

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a kid, right? Jeff Hickman  It looks like me without makeup. Jeff Hickman

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm wearing makeup right now. John C. Devorak  Right now. Jeff Hickman  John C. Devorak  Yeah, no, I should say that. I should say this is what I look like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman Fire it up on a lower third, man.  Jeff Hickman Let's see that lower third up there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman I think you're a Dove ad waiting to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Before, not after. Oh, goodness gracious.  That's pretty funny. That was on Dignation. That's where I saw that. You guys talked about it.  You do watch the fabulous Dignation show, everybody. Where was it? You were just,  you guys go all over the place. Where was your, were you in London at FOA?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman No, that's next week.  John C. Devorak Next week.  Jeff Hickman We're not doing a Dignation out there, but I'll be out there for the conference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak I was invited to FOA, but I can't go because I'm stuck here.  Jeff Hickman That's FOA.  John C. Devorak Future of web applications. You did a big one. That was where you did the  gigantic one in... Jeff Hickman  That was a huge one, yeah. John C. Devorak  Was it last year, the year before? Huge. Jeff Hickman  Future of web applications. Jeff Hickman

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You should go out next year. It's a lot of fun out there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm afraid that I would be arrested and extradited to Switzerland. I don't want to  leave the country. Jeff Hickman  It happened. John C. Devorak  Did you hear what happened? Roman Polanski. Jeff Hickman

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I think it was last night. John C. Devorak  They caught him. Jeff Hickman  Yeah, he's 76. John C. Devorak

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They can't get Osama Bin Laden, but boy, they got Roman Polanski.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman Well, what's weird about it is that he's  been vacationing there on and off for like 20, 30 years and all of a sudden somebody noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman Yeah, I'm with you, Patrick. Something's fishy.  John C. Devorak It's fishy. Very fishy.  Jeff Hickman Okay, next news item.  John C. Devorak That is a weirdly paced, oddly paced show today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman Well, let's do a commercial then, since the pace is so odd anyway.  Jeff Hickman Touché.  John C. Devorak Touché. You know what I said, I told my staff when I walked in here. It's kind of,  I don't know if you know this, but getting ready for Twitter, it's like a bullfight.  I go out in the lounge and I've got my staff and they wrap the thing around me and I hear the,  and then the door opens and I come in here and it's like, so I tell them as they're wrapping  me with the girdle to get ready for the show. I said, today, I will do a 45-minute tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman They didn't believe me,  but I will today and you will get the bull's ears, Patrick Norton.  Jeff Hickman Woohoo.  John C. Devorak Oh yes, Jase, the ears are for you.  Jeff Hickman Very tasty.  John C. Devorak Because you today are not wearing any makeup, are you?  Jeff Hickman No.  John C. Devorak No, it is real. Genuine. In fact, I don't think you even shaved today.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman You're not helping yourself with this 45-minute tweet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak I don't think you even shaved for the show today.  Let me tell you, my friends, about Squarespace.com. This is the great-

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman I spent 23 hours of sleep on Friday night, dude. I'm lucky to be vertical at this point.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Wow. You mean you didn't sleep for 23 hours or you did?  Jeff Hickman Did you have the swine food?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman No, I slept from 6 p.m. on Friday till almost 3 p.m. on Saturday.  John C. Devorak Why? What was that?  Jeff Hickman A combination of hosting a movie for Paramount,  movie opening that started on midnight. By the time the movie was over and I got out of that,  it was, I want to say, 3.30, almost 4 by the time I got home and got to sleep and the baby woke up.  Jeff Hickman It was very scary.  John C. Devorak What, the baby waking up or the movie?  Jeff Hickman The baby waking up is always scary.  John C. Devorak What was the movie?  Jeff Hickman It was Paranormal Activity.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Yeah, I've started seeing some buzz about that. What is it about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman Well, it's about bad stuff happening to a couple.  John C. Devorak Is it a documentary?  Jeff Hickman Not exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman It's like Blair Witch. I think it was made for like 10 grand, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman It's made for like no money. It's basically the really good use of timing,  minimal special effects, spooky as all hell.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Oh, it's like the, what was that movie?  Jeff Hickman Blair Witch Hunt.  John C. Devorak Blair Witch Hunt.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman You mean the one that Kevin just said?  John C. Devorak Did he say that?  Jeff Hickman That'd be the Blair Witch Project. Kevin said it.  John C. Devorak So it's like Blair Witch Project.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman He's mumbling.  John C. Devorak But would you say it's like the Blair Witch Project?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman You know, I've met it. Actually, by the time I had a chance to see the Blair Witch  Project, it was so hyped. I knew there was no way it could be nearly as good as like the nine months  of hype I'd heard. So I just never bothered to see it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman I never bothered to see it because everyone kept telling me they got seasick watching  it. John C. Devorak

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Here's another picture of Carmel Electra without makeup that's not quite so flattering.  Of course, she's making a face.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman There you go. That's more like it. But she's still got makeup on. Look over her eyes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's makeup. John C. Devorak  How do you know so much about eye makeup, John?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman Actually, my first wife used to be a makeup artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Oh, well, there you go. I think that answers that.  Jeff Hickman Your first wife was a makeup artist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Yeah, she did. In her spare time, she was.  Yeah. She could, somebody would come over to the house for dinner or something. She  it would be, she'd walk out of there and was like, wow, it doesn't even look like the same person.  Jeff Hickman Well, John, take a look at this video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What do you think? Makeup?  John C. Devorak Yeah, I think so.  Jeff Hickman She looks like a different person.  She looks like a different person. She's got eyeliner around her eyeball.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman These are paparazzi shots from an unflattering angle,  probably designed by a- from an insert name of, you know, insert name of mega tabloid that basically  thrives on doing obnoxious things to celebrities on the cover to push magazines off the newsstand.  I mean, Kevin, God help me, if he gets a little bit larger, we're going to start  seeing weird shots of Kevin drinking his air all fluffed up.  Jeff Hickman We're waiting for that.  John C. Devorak I can't wait.  Jeff Hickman You know, Kevin Rose, like climbing up a hill in San Francisco,  you know, on, and, you know, his mouth open or something. And it's like, you know,  we forget the fact that the French are so paranoid, like we have to tell if these are  photoshopped. And it's like the entire act of putting someone in a studio,  having them professionally lit, professionally made up, professionally posed, photographed under  perfect light by a photographer who's basically an artist, an alchemist with light. You know,  the mere fact that we don't even bother to point that is a sad statement on how we treat basically  the image. So like, I think they should point that on every fricking ad. And then on top of that,  they can point out the photoshopping.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Yeah, in fact, if you don't know that,  you know, you're not really paying attention.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman Most people don't know that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Most people don't know that.  Jeff Hickman That's what kids need to learn. This is called media. This is, this is, I mean,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Most people don't know that, John, but it doesn't, it does not mitigate the impact  that the series of images have on people, especially young women from their formative years.  Jeff Hickman I'm in total agreement with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman Have you guys seen the Dove Evolution?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Jeff Hickman Yeah, I think that was the best campaign along these lines ever.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  John C. Devorak Absolutely.  Jeff Hickman That really did the job.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  John C. Devorak That shows what they can do with Photoshop.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  For people who didn't see it, it was, it was, it was interesting that Dove did it. It was an ad  campaign or a video that showed- Jeff Hickman I think it's on YouTube.  John C. Devorak Oh, yeah, yeah, just YouTube Dove. What is it?  Jeff Hickman Evolution.  Jeff Hickman Yeah.  John C. Devorak Well worth seeing. Well worth seeing.

You know, after all these, um, scary stories about WordPress hacks and so forth, it's kind of  nice to be on a hosted site where you don't have to worry about that. They just keep it up to date.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm constantly, yeah, you know, my site got, uh, what really before the upgrade, but there's some  kind of thing they, they, cause I mean, one of the bloggers noticed that, uh, if you type in,  typically if you just, I guess people keep checking on this. If you just type in the vorac or John  Dvorak, you would always have the same kind of listing on Google. It would always be headlined  by the one or two spot. The Dvorak uncensored blog, right? Disappeared. Oh, cause Google blocks it.  If it's got malware on it. Yeah, when I wasn't malware, it was a, but apparently in the front,  the front template at the very bottom, there's a whole bunch of just keywords that were dropped  into gambling and you know, porn and just a whole slew of keywords with links. I don't know what  they were trying to accomplish, but, uh, somebody from Google pointed out that this is one, when they  see this, they just basically quarantine the site because they don't know what's going on. Right.  And so it takes about two days to get it back and get rid of all that crap.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. It's very scary. I happen to scoville. I update, uh, but this is what you have to do.  If you run your own WordPress blog, you gotta check all the time if there's a new one and  update it immediately. So you don't have to worry about this, Kevin. You're smart.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I don't. Yeah. That's the part of the problems. I think that there's the people that  are super, super like, you know, their own developers and they want to go the extra mile  to customize everything in like crazy, crazy ways. And then there's like Squarespace sits in that,  that spot for me where it'll do 99.9% of the stuff I needed to do. And so I don't ever have  to do anything but just write articles. And when I log in, there's a new interface like every few

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  months cause they upgraded. It's kind of the night. It's kind of nice just to think about content and  not about anything else, especially if you spend your day, you know, all day thinking about dig.  Uh, you think the last thing you want to do is come home and start not enough hours in the day.  I can have them do it. I don't know. I did a search for you, John. I did find your  Dvorak on censored blog, but then the image results for John C. Dvorak are a little odd.  One of these things does not belong. Yeah. One of these things,  why do I see three, four pictures of John C. Dvorak and one picture of Steve Jobs?  Yeah. Holding an iPhone. Very strange. Actually it doesn't look like a story.  It's an unhappy iPhone. There's a little, um, maybe that was  a joke.  Oh, there it is. See, and right under it says John C. Dvorak. So Google's not wrong. Look, see,  Google's never wrong. Google's got it again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So here's the story that I think was interesting. Good place.  I beg of you. Is police trying to bust blog commentators?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, this, you know, okay. So what's happening is that, uh,  people are saying bad things about the chief of police and I don't know what they call him,  the sheriff, the ranger. What do they call the Texas guy? We'll say the chief of police.  So he's investigating to see whether he can shut them down, maybe arrest them,  take them away, put them where the sun don't shine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I'm always amused by people in this day and age. You know, we had the,  I guess the personal computer revolution began what? 35 years ago. And then the internet  revolution began, what, 15 years ago. And there's these people that apparently don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  have a clue how anything works. It came from the Knights in Shining Armor.  Austin police chief Art Acevedo, according to the Austin American Statesman, is considering  pursuing commentators on blogs who have, one, impersonated him. Have you ever been  impersonated? I have. Yes. I think we all have. We all have. Sure. I think the world works very,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  very different if you're a senior lawman in Texas than it does if you're a news commenter in

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the East Bay, John. Or malign them, he says, beyond the boundaries of legal tolerance,  whatever that might be. Liable. Well, they're saying not only liable suits, but criminal charges  if police believe these are warranted. A lot of my people feel it's time to take these people on.  They understand the damage to the organization. And quite frankly, when people are willfully  misleading and lying, they're pretty much cowards anyway, because they're doing so under the cloaks  of anonymity. I don't like this trend. Remember this article on CNET also refers to that skanks  in New York City case where Google was forced to give up the name of a blogger who wrote bad things  about a model? Exactly. It's the same thing. If you're a public figure, I don't know. It's pretty hard to...

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I know. Yeah. Well, I mean, it depends on whether there's liable involved. I mean,  sometimes liable and slandering, you know, and there's, I mean, maybe you have a point,  but generally speaking, most people who do this sort of thing are just goofs. And they're, you know,  posting, you know, so-and-so is a, you know, they sign at the sheriff. I mean, it's, I can't see

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  getting worked up about it. Well, I wouldn't mess with a Texas lawman.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Did you... I actually cuss at him when I see him. They don't seem to care. You're the kind of guy

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  probably did that when you were young, long haired hippie in Berkeley at Cal, University of  California, Berkeley, probably you do that. Did you call him Pig? Texas, the cuss at a lawman?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Or call the Berkeley police officer a pig. We love law enforcement folks. So there's a, you know,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  my favorite, there used to be a guy that was on, I think just until recently on Telegraph Avenue,  saw all these crazy bumper stickers. I mean, they were just the wildest ones and they're all,  you know, just nutty, extreme communist bumper stickers. And, but he had this one that I always  thought was amusing. It said, you know, F-U-C the police. And it was, it just says, and it's just a  beautiful sticker. And it had also buttons that said that. But no K. And I've always... What? No K.  Yeah, there was a K on there. Oh, there was a K too. Okay. It was the real deal. And so you can buy  these stickers for a buck. So if you found somebody you didn't like and you could just... Put it on  their car. Exactly. You put it on their rear end bumper and they're just driving around endlessly.  And I'm sure that the police really got a kick out of that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's like putting a kick me sign on a guy in high school. A little worse. No, it's a little worse.  Man. Go ahead. Take that call. It's all right. Maybe it's the Texas police. Hello.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  She's going to be back in about three hours.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So did you get your Fitbit yet, Kevin? No, they haven't. I haven't even spoken to anyone over

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Fitbit. So this was your pick. I remember you were on after TechCrunch. It was like TC40 last year.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  A year ago. Yeah. And you were a judge and that wasn't the best of the Yammer was the best of.  Right. Which apparently is still doing quite well. Jason told me that they're doing quite well  as a kind of enterprise Twitter. But you were the judge of the Yammer. Yeah. And you were the judge  but you liked and I thought very interesting the Fitbit and they're finally coming out. They're  a little late. Is it a pedometer? What is it? Yeah. So I mean, essentially it's something,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's a little device that is about a little bit smaller than a pack of gum.  You either clip it on a wristband or on your waist and you just go about your day. Right. So  you're just walking around. You could go to the gym. You might walk to lunch and you keep it on  you when you sleep as well. And then it syncs back to your computer and then pushes all that data  about your movement to the website. And then you see basically, you know, how your sleep was.  Were you moving around a lot in your sleep? Supposedly it tells you how many calories you burned  and you know, how the distance that you traveled. I don't know how accurate it is, but it's kind of,  I don't know, in my mind, these devices are going to take off soon. I mean, there's a lot of...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I love the sleep side of it. I mean, pedometer is one thing, but I love how well did you sleep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. Yeah. I think you might as well get chipped while we're at it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Wait, wait. This is just, this is like, I mean, there's a lot of different things that are  happening in this space right now, right? You got the Nike Plus, which is the same thing,  but inside of your shoe. And that's built into all iPhones now and, you know, all iPod touches.  So when you go to the gym, you know, you exercise, you run down the street, it tells you  the distance and calories and all of that stuff. And even like pushes like your favorite song when  you're supposed to be hitting your maximum. They call it like your, I can't remember,  like your burst song. Yeah, something like that. And I even saw recently there was a new treadmill,  or not treadmill, but a new bike at the gym that you sit down on and you plug your iPhone into it  and it's Nike Plus compatible. And so you don't even need the shoes anymore. It just tracks all  of your calories and your distance and everything, and then uploads it back to the website. So when  you log on later, it shows you exactly, you know, how you've been doing compared to previous times

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that you exercise. How many people are actually using the Nike Fit? I don't, but I know a lot

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of runners do, I think. Yeah, I think it's one of these things where Nike, I mean, it's cheap for  Nike. The device itself is, you know, 10 or 15 bucks. And if they can lock people into this and  create like this experience online where you go there and you share with your friends, like the  different workouts that you're doing, you can map out different trails that you go on and share it  with other people. If they can own that market, then you're always going to be buying Nike shoes,  right? Cause they own the patent on the little slide in thing on the shoe. I'm buying a FitBit

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right now. I think it's, so they're available now. People are getting them. Yeah. I guess it's a month  or so until they ship them out. Oh shoot. So you probably would want to like, cause if you're going  to wear it when you sleep, you'd have to wear it like all the time. I mean, they have like a little  place to it. It would imply that. Yes. You could just guess. There's actually a shower. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  You know, you burn off a lot of energy in the shower or you're scrubbing yourself down. Thank  you for the picture. And, uh, it seems to me how long you showered. Is it waterproof? Is it waterproof?  I like this picture of you. Look at the cell phone you got. Isn't that great? By the way,  I've been trying to get one of those, this big old clunkers. I think you can still get them here and  there. Oh, wouldn't it be cool? I like the retrofit one. So it's an actual cell phone that'll work.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be so cool if you're at a conference and your phone rings and you pull out this gigantic  cell phone and start talking on it. I think that'd be, you know, that's what Waz did.  We get the big laps today. Waz took the, uh, took an old dial phone, you know, like an old  Western electric black rubber dial phone and put cell phone electronics in it. He talks on it on  the phone. This is, this is good. This is a, one of our listeners made this image of John. It says  on location in Caracas. He's from now on when you're, when I don't have video,  that's the picture we're going to show John. I just want to warn you. Thank you. You consider yourself

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  a warner. I've warned. Meeko is a good place to go for those by the way, John. Meeko? Meeko. It's a  guy. I'm actually, he's probably not too far from where you are right now. Uh, who's, he deals in a  lot of surplus electronics, of vintage electronics. He shows up at Defton every year. Oh, cool. He  has a couple of those people like him for the three watt amplifiers inside of a big fat honking

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  cell phone amplifier. So what it's still, but it's an, it's an analog cell phone. So it wouldn't,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  you'd have to modify it, right? Well, what you do is you basically, people tweak around with the,  uh, people play around with the actual amplification sections of the phone without  dealing with the analog section. Basically they, they turned it into a cell phone booster.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You put a little cell phone inside. It could get brain. Yeah, no kidding.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think both of them still pale by comparison to the amount of energy that's hit your skull from

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the sun. Oh good. So as long as you stay out of the sun, you're okay. Exactly. Supposedly maybe,  maybe, uh, Kevin, you shouldn't modify your MacBook Pro just yet. Cause according to Apple Insider,  Apple is about to announce new models of laptops. Now see, nobody knows.  So this is one of those rumors, but they say that they will update the Mac books,  the cheap white polycarbonate MacBooks and come up with a much or somewhat cheaper  laptop, the cheapest Mac laptop they say in Apple history.  That's, I think given the sales on a netbooks, that's probably a good idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Maybe that's what all those 10 inch screens were for. Wouldn't that break everybody's heart?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh man. They put it in a Mac book. What do you know? I, we, I have this conversation on Mac  break weekly every week and you know, those guys are really excited about the idea of a  Apple tablet. And I keep saying it's, I don't know if there's a market for  a 10 inch tablet touch tablet. Is there a market for this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I've actually found myself, I was in a huge conversation slash argument with Callie Lewis,  of all people about how it, and I, like an Apple tablet would be just worthless. And then about  six months later, I was trying to use the GPS on my iPhone and it occurred to me just exactly how  much more usable all the iPhone applications would be on a larger screens. Like I just was  thinking seven or eight inch, I think 10 inch may be too big. Cause you can't put that in your pocket.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, but there's a lot of things where you look like an idiot when you use it as a phone. Well,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's not going to be a phone. I don't think it's going to be a phone. It won't be a phone. It'll  have a high speed. Hi, mom. You'll look, that'll look just like, you know, here we are. We're just  saying how we would like to have one of those old fashioned big cell phones, but oh no, if Apple  makes a giant slab, I'm not using it. Cause that's modern. Well, I just, I just wonder when you think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  about the device, I mean, you can, you see all these Photoshop concepts and everything and it  looks really cool. And you're like, wow, that would look nice, you know, sitting on my desk,  but really, you know, when I'm out and about it, what do I want to do? I want to be able to look  up something real quick on Google. I want to be able to check my email. I want to be able to maybe  surf a webpage real quick. If I need to pull up something, all those things I can do very well  on the iPhone, right? And if it's anything above and beyond that, I have my notebook, right? It's  pretty light, carry it around. And then I pop it open and boom, I'm on wifi and I have a full  keyboard. Where would this device sit and what would I use it for that I couldn't do on my iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Right. I just, I don't know. Get hanged on the wall and make it a picture frame that shows your

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  photos. That rotates through the photos. Nice. It's only $900. And I would probably buy it because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's an Apple device. Yeah. Well, did you see the Microsoft courier? Gizmodo showed this. Now,  you know, Gizmodo does not have the greatest track record on, I don't want to say veracity,  but you know, sometimes they say things maybe, I don't know if they're completely true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They claim- You're saying you're questionably, you're questioning whether this is somebody's  backyard Photoshop mock-up or a genuine real Microsoft potential product. I'd say consider

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the source. Gizmodo has the video. It's, did you watch the video? It's this I would buy as opposed  to a 10 inch, because first of all, it's a book. It opens, right? And it's got both, it's got touch,  but it also has stylus. So it's kind of a hybrid thing. And that kind of makes sense. That's  exactly what I would expect from Microsoft because of course they did those tablets.  And the use case that they showed in the video was kind of neat. It was a woman who was outside of  the client. So she was sitting at whatever, an internet cafe. She opens the book. She drags-  It's a Filofax. Yeah. It's a Filofax with, but electronic. And the other thing I like about it,  and I think that the Apple tablet would have some of this as well, is that it is also an ebook

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  device. Did you notice that while you're showing the video, I'll see it on this podcast necessarily,  but they're doing a two finger stuff. Did they give them their, I thought Apple had that locked

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  down. No, no, because the surface has the pinch and so does the pre. A lot of devices have the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  have the pinch. What was this patent then that Apple had with the two touch screen?  I don't know. Multi-touch or whatever they call it. I don't know because a lot of people are

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  doing it. I don't think Apple, I mean, the guy who demonstrated it, Carnegie Mellon had this  demonstration was well before the iPhone. Remember that demo? It wasn't Carnegie Mellon. It was  another school. Yeah. So I remember what you're talking about. Yeah. And he demo- it was a  Ted speech. Did you give your Ted speech yet? Well, it's Ted X. Now I have to say that  because Kevin goes to the real Ted. I go to the franchise Ted. It's like he's going to the French  Laundry or you know, Sir. I've never been to the French Laundry. I'm going to Bouchon. And I'm going to Mickey D's.  No, but it is in Dubai. So that's exciting. No, it's October. You're going to Dubai? I'm going to Dubai

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  in a couple of weeks. That's amazing. And when you go there, make sure to do buy stuff because

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's a shopper's paradise. Well, but aren't they going- I heard that they were kind of going through

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  a little bit of an economic- It's the music. These will be on sale. I mean, that place is like, wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So you're giving a talk. Well, so there's Ted X. You know, there's been a lot of- there are a lot of  Ted X's. These are the franchise Ted's. So there's Toronto just had theirs and they're all over. Dubai,  a guy emailed me, Giorgio said, hey, I'd like to do one in Dubai. Would you come if I did one? I said,  are you kidding? You pay my ticket? I'm there. It's kind of funny because I'm flying 26 hours  for an 18 minute speech. It's miserable, that flight. Well, I'm on Emirates. I'm on business  class. No, Emirates is fine. You're set. So it should be okay. Not first. In first class in  Emirates, apparently you get a room, like a cabin. But I'm not first class. Business is all you need.  Yeah, that'd be fine. I'm excited. I can't wait. Yeah, it's a couple of weeks. We're-  we're- Alex Lindsay is going to fill in all week on Twitter. This is an experiment to see if in fact  this whole network can survive without me. And if it can't, I'm staying in Dubai.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, have you made sure that it's actually a conference and not somebody, you know,  going to hold you hostage or something? They have a website. Dubai is hot. It's really hot. It's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  100 degrees. I've been watching the weather all summer. It's like 100 degrees. They close the

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  outside. Noon to four. Nobody goes outside between noon and four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, don't they- but now Kevin, you've been to TED. Haven't you spoken at TED? I thought you'd-  No, no, no, no. I've just attended.  Well, I'm hoping the TED- 12 days, 6 hours and 48 minutes.  This is a real honor, Leo, for you to do this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm hugely honored. Are you kidding?  To speak at TED is a big deal.  But it is. It's still hard to go to these things.  I'm excited. I'm hoping that this-  That's congrats.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The trouble is, the problem is that you don't understand, Kevin, is that you don't know.  Leo, he'll tell you about this, but his speech is going to be about how to work a microphone so you  get the right tones.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's okay, right? Isn't that allowed? You can talk about anything you want. All right,  Mr. John C. Dvorak, if you were giving a TED Talk, what would you do? What would you TED Talk be?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  What would I TED Talk?  Yeah.  I feel I have absolutely nothing to contribute. I would refuse the honor.  No, you wouldn't. Would you really?  I have to dream something up then. I mean, I haven't got nothing.  Oh, come on.  I mean, when you listen to the show, I'm just here to kibitz, you know, and to throw in one-liners  when I have a shot at it and see if I'm cracking and reporting-  It could be like a retake of my old wrestling coach's philosophy on life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Power of negative reinforcement.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Let's face reality.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'm giving a speech on Friday to the Online News Association in San Francisco,  and the speech is titled, I haven't written it yet, so I better write it, but the speech-  Run for your lives.  Yeah, really, it's bad news everywhere. No, my speech, I thought this was appropriate for  the Online News Association, is how a lifetime of failure led me to be an overnight success.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I didn't realize you'd had a lifetime of failure.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Crickets. All right, Patrick, what would you do if you were invited to TED? What would you speak about?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I don't, A, think they would have me, and B, I think it's kind of elitist.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's giving it to him, Patrick.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, no, I mean, every so often I see something amazing from it, but it's kind of like,  we're going to have the people we think are the coolest people in the world come talk to the people  we think are doing the most good in the world, which is great, and I don't really fit under  either of those concepts.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, I'd love to go to TED though in Long Beach.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Are you talking about TED or the Online Newspaper Association?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What's TED like?  Kevin, I mean, it must be pretty cool. I would love to go to the big TED.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean, it's one of these things where you definitely feel like, so last year was the  first year I ever went, and it felt like I was out of place because you walk around and there's  Bill Gates and there's Larry and Sergey, and they're like, you can just walk up to them,  which is not like normal conferences, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Getting scared, like I better start thinking about this speech.  I hadn't really thought of, I figured 18 minutes I could just get up there and blab.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  So you haven't, wait, wait, you haven't done your TEDx  speech or you haven't done your...  He's written this thing a million times already.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Leo is over-prepared when he does these things. I've heard a couple of Leo's...  I do over-prepare.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I do over-prepare. Oh, thank you. That's very nice, John.  No, they are.  But the problem, the reason I over-prepare is because I write it and then I throw it out,  and then I write another one and I throw it out because I hate them all.  And then I finally get to the stage and I'm confused.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You need to write one of those kind of tearjerkers. Some of the best TED talks  are always those really sad ones where people walk away and then it's like, yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Oh, good. All right. Good. Okay. I need this now, Kevin. So this is good.  So we need a little drama here.  Pathos.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  What is the drama?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Actually, you have pathos going on in your life right now.  I do?  Related to anonymity in the internet and how the internet's greatest strength is also its  greatest downfall when used irresponsibly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It is. This is a big challenge, I think.  Did you see, have you seen We Live in Public yet?  Yeah.  Josh Harris, the biography of Josh Harris, who's the guy who created Pseudo and  he wired his apartment, this is like in 2001, with cameras everywhere, even in the toilet.  There was a camera in the toilet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And you're making a motion as though it's in the toilet.  Really?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yes. In the toilet.  That's gross.  Yeah, it's gross. And then microphones everywhere, all of which were activated by movement or sound.  So basically he just walked around and everywhere he was. And then he has his girlfriend, which he  calls his fake girlfriend, in there with him. And they have the chat rooms and everything they do  is documented. It's weird. And I think he had a nervous breakdown.  But because he said, if you do this, you will have a nervous breakdown.  I think he told me I was going to have a nervous breakdown.  What did you think of that movie, Kevin? It was pretty good, I thought.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I thought it was okay. In my mind, it was like, I mean, the guy clearly made a lot of money  in tech. He had millions and millions of dollars and he kind of blew it all on, or quite a big  chunk of it on setting up cameras. He's broke. He blew it all.  I just don't understand why one would do that. Like, I don't know. Seemed like a waste of money to me.  I almost think he was, Josh was a performance artist, not so much.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I was going to say this, this sounds like a lot of stuff that was going on in all of the movies.  Off-off-Broadway when I was in college in New York City.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was New York. In 1999, he took over the basement of a hotel, put bunks,  sleeping tubes in it for, I don't know, a lot of people, 50 people or something.  Cameras everywhere. People moved in, they couldn't come out.  And they eventually got closed down by the New York City police after the 1999-2000 New Year's Eve.  But boy, I just, yeah, I think he's a performance artist is what I think he is. He's very, very

Transcript:  East side, Lower East side. Or now, lower, lower, lower East side.  Alphabet City, baby. Yeah. No, Alphabet City is almost gentrified.  Is that hip now? Where am I going to get my heroin? Not there anymore.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's another article here I want to discuss. Yes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess you love going off track, off the- Can I do it? Wait a minute. Okay. Hold on. I'm  going to do an ad. I got one more ad. This is interesting.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. That's why you should stay tuned. No, no, no. I'm saying it's interesting.  This is the second time I've tried to cue a story and you came up with this ad thing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because, yeah, this ad thing. I'll never understand it. What is this ad thing you do?  How does that work? What is that? Do people pay for those?  What exactly is an ad? Well, my friends, without the ads, there would be no twit.  You know how expensive it is to do this show. It costs me several dollars an hour.  That's why we ask our fine sponsors, people like audible.com, to defray the costs  with small advertisements. These are all products I use and love. I don't mind doing it.  I don't think of it as an ad. I think of it as recommending something I enjoy. Audible,  to be honest, don't tell them this. I probably would do these for free. They save my life driving  to Tech TV, two hours, three hours a day in the car. Flying to Dubai. Flying to Dubai. I'm stocking  up. In fact, I'll show you my library because I actually- Bring a battery booster for your iPod.  Yeah, I do. I have the Fast Track and I think it's going to get me all the way. Well, wait a  minute. No, I'm on- You have power outlets and business cards. I could plug into everything.  Lucifer's Hammer, Larry Niven and Jerry Pornell. That's about 30 hours. Got the new Chris Anderson  free. That's free by the way on audible. Kind of makes sense. Andy Anacoh would recommend a book  about the golden age of movies, the 70s with EZ Rider and Raging Bulls. It's called EZ Rider's  Raging Bulls, the history of Hollywood in the 70s. The Battle for America 2008. I'm going to listen  to all of these on the plane. I'm actually kind of excited. The Innovators Dilemma, which I've been  meaning to read for years. Ben Mezrich's book about Facebook, the accidental billionaires. By the way,  they're going to start filming that. That's pretty exciting. Aaron Sorkin wrote the screenplay.  Who's directing? They got a great director. I can't remember who it is.  It's Kevin Spacey's company. Trigger Street is producing it. I'm excited about this. The accidental  billionaires. I know Mark Zuckerberg is not as excited about this, but I'm going to listen to  this. This is the story of Facebook by Ben Mezrich. He's the guy who wrote 21, that great book about-  This would be a good Audible pick. I'll tell you what, let's make this our Audible pick.  You can go there and get this for free. Go to audible.com slash twit two. Listen to the books  I'm listening on the way to Dubai. You get two books when you sign up for the platinum account.  Platinum account is two books a month.

Dvorak has an actually interesting story

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to tell us. I don't remember. Oh, come on. Okay, here we go. Ready? Yes. Since Kevin's here,  I think he can maybe shed some light on this. There was a number of studies that came out that  showed that people who are on social networks really are on social networks only because they  want to be social. They don't want to have stuff sold to them. Meanwhile, this Wall Street Journal  article comes out saying Twitter users twice as receptive to advertising. This is bull.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know why? I'll tell you, it's not bull. I bet it's not bull. And of course, you want to ask  Kevin, so I'll let Kevin talk. But I think it's not bull because people on Twitter don't expect ads,  so they get suckered by the ads. Oh, that's bull. What do you think, Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know. I think that the people on Twitter, it would be interesting to see what their main demo  is. And I think that Twitter has been able to capture a lot of people who have never blogged  before, a lot of middle America that don't know how to use computers. I have some friends of mine  that aren't into the whole tech scene, and they're like, well, Twitter just makes sense for me because  it's a simple little box, and I just fill it in, and that's my website now. They even call it their  website, which is weird. That is weird. You know what I mean, though? Can you imagine those people  just getting online for the first time and using the service and then seeing an ad and being like,  oh, I'll click on that. Isn't it true that more newbie people to the internet click more ads

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  than more savvy, tech savvy people? There's a couple of flaws in what you just said. One,  I don't think Twitter is populated with that many newbies. Most people have some experience  online before they even find Twitter or feel that it's useful.  A. And B, I've studied this because everybody and their sister now uses Bitly, which tracks clicks  and click-throughs when they want to shrink a URL. And so you can put some sales pitch into your  Twitter feed like, this is the most amazing, unbelievable video I've ever seen. And then you  give it a little link and then you can see how many people click on it. And it's not a substantial  number. I mean, there are some people that do, but it's not like something that's outrageous.  The most click-throughs I've ever gotten with my 50,000, 60,000 users, which is a good group to  study, is when it said that we talked about Leo going off on Michael Arrington. Because that  wasn't about anything except social. That was pure social because Arrington's both in a social  network. And I think it's still social networks are good for one thing. They're good for social  networking. I think this is a bogus report. B. Well, I didn't read the report. So what are

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they talking about exactly? What was the study all about? A. The Internet Report, survey of 9,200

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Internet users found Twitter users are twice as likely, now this is what it is, and I think this  is true, twice as likely to review or rate products online. That makes sense, right? That's  the currency of Twitter. I just use the Fitbit. This is pretty cool. Visit company profiles  or click on advertisements or sponsors. They say 20% of Twitter users are likely to click on  advertisements or sponsors versus 9% who belong to traditional social networking sites.  Spambots as advertisers.  There are no Twitter ads right now. Well, I guess there kind of are. There's those links on the  right. This is compared to MySpace and Facebook. I mean, it's good news for Twitter. Now,  it's interesting this comes out right when they're getting $100 million more money and getting

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  valued at a billion dollars. You know, John, I can almost buy into it simply because there's  so little ad activity on Twitter. Maybe people don't, you know what I mean? Like people didn't  really start violently reacting to ads until ads started getting really obnoxious on a lot of the  interfaces when the eye blasters and the other stuff came in. So maybe it's because they're  reacting so mildly to it because they just haven't seen any advertising activity or maybe they don't  realize that they're not even seeing any advertising activity. Well, until I see raw numbers or actual

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  sales figures of somebody who's made Twitter a channel, let's say, for selling stuff,  I'm very skeptical of this. Twitter does drive a lot of traffic, right? I do have one point of data

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that was pretty interesting to us at Digg is we have this feed called Digg 2000. It's like  dig underscore 2000 on Twitter. And it's only stories that have 2000 or more Digg's. And we  found that the users that come from that feed consume more pages per visit, not ad clicks,  but pages per visit than other people just coming in from search or from other ways of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  finding the stories. But that's a really quality feed. I mean, if it's dug 2000 times. Right. But

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  not just that one page. As a subscriber to that feed, I can say it's all over the map. So. But  once they come in to dig, they go several pages deep versus like if someone comes in from a Google  search, it's typically bouncing off and then going into something else. This Digg 2000 has

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  almost a million followers. Holy cow. That's numbers just stagger me.  There are kind of, I mean, it's a, it's a variety. Do you guys track it? Let's say you post something

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  right now on dig 2000 and you have a million followers. What number of people will generally

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's got to be Baltimore here. As far as the ad of the, out of those millions, how many links  do you get there? Yeah. Yeah. Let me click through. Oh, clicks. I don't know. I'd have to go check

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  with. Well, I mean, it's like this car that saw this car parked outside my apartment today, pick.  It's got a picture and then it's got a link. So you should be able to count those links. Yeah.  I'm not sure he knows, but it doesn't. I'm thinking somewhere on the 20, 30, 40,000 range.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Holy cow. It depends on. How did you get a million? This must've been on the suggested users list,

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  right? Yeah. It was, it was on there for a while. It's the only way I've ever seen anybody get to a

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  million. Yeah. Everybody but me. I don't care. That's fine. Yes. No, I don't. I do. I don't want

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  to be a club. I have for you, Leo. I think you got ripped off. Oh, you're just trying to get me  going. You are. I know you are telling me this a fact. I brought this up last time I was on the  show and I still believe it's true because you have a show called twit and these lawyers over  there at Twitter probably worried sick that if they, you know, there's an interesting, there was,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  there was an interesting, I think Dave Weiner did this. He took the, the Twitter counter graph of  Michael Arrington's followers and he was on the suggested users list right up to the point where  he published those confidential Twitter documents and he never showed up in the SUL again. And the  graph of his followers is very, very steep. And then as soon as he's off the, off the SUL, it  flattens right out. So what does show, there's two things you get from that. One, that SUL makes a  huge difference in the number of followers. That makes sense. And two, that Twitter can use this,  whether they do intentionally or not, but can use this to manipulate coverage because as soon as  Arrington does something they don't like, bye bye. You are no longer on the SUL and your follower

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  number is just plateau. There you have it. I'm not going to use the word corruption.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's, well, Dave Weiner did. I don't know. So I'm not on the user list anymore. I got,  I got removed a while back. Oh really? Do you know why? Yeah, absolutely. They sent me an email and  they're like, Hey, we, we rotate through people that we think are interesting people for others  to follow. And you've been on there for a while and we're going to yank you off. And they did it  to a bunch of different people. And I was like, so be it. That's just what happens. You know,  they're trying to basically create a list that when you come to Twitter for the first time,  and you sign up, hopefully you'll be able to go through that list and find some people that you  recognize and you might want to follow. So let me, let me just show you the graph. Let me just show

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  you the graph of how it was when you were on the SUL and what happened when you got off the SUL.  Yeah, absolutely. It's going up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up. I could tell you,  in fact, Kevin, I could tell you the date that you got taken off the SUL was August 20th.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, totally. I mean, there's, that's just the nature of the list. I mean, it brings in so many  people that are coming to sign up for new Twitter accounts. So nobody's, I mean, we don't know if

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it's misused or not. It's just clear that it has a lot of power. You're also assuming any of those

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  people are still online, that they actually read the feed. How, what percentage of users actually

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  pay attention? It's going down slowly. And I presume that there's a certain amount of attrition  because a lot of those SUL followers are in fact not committed Twitter users.  They, you know, they got there because Oprah was there and they fall off.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But they wouldn't quit. Kevin wouldn't lose, generally wouldn't lose anybody unless they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  bumped them from this. Well, you lose people a couple of different ways, I think. One,  they delete spammers from time to time, right? So some of those accounts are going to be spam  and you're going to lose some people. The other is people have no idea who you are and they'll be  like, I don't even remember signing up for you. Why am I following him? Because it's kind of  automatic. Yeah. And then the third thing is every time I tweet out like pro Brett Favre stuff,

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I get a lot of people following me. I think everyone should bail out on you now. So here's  my graph. I'm the San Francisco area for God's sake. Here's my graph. And because I'm not on

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  the SUL, it's very steady. Always, always. You could see where they dropped some spammers because  I took a couple of thousand people off there. But it's a pretty predictable linear curve.  Compared to what happens with the SUL. I don't know what to make of that, but it does open up the  potential for corruption because you could say, hey, I don't like your coverage, Mike Harrington,

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I'm taking you off the SUL. But you guys are acting like that's going to actually...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's valuable. Don't say it's not valuable to say, I have a million followers. It shows up in the  New York Times. Whenever an article is written about somebody that is one of the numbers,  if they have a large number that will come up. Having directly seen the results of some of the

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  link throughs with people with a million followers. I understand. You and I know it's worthless,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but the mainstream media doesn't and normal people don't. This is actually part... Sorry, Pat, go

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  ahead. I was going to say, it's not like this is going to be quieting Harrington and maybe  punishing Harrington from Twitter's viewpoint. But it's not like it's silencing Harrington's voice.  Well, it could. It could have a chilling effect.  So everybody else is going to stop reading Harrington's articles and TechCrunch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  If you're a journalist and you're thinking of saying something bad about Twitter and you are  on the suggested users list, you might think twice depending on what you see the value of the SUL.  Then you shouldn't be a journalist. Well, I agree with you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You should sack up. You should buy a pair of ovaries and get a clue.  Yeah, no, you're absolutely right. You know what I mean? It's like,  I hope Winfrey's got two million over a email and a quarter million followers and updates  regularly. I mean, the people that are there are probably legitimate fans.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This is actually part of the talk that I'm going to be giving at FOA next week. But it's about  features that are created on websites that stroke the ego and features that tend to  blow up a site. And one of the big things for Twitter was the follower count because celebrities  basically get on Twitter. They look at that count as a means of social currency. The more the better.  Twitter has, I don't even think they plan to do this, but they've turned every celebrity  into a spokesperson for them. Absolutely.  It didn't work. Millions and millions and millions of dollars of free...  Kevin, you and I did it. You and I had that horse race.  That's what did it. Yeah. And it's happening. Look at what's  happened with all these celebrities now. They're creating videos. They're going out there  in the press. They're on Oprah. I mean, you name it. It's just like, I've never seen this happen  before where celebrities will just go out there and freely promote and plug something.  Brilliant. It's brilliant.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're excited about it. And what's amazing about it is it's not somebody pretending to have a  website they built when it's built by some little cadre of people from their agents office or  something. But this is actually like Shaq sitting in a bar somewhere or a restaurant or whatever  Shaq tweets from or following Tony Hawk. I think it's a hoot to follow Tony Hawk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One of the other things, one of the other points real quick that I wanted to make is that  one of the things I think is first is that I believe that in some ways spam actually helps  Twitter because what it does is it increases follower counts on a lot of these smaller accounts  and it gives people a perception of audience. So someone will come in and say, oh, I have 50  people following me. Maybe 25 of those accounts are fake, but they believe there's an audience  there. And so they engage with the product more. It's just a really weird ecosystem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Do you, are you going to talk in your talk about things like that that are brilliant hacks in  effect, social engineering versus features that you add to a site that add genuine value to the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  site? Well, I think that's the next step for Twitter. I think that Twitter, it's not just going  to be the raw number of followers, but it's going to be how influential that person is and looking  at other factors in order to determine that. And that's some of the stuff I'm playing around with  on We Follow. We have a bunch of people tagging themselves under certain keywords and we're  starting to look at how many people inside of certain tags are being followed by other  tastemakers inside of that tag. So if Shaq were to tweet something out about Nike, I would instantly  know how many people that are fans of Nike are following Shaq and how important is that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fun times. I liken it to old media where you could, for instance, on a show like the  Screensavers, you could boost ratings by having more low cut tops on the girls,  or you could boost ratings by putting more content in. It's two very different approaches. One is  kind of shallow and manipulative and one is kind of more genuine. But there was a point where we  had that balance though, right? Don't do that. There's a balance. I don't know. I'm one of those,  look what we do on Twitter. This is not exactly a sexy production. We try to make it a value, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but there was a time when the Screensavers and love them or hate them when Paul Block,  our executive producer, came on and threw Morgan Webb up there in a cute little Windows Air shirt  and she was delivering awesome content. She's an amazingly brilliant smart woman.  So you're saying do both?  Very attractive.  So you're saying do both?  It worked for our fans, you know?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I guess that's true. As long as you're not sliding the content, I guess.  I am allergic to manipulation and I hate when manipulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You are so not allergic to manipulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Maybe because I'm so susceptible to manipulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yes, you may despise and hate manipulation.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I'm saying. I don't like it because I'm a sucker for it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Immune suggests that it has no impact on me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I probably wouldn't hate it so much if I were immune to it.  So seeing as I'm not immune to it, it bugs me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  The chat room went nuts with that one, Leo.  That is BSLeo says.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That I don't like manipulation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that you're immune to it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, that's what I said. I am not. Patrick nailed me on that one. I never  pretended I was immune to it, but I am. But it bugs me.  I always feel like you should try to give value.  I don't know. I think maybe it's more long-term successful if you give value.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I remember when working at Tech TV, we all had these little TVs in our cube.  Remember that? So we could be sitting there and preparing for that day's show,  but yet they'd rerun the screensavers from the day before.  Right? So we'd be sitting there and the screensavers would be running on.  Of course, you watch your own segments because you're like, okay, how did I look?  Did I do okay? Did I get the points across?  And then Morgan would come up on the screen and do her Windows tip.  I knew the Windows tip, but yet I would still turn and watch Morgan on the screen.  You watch it.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's what I hate. I don't like it that I could be manipulated like that.  Maybe that's it.  Real quickly.  Ah, come you don't watch Fox News, Leo.  I do. I have it on right now. Let me tell you something about Fox News.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's right. You had it on last time I was there.  Because on the weekends, MSN...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, it's funny that you should say that because I just know... I don't know.  I never noticed that before. They have the cutest anchors. It's all cute anchors.  They're all perky blonde, cute anchors on there or in commentators. I never noticed that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  No, that's not true, Leo. There's a few brunettes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Okay. But I don't know. The reason is because I need to have a news channel on and MSNBC  does prison breakout all weekend long. It's the most revolting program. Talking about  God awful programming. And CNN is like, I don't know what they're doing. They're in rerun heaven.  Larry King.  So I have to watch Fox because if something... Because God forbid something horrible should  happen in the middle of a show. I want to know it. I don't want to be in the dark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I thought it was explaining why you were bouncing on that ball constantly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's just to keep me pumped. I've hooked it up to my pump. Nintendo slashes Wii price by $50.  They're not already number one. MMS and your iPhone. Exciting?  Welcome to 1999.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Finally people can send me some of the images and movies where I won't have to like cut and paste  a password on my Mac. Yeah, I hated that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, that's a good point. That's a good point. Google Book Settlement on the rocks again. The  Department of Justice weighed in and Google and the judge said, all right, back to the table. We  got to figure out a better settlement. So the hearing is put off. Windows 7 due earlier  because a couple of companies might just push a PC out with Windows 7.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, they haven't changed the release date for Windows 7.  October 22nd. There's kind of some hacks you can do to  get access to Windows 7 earlier on a new system. Some small custom PC makers, according to Crave,

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  are claiming they'll start shipping systems as early as October 13th with Windows 7 on it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh, I had something I want to talk about. Very importantly, thanks to all of us.  I tweeted out last week a link to an old screensaver segment.  Yes. G4 Media stepped in and took it down off of YouTube.  What? Yeah. Why would they do that?  Because they own the rights to it and they want the traffic to go to the website.  This concerns me though because it's really good. You know, there's a lot of tutorials and how to's  that got snipped up and put up on YouTube and they exist out there. And it worries me that  they're taking down good quality content for no apparent reason at all.  It says remove from G4 Media after I...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  They're protecting their... Wait, it was G4's YouTube account?  No, no.  Or removed at the request of G4 Media.  Exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  There have been screensavers clips on YouTube for five years just sitting there,  but now they're starting to do DMCA takedowns.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, some of the best moments of the show too, which is too bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the bit that you put up there?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Mine was about hacking a toothbrush into Make It a Sonicare toothbrush. So I took like an  $8 toothbrush and made it a really expensive one.  So it was your segment?  Yeah, it was my segment. Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  You know what I bet it was? I bet you linking to it generated enough traffic that it raised  awareness at G4 and they had it pulled.  All right. I have another possible scenario.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah. No. Wait, can I throw in before you get the real answer, Leo?  Yep.  It's because they were afraid that the numbers might go up and they didn't want that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They were afraid they'd get more hits on Kevin Rowe's five-year-old toothbrush segment  than on current programming on G4. I think you're exactly right.  Yeah.  I think that's exactly right.  No, I doubt that.  I got... Okay. This is my theory. I got a call. I think I've told you guys this.  Got a call from people at G4 about three months ago. They said,  we have been over the past three years, we have every show ever done high quality tapes  or whatever, hard drives, I don't know what, of every show ever done on Tech TV from 1998.  I know you don't believe this, John. From 1998 to 2004, we have for the last few years been  digitizing every one of these. We would like to know if you're okay with it if we put up a website  that is Tech TV Retro that has everything you ever did on it. And I said, all right with it.  I would sing it to the heavens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And sell DVDs with your face on the outside of it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they can. They have the right to do that.  Right? Because we all signed that paper that said, all media, now or future, forever.  Yeah, no, I didn't sign that.  You didn't sign that?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No, I didn't need a separate contract.  I've never signed away the rights to my image.  You didn't have a personal services contract?  I never had a contract, Leo.  Oh, you were so smart.  Who's saying they're going to be repackaging and reselling these? G4?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No, they did not say to me that we were repackaging them. They said they would be  making a free website where people could go see high quality digitized copies of all the stuff  we ever did.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Is this G4 or someone who...

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This was G4. This was the people in the internet division there. They said, hey, we're real big  fans. We've always wanted to get this back on the air. We have been kind of quietly digitizing  everything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but I mean, this is going to cost them just tons of money and bandwidth charges.  They'll have to monetize it somehow, right?

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah, I'm sure they'll have to put pre-rolls on and probably...  Of course, they're business. They're going to monetize it. I don't mind that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So if they are going to do that, I could see maybe why they'd start issuing takedowns on YouTube.  Maybe. I've always think it's dumb to take down anything anywhere. Just put it out there and it  promotes you that you've got the high quality version back at the ranch.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, or they could just upload them all to YouTube and call it a day, right?  They don't have to put that aside.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, G4, if you're listening, what's the deal?  Screw you, G4.  No, no, I'm not saying screw you. I said, that's great. I'd love to see you do that. Please do that.  You would have no issue for me because I don't, unlike obviously G4 Media,  I don't feel like those things should be kept back. They should be out there.  Don't you all agree?  I agree with that.  You wouldn't feel bad, Patrick, if all those great shows were...

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Love to see it out there. I just don't particularly want to see my image on the  cover of a DVD without my permission. That's all. I would love to see the video posted online.  Good man, Patrick.  I love it. That's it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They did it anyway. Remember, aren't there a bunch of DVDs with you showing,  cut downs of you showing them to do different things?

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's an easy lawsuit for Patrick. Patrick, you actually do want to see your image on a DVD.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's an easy half million in your bank account, Pat. That's cool.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  All right. Well, you guys must give me the name of a good lawyer. Let's get this rolling.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Ladies and gentlemen, thank you so much for being here. It's always fun to get the old  gang back together again. Patrick Norton is on Dig... Dignation. Patrick Norton is on Tekzilla.  HD Nation.  HD Nation is the new show with Robert Heron. We asked Robert to come with us. I think he was  unavailable. I wanted to get Robert on too, but that's a great show.  Thank you.  You must all watch it. It's at Revision 3 or just go to Tekzilla.com.  T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A.com with a beautiful, I'm so jealous, Veronica Belmont.  Smart, too.  Well, smart number one. Just the greatest. Just really fantastic. Kevin Rose is the Dig guy.  Of course, Dignation is still the best and best traveled tech show on the network.  We do travel a lot.  When's the next on the road for Dignation?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I don't know when the next one is.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They just show up in a limousine and they take you to the airport  and you arrive and you say, where are we? Okay. Hello, Cleveland.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That would be awesome. That is not the case.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Our best, the best thing we ever did, Patrick, St. Louis.  Or...  That was epic.  Or Tom's River, New Jersey. That was pretty good, too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Tom's River, New Jersey was fun. It's very close to my folks' hometown or my hometown,  but St. Louis, all those people out in 13 degree weather. That was just incredible.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We kept signing until they came and they took the tent that was over us away. They took the stage  we were sitting on away. They took the table we were signing and we continued to sign. It was just  us and two chairs in the parking lot until every single person had an autograph. And that was it.  That was the peak of my career.  John C. Navorek is at Channel Navorek and someday he will peak, but not yet.  I will be what?  I don't know. The peak of your career has not happened yet.  Am I wrong? Is it all downhill?  I think you have help on you.  It's true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, yeah. All right.  It's that old cell phone, I think.
