Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a bad person no she's discriminating I recently learned that that was not cool at all oh no  according to the rules the rules of the internet rules of Twitter who knows but if you follow so  many people then you can't I don't know I like to be able to actually keep track of what's happening

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  it breaks it as a utility it's I think it does if you yeah well then it's just a it's just chaos

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was sorry we didn't get Kevin falls 102 people how is that ball I fall about five

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  you track of how do you actually get a cohesive thread out of like 13,000 people you don't and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  even even Scoble who was promoting this idea for a long time Scoble said oh you have to follow  everybody follows you and then even he admitted no it's broken it's and left so not broken yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  but it's it's not broken it's just it's what is it's basically Leo because Leo's bailed out

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  he hates Twitter because that's the name to it well I'm not fond of that but you can't blame me  for that I was I was to it before they were Twitter let's put it that way it's basically

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  people that are using the system the way it wasn't designed and it falls over when you use  it that way and it's it's a violation of their terms of use and they put a cap now you can only

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh yeah that's right they changed that yeah Kevin I tell you the deal I dropped you I'm gonna put  you on I'm gonna follow you but I did it because during that era when you and Leo were fighting  it out I felt obliged to Leo take one number away from you and to give Leo one more it didn't do  any good I'm gonna cry I'm very touched but didn't do any good that's what I did it's kind of that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  man that's man love now that we're back together I will you know actually we had a meeting on Friday  called bear hug camp the point of which was it was kind of started by Dave Weiner and Steve  Gilmore the point of it was to bring all the players together and we actually wish we'd had  you or Leah or somebody from bears Leo by the way Leah who is the creator of pounce which Kevin  is what is your title about your CEO president what do you what do you well we we all kind of

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  share the responsibilities it was just a little project that the three of us got together Daniel

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Burka Leah Culver myself and decided to create yeah it's very cool love pounce love Jaiku love  Twitter love all of these things but one of the problems is there are all these in you know  individual silos of information and just like in the early days of email when you had a copyserv  account you couldn't email somebody on MCI mail we want to make it so that everybody is federated  and the data is kind of transferred from one to the other so we had a lot of the players came it  was really good you know because I'm running this laconic instance at twit army and and but but but  but actually was interesting because Alex Payne Jack Dorsey and Biz Stone came awesome from  Twitter they didn't stay they came because I think because they felt like and this is the point of  bear hug they kind of felt like if we don't show up then we're showing disdain for the community so  they felt like they had to come and the question that was asked of them several times in many  different ways was when you're gonna restore track when you're gonna restore I am when you're gonna  make the the data stream of Twitter available to others and and you know it Twitter's fallen on  this excuse that there's a technical reason they can't do it that it's you know it's bringing the  search system down but I think that that's kind of no longer credible and I think they even are  saying well we're trying to figure out a way to do it I think what's happening is they want to that  that's the real value of Twitter is this data stream created by all its users you kind of have  this same issue Kevin with dig and even I think there's been some push push and pull between dig  and its consumers some of whom feel like well we created the content on dig we have we feel like we

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  should have some say in how it's used well they have absolute say that everything that is created  dig falls under public domain creative comments right they can take they can use our API take all  the data and read it split in any way they feel fit so yeah I'm stealing it tomorrow hey can we

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  get to the news this is news okay this is a big story something is there something I should be

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  doing in the video world by the way just as an aside no I can't do video on the on the threesome

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  so excellent just have to stare at me unfortunately just check it but I have to say I saw you I saw you  on Friday when we were at CNET bear hug camp was CNET very kindly kindly let us use a conference

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  room and you look fantastic Molly oh Leo thank you just just now that is news it was bear hug

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  talking about was bear hug camp in San Francisco yeah was it was at CNET okay Dan Farber let us

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  use a cup we host all these hip things that I don't find about until find out about until they're

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well publicized I wish it had been better publicized but we but I think the idea was  to have the players in the room and I hope they invited you Kevin and Leah and Daniel but I don't  know if they did nobody invited me you're not a player hmm actually people were saying where's  Dvorak and I said I don't know if dark this is the kind of thing Dvorak would come to I think he  would cover the results thereof but I don't think he's interested in process particularly are you  no that's what I thought so I let you off but I like to get invited yeah I'm sorry I should have  invited you I won't invite you next time but the good news is I think that that you know Biz and  Jack and Alex said it pretty much committed we're gonna make these these these streams available just  as you have Kevin we're gonna make this content available for developers to use in other ways and  that's really what we're asking you know you go to Twitter it still says we're working to restore  I am services thanks for your patience it said that since May they're not working on it they I  think what happened is they said hmm we can make some money on this let's hold on to it and figure

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  out what's going on I don't know I had a went and had lunch with Evan Williams the other day he's  one of the co-founders of Twitter and we were talking about scaling the site and he said that  they're finally they have a really good team in place you know they acquired some eyes which was  their search if you go to search.twitter.com and that actually works very well and that the people  they brought in from some eyes I think there was three or four engineers are now kind of like their  lead architect and they're rewriting a lot of the code and well see this was the issue because some

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  eyes was the only company that was getting the we call we call it the fire hose the full stream  of information and they and they folded some eyes back into themselves they spent 10% of their  some eyes basically taking it back in I think I think Gnip is getting the fire hose too but  but Gnip says we can't let others see it Twitter says they can so there's just a question about  what so anyway as a somebody puts data on Twitter which all of us do and add value to Twitter it  seems not unreasonable for us to encourage Twitter to make that data available to others some eyes  wouldn't exist if they hadn't done that and some eyes was an amazing innovation and more and there  should be more like that that's the point that's all it is good can we get to the news yeah what is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the news John well I don't know you got it on the delicious site I don't actually I didn't really

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  do much today I didn't do much this week Molly you covered the news what is the big what is the  big story of what would you say it's the big story of the week the Seinfeld gates part de part to

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  do as much as I was hoping that there would be other things to talk about that was kind of what  we were left with at the end was Seinfeld gates part de which I have said on Twitter and elsewhere

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I thought was hilarious it's funny you were actually laughing out loud are you kidding me I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  chuckled chuckled audibly I audibly chuckled let's see what that would sound like how was it what is

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a Molly would chuckle it's like it's sort of like a maybe more like a giggle but I don't want to

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  be all girly it was like a chuckle so I'm watching this I'm watching the move one one of these you  know channel I think it was the IFC you know the film channel yeah right and they were showing a  movie and I was putting it on a DVD everyone says I love you the Woody Allen musical was that any  good actually there's a lot of gags in there and they're the same gags that are in that crappy  commercial they couldn't even invent new gags I'm telling you to say if you go see that movie  everyone says I love you or just watch a kid kill all the songs and just listen to the guys the same  gags the person sitting at the table the old lady that should get ready for this you want to hear

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's not like any of that was groundbreaking comedy like the lady is not groundbreaking comedy  but I thought that gates and Seinfeld together had funny energy and I think that I thought they're  very funny yeah encouraging more of the same I like it it's absurdist and amusing I think it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Microsoft's right to throw away 300 million dollars in any way they see fit I don't think  these are good ads for anything but they certainly although there's an interesting interpretation  remember last week Ryan Block deconstructed episode one and came up with a lot of interesting stuff  like the shoe store was really a Mac store in a mall and it was discount shoes that didn't quite  fit but you could make them stretch to fit he came up with a lot of interesting kind of I don't know

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  so I take it Leo Leo that you didn't read my PC magazine column where I interpreted the entire  thing as an S&M pickup scene it's leather from exactly this get this here's the interpretation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that was that was vaguely hot I'm not gonna lie so so so the little old lady wandering through is  Steve Jobs they say very explicitly that she's been with us for 12 years Steve Jobs has been  nappled 12 years she runs everything secretly she fixes the car she does the laundry nothing  happens without her there's some interesting semiotics going on this is getting ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  now I admire the idea of doing a deep kind of a metaphorical allegorical kind of interpretable  kind of commercial for the nerds out there that want to go through this but does this sell any  product it's just totally ridiculous and does anybody even get out how many utterly ridiculous

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  seeming branding campaigns have we been subject to over the years where there was no you know  ad in play well take it writes but somebody buys the rights to a stadium for crying well taken the  McAfee Coliseum has never made me make by any software I don't it was be it would have been  ridiculous for Microsoft to come out with an ad that looked anything like the Apple that I'm a  Mac I'm a PC or and I'm arguing these points or even an ad that attempted to pimp Vista because  it's about something that tries to sell some damn thing I think I think this was saying except

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Microsoft I think that seems like it needs sorry it seems like this is the plan all along I mean  it's got the tech guys talk about it like tech guys and girls sorry Molly all talking about it  and you know we're basically we're thinking about Vista again it's in our minds you know we talked  about whether it sucks or doesn't suck I don't know but is that who they need to impress with  they want the hardcore geeks to get back on board right they want that kind of like I don't know  maybe they're looking for that top-down approach where if the hardcore geeky people adopt it or  finally take a look at Vista again they'll say oh it's not so bad and then that'll filter down to

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  mom and dad so this is not aimed this is not aimed at general mainstream America this is aimed

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  at us I mean when you show Bill Gates's ID and it's his photo of him being arrested yeah obviously  only people that know that are gonna be the hardcore but we all did didn't we we all said

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  there were there definitely are Easter eggs all over the place but I can also see just you know  for the non deconstructing crowd for the kind of more mainstream the idea that they might I can see  it being just as aimed at people who just are out there thinking everything I've heard about Vista

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  is toilet but Microsoft's not so bad it makes you like Bill Gates and I guess the question I have  is didn't Bill just leave what's he's gone he's history so why is he the like the front man what  he's the whole thing was a fake he isn't you always have said that he never went he's never  meant to leave but now they're advert basically these are ads for Bill Gates if you ask me and  what a human you know funny guy Bill Gates is he's a laugh riot and do you find it a little  insulting that they that the whole point of the ad was Bill and Jerry are so rich and out of touch  they have to move in with a regular family to understand what regular people are like that's a  little is that yeah that's a little like do you really want that to be the message but again I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  mean it's sort of like if they tried to make a commercial that was pro Vista right what else are

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  they gonna say right you know how about making it you know the advertising is not a new idea and  there are mechanisms that are out there for selling products and getting your reputation to where it  should be going off the deep end with some crackpot crazy advertising campaign thinking that you know  a few people were interpreted or even worse that bloggers are gonna I had to say I did this myself  I blogged these but they're gonna just run them you know and it's gonna be free advertising  because that Microsoft's a cheap company they don't do a lot of advertising the whole thing to me just  seems to be so off base and so off the wall and ineffective I don't think it's gonna work I think  it's 300 million dollars if that's what they're gonna spend wasted eventually it's although they

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  keep saying dope just bear with us because it's gonna start having content they keep saying no  they said that they said this is just we're setting it up they're getting longer each one's  longer this last one but they're not airing that for now first of all I think you made your the  point actually John because how many people have I haven't seen it on TV no I never have I mean I

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  know that it's been on during shows I watched but I must have fast-forwarded through it I've only

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  watched them online so really it may be this is actually brilliant because maybe Kevin's right

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  maybe it is totally Kevin you might be right that it is totally a love letter to the community who  will then stop saying because really who doesn't take a cheap shot at Microsoft or  best at this any time they can't you know that's kind of intriguing that's that's the case that's

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  very innovative markets getting too much negative publicity Molly for this to be the case wait a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  minute didn't you immediately go watch it as soon as you saw a link to it yeah I did any blog about

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it before I watched the cat playing the piano too that doesn't mean I'm gonna get a kitten

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  tomorrow but you liked it right you were like oh I like that cat Kevin was it the most Doug one

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  of the most Doug links of the week it was pretty high up there I don't know I'd have to go check

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I would bet you know cuz everybody everybody wants to see it oh and the next one it's gonna

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  be even you know hotter everyone's just gonna be waiting for the next yeah I don't know I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  you might be right this I hadn't really considered the thought that it is because because Mike my  complaint was if you're aiming at a mainstream audience they don't know what the hell's going  on it's just weird but if you're aiming at the insider geek crowd the influencers maybe  that might not be a bad that's an interesting strategy anyway I'm telling you Lito I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  it's good they're gonna get a lot of free publicity they're gonna get a lot of free bloggers are  gonna put the thing up but they're getting negative it's all in a negative sense I don't  think it's necessarily good even though all publicities measure by the pound yeah I think  that's true to a point but the thing is that this isn't I'm not hearing anything positive except  a few weirdos out there that think these ads are funny I'm sorry yeah I'm sorry I mean of the few

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it was people with different tastes it was in the top 10 technology digs 3,128 digs that's pretty  good right under 30 beautiful Photoshop tutorials and 28 useful cheap cheats well that tells you  something by the way you Kevin Rose hit the nail on the head we're gonna talk about the  new Nanos and you couldn't have been more right in every respect not just about the  Nanos but about iTunes Kevin but first let's show you how a real ad is done what do you say  next time you go shopping I want you to take along your Visa card my friends Visa makes it  safe it makes it secure Visa does so many things to make sure that they prevent detect  and resolve online fraud so you don't have to feel bad when you go shopping even if it's  online or off you just whip out that Visa card and you know you're not liable for unauthorized  purchases on your Visa card that's what I'm telling you safe secure Visa that's real peace

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  of mind right Jeff Smith all right now I get it I've got to give them some credit for being  safe and secure no problems they assure it's Visa Visa Visa that's commercial all right

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin Rose you hit the nail on the head I was very impressed that document you had obviously  was the real deal apparently so I mean that's that was a picture of the actual Nano I just got

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  mine today by the way how do you like it good it's super thin it's tiny I got it because I

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  wanted to start using that Nike fit right now you still have to buy the thing for the shoe though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  right right correct just goes in your shoe and you don't need a dongle for the iPod anymore it

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  just it automatically senses it and what does it sense how many have you still need a dongle

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  for the the Nano but not for the touch oh to the touch okay so you bought a Nano right got the  Nano and is it pretty is it glary yeah it's no it's not too bad it there's a little bit of  screen glare there that wouldn't be there if they went with a flat screen but you know it's the it's  pretty clear and the colors are amazing they're very vibrant is it did you have the fat Nano  because I'm told it's the same screen I have the first gen Nano okay I still have an upgrade this  is my first upgrade in like years and years and years well we're glad you could afford to get a

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Nano Kevin I'm glad you said that too because it answered my question which was like is this is it  enough to upgrade like I mean I we have the fat Nano at the house and I can't see reason

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  unless you want that shake thing the shake to shuffle which is kind of which really yeah I mean

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  it's neat but you'd actually spend money just to get that if you had a perfectly good working

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nano like my theory Apple has finally fit done the Detroit thing when a product gets mature you  can't really add significant new features so what do you do you change the styling in order to  encourage people to buy new ones you have to change the styling you add fins so basically  that's what they're doing here they're adding fins how long can you do that for though well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  yeah I mean for years no I know that the 50s and 60s that's where that was you know the dominant  kind of thinking but it but in before that previous that in the 40s and 30s and since then and  especially in the 70s and 80s it turns out that you can't you there's no there's not enough talent  in the world that can make that work I mean we haven't seen that I mean if you look at that  little Audi TT I was I was looking at some of my old photos that was stood at Hanover like 10-12  years ago and there's one of them there in Germany interesting this car hasn't changed at all well

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they've got the best simply the best industrial designer in the world Jonathan Ive if anybody  could do it it'd be Johnny but you got a point that there there's a there's a diminishing returns  especially because I don't think consumers I think consumers know more than they ever did before  also the other thing is a car wears out the Nano or the iPod not really gonna wear out yeah yeah but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  some people like to load them up so they do kind of wear out you know if you got the thing full

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they need and the batteries you need another one for the spillover the batteries wear out yeah no

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm saying that the many people I know you know these a lot of kids they put their entire collection  in there and then they keep throwing stuff on there they don't like to erase anything well look

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  at Kevin he has his first-generation Nano how long is that four years yeah something like that yeah I

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  think the next wave though the next I see them adding more and more kind of technology bundles  inside here you know GPS support internet connectivity you walk in your house it automatically  sinks wirelessly there's gonna be a bunch of new features that are sprinkled into these devices  over the next few years to keep people buying them what do you need a GPS and a Nano for Detroit

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  has learned all too painfully that at some point you do have to innovate yes because the Japanese  came and stole their thunder exactly and I've heard a lot of people trying to still tell me that  Apple is the innovator but when it comes to the iPods there's not a lot going on there except for  I mean certainly the touch and the iPhone are taking it in a whole new direction and I think  Kevin's right again that that's gonna have to be where they take the iPod line because really you  can't keep putting out a Nano like 15 months after the last one that just looks a little different

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I got it Apple has figured this out I found this on dig US patent application to zero zero eight  oh two one eight three one zero the company details a way to stop us using unauthorized  training shoes with the insole sensors a patent that allows you to the last shoe DRM for your  shoes pairing a sensor with an authorized garment such as a running shoes shirt or slack I want

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  off the ride is there really that much piracy going on within the running shoes like there's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  a big shoe problem like people really are well I just can't I'm not buying that Nike I want my

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Adidas to work with my iPod hey go to Amazon and look at the Amazon reviews for spore spore has  one and a half stars even though it's one of the best games in years and the reason is a concerted  effort by anti DRM forces to to jam the reviews if you look at the reviews all those negative  reviews are I'm not buying it because of DRM I don't like DRM there's a real attempt now out  there to say if it's got DRM we're gonna slam it and as a result they're getting bad reviews on  Amazon somebody called me on the radio show said is sport really bad because I've seen the reviews

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  and it's terrible you know what's interesting is that this kind of thing really was even not in  the 1980s every time you know people came up with these crazy schemes to protect software from people  backing it up or copying it for their friends there would be this huge public outcry I mean there was  a scheme once on a floppy disk where the idea was that you that each individual disk that you buy had  a hole burn yeah and it would be mapped when they when they wrote the disk and if the map  didn't show the hole when you made a copy you know there wasn't a hole there in other words in the  other disk and of course it was Central Point software out of Oregon that kind of found the  browned about way of beating this I remember that but people would make a fuss like there was no  tomorrow and this never ended it actually partly sunk wordstar when they came over the word start  2000 which was copy protected this is this is not going away well not to mention the fact that the

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  DRM on spore was cracked before spore was released well and the main thing I think about spore the  reason that I mean you know arguably things have been coming out with DRM that have you're not going  to see games with that DRM for ever in the marketplace you're not going to see it but the  sport DRM broke right the thing is that DRM technology has not kept up it breaks things for  people it ruins the consumer experience so it turns absolutely legitimate buyers into obviously  suspected pirates but then people who cannot use the product that they paid for and that's where  the outrage about sport came out is it wasn't just DRM it was poorly DRM right and everybody

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  became aware of just how stupid DRM can be so I have spore I installed it on both my Mac and my  PC I have no problems what's what's the deal with this DRM it's working for me too it didn't break

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it broke for evoke for an angry minority but people were having a lot of problems registering  the point is the point is these are honest users and activating but they were all on it yeah and

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  if you were a dishonest guy you just downloaded the cracked version from a torrent and had no  problems at all so the people were having problems with the honest users this is exactly not what you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  want to do as a company well and that's exactly what DRM does right I mean that's almost point  of DRM right like that and not the point but the people who end up getting bitten by it are the  people who are attempting to use it legit is casual piracy a big problem is that the real reason is

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  because oh they're you know my people are gonna make copies for their friends no come on I don't

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  buy that I mean I would assume that they would say yes but I can't believe that's that's really  digging into their profits to the extent that like large-scale you know Chinese counterfeiting is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  because of micro because of spell checkers so let's get back to this point about surprising  people so what you're saying is that you'd rather be kind of like pushed around by the marketing  machines which is basically what the surprise mechanism is all about these large corporate  marketing machines are gonna push you in one direction or another and you'd rather you'd  prefer that to advance information based on people actually doing some research and trying  to help the public make decisions what decision there's nothing to buy there's nothing to decide

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm just saying yeah no I like the story I like to be told a story John I just think don't you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  don't have to I mean it is all optional it's all optional reading you know like you don't have to  you don't have to voraciously follow every rumor and then unfortunately I do I see so you have to  take responsibility for your own rumor-mongering and then you know that's how you get spoiled

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  well I'm saying Kevin or somebody I mean I'm not saying it was a big deal that I knew but  you know there's something fun about remember don't you remember the good old days when we  sat in the audience and Steve Jobs is up on the stage and he says we've got three new devices  we're gonna announce today an internet appliance the best iPod we've ever made oh yeah and a phone  and these three things are all in one it's the iPhone and it's the first you ever saw and you're  yeah don't you remember those days those days it was like a year and a half ago I remember my first

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apple keynote though my first Macworld keynote was the one where they announced the original colored  iMacs yeah and I remember being I mean I love that I think I think I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think John you don't I don't have an appreciation no I'm not 12 anymore that's the difference for  the mastery the marketing mastery that Steve Jobs and the Apple team are showing an amazing now I  know I'm selling like I just a cracked Apple fanboy here and I and I don't mean to sound  that way I wish other I would love it if Bill Gates could do the same thing oh he could though

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  that's the whole thing I think gate should do that you know through a big event dress in black come  out there and then it's like every year show off something really cool like you know surface or

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  whatever it is that he has cool for the year and instead of saying like oh and one more thing he  could say that's not all folks or something you know you have some like tagline that's not all  you could do that no I think no I have to say I have a real admiration for the attempt to create  magic and and that sense of awe and wonder and surprise and and I think that's good marketing  now what's interesting why do you think it is Kevin that Apple which had done a great job for  years last three years keeping this stuff quiet is now completely unable to keep it quiet it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  turned around I have no idea I think this is just a fluke this time I don't know if I'm gonna get

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the fat the fat nano they knew about that we saw pictures I'm thinking that Apple involved  though yeah when you're talking consumer devices it's easier with a computer isn't it a consumer  device you got a lot of I mean what we saw was was probably that that that document that you had  was didn't come from somebody at Apple probably came from a vendor right you know so you can't

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  keep these guys quiet he actually would in the game I play in the in the writing game you'd  always go to the hard disk guys because they they don't everything sure they know everything they  have to see everything they know everything in advance because nothing can be built without them  being somehow involved and you'd always and they'd always kind of and they didn't mind talking if you  didn't use their name and so you could kind of keep up with this stuff you can't keep everything  a secret I mean unless you're unless you're unless you're totally vertically and horizontally  integrated to such an extent that you can lock everything down like that like for our lock talking  about luck like Lockheed's skunk works I mean they could be building a rocket ship for all we know we  would never find out about it because they do everything in the in-house they internally yeah

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  yeah you're you I remember that I mean I've seen that people troop in and out of your house talking  to you or you take I mean you you were always very good at getting those sources is mainly I'll tell

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  you I'll tell you the key to success is that you for one thing you can't you have a bad memory like  I do you write down the important stuff but you don't remember anybody's name right and literally  and then you don't keep a lot in your notes are like sketchy and to be honest about it I am not  lying when I say I can't remember who told me stuff after they tell me not to use their name I  seriously and it's not and you could put me on a lie detector and I can't remember their name but  the key is I don't remember names very well Kevin Rose listen and learn taking I'm taking notes but  not writing down names no names because they can subpoena the notes you know and then he wants to  well by the way the irony of that is about every like every decade somebody comes up to me and they  say you know I'm the guy who told you blah blah blah and I look at him I go I don't even know who  the hell this guy is and I'm dead serious because I don't remember him from Adam you know I think

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  one thing that has changed maybe is because of the internet and this is where you're benefiting  Kevin is there are these now vast communities I'm looking in our chat room and somebody's saying oh  yeah my dad's an engineer at the Longheed skunkworks there these vast communities now and this stuff is  a little bit more porous because well look at dig I mean you have this vast community of users who  are sharing this information and they get some and they get some stock and trade from knowing  something right yeah right it's a value no stock but yeah I'm sorry carefully use that phrase  carefully right we're gonna come back actually some some scary news for eBay could be big trouble on  the horizon but first I want to mention this episode brought to you by Gobi not the desert  the global mobile internet Gobi from Qualcomm this is kind of cool while you're starting to  see him in laptops now it's a new Gobi device a wireless network card that's built into the new  notebooks from leading notebook manufacturers HP is doing them Dell has one to or is going to have  one Toshiba they they allow you this card allows you to access multiple wireless carriers networks  so you're so when you buy these laptops your network hardware it doesn't have to be carrier  specific it supports HSDPA and EVDO you know you get that real fast 3G connectivity it's built in  so you won't lose it won't break off and it's really global connectivity really amazing they  call it the world is your hotspot multi-mode support for corporate network managers one device  and multiple carrier support means one skew notebook purchases for any geography and no more  hassle carrying around those external EVDO cards or HSDPA cards absolutely productive more places  around the world with a new Gobi the world is your hotspot learn more about the Gobi powered  notebooks from Qualcomm available at leading notebook manufacturers go to Gobi anywhere  gobi anywhere dot com slash products for the Gobi notebook for you thanks to Qualcomm and Gobi for  their support don't have a jingle for them that'd be a good one easy one Gobi Gobi Gobi go go go go  be we'll write a jingle for them so according to Barron's in a report published today but signing  a report published last week by wedge partners eBay may have to cut 1,500 jobs the wedge report  says eBay's business is deteriorating the company is readying layoffs of 10% of its employee as  much as 15,000 no no I'm sorry has 15,000 employees could affect 10% of its 15,000 that's  the 1500 what do you think eBay could it be in trouble it's had a lock for a long time on  this auction market is there more competition Molly wood is there more mark more auction sites

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  out there now well I think it's not so much that there are more auction sites out there it's that  people are getting I think people are over the auction thing so the whole competition yeah and  they're I mean they are really restructuring their business they're really moving toward more fixed  price sales more buy it now more catering to big sellers I mean I actually think if anything they're  positioning themselves to take more of an Amazon model because I think that is where their competition

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  is well I think Amazon's been killing him but you know there's a my stepson Eric who does the  Craigs Finder open source thing and some other projects he was made for a couple years ago him  and his wife were doing this you know doing a lot of business on eBay and then more and they stopped  and in it when he gets a hold of me all he does is harangue me about how screwed up eBay is they  charge too much they don't have you know there's all kinds of issues with the payments they don't  support the vendors the whole and the scam of the whole auction thing has kind of fallen apart  it's been semi-scammed by you know these automated systems that will bid at the last split second  and the whole thing is I think the whole structure has fallen apart now where's Meg Whitman by the  way she's busy campaigning for the McCain payment maybe she should be you know I mean she spoke at  the Republican Convention this is the one of the issues that you have you have these this is typical  of high-tech companies hello Kevin can you hear me there's these guys there's these guys who have  the brains they have the vision they go and they start these ideas and they make them they take  them so far and they're part of the the whole system in terms of you know they can make the  when it comes to like a little bitty decision at some point they'll make the right one somebody  else won't they're out of the picture and the next thing you know the company is making bad  decisions because they don't really know what they're doing and the next thing you know they're in  the toilet and this company is one of those companies that's headed in that direction I think  I think they're toast to be honest about it wow I go to the site all I see is buy now buy now buy  now all I'm seeing is a bunch of little Chinese shops that are in mostly in Southern California  that are bringing stuff in from China and they're selling it you know really fast I'm not seeing  the stuff that they used to have the kinds of things and the scammers they've done nothing  about the scammers they pushed everybody toward PayPal which doesn't help at all I mean it's like  it seems to me that the whole thing is falling apart and when they had when they were to get  had it together and they were they bought like Butterfield and Butterfield one of the auction  sites then they were gonna get into the real business and maybe learn something they couldn't  deal with and they sold them back off to somebody else and they just now they're drifting like a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  rudderless ship it's ridiculous so Kevin you're not gonna do that well I mean eBay is very large

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  we are still very small you have a long way to go for you have to worry about laying off 1500

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  people yeah exactly but when we see Kevin Rose speaking at the convention then we'll know yeah  I know I know Kevin spends every day and I'm sure very long hours at dig I know you work really

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  hard at dig yeah we're focused on product we're all on new features yeah no the point is Kevin is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in the same boat as everybody else I mean Meg Whitman was working really hard just like Kevin  when the thing was a two-bit operation but when the thing gets really big and you're gonna bring  in the professional managers I mean I've been watching this go on over and over for the last

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  couple of decades isn't there a natural life cycle I mean maybe just eBay's time has come  was there any I don't think I don't think that would be the case if they had the original people

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there what could they have done to save themselves I don't know but Meg Whitman might I mean do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  think the auction model is I think people got tired possible I think people got tired of the  auction model and I'm not sure that it's feasible large-scale especially online where everything can

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  be gamed yeah to the extent that I can impossible to stop the gaming and this and as you say John  that sniping it chases away normal people who want to bid on it because you're bidding you're  bidding you're doing everything and then some sniper comes in at the last minute and boom it's

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  over and if they I think if you're gonna be an auction site I think it's possible that you have  to stay really small and be really all about like yet places like Etsy yeah yeah I love it's great

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  what what and you like what ETSY com it's for crafts oh okay and it's big but it's not it's  not you know eBay big well and it only does crafts and it's and it's focused exactly well

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there's that element but here's the here's the question you have to ask yourself I mean like  the eBay early on did a lot of wine a lot of people collect wine they sell the wine you can  legally do that after the especially with a wine that's over it once it's the ten years old you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  can oh really that was it the deal is if it's old enough you can sell it ten years was the key but

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I mean there itself people were selling it all different you know they weren't doing that but  that is the legal limit is last time I checked was if the wines ten years old then you can sell it on  the open market and as a citizen and as opposed to being a liquor store and they were doing that  then the wine commune and two or three other sites came up they sucked all that business away from  them and now you're talking about this being a crafting it's sucking if but if eBay had its act  together they would have themselves created a secondary yeah these secondary auction sites  rather than being the one big giant thing there you go you came up with something they could have

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  done that's a very good point you know Amazon it is the booze the big gorilla in all of this they've  just announced they're gonna start selling wine in 36 states yeah so if I were a wine if I were a  wine site I'd worry doesn't me Amazon is really the Microsoft of online sales they're dominant

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I wonder why thing there I buy toilet paper do you think they're gonna sell like specialty wine or  do you think they're gonna kind of do what Costco does like buy a lot of become a big buyer yes but  of you know not necessarily don't kid yourself about Costco Costco is the number one wine retailer

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  in the United States really don't kid yourself about the stuff they got they have one straight  you know the thing about Costco that guy who is a CEO is an Easter egg okay wine come on  they have some tremendous deals and terrific wine that float in and out of that Costco operation

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  it's almost frightening John is John before he became a computer writer was a wine writer so

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he actually knows where I still taste but you know but professionally well not what is a professional  taster do what is you get paid that's the point you go to a competition you're one of the judges  oh you do that yeah that's cool did you see bottle shock not yet that's about the famous 1960s

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  blind tasting they did in yeah no I heard that's about you right the thing spur that the guy is

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  spur you're I guess was and they did it I met him really yeah he was he had a shop in the  office of Plas Madelaine in Paris and I visited him and chatted with him for a while and he had  some of the most unbelievable deals I just couldn't put enough stuff in my suitcases so how do you

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  know when there's a good wine at Costco because now I'm curious I mean well Costco has a thing

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  about Easter eggs if you realize that and you always look around you'll find once you know about  the Easter eggs then you you get really clued into looking for them and you'll find them and  they're in the cheese section they always did a lot of wine and food stuff there's a lot of  product they're just all over the store when you say Easter egg what it's just like an it's like  something that they that's underpriced to an extreme but here's an example I'm up at the I'm  up at the Costco in Squam Washington there you go and I'm floating around and I go over to the wine  section and they have a 2001 Mouton Rothschild for $99 which is not a cheap wine by any means but  the wine generally speaking goes for $250 so I grabbed a couple bottles and showed them to my  wife I said look she says what about it I said these wines are you know this is amazing this is  the Easter egg and she says what does it cost I says 99 bucks what 99 bucks but meanwhile I knew  what the deal was these things you got try to buy a bottle now it's about two three hundred so I  bought them you know and be knowing it was an Easter egg but Costco has these things all over  the store these you have to be knowledgeable enough to know totally is it are they actually  ridiculous deals or are they like no I've got some of them I'm telling you some of them are

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  like it's jaw-dropping ridiculous come with me to my cost Twitter out that's it that's what

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Twitter's good for John that's what Twitter's for is you right now right now at Costco in San  Francisco I'm gonna go back on Monday because I checked I had to check the line out before I  was gonna buy it there is one of the top 100 wines from the wine spectator spectator 2007  it's an Italian wine the Barbera's a matter of fact from Pete mine and they're in they're buried  in the back of the cheap wine section they're not even where the main wine is a buried in the back  and this in wooden cases for nine dollars a bottle I bought a bottle this stuff's fantastic I'm gonna  go get a case on Monday or Tuesday and it's just a typical Costco Easter egg Wow that's very  interesting what is it retail for normally you don't you won't get this wine it's been sold out  for a long time it would probably be like a 15 20 buck wine but it's beside the point is you can't  get it it's a one of the really great I mean you can't get a wine this good for nine ten bucks

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  period so this is because the CEO of Costco kind of gets off on this that's my understanding like

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  they just they know and they're just like it's a it's a little present to you yeah it's a present

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  to people who know what they're doing but it's also great marketing again I see I love that when  I see this kind of stuff that's subtle marketing because now you're gonna go to Costco more often

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  aren't you this this happened to me at Costco with hot pockets I found some pop tarts there

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  they were on sale hey the heat is on it could be a Barbera it could be a hot pocket it's to each

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  own I'll give you one that for people who want to find one that probably most of the Costco's have  there is a they have a master of wine guy who's who's been buying wine for them as a negotiation  and he's been bottling it under the Kirkland label now I've been following the Costco Kirkland crap  since its inception and most of it is their house brand that's a house brand is really where to have  a Kirkland wine you don't think it's gonna be very good they actually have and this is also buried in  the back by the way they have a meritage I think it's from 2005 or 2006 with a really fancy label  on it and a big heavy bottle for ten dollars and ninety five cents which is actually mostly a Merlot  about 65% Merlot wine it's really a high-end Merlot and it tastes like a number of Flora Springs  Merlot high-end the trilogies there's a bunch of high-end Merlots it tastes like it's ten dollars  and ninety five cents it's ridiculous for the for the price and there's a crap load of it there and  there's another one they have which is also picked by the same guy which is a I think it's a Paso Robles  or a Santa Barbara Pinot Noir for thirteen dollars with a very expensive looking label on it that's  like why are they spending this much money on the label that is a very credible Pinot that's for  thirteen dollars it tastes pretty much like about a thirty five dollar wine well there you go rush

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  out right now and get that wine folks it's good would you please Twitter that because that's the

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  kind of that's what Twitter's made for that's the stuff Twitter's way so anyway I'm sorry I went off  of the tangent but when you say this about you know Costco wine they've they're notorious for

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  this kind of thing I think Amazon I wouldn't be surprised to see Amazon's sell high quality wine  I mean I don't think it'll just be wine in a box it's hard to do you to do mass marketing of high

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  quality wine on a big site like that I don't think they're gonna come up with much because they can't  get enough no you can't get enough you get a few I mean you can get if you know I mean some of these  wineries do 600 cases you know a year for of their best wine and I mean 600 cases is like and a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  national site is gone in five seconds because they do that with wheeze I have I have it set up so that  they will text message me when wheeze are in stock at Amazon and I can never get there in time  yeah so they're used to selling small lots of things so I bought the Wii Fit and I still don't

Transcript:  have a Wii the Wii Fit's just sitting because they sell out of the Wii Fit you know I saw the  Best Buy and everyone's grabbing one I got caught up in the moment and I bought one. Kevin if you

Transcript:  That's interesting huh. Yeah. You know and they have to put a UPS in your garage because if the power goes out it  stops working if the internet goes out it stops working. I mean it's not exactly reliable phone service.  I'm not too comfortable with that in earthquake country. No no. So TechCrunch 50 and Demo have you been watching this

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  political battle between the two of them? TechCrunch is. They announce next year they're doing them in  separate days. They good. Two weeks apart next year. Mike Arrington and Jason Kalakandis put together

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  TechCrunch 50 basically same format as Demo. They select hot whatever it is 50 hot companies and let them  demo in front of VCs and press. The big difference was TechCrunch 50 is free and Demo was you pay  quite I mean it's fifty thousand dollars. Did you ever do a demo with dig or anything like that Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No I never did. I suppose if you look at TechCrunch 50 this year though. I think if you're looking for money it's probably a good way to go.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know I've boycotted these things for years because of the non-disclosures that they provide they make these people sign off on  which was to me as a journalist. You can't do it. Well no it's not the journalist has to sign the non-disclosures to companies.  So I'll get calls from companies saying well you know I wanted to talk to you about something but we can't tell you anything about it till after.  Demo I'm saying well that sucks and the thing that I've noticed and I've told these people that I said well you know once you do that  once you make that kind of a decision that you're going to screw me I'm never going to write about your company and I tell other people to do the same thing  because what's the point and the other thing that what I've noticed though is that very few companies that are brand new going into any one of these kinds of things  demo being one example. I don't know that any of them have ever been successful.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No no that's a good question. I can think of some demo. I'm looking at the TechCrunch 50 winner Yammer.com and wondering what do you think of that Kevin?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That was the winner right? That's the best one. Yeah the winner was Yammer. It's a Twitter clone.  It's a Twitter clone but for businesses and you have to have an email address from your company to claim it and log in and you can do different things around like organizing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think they have dates and stuff like that. It's I don't know. Go ahead I was just playing the video. I don't want to play the video.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah I was more impressed with Fitbit. That was my favorite. Fitbit? What's that about?  Fitbit. Go to fitbit.com. It's really cool. It tracks your fitness and your sleep. This is cool.  Yeah this is cool. So it clips on your belt. It was started by two former CNET guys and basically it has a little accelerometer in there.  And the guy that demoed it off on stage he took 14 steps. He went back. He re-synchronized it with his computer and it said you've just taken 14 steps.  It shows you how many calories you've burned. Oh I like this. So it's a fancy pedometer. Yeah exactly. And so it shows you get this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So as you're wearing it. Stop stop Kevin stop. Just saying this to these few thousand people it's like I can't get to the site now.  Oh yeah we kill every site we mention. It's barely loading now. Yeah we kill every site we mention. Go ahead Kevin I'm sorry.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So basically what you do is you wear this device throughout the day and then when you look at the side of the device it's really small.  If you can't see it I mean it's like I don't know it's the size of one of those old shuffles. And it can't clip though so it goes on your belt or your pants.  It clips on the belt and then as you look down at the little device it'll tell you how active you've been and it has like a little flower that grows.  And so the more active you are the healthier the flower is. Now how about the sleep deal? It's monitoring your sleep too?  So it also monitors your sleep so as it tells you how much you toss and turn during the night.  And the cool thing though is when it syncs back to the computer it plots all this out in really fancy looking like cool charts and graphs.  It shows you how many calories you've burned how active you've been versus in the past.  And it's a great way for people to kind of track like you know I need to get up more I need to move around more I need to.  And actually people have lost weight with this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Does it inspire? Well it's also a great way to I mean the best way I think to work out is to have you know be in friendly competition.  Right. Oh so it does that too?  And it's really good for that. Well because you can share this data.  So you can sync it with your friends.  Yeah so if you're matching up goals with someone or you have a workout partner or you're in friendly competition you have some kind of bet like it's a really great way to share.  I thought this was really cool too.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  This looks like a good company. So that should have won. That's a good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And there's no fee for it. It's 99. It's a flat $99 for the device and then it's free from that point forward.  So you don't pay any monthly fee or anything.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think this could do very well.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Social networking meets physical fitness.  It was inevitable. It had to happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well and at least it's not I mean you know to their credit at least it's not a social networking site for for fitness buffs because kill me.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right exactly.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know what I have to admit I was I was really excited about Closet Couture.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm watching Kevin I mean Jason Calacanis to get drunk at.  So go ahead please.  Oh yeah I heard that was.  We'll talk about that later.  No I like the idea of sharing.  I mean there are a lot of websites like Gimme20 and a bunch of websites that will keep track of your fitness and let you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Right but to kill this website.  This is really annoying.  I mean what is the deal with these websites getting so easily killed by just a few thousand people.  No it's not that easy.  There's three thousand people watching.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Nobody expects three thousand hits at the same time.  It happens every time we mention a site.  Kevin can do it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  The one thing I will say about this device though that the reason why I think it really works is I've seen a few other I was sitting I was one of the judges here I was watching some of the other like health websites that were being pitched and all of them require manual input where you're like okay I just ate a hamburger so I'm going to plug that in.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well I wish they'd make something that would watch what I'm eating and do that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That would be nice because you don't have to do anything right.  It's all wireless it syncs back to the computer you just wear the device.  That's good.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No that's a really good idea.  Can they make one for my gullet that just watches stuff go by.  Your gullet.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You have to swallow something.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Just watches stuff go by.  There's a cheeseburger.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That would have to have to have hooks in it so when you as you swallow it halfway down the esophagus it would have to hook into you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I predict in the next century the next hundred years we'll have nanobots in our in our throat that can do this.  Oh it'll be sooner than that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  How about eating less.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No no eating less is too hard.  No we've tried that.  Molly did I tell you how good you looked when I saw you at this.  You did.  What did they hitting on her?  No not hitting on her she's a married woman.  I know she has two tattoos and a tongue piercing but I still I'm still not hitting on her.  Oh my god.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Tongue piercing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh it's a long story.  Our friend Will Harris interviewed Molly and asked her what are some things no one knows about you.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yep.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And now everybody knows them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And now everybody knows I confess to him that I had my tongue pierced for nine years.  Wow.  It wasn't just a bad oh no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You know I was committed.  You're a mommy now you can't be doing those things.  Committed to the piercing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I picked it up when I got engaged I said I'm a grown up now.  Oh really so that recently.  The days are over.  Oh yeah.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Okay.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Had I been doing CNET video when I first started working there you might have been.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  We would have seen it.  I thought you had an odd lisp early on in Buzz LA.  So were you there for.  Kevin were you there for the party that apparently Jason got pretty sauced and started posting on Twitter stuff that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I missed the parties I decided to stay home.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You are a wise man.  According to Valleywag not that they're the bastion of truth in the wilderness but they say.  Mike Harrington made Calacanis delete his drunken Twitter postings.  This is where Twitter can really get you in trouble.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How do you delete your Twitter postings.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh you can there's a little trash can next to each posting it doesn't work very well.  Yeah.  You better you got to get to it right away.  Yeah.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I believe.  Oh.  Hasn't everyone seen it and it's on index.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what was he posting that was so embarrassing.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Plus it lives on forever you know on friend feed and all these other places you can't once you post it you can't.  In fact I should search let's go to friend feed to see what I'm more concerned about the misspellings than you know embarrassed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And that's the only way you can edit on Twitter.  So it isn't very good is it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So what's the what did he say that was embarrassing.  I never heard this story.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well let me see if I can because it won't be on Twitter anymore but maybe I don't know did anybody read him.  What he said.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Apparently not.  I can't believe Valleyweg didn't have.  Yeah.  No pictures.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  Let's see I'm going to search.  So you know it's kind of hard you can't just delete it.  Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm going back through time.  All right.  How can that happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  49ers stink.  I know and Seattle hasn't lost a game at home and like.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  And the Raiders won today too and they suck.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How could that even happen.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I thought they were going to go windless.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I know and they beat Kansas City which is not you know.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Well Kansas City you know that new guy is that coach there stinks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  How are the Jets doing.

Transcript:  The Jets are tied or just behind.  I had no idea.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  You've really made a sacrifice to be with us this afternoon.  I apologize.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I had no idea.  There's no sacrifice not watching the 49ers.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah no I only switched over because I thought that it was tied but I had the.  I might have the TV on mute.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  According to our very intelligent chat room one of the things that Jason Twittered is I am so drunk I don't know where I am.

Speaker: UNKNOWN
Transcript:  Hey I've been there.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  If you're so drunk you don't know where you are you wouldn't be able to find the Twitter.  How could you Twitter?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's like every third Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's normal.  That's normal.  There's a lot of Twitters like that.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'm sure if you watch the Twitter homepage like it's going to be wasted wasted drunk.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I'm wasted.  I just woke up in a cab.  I just woke up in my own puke.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  That's getting back to the conversation that started us off.  That's exactly why it's so interesting to follow the Twitter stream.  If you can parse it you could write a little you know a little track that would say anybody says puke I want to hear about it.  You never miss another.  Never mind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Another puke Twitter.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Don't call them Twits they're Tweets.  Sorry.  In fact you know when I was at this bear hug conference about eight people when I said I'm with Twitter they said oh is that.  You mean Twitter?  That must have got you.  That kills me.  Oh it's it's it's over.  I've lost that trademark.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't think that you should.  I understand your pain but at the same time it's not like you're starving to death.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No and in fact now and this is the thing you know Evan and I talked about he said well as long as I don't do a podcast and you never do a micro blog I think we're OK because we have trademarks in different areas of course.  If you go to army.twit.tv you'll see I am in fact doing a micro blog.  So I'm just waiting for him to do a podcast then we'll see what happens.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  He's not going to do one.  He doesn't.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I mean he probably feels bad.  I mean he's a pretty nice guy.  He's a great guy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I have him on tape saying that somewhere.  Most people know the difference.  If they don't know the Twit broadcast yeah they don't know the difference.  It's not maybe part of it but you can leverage that the way I see it you can take advantage of their trademark.  That's fine.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's about the way it looks now.  So this book doesn't need an audible version believe me.  I would love I could breathe life into that.

You can get two free books from audible right now by going to audible.com slash twit two.  I also want to mention I just want to thank audible because in this political season I think it's so you know I.  I was chatting with somebody on twit army today and they were saying I don't want to hear any more about politics.  And I understand that feeling and understand people get cynical but this is such an important election and we need to discuss this stuff.  Audible has done a great thing.  They have an election 2008 section with free speeches from both conventions.  The books of the various candidates a place where you can do your research.  Other people talking about the candidates.  I really think it's important.  So I thank you audible for doing that.  They do that every every election season and it's really great.  Audible dot com.  By the way they have a whole Sarah Palin section.  Sarah unabridged.  Wow they've already got a book about Sarah Palin.  Isn't that amazing.  How do they do that so fast.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  They put a team together and they do it over the weekend.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's a short book.  It's empty.  The pages are blank.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I could see Russia from.  Did you see Saturday Live last night with Tina Fey as Sarah Palin.  That was genius.  Nailed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  My gosh.  I'm dig right now.  Nailed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That was I mean it should have been expected that she would be that good but she I couldn't  believe it was almost she was almost indistinguishable from the actual Sarah Palin.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Have you heard had Tina Fey do her voice of Condoleezza Rice.  No.  It's unbelievable.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  She's really good at impressions.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  She's a very funny person.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Oh I love her show.  But I have to say she got that.  And I can't figure out if it's a Minnesota accent or what.  It's an Alaska accent.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's just a northern American accent.  My mom sounds just like that.  Really?  It borders a little bit on Canadian eh.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's very it is very Canadian.  Canadian meets Minnesota.  We talk a little bit like this and this is a they come from Vancouver.  I told them thanks but no thanks on that bridge to nowhere.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Molly.  Molly you nailed it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Molly say do the hockey.  Do the hockey.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I grew up in North Dakota.  North Dakota same thing.  Yes I've heard that voice.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I'll take two bowls of spitbee soup and some back baking.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Molly would.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  North Dakota.  North Dakota's got the accent.  Very good.  By the way talking about North Dakota when I was doing my old radio show for public broadcasting  I had the guy who was the father of modern wind energy on the show and he said to me  and I bring this up every so often that North Dakota and if anyone's been to North Dakota  they know this is true.  North Dakota if you use third generation wind generation technology could power the entire US grid.  Is that windy?  It's that windy.  It is so windy in North Dakota that it's almost unbelievable.  Yes that is so true.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  24-7 too it's just windy.  It's wild.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I was told by some North Dakotans that there's a because of the Rockies the air comes over  the Rockies and flows off and it just picks up speed and blows across North Dakota and  there's nothing to stop it.  The whole state is basically just a wind tunnel.  The whole state is a wind tunnel.  Wow.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yep.  Does it sound fun?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Which is why to this day wind makes me actually physically angry.  I hate you.  I get enraged.  I hate you wind.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I understand that because when I was there it was like holy crap does this ever end.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's windy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Kevin have you installed 2.1 on your iPhone?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I just did.  It's amazing.  The battery life is great.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So you have noticed a difference.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It's fixed a lot of issues.  Very cool.  Yeah the reception it's funny because David Prager has 2.02 and we were sitting today  having a little lunch and we held our phones next to each other and he only had one bar  and I had four.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  So it improves reception.  Oh that is significant.  So it really does make a difference.  It's interesting.  It's a better battery life.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  That's puzzling.  I'm pretty curious about it.  I haven't noticed.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I haven't used it that extensive.  Yeah I mean finally they say they're going to remember where we put our icons.  So I took the trouble to actually rearrange my icons.  I've kind of given up because every time I have to reinstall you know restore the iPhone  everything gets jumbled up again.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I've heard that it also if an application crashes on your phone it remembers that and  sends that data back to Apple the next time you sync.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I did notice that the backup time is much faster.  That was driving me crazy.  I was literally taking four or five hours to do a backup every day.  What?  And you've seen that video I saw that video where the guy was like 12 hours he had a clock next to it.  It just went on and on and on.  I think it's like a diff now.  Yeah that would be the way to do it huh.  Not back up the whole thing.  Yeah I feel like I've never been so grateful for Exchange.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Because the first time I tried to sync it I was going to not use Exchange on it and I just tried to sync it  So now it pushes.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah I use MobileMe for that.  It pushes a calendar and the address book it's great and then I use Yahoo mail which is also pushed.  So if you're not an enterprise user like Molly.  Right.  So it's it does a pretty good job I have to say.  You know I want the iPhone to work because I really like it in so many ways.  And it's just been very frustrating when it dies.  What's your favorite app Molly?

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Do you have one?  Wordle.  Wordle?  I'm obsessed with Wordle.  What's that?  I feel like Wordle should give me a kickback.  I pimp it so often.  And then you draw the words and you can find them in any order.  It's completely nerdy but I am I cannot get enough.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Downloading Wordle right now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Thank you.  My husband comes out like I went I said I'll go in and do some dishes while you finish feeding the baby.  And he goes that's really quiet dish doing that.  Wordle.

Transcript:  You know that for detecting the song.  Oh yeah I like Midori for that.  Yeah we talked about Shazam.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Is Midori better?  Midori you can sing into it.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Does that really work though?  Yeah.  It works for me.  I could sing a song and it'll play it back.  We rick rolled it.  I sang Never Gonna Give and it worked.  Anyway I won't sing it now.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What was the name of that one more time?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's Midori like the melon liqueur.  Boy it's bad if we both know that.  It's really bad.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06

Transcript:  You don't know that we're not dead.  We could be in another universe.  That's true.  That's what happened.  Wouldn't that be cool?  No I'm serious.  Yeah yeah.  George the fact that all these countries got together and spent all this money,  6 billion euros something like that to build this.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  This was going on around Austin Texas until Clinton just decided because it was George  Bush the first thing that they just killed it so we lost out.  They dug the big hole and they were going to do the same thing in Texas and the United  States would have been the leader.  The SCC the superconductor.  They would still be in business.
