This week in tech is brought to you by GoToWebinar, a trusted webinar platform with over 55,000  customers who've hosted over 2.7 million interactive web events to connect with their audiences.  For more, visit gotowebinar.com slash podcast.  Welcome to This Week in Tech.  Leo Laporte here, all alone in the studio.  But don't worry.  I won't be alone for long.  Everybody makes an appearance in this show practically.  We started the year, of course, with the inauguration of the new president and Silicon Valley had  kind of mixed reactions, especially to the immigration ban.  Watch.  I mean, I guess we have to talk about and, you know, I have mixed feelings about talking  about politics.  We try to keep to politics only where it intersects with technology.  But in fact, there's a pretty big intersection.  This is, of course, the concluding of President Trump's first week in office, a lot of executive  orders and one yesterday that seemed to have really triggered a reaction from Silicon Valley.  I shouldn't even say that from all of the tech community.  And that's his ban on immigrants, visitors from seven nations that are predominantly  Muslim.  But more than that, even green card holders, legal residents of the United States, were  blocked at the border.  There was some question of whether that was the intent.  Apparently, the border control called the White House and said, Now, do you want us  to stop green card holders, too?  And they said, You bet.  And a number of people were detained.  The tech community's reaction to this was of varying strengths.  Mark Zuckerberg, one of the first to respond with a somewhat tepid response on Facebook  saying he didn't think it was a good idea, but not really calling it out.  On the other hand, Sergey Brin, one of the founders of Google, immediately went to San  Francisco International Airport to join the protests there.  And then there's Sergey.  He of course is also an immigrant from the Soviet Union, Phil, I think so.  Yeah, I think so.  Yeah.  So why is Silicon Valley upset about this?

Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  To be honest with you, I'm not sure that the tech community is doing much good on this  issue.  They may actually be causing more problems.  Yeah.  Or even kind of in the election in general.  I think we are a little bit tone deaf about exactly who cares about what we think and  who doesn't.  We're becoming like Hollywood in this sense.

Start time: 210.62
End time: 246.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Good point.  But it's reasonable for Google, for instance, that has nearly 200 employees that are blocked  by this order.  Of course.  People were trying, you know, if they were overseas, would not be able to come back to  Google.  Many Google employees said, since our colleagues can't travel, we are not going to travel anymore.  Google issued a statement saying we're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals  that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families or that could create barriers  to bring in great talent to the U.S.  We continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere.  It does sound like they're not condemning the order.  They're more just saying, hey, this impacts our business.  So we're not happy about that.

Start time: 246.90
End time: 269.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  And of course, every company has a responsibility to its employees and to make sure that everyone's  OK and that business doesn't get interrupted.  And the much larger question is, I think we do have some moral responsibilities to refugees,  to immigrants.  But I do think the discussion on both sides here has been pretty poor and not helpful.  There's very few reasonable voices here.

Transcript:  When the tech leaders, and Tim Cook, by the way, is in Washington right now, the CEO of  He had dinner with Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, Trump's advisor on Thursday,  has been going around making the rounds.  Cook issued a statement, said, I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned  about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim  majority countries.  I share your concerns.  It is not a policy we support.  That was probably the strongest kind of statement from all the CEOs.  But Tim Cook went and sat down along with Elon Musk.  In fact, Musk's now met twice.  He met again this week with President Trump.  Do you agree, having been in a position like this, do you agree with them that it's important  to meet with the incoming president?

Start time: 311.60
End time: 338.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  Yeah, absolutely.  I don't see.  Why wouldn't you?  Yeah, I don't see what's to be gained by kind of shouting about everything.  I think it's just going to make the world worse.  There should be reasonable people on both sides.  It's sometimes hard to do that.  There's a lot of pressure to take a strong position.  There's a lot of pressure to be very vocal.  It's good that a lot of people are doing that, but I think we also need people who are actually  trying to be reasonable and move the world forward.

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  Right.  But when you're championing yourself as a beacon of hope and light and basically constantly  claiming that you're guiding the United States to this new frontier of greatness through  I think that you owe it to the people that you've promised, both American citizens, but  also your employees, to take a stand against some of this stuff.  I won't say that every single thing that Donald Trump is doing is wrong, but there are certainly  some measures that can be just described accurately as xenophobic and problematic when it comes  to sourcing talent from other countries and basically creating this new and open world  that all of these Silicon Valley companies are constantly talking about.  So I was actually really disappointed by the number of leaders that were willing to speak  out and the amount of time that it took them to actually say something.  There are people like Sheryl Sandberg who have spent years talking about progressive  ideals and then when push comes to shove have actually been pretty quiet about these things.

Start time: 411.52
End time: 441.45
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  She did finally issue a statement about not about the immigration thing, but about the  Women's March.  I think Planned Parenthood, the Women's March.  She said that.  That's right.  Yeah.  Yeah.  But you're right.  She hasn't said a lot.  But I think as a C-level executive at a publicly held company, there is some responsibility  to not be political, not to become a Meryl Streep, but to in fact to be more judicious.  Is that right?

Start time: 442.30
End time: 484.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  So look, I have personal opinions on all this stuff and I'm actually totally happy talking  about them.  Yeah.  But that's separate.  Not being figured at all.  Totally happy talking about them.  Yeah.  What I'm also trying to be mindful of is what's actually going to be the most effective way  for the world to move in the direction that I would like it to move.  And very often that's not telling people from a position of assumed authority what they  should think and how they should think.  How would you go about it?  Well, for example, it's not clear to me that Sheryl Sandberg being louder and faster  about her position actually helps convince the people that need to be convinced to change  the position.  It maybe makes people feel better.  It maybe makes for better demonstrations.  I'm not sure that it actually makes the world, it pushes the world further in the direction  that Sheryl would want it to be pushed.

Start time: 484.48
End time: 505.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  There's also a significant risk, I think, of Silicon.  At some point, people realizing that the problem isn't so much immigration.  created by Silicon Valley and automation and that, in fact, the tech community could quickly  become the enemy here, could they not?

Start time: 505.64
End time: 523.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  We are pretty tone deaf as an industry, I think.  I think we got used to being treated as heroes and the people that are making the world for  the past decade or so, and I think that's on the verge of changing.  I think we're kind of tone deaf about how we talk about it.  I think Hollywood tripped over that line a while ago.

Start time: 524.00
End time: 532.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Hollywood's given up.  Hollywood's Hollywood, and I think most people in California feel the same way.  And we're close to following that.  Right.  And the tech industry could be going over that line.

Start time: 533.16
End time: 537.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  I would like us not to.  I'd like us to remain effective.  And I think that a little bit of shouting, it hurts that.

Start time: 538.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_10
Transcript:  What I've learned over the past week is that Silicon Valley continues to exist in a bubble  that is essentially unrelatable for a large majority of Americans.  There's been a diversity problem in Silicon Valley for years that is basically underreported  and underdiscussed.  I don't want to put all of the blame on Sheryl Sandberg, but I think she in particular is  an easy target because she wants to be or she positioned herself to be considered a  leader for the feminist movement.  And I wrote the book Lean In.  Right. And so I think when there is such divisive rhetoric that is just constantly coming from  Washington, I think that you kind of have to choose one way or another.  Either you're purely a capitalist and that's totally fine and you can refrain from saying  anything, but then you can't go on to expect to be treated as an authoritative leader on  any progressive movement.

Start time: 614.26
End time: 631.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  So I think, you know, I think Phil, you're saying they shouldn't be a leader in the progressive  movement. They should stick to their knitting and do their job.  Although I can understand why Sergey Brin, who went to that protest, but I think as a  private citizen, I don't think he said I'm bearing the banner of Google.  But as a private citizen, I feel strongly about this because I was a refugee.

Start time: 632.08
End time: 672.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_20
Transcript:  And you got three different issues here that are being conflated.  One is the issue of like, what should people, how publicly should people state their views?  And they say that is as publicly as they want.  Yeah, everyone can make that decision and state them as publicly as they want.  Right. Second issue is what is the proper role of someone speaking for a company?  That's a different matter entirely.  That's a different matter entirely.  And then there's a third issue, which is what's most effective.  And it's that most effective issue where we are about to go over a cliff as an industry,  where we're about to take everything that we in general think is important and  significantly hold those things back by being perceived as hectoring and lecturing  and being tone deaf and being out of touch.  We will make the situation worse if we keep doing it.

Start time: 672.42
End time: 677.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  So can I say something?  I've been real quiet because I'm trying not to do the yelling thing that you said.

Start time: 677.76
End time: 683.61
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  I feel like I feel like we are on the edge right now on the precipice of a patented  oh, doctor rant.

Start time: 684.70
End time: 773.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  So as a person who doesn't live in a bubble, I think that you're generally wrong when  you say that the tech community is tone deaf and that Hollywood is tone deaf.  The country in a majority voted an opposite direction of what we currently have as a  regime, the popular number of people.  So that the way the people are speaking and when they speak out, it's not tone deaf in  general unless you live in the middle of the country and you've seen your job creation  go away as opposed to a Silicon Valley where things become an automated.  We're not talking about what educations people need to be having and what we should do for  education for people to have these new future jobs.  Because until we get the robots to build themselves, build the wall, pay the taxes for it, we've  got to do some other things and fix these issues.  So, yes, it's important for a CEO of a major company who has immigrants working for them,  mostly as engineers or whatever they have, because you never see them on a higher echelon  of work and jobs.  Well, I am such an Adela Sundar.  No, no, no.  I said in general and don't talk to me like that because he just made the statement of  the fact that racially, the way Silicon Valley is, you know how it is in general.  I said in general.  I didn't say all.  I didn't say every.  I said generally.  OK.  So again, let me finish.  The way things are set up.  Go ahead.  Sorry.  I'm just saying they're not tone deaf.  And maybe if we did a little bit better educating the people in the middle of the country about  what's about to happen to them, maybe we don't have to fall off a cliff or push ourselves  off a cliff or rappel off a cliff.  I agree with you on that.  We can work together about it.

Start time: 774.04
End time: 795.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  There is a leadership role Silicon Valley could take, which is, look, the change is  coming.  We understand this change.  You might want to get ready for this.  This is the educational.  I mean, you push STEM, but this is these are things you've got to do as a country.  We've got to do to prepare ourselves.  And it's not it's not building a wall because that's not going to solve the problem.  That's not where the problem is coming from.  That's a mistake.

Start time: 796.70
End time: 808.99
Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  I saw the best thing I saw for that was instead of building a wall.  Why don't we build a solar panel wall out there in the desert and get some free energy?  I'm sitting like, like, it's the little things like that.  I'm like, I like a 12 year old said it.  And you're like, that'd be amazing.

The I actually think that it probably will be a little bit like Facebook where you had  this big pop, people got excited and then they have a, you know, slow down and earnings  or growth doesn't shape up as quickly as possible and it drops.  And so maybe I'll buy it when it drops.

Apparently there's as much as a billion dollars in shorting going on right now.  And snap, there's a lot of people betting as you will that that pop will go away.  They they they were saying that they were going to and you'll help me with this because  you're the financial guy.  Sure.  Right.  They were they were saying initially that the IPO would be 14 to 16 dollars.  They ended up opting for 17 dollars, which means they took a lot of money off the table  for the founders.

Start time: 898.52
End time: 909.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, you set a price.  It's a big dance on the first day of the IPO.  You sell the shares, the underwriters, you fill the book beforehand.  Right.  Seventeen dollars a share.  And then the opening price is set by kind of a give and take.  It takes place in the NAS.

They were one of the early snap investors.  They were the first. Yeah, they were the first.  They made a lot of money, right.  They put in a really good 26000 percent return.  But Barry spread the wealth because he's a parent at that high school in the high school,  which is weird, had an investment fund, the financial growth fund.  He's the chairman.  And he said, I get you.  I can get I get you to do Silicon Valley.  I get you a taste of that.  So again, they bought fifteen thousand dollars in shares, which are worth now.

Transcript:  Well, they did a it's it's like photos and another story that's related to this.  It's probably linked from it.  That is it's the same idea is that there are certain malls that have recast  themselves and they've gone higher end.  Yeah, they've been successful.  But there are a lot of them that are just falling apart because, you know,  their anchor stores are you lose the anchor.  Yeah. And those are not drawing people in.  And it turns out that so many people are preferring to shop at big box stores  or on the Internet that the traditional shopping mall is now a lot less appealing.  And so some of them can redefine themselves closing like 100 stores.  But a lot of them can't.  And like Sears and Kmart, which Sears owns, Kmart, that that is a company  that may not make it at all.  They may just go out of business.  And so what do you do with that space and how do you turn it into something else?  Is this this is this is Amazon.  A lot of it, you know, and there are other trends, too, like in a Walmart.

But when I want to refill, when I want that shoe again, if I can get it on Amazon,  I'll just get it again, because I know it fits and I know that I like it.  So it tends to be like the first purchase is at a store.  But then if I want 10 more down the road, they don't get my sale because, you know,  I paid them for their marked up first version.  But then in the end, it's just so much more convenient to say,  you know, it's six months later and I want another one of these.  I'm just going to have it.

We're really pleased we were you know, we always do these best ofs,  but often we don't have advertisers.  But GoToWebinar came to us right at the last moment said, you know,  we'd like to buy the best stuff.  So they're sponsoring all the best ofs.  Thank you. GoToWebinar. GoToWebinar is great.  I've used it.  I've done a number of webinars with GoToWebinar.  I'm not alone.  They've hosted two point seven million interactive web events this year.  That's 60 million views.  That's one of the things that's cool.  What is that average then?  More than 20 people per webinar, but it can be even bigger.  GoToWebinar lets you present from one to six presenters,  as many people who can see it as you want, both live and on demand.  And that's really, really you get the, you know, all the big audiences is  you create a live webinar with live audience.  You have polls, 20 polls up to 20 polls per webinar, up to 20 questions per poll.  You can set them up ahead of time.  You can do it in the middle of the webinar if you don't know,  you know, people don't understand or you're worried that people are, you know,  you just want to know more about your audience, whatever.  You do that during the live webinar.  But the live webinar is recorded and the polls are live and the numbers are live.  On the on demand version.  So that's really neat.  People can still interact with it, still feel like it's the excitement of a live event.  But you don't have to be there.  You can do this webinar once and watch and have millions of people see it  after the fact.  It can be completely branded with your company's logo and custom image  and all the webinar materials.  Easy to start to you.  They have automated mail templates that let you send out custom email  invitations and confirmations and reminders.  That's really important.  Mobile friendly. That's right.  You can do this, by the way, on your phone, iOS or Android.  And you can only schedule a webinar, set it up, but you can edit a session  and track performance. Speaking of tracking, they have lots of metrics.  So it's a great way if you're doing sales presentations to gather leads,  if you're teaching to get a sense of how many students attended the whole thing.  And actually, that's very helpful in making your webinar better.  Were they paying attention? Did they stick around?  So that the next time you even get more engagement.  I am a fan of GoToWebinar. I want you to try it.  GoToWebinar.com slash podcast is the special address.  That way they know you saw it on our Best Of episodes.  GoToWebinar.com slash podcast.  Thank you, GoToWebinar, for making this New Year's Eve presentation  even a little bit more special.  Pop the champagne, folks.  Mark Zuckerberg running for president.

So I wrote a piece, I don't know, a few months ago saying, it sure as heck  looks like Mark Zuckerberg's running for president.  And there was some people that were like, absolutely.  When you look at all these photos and there are other people like you,  you're completely wrong.  The old these photos, what is going on?  Like, what is he doing?  And don't tell me he's just going around the country meeting people,  because if he was doing that, why would he be specifically said to this family?

And then also, OK, maybe eventually, eventually doing that.  They've got a massive press problem on their hands right now with fake news.  And does this make people feel better about fake news to see Mark

Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  Oh, please. Oh, I have to tell you, I feel like I have a special  point of view on this because, you know, I'm out there.  In fact, right before I got here, I'm out there in Hall, Massachusetts.  You're doing Frank and I, I'm doing this.  And the thought of inviting myself over to someone's house  is so deeply uncomfortable.  And if you want to meet people, this is a completely wrong,  really weird way to go about it.  Like I have people that write me every week and I go,  do you want to have coffee?  And that's sitting down in private and talking.  It's not making it this weird media thing.

Start time: 2041.86
End time: 2055.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_22

Start time: 2056.63
End time: 2078.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I. OK.  But the better question is, though, is it does, you know.  So Brianna, you're asking people if they want to have coffee with you.  Wouldn't wouldn't Zuck just tell us we're going to have coffee  with the miracles of AI and machine learning?  And why bother going out to the real world when you have everybody's data  your fingertips? I think you're both right.

End time: 2119.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  I think we wait. Wait, hold on.  Can we look at this?  There's other evidence here. OK.  To a politically a political campaign.  So they updated their  as one filing with the SEC to note that that if Mark Zuckerberg  decides to run for office and he could still remain CEO, why would you  why would you put that in there?  If that didn't mean anything.  They've been hiring people from the Obama campaign  on the foundation.  There's just all these things that he's been doing and these photos.  It it doesn't add up.  It's you know, there's people that have been telling me telling me,  oh, well, it's just a PR push.  And but it's it's giving them more negative PR around this whole president thing.

Start time: 2142.88
End time: 2176.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  It's clearly something going on.  I think, Amy, you're right.  What there is a question.  He in fact, we many of our panelists have said this in the past.  He's already got a very probably the he's a kingmaker.  He doesn't need to be the king.  Oh, he's better to be the kingmaker.  The reshul you rather than, you know,  because then you have more power, frankly, the kingmaker.  However, so I don't think he's running in 2020.  I think, though, that this is a he's playing the long game  that at some point he would look at this.  You don't do that.  You don't. Yeah. Because of fake news, you don't feed a cow.

Start time: 2180.72
End time: 2203.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  I don't know. I I got to say, because I'm, you know,  we we advise many, many, many news organizations and also  not this administration, but the previous administration.  And he's got a pretty massive problem on his hands.  And if every news organization in the country, in our country,  decided to cut off the tap, that would be a tremendous problem.

Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So here's here's the here's the thing I you know.  My hunch here is that we're all so easily distracted,  no matter how smart we are and how, you know, prestigious our jobs might be.  We get distracted over and over again.  And I my first career was as a journalist.  So this is not about me, you know, disliking journalists or anything like that.  I just think we get distracted.  And I think that that that campaign,  you know, whether it was for politics or for straight up,  you know, gratiating Zuck and Facebook, Facebook back into everybody's good graces,  I think was more about was a lot about likeability.  And I think that that has a reverberating effect.  I really do.

Start time: 2275.98
End time: 2320.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_00
Transcript:  I think you have to look at the big picture here, too.  I mean, look, he recently gave away a huge portion of his wealth for,  you know, philanthropy worldwide. And well, well, I know it's sort of gave it away.  I know it's quirky.  But my point there is he's trying to raise an international presence here.  And when he has a positive view by the mass public,  I think it enables him to do a lot of things like Facebook is trying to  work with local governments.  That's a huge part of what they end up doing.  So I see this as an overall political move meant to open many doors for him.  And maybe he runs for president, maybe he doesn't.  But it certainly makes a lot of the things Facebook wants to do just easier.

Start time: 2321.24
End time: 2337.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  So I would mention to Mark's team that just remember Mike Dukakis in the tank  with the helmet, that picture with basketball players does not show it again,  does not raise Zuck's stature.  That's no, that is probably the one you want to throw out.  Just I'm just saying.

Start time: 2337.82
End time: 2354.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_16
Transcript:  Also, I think here's the thing.  Let's just pretend that the four of us run Mark's public relations team.  Can you imagine?  So, you know, oh, guys, it's been this huge problem with fake news.  What do we do? And someone says, I know.  Let's go take a picture of Mark feeding a cow.

He was going to learn Chinese and actually did, which is kind of impressive.  Having tried that for myself for four years in school, it's not easy.  So one of his goals for this year was to go to all 50 states,  talk to people in all 50 states.  So you could just say on the surface that he's just doing his weird kind of  I'm a billionaire. I could do anything I want.  So instead of building a rocket ship, I'm going to meet everybody in every state.

Transcript:  So here's the thing. I do want to say one other thing.  So there was when when when I written that Vanity Fair piece, BuzzFeed went along to  to Zuck, they got access to him and they said, are you running for president?  And he said no.  And then it was this big story like Zuck says he's not running for president.  Of course, he's not going to say he's running for president.  That's Facebook stock would literally drop 20, 30 percent in five seconds.  Right. So so it's you know, I think that there's we should we should not take it  as base value when he says no or don't tell people I'm running for president.  There is something going on and we should we should be questioning it.

There's actually a lot of significant stuff.  It just they didn't really explain why the stuff mattered that good.

Start time: 2485.74

Transcript:  Well, and you know, in Google's defense, that's a good point.  I mean, you know, you making if you're making big strides in artificial intelligence.  Well, that just kind of slips away.  If that's one of the things Sundar Pichai said, he says,  we're moving from a mobile first world.  By the way, I'm just catching up with mobile first. Yeah.

Transcript:  I thought they said the same thing. Yeah, you're right.

Start time: 2533.08
End time: 2572.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  You know, one of the things that sticks out to me is if you look at the complaints  before Sundar took over as CEO about a year ago now,  a lot of it was that you go to Google I.O.  and you see all these like really fun,  gee whiz kind of ideas that aren't necessarily fully realized, that are costing a lot of money.  Sundar came in CEO and kind of focused the company, got rid of a lot of that sort of thing.  And this is really what the company is focused on.  And so this is iterative stuff versus last year in this AI first idea.  And it's good progress like the cloud TPU  set up these is basically these computer chips that will help their machine learning system.  The tensor processing unit.

Start time: 2572.46
End time: 2589.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Yeah, that's probably the biggest news of the event.  This is exactly a huge business implications. Fascinating.  So these are these are inexpensive.  Almost they look like almost like Raspberry Pi.  They got four processors on big heavy duty GPU stuff.  This is no Raspberry Pi.  One hundred eighty teraflops. Yeah.

Start time: 2589.94
End time: 2595.00

Start time: 2595.22
End time: 2629.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  They're also making available to third parties.  Part of the Google Cloud AI software.  So they've already open source tensor flow the software.  And these are hardware devices designed to run tensor flow at speed.  And if you know, you're impressed with one hundred eighty teraflops.  That's really not the point, because the idea is they massively  paralyze, parallelize them.  Yeah. And these these racks are multi petaflops per.  This is eleven point five petaflops of machine learning in this rack.

Transcript:  And so what I think the missing piece really was soon to our somebody else from Google saying,  hey, this is what this is the here are the cool things we'll be able to build with this technology.  Here's the stuff that you developers should come and help us build together.  Regular people watching this consumers and enthusiasts.  Here's what the future is going to look like.  And and here's the vision. Right.  So it's soon to ours.  Google doesn't do as good of a job at illustrating that vision in these keynotes as as as you know.

I can't remember his name.  It was a great name. Yeah.  You're getting somebody.  But but he talked about how the theory is so far ahead of the practice because it was not the way you just said,  is that is that the power to do what they want to do isn't there.

Transcript:  But see, this is this is what Google doesn't do.  Google doesn't shut up. Apple shuts up.  Exactly. Google builds their products in front of you.  Sometimes they fail, but they always are basically you get to see how the sausage is made.  Apple, they keep it secret.  And then when they have a fully realized product, usually, unless it's like a beta like Siri or Apple Maps,  then they'll bring it out to you.  This is actually something that Mark and I have been talking about recently just just as friends, but also on our  Buzzkill podcast. But it's like this is this is a difference between those companies.  Where's my plug buzzer?  Yeah. Facebook also, you know, with their F8 developers conference, they're they're further behind on the  Halls tech, but they showed some like, you know, camera apps and it got people excited.

Transcript:  I was a little disappointed. We didn't see anything about Chromebook.  We didn't see anything about a lot of consumer products.  They didn't mention the Pixel phones. They didn't mention.  They did mention Google Home and the Assistant and the Assistant now is on the iPhone,  which is really a stealth introduction to Assistant to get iPhone users to understand, you know, that Siri you've got, that's crap.  This is what a real assistant can do.  I think hoping to woo some people over to Android, but at least to get them to buy the Google Home.  The other thing that maybe it's just me. I keep mentioning this.  Everybody's kind of ho hum.  I think the fact that you can make free calls to the any phone in the US and Canada on your Google Home is kind of impressive.  I think it amazes people our age.

Transcript:  If I have to go to my phone to set up my speaker, my speaker should know that my phone exists and it should be able to basically be a speaker phone.  Like that doesn't seem crazy.  I just, you millennials don't.  You can call all the other Alexa's.

Start time: 2895.60
End time: 2950.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  You can only call other Echo's.  Yeah.  This so in a couple of ways they scooped.  I thought they sort of, you know, scooped Amazon's big announcements the last few weeks because that was one announcement is free Echo to Echo calling.  Big deal.  Yeah.  And they also have, by the way, some privacy issues because there's no way to block calls.  So the fact that anybody who figures out how to get a hold of you on your Echo can bug the hell out of you in your house.  Yeah, no, thanks.  Problem. No, thanks.  But then remember, Amazon has announced but not yet shipped this home.  The show. What do they call it? The show?  Yeah, the show.  The show has a screen on it.  It's really just a tablet with an Echo built into it.  But Google says, well, we didn't do that because you got screens all over the house.  So how about if you just can cast your calendar or your TV or any other, you know, cast ready screen in your house?  And of course, most people have cast ready screens all over the place now.  Yeah.  So I thought that was that was impressive.

Speaker: SPEAKER_17
Transcript:  It does make me wonder, though, if this is something that Megan Moroney brought up, actually.  And we were talking about earlier is whether or not this puts pressure on Amazon to come out with a phone again,  because even so, you know, Google has its apps on the iPhone and they, of course, have Android.  But basically, if you're using an iOS device or an Android device, they have a presence on your phone.  And the reason why this might be a little bit of a jump ahead for them in this in the smart speaker phone calling thing is because they have access to your phone in ways that Amazon doesn't yet.

Start time: 2985.04
End time: 3040.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Well, and that's the other thing Google has to kind of think about is the creepy line, right, Jeff?  I mean, every time they announce something, there are going to be a group of people, privacy advocates, say, oh, hell no.  Yeah. I put that in Europe.  Yeah. Right.  The Google lens is kind of funny.  They announced this is an AI capability that reminds you a lot of Google goggles, which and Amazon's Fire Phone.  Seven years ago. Right.  But I asked somebody at Google who was involved in integrating this into search and photos.  She said, well, but this is AI.  You know, goggles was kind of pre-populated. We had to teach it.  This is this is learning all the time.  So, for instance, I love this. They took take a picture of a flower.  This happens to me all the time. What is that flower?  And it will actually say, oh, that's a milk and wine, Lily.  And it will even give you nearby florists.  You can order it and buy it.

If you have barcodes in the back of your router, it will automatically configure, you know, connect to it by just taking a picture of it.  It can read it. And my favorite one was they showed, you know, you using your phone.  And I'm not sure what app this is.  Maybe it's just the camera app because that has lens built into it.  You turn on lens and then you point at different storefronts and they'll tell you what the star rating is, you know, how much it costs.  You can make a reservation.

Here's a here's an example of they took a picture of a marquee at one of my favorite clubs in San Francisco, Bimbo's 365 Club of Stone Fox's are playing May 17th.  So the lens is smart enough to know that that's a Stone Fox's offers you Stone Fox's music offers to add that to your calendar, which is pretty impressive and shows you where you can buy tickets to that all from taking a picture of the marquee.  Those things seem like the kinds of things that would be useful over and above a goggles.

And again, I thought, what?  And I couldn't wait to get back here and ask you all what you think of this.  Amazon buys Whole Foods.  Now, there's some wags who said, I don't think this is how markets work, but who said, you know, Amazon stock went up by more than thirteen point seven billion dollars.  So in effect, it was free.  Yeah, it wasn't a stock deal.  So, yeah, not really how it works.  But yeah, but but it certainly was a good move, at least from the point of view of the market.  They thought, hey, this is a good acquisition.  Is it? Why would Amazon buy a brick and mortar grocery store?

Do you know how awesome this is?  OK, why is this a good deal?  Let's say first of all,  Whole Foods, aka Whole Paychex, has done the marketing research  and they only are in rich environments.  Those people are the people that can afford to pay Amazon to deliver  and or pick up and or drop off their expensive groceries,  because regular people won't do it.  So taking an Acme or a ShopRite or Lion or whoever grocery stores  are going to help you. This is a national food grocery store.  So get Coast to Coast Key West to Key Largo.

Speaker: SPEAKER_19
Transcript:  I don't question what I'm saying.  Just listen to what I'm saying.  OK, anyway, it's great for them  because they have many markets in certain areas that are affluent areas  to test their whole pantry system and food if they're trying to sell.  Key West to Key Largo is like 10 miles.  That's why are you so.  I said 32 things in five seconds.  And you stuck on Key West to Key Largo.  Shut up. It sounds good, though.  I like it. This is a smart dinosaur.  Most companies blockbuster sat there and watch Red Box eat their lunch.  They watch Netflix eat their lunch and they didn't do anything.  Amazon is the end all be all of retail selling.  And this is a strong foothold Coast to Coast, San Francisco to Miami.  That's going to help them expand their their grocery brand  that they are obviously moving forward to.  They're probably going to scale back on the high priced items.  But it's a great move for them.  And it gives them a foothold in something that they bought,  quote unquote, on the cheap.  They, quote unquote, got for free. It's great.

Transcript:  I don't disagree with anything that that that Owen is saying.  I think that I was saying about Whole Foods was they were  their profit margins have been degrading.  They've been in a little bit in trouble, right?  They're not fending off a little bit of activist investor pressure.  So this was a way for them to make a an exit to somebody  who can absorb that pressure and not worry about it  because Amazon runs on thin margins all the time.  Amazon just made Amazon fresh, fresh again,  because they get a presence like Owen's saying in all of these different markets,  and they get brick and mortar outlets that they can use as distribution for that.  The problem is Instacart has a five year deal with Whole Foods.  So they're going to have to figure out what to do to either break that deal  or coexist with Instacart delivering Whole Foods for five years.  And Instacart's out there immediately saying Amazon is a threat  to every other grocery store.  You want to sign up with us right now.

Start time: 3390.34
End time: 3405.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Is this though?  I mean, it seems like that.  Assuming that this is a deal about Amazon delivering groceries to its customers  seems like it's it's less than it really is.  It feels like there's more to this than just that.

Start time: 3406.94
End time: 3434.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  More than just that. Yeah.  And I think they obviously want to to jumpstart  the same thing they've been doing with the brick and mortar book retail stores.  And there have been a lot of rumors that they were they were thinking about doing  electronics outlets and and they have that Amazon Go convenience store.  So they may be if they can get the kinks worked out,  thinking of bringing that kind of technology into the Whole Foods outlets  to make them super high tech places to shop.  So, yeah, I don't think it's just about delivery, but that's the big early win for them.

Transcript:  It's funny because as Ben Thompson, as Ben Thompson points out in the Stratecary,  it was only two years ago that Whole Foods CEO  John Mackey predicted that groceries would be Amazon's Waterloo.  So if you can't beat them, buy them. Yeah.

Start time: 3451.28
End time: 3526.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_14
Transcript:  Yeah. Here's how I think of this deal.  And Larry Dignan on ZDNet has, you know, my colleague is written really smartly about it.  He watches this stuff and he's pretty skeptical, too.  He's he's pretty bullish on it as well.  And obviously, we've talked about it a lot.  But here's kind of how I think of this.  There's a real similarity that Whole Foods and Amazon have in that  Whole Foods was struggling because all of these grocers  were were carrying the same products that Whole Foods carries.  A lot of them, not, you know, all of them, obviously, but they were carrying  they were and they were starting their own brands to do all of these  these same kind of organics, you know, clean eating kind of products.  And that was slowly siphoning off more of Whole Foods business.  Amazon had, you know, its biggest threat.  I mean, let's be honest, Amazon is such a monster right now.  In the U.S. last year, in the holiday sales, which is when, you know,  everybody makes all of their money in the fourth quarter, Amazon owned like  40 percent of the holiday gift market.  The next closest competitor, I believe, was Best Buy  in the low single digits, like three to four percent. Right.

Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Mr. Kalanick's exit came under pressure after hours of drama  involving Uber's investors, according to two people with knowledge of the situation  and their phone calls and hotel calls and Bill Gurley, who, by the way,  who is the venture partner at the benchmark capital,  one of the big investors, has left Uber's board to put another partner on the board.  Maybe he's somehow tarnished.  But Kalanick was in Chicago.  A letter hand delivered to him says, Mr. Kalanick, time to say good night.  Now, he's still going to be chairman of the board.  He ain't going really anywhere, but he's not going to have day to day  operational management.  Interestingly, a thousand Uber employees signed a petition saying we must have him back.  He's the only guy who can run Uber.  But the investors clearly felt that he was more of a liability  than an asset to the company. Your thoughts.  Tom, you start. Go ahead.  Tom, go ahead.  You got the shot glass in hand.

Start time: 3687.58
End time: 3727.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  I think this this this is a very difficult situation for Uber to be,  and they have virtually no sea level executives.  They have a committee of 14 people running the company.  Travis Kalanick was doing the things that he needed to do at this point.  Now, you can rightly say too little too late as far as forgiving him personally.  But he was finally saying, yes, we're going to get rid of people.  We're going to change the company culture.  I mean, Arianna Huffington was right there next to him,  cheering him on, saying, here's all the things you have to do.  And and yet that faction of the board said, you know what?  We'd just rather have you out of the way so we can pick an adult.

Start time: 3728.14
End time: 3733.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_22

Start time: 3733.88
End time: 3760.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  And I think what is odd to me is that they didn't have a candidate  already lined up after that is interesting, right?  We don't know who's taking his place.  Yeah. And and and that will be the telling tale here, right?  If they were to get a Sheryl Sandberg,  I don't think they'll get Sheryl Sandberg to leave Facebook.  But if they were to get somebody like that, that makes sense to me.  If if they get someone unknown or or someone who doesn't have a proven track  record, then that makes not a lot of sense at all.

Start time: 3760.60
End time: 3797.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Yeah. And in fact, you're right.  That would make what it would have made sense is to go out and talk to a Sheryl  Sandberg or to six hundred and ninety cities.  You don't play video. Thank you.  Or go out and talk to Susan Wojcicki.  She's been floated as an CEO of YouTube.  Maybe a guy, maybe somebody like Alan Malali, another person who's been named  as floated, former CEO of Ford, who is currently, you know, just kind of hanging  out, not doing anything and a smart guy.  And if you if you think that self-driving vehicles are important to Uber's future,  might be a good choice.  Wouldn't you go and talk to some of those people and say, look, we're going to  we're going to boot Kalanick.

Start time: 3798.08
End time: 3816.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_23
Transcript:  Yeah. Maybe because because the reason you get  rid of Kalanick as far as like just brass tacks, if you're the board, I think  you get rid of him, obviously not to please the employees because you've got a  bit of an employee revolt going on, but because you want to polish it up for the  IPO. You don't want to have this in the way for the IP.  And regulators. Yep.

And they just decided that he wasn't the one to clean it up.  Like, he's the one who created the mess.  Having him clean it up, you know, probably doesn't work.

Transcript:  Yeah, you should have put more ram in the damn thing.  All right, Amy, we're going to put you on the spot.  You have to represent all of womankind.  Although a number of men jumped in on this.  So apparently, there was a memo placed by a Googler, as  yet unnamed Googler, although if his name is ever revealed,  I think we'll find out about it.  He posted it on a apparently a Google meme site as well as  the internal equivalent of Google+.  And the full content of the memo has been finally revealed  by gizmodo.  They got it.  Wasn't probably very hard.  And I'm going to try to characterize this so that  people can react to it.  The reaction's been very, very strong.  Google has had a diversity problem.  The FTC's been trying to investigate them.  Google said, no, you can't have any documents.  Google says, we're satisfied that we're doing enough to  hire more women and more minorities.  It's apparent, though, if you look at the numbers, they're  not.  Women engineers represent one in five Googlers.  African-Americans and Hispanics even worse.  I think it's 1% or 2% African-American engineers at  Google's engineering division in the United States.  But this memo says, well, this is just another form of  discrimination, all this diversity, all this attempt to  let me see if I can find the text of it.

Start time: 4144.79
End time: 4168.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  So there are different sections of it.  But the sort of gist of it is women don't make good coders,  according to the person who wrote this, because they're  genetically just not suited.  Right, genetically and socially not suited.  They have other skills, he's saying.  Women are extroverts, men are introverts.  Right, so there's like a whole litany of reasons why.

Start time: 4168.80
End time: 4180.77
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Women like people, men like machines or things.  This is like Larry Summers, then president of Harvard,  saying, well, women aren't good mathematicians.  It's just genetically the case.  Oh, that's great, it's lovely.

Start time: 4181.76
End time: 4251.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, here's what I would say.  My viewpoint on this is possibly a little controversial.  I don't think so.  But I would say that we are not all the same.  That women and men are not the same.  But I would also say that within women,  there's quite a bit of diversity,  just like there's quite a bit of diversity within men.  The three of you sitting at that table are not archetypes  or carbon copies of each other.  At least I don't think so.  And by this guy's definition, I would read like a 16-year-old  teenage boy if we agree with how he delineates the genders  in the memo.  So there's a couple of things going on.  One, he's making broad generalizations about women  and about men, which any sociologist would tell you  don't track.  So his generalizations, and anybody who's a coder  has taken math, which means that he should have known better  than to generalize to begin with.  He says the science will back me up.

Start time: 4251.80
End time: 4253.49
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  The sociology proves that.

Start time: 4254.40
End time: 4254.73
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  It doesn't.

Start time: 4255.36
End time: 4258.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  But it doesn't.  So that's point one.  Is just wrong.

Start time: 4258.84
End time: 4351.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Point two, this had to have been a pretty low level engineer  because the way that he's describing some of the work  would tell me that he hasn't yet worked on any more  advanced projects at Google.  He's probably like an entry level 23-year-old kid.  Nothing, you know, that's if there's anything wrong  with 23-year-old kids, but what it does tell me  is that his work has been binary.  So he hasn't had to solve any real problems.  And anybody who's ever had to think about the future  or about the past or solve any real problems  understands that biodiversity is a good thing.  And that teams are requisite.  So to me, this was probably written by somebody  in reaction to either a bad performance review  or a bad day at work or feeling left out of the club  or maybe he got rejected by a fellow coder developer  who happened to be a woman.  Could have been any of those things,  but there's so much inexperience  throughout the entire memo to me that  it sounds like some petulant 20-year-old  who doesn't have a lot of experience  and doesn't know what he's talking about anyways.  So I wasn't super angry or upset by the memo.  Now what's been interesting is the reaction to that memo,  which to me almost feels a little inauthentic.  It feels as though in the year 20,  what was the year that movie PCU came out?  Do you guys remember that movie?  It was like early June.

Transcript:  I feel like we've circled all of history.  94, you're right.  Yeah, I feel like we've hit that cycle again  where our responses are expected.  And I feel like some of the responses  that I've seen to this memo have almost been formulaic.

Start time: 4371.36
End time: 4389.43
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  What about Google's response though?  That's the one that really matters.  And some people have been critical  about the Google management's response to this,  which was we wanna make a safe place at Google  for all beliefs, including these beliefs.  Which is why-  Was that an official,

Start time: 4390.00
End time: 4391.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_12

Start time: 4391.16

End time: 4408.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  So it's interesting you say what you said, Amy,  because before the show you mentioned  you hadn't read Yonatan Zunger's medium piece about this.

Start time: 4409.12
End time: 4410.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  No, no, no, I had.

Start time: 4410.12
End time: 4503.03
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  You had, okay.  Yeah, yeah.  So he was actually-  And he said the same thing.  A very, he said exactly the same thing.  He's a very well-known Googler, very politically active.  He has recently left Google, so he said,  well, I could speak a little more freely about this  than I would have if I were still a manager at Google.  And he said exactly the same thing.  He said, when you first start coding,  you are just dealing with the machine.  But as you get more senior, you realize really  the job is not coding, the job is solving problems.  And in particular, interacting with other people  to solve those problems.  It isn't, it isn't, and I think you're right.  I think a lot of young coders starting off  think what coding is all about  is learning how to instruct the machine.  And he says, essentially, this is Yonatan,  engineering is all about cooperation, collaboration,  and empathy for both your colleagues and customers.  Something that the memo writer said,  oh, those are female traits.  If someone told you engineering was a field  where you could get away with not dealing  with people or feelings, then I'm very sorry to tell you  you've been lied to.  Solitary work is something that only happens  at the most junior levels.  And in fact, the traits which the manifesto described  as female are the core traits which makes someone  successful at engineering.  But I think the bigger issue, Amy, is  that the lack of diversity at Google and in Silicon Valley.  Does it hurt Google?  Does it hurt the product?

Start time: 4505.53
End time: 4593.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, I would say yes.  And I would say, one of the things  that I'm researching most intently  is artificial intelligence.  So that's been a big part of my life  for the past couple of years.  And you can see the strange and weird ways  that AI is starting to break or break down.  And that's a result of having too few people  with too narrow a worldview  trying to solve problems together.  So everybody that I know that works in tech  likes to talk incessantly about nature  and yet they seem to not take some very basic cues  from nature.  Nature tells us that biodiversity is good  for the ecosystem.  And it's always good to introduce complimentary species  and life forms to be together.  What I find so interesting is that we see  study after study and anecdotally  and just evidence all around the biodiversity is great.  And yet we don't seem to take that advice  when it comes to staffing the offices.  It's a model culture.  Where the stuff is being built right.  Now, it's difficult and it's hard to have  this conversation without using those broad generalizations.  Right.

Start time: 4594.08
End time: 4622.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Well, that's, so I want you to school me  because then I'm gonna walk right into a minefield here.  But that's okay.  I wanna be educated here.  It is truth that, I mean, and of course,  every individual is a unique individual.  And many guys have more female traits.  Many women have more male traits, whatever.  My wife is much butcher than I am.  But it seems to me there are, are there gender differences?

Start time: 4624.92
End time: 4649.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Well, I think it depends on who you ask, right?  I think Dinesh D'Souza, who's a right wing  conservative writer would tell you  that stereotypes are born out of fact  and that they exist for a reason.  I think that any sociologist who's had any real training  would tell you that it depends on the data set.  And gender is not just influenced biologically,  but also by the cultural norms and standards  in each country and region and everything else.

Start time: 4650.42
End time: 4652.25
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  And yet when I had, you have kids, right?

Start time: 4653.02
End time: 4653.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Yeah, I have a kid, yeah.

Start time: 4653.96
End time: 4717.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Yeah, okay, well, we have a boy and a girl.  And I'm pretty convinced that we did not in any way  try to push them in any direction,  but the boy liked playing with guns and balls,  and the girl did not.  And this was out of the womb.  This was very early on.  I don't think this was socialization.  So I agree, there's a massive debate  over nature versus nurture, and I don't,  it's very hard to know what's nature and what's nurture.  I guess, look, I think we do need diversity.  Clearly we need diversity in Silicon Valley and everywhere.  Everywhere is, every workplace is better  if it's a diverse workplace.  It's just better for everything,  for everybody in the workplace.  I know that, that's true.  But part of the reason that's true  is because people bring different flavors to it.  And I think you, I don't think it's unreasonable  to observe that women bring different flavors than men,  or is that really a bad thing to look at?

Start time: 4718.72
End time: 4829.19
Speaker: SPEAKER_12
Transcript:  Here's what I would say.  Humans are not wired for change.  We are, our limbic systems react very poorly  when the status quo is challenged.  That puts us into fight or flight mode,  and it causes us to make bad decisions,  and more importantly, it causes us to pine  for the way that things used to be.  And it's because of our limbic systems  that a lot of people are not good  at thinking about the future.  However, if we look from a statistical standpoint,  what, that change is often better, right?  And that it helps us approach and understand the future  in a better way.  What's happening right now is that technology has  reached a certain inflection point.  We have enough people who are trained  that can go into the field.  We have enough compute power to be able to work  on meaningful projects.  And because of how things have always been,  those roles are predominantly dominated by white males,  and males from other, a few other countries.  So this is really about change.  And it happens through every field.  If you look throughout time, it's happened in every field,  in every case.  And once that change happens,  and the workforce has become more diversified,  you know, they tend to be more productive, they do better.  It's all this data showing that.  So I think when it comes down to it,  we're just dealing with the latest round of this.  And we feel it and sense it acutely,  because it's the field that we all pay attention,  that us, the people who are on this show,  and who are listening to this show, watching it,  you know, it feels acute because we pay attention to it.  But it's the same story that's been written  over and over again, you know, in law, and in academia,  and you know, in all of these other  different fields and industries.

I wrote that in 1972,  and an iPhone does most of what it says in there,  but of course we had to set it a long way away  because even in 1972,  nobody thought that I would live to see.  Isn't it amazing?  Most of the people in this world,  accept fruits of technology in about the same way  as a kitten accepts milk  when you pour it into a bowl for it.  There was a common phrase in the robot industry,  you never understand how smart a moron is  until you try to program a robot.  It towards the end of the Soviet Union  and Pinovich, which was doing  the handwriting recognition software for Microsoft.  She said, my biggest problem is  I don't have enough technical handwriting.  Then I got my logbook out, you know,  that's the technical handwriting that was the standard.  And that engine has been in every edition  of a Microsoft handwriting recognition program since 1990.  How is your handwriting, Jerry?  It's God awful.

It says, oh, look, we all love milkshake duck,  and then five minutes go by,  we're sorry to inform you that milkshake duck is racist.  Whenever the internet finds something that's lovely and nice,  it turns out to be bad.  So if you found a herb that was non-verified,  he may become milkshake duck and actually be racist,  and KFC has to apologize, thus ruining the moment.  So by following verified accounts,  there's probably a lower level of that happening.  Yes.  Anyway, social media is hard, and that was hilarious.  Social media is hard.

Transcript:  In Cognito mode.  Well, the good news for Apple is  we have a number of data points.  Of course, Apple's own quarterly results came out  the day before the iPhone X shipped.  And they say they had amazing sales of iPhones.  The iPhone sold 46.6 million units in the fourth quarter.  Much of those, probably iPhone 8s.  So iPhone 8 was a success.  And then, of course, Slice,  which is an interesting story.  I don't know, I'd love to hear  whether you guys trust it or not.  I use Slice.  Slice is an app that monitors your Gmail  to see of its customers.  And there are, I guess, millions of users.  It monitors your Gmail to see if your delivery is coming  and when it's coming.  So they have advanced information.  Admittedly, a sample,  but I think a fairly large sample size.  And they say, according to their customers, their users,  it's the largest product launch in the company's history.  This is the graph.  The iPhone 8 and 8 Plus,  kind of one of the smallest product launches  in the company history.  But the iPhone X even bested the iPhone 6,  which was huge because it was the first big iPhone.  This is pretty significant.  Brian, are those useful numbers, you think?  I feel like Slice is useful.

I think Apple has disputed those metrics before,  just from what I remember, they don't love them.  And I'm not sure if it's because they're too accurate  or if they're totally wildly off.  I do think that early orders are definitely a good metric  for early adopter interests and just an indicator  of whether or not a product is very interesting  to technology enthusiasts.  I don't know if it really tells us much about the long term  over the course of a year,  but it definitely is interesting to see the iPhone X  and so much excitement over it.

It's actually kind of a hard thing to do  because what you have to do is record  using the screen recorder because you're limited  to 10 seconds.  No, this is an ad.  Let's see if I can find it.

Actually, there's some concern about, believe it or not,  I managed to find all the negatives.  There's some concern about this because Apple,  of course, Apple says the Face ID information  is stored in the secure enclave,  is not available to anybody else.  We don't see it, only the phone sees it.  It does a very good job of recognizing you.  I'm actually pretty impressed with Face ID.  I wasn't, it's as good as it could've been,  I would think, in the circumstances.  But there's some concern,  because there is an API for third-party developers  to use the cameras in the notch.  I imagine Snapchat be one of the first, right?  Wouldn't that be a great way to get those Snapchat  characters use the notch and do a better job of it?  And there's nothing to stop them from ex-filterating  that information from the phone to the Snapchat servers,  all the information delivered by the notch.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think that's fair.  And the ACLU and the Center for Democracy and Technology  say, well, maybe this is a problem.  I don't know, you have to really stretch.  You're right.  You're right, you have to approve it.  ACLU says a lot of things about Face ID.  They don't like it.  But something to be aware of,  a senior policy analyst at the ACLU says,  a bad guy could, what?  Get your face.  Big deal.  All right, I'm trying to find negatives.  I really am, it's not easy.

Start time: 5660.08

Transcript:  All I have to do is be grumpy.  Which I probably would look shocked  if someone smashed my,  like that would probably be enough to stop the phone.  I have some anecdotal evidence that it does get better.

Start time: 5697.40
End time: 5725.35
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  Apple said it would get better  because occasionally it doesn't recognize me.  I did it first with glasses,  but I didn't have glasses, it didn't.  I entered the code, so then you have to use your PIN.  But from then on, it recognized me with glasses.  So I have a feeling it's updating all the time.  Yes.  And Apple said it would be.  And I think there is evidence it's doing it.  Same thing, the studio lighting confused it at first,  not anymore.  It gets better.  It's pretty impressive.  Yeah, there was a brother.

Start time: 5727.98
End time: 5752.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_09
Transcript:  Go ahead.  A brother did the exact same thing.  So they had similar faces, and two brothers  unlocked the phone by having the phone relearn  the new face, which was actually the brother's face,  which was similar enough for the phone to be mixed up.  So there's probably some updates  that will make it a little bit more attuned to that.  But it is constantly trying to relearn.  Like if I probably do the passcode with a grumpy face,  it would probably notice grumpy Georgia.

Start time: 5753.52
End time: 5864.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_22
Transcript:  So it doesn't recognize you.  It asks for the passcode, you enter it,  I suspect it's then saying, oh, well, that was you, I guess.  We'll add grumpy to your repertoire.  We did try it with identical twins.  Megan Maroney, one of my co-hosts, tried her iPhone 10.  She had one of her son's Huck unlock it with his face  and then gave it to Milo.  Milo was able to unlock it.  This is what Apple said could happen with identical twins.  And they were right.  So that's a drawback.  You can only have one face in there,  unlike the fingerprint.  I used to let my wife have her fingerprint on there,  so she can get to my phone when she needed to.  Now I have to give her the passcode.  iFixit ran to Australia as they are want to do  to get an iPhone 10 so they could destroy it.  We had Kelsey from iFixit on the new screensavers yesterday.  A couple of not surprises, but interesting things.  A, they gave it a repairability score of six,  which is not bad.  Better almost than I thought.  They found the batteries in two modules.  It's an L-shaped battery with two different modules.  And as a result, the logic board has an odd shape  and is jam-packed.  They figured out it has three gigs of RAM.  Apple never talks about that,  but that seems more than adequate.  Of course it has the A11 Bionic, as we expected.  Actually has quite a few custom processors on it,  which is kind of interesting.  It's got a lot of smarts in here.  There's the, they give the chip numbers,  but there's definitely a motion co-processor in there  and some other things.  It's for such a tiny logic board,  there's a lot of stuff in there.  All right, I don't know what else to say.  That's the iPhone 10.

They put the rock behind him, you know, also looking buff.  Let me see if I can find that  because Bezos did an interview this week with his brother.  And his brother and he, there you go.

Transcript:  And so they actually, his brother put that up on the screen  and they were laughing.  They were laughing.  His brother though, if you look at his,  Jeff Bezos' brother, he's been hanging out at the gym.  I don't know if I can find a picture of this.  So his brother, as one would expect,  got him to reveal a lot about himself.  For instance, every summer from the time he was about six  to the time he was about 17, Bezos would stop it.  Auto play video, I gotta.  He would go to his grandpa's, pop, he called him,  where there was nothing.  There was no connectivity.  Bezos spent his summers working on his grandfather's ranch  in South Texas.  He says, I learned my resourcefulness from my grandfather.  Tell some stories like the time his grandfather leapt,  I don't know if I can tell this, do this story justice,  leapt out of the, he was driving the pickup truck  off the ranch.  He leapt out of the pickup truck.  I've done this, who doesn't?  Trying to open the gate without stopping the truck  so he can open the gate, jump in the truck and keep going.  Accidentally, the truck runs into his hand, his thumb,  and cuts off most of the top of his thumb.  They rushed to the hospital and pop, Jeff's grandfather says,  he's so mad, he says the thumb was hanging by a thread.  He's so mad, he takes the thumb, rips it off,  throws it into the bushes, goes to the hospital and says,  I don't want my thumb reattached, just take some skin  from my butt and put it over the hole.  And ever after, Bezos is telling the story,  he'd have butt hair growing off his thumb  that he had to, when he shaved, he would shave his thumb.  And now you know how he's the richest man in the world.  I don't think the dots quite connect on that story.  Well, the point Jeff was trying to make is,  I learned resourcefulness from my grandfather.  He spent, he bought a non-working combine.  This is not Jeff, Jeff doesn't have the butt thumb,  his grandpa has a butt thumb.  He bought a non-working combine and said, Jeff, your job,  he's like, Jeff is like 12, is to get that thing working.  And they ordered parts and Jeff worked on,  some of the parts were so big, they couldn't lift them.  So grandpa built a crane, a homemade crane,  so they could lift the parts into the combine.  He said, he said, this is where I learned  how you invent your way out of the box.  He says, choosing his wife, same thing.  He,  Oh, geez.  Should I stop?  Yeah, I don't know.  He says, I was looking, he was doing the Dayton thing,  like he had the app, he was doing the Dayton thing.  And he said, I just want to find a woman who's resourceful.  So that, what was it?  So that if I hurt myself, she can,  I, what was, I got, I want to find this.  It's just the funniest, if you get a chance,  just read the interview.  I guess that's, that's the bottom line.  And I'm not making up the story about the thumb.

Start time: 6097.26

Look at that.  He was, in Montessori school,  you go from task station to task station.  Jeff would get so focused that they had to actually  pick up his chair and move it.  He's not a fan of checking his phone at the dinner table.  He's not big on multitasking,  even when it comes to his email, multitasking bothers me.

Ever since we started Twitter 600 some episodes ago,  what is it, 643.  I've always tried to have interesting, compelling titles,  maybe not the best SEO, maybe not a title that makes you  have to listen, but just something fun.  And I like to kind of make it almost an Easter egg.  So it's always something in the show that somebody says,  and it always has to do with something we're talking about.  That particular story from Jeff Bezos gave us  one of my favorite titles of the year,  Grandpa's Harry Thumb.  I love that.  And I want to, a shout out to the chat room,  because in a way at the end of our shows,  it's always a competition.  The chat room is firing off title ideas,  and very often, in fact, almost always,  the title idea comes to the chat room.  So thank you, chat room.  Thank you, everybody, for watching.  I am so grateful that I get to do this show every Sunday  with some of my favorite journalists.  We don't have a regular panel on this show  because it's a chance for me to talk to all sorts of people.  And I think, I hope you enjoy that.  Let us know, you know, keep watching is the best way  to do it, and we will make, I promise you,  some great shows for 2018.  Have a happy new year and safe new year.  We want you back next year.
