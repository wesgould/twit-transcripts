Transcript:  You're not alone I'm still trying to figure out my podcast strategy  Also Jill Duffy who is a contributing editor of PC Mag and always a welcome guest on the show it's great to see you Jill we were talking about  You're only for a few more months in the US and then you're going to you were in Japan for a long time  Oh India India I'm sorry and now you're going to Romania this is what a life  It's pretty fun nice to see you and I'm going to ask you later on because you're learning Romanian about the various PC language tools because there's so many of them  Okay Mark Spoonhour is new we're going to welcome a newbie he is editor in chief of Tom's Guide great to see you Mark laptop magazine  It's nice to have you and don't be put off by the by the other people on the panel I know they all look very mysterious and interesting  And you and I just normal guys but that's okay we have a role to play as well I guess we should start off talking about net neutrality  Do you feel like this is just the endless battle that so now Ajit Pai at the FCC in a stealthy Thanksgiving release released the new plan to basically eliminate net neutrality  Pai says we're not going to micromanage the internet anymore we're going back to the way it was in the good old days two years ago before the Obama era net neutrality regulations  Remember Tom Wheeler the his predecessor of the FCC used the Telecommunications Act title to the Telecommunications Act to which the courts told him he had to it was the only powers that the FCC had to enforce net neutrality  It's a complete step back even to the point where the FCC is saying the states may not make their own rules this is the law of the land  We know why net neutrality is important right anybody watches this show understands this show wouldn't exist if it weren't for net neutrality Comcast could throttle us and say no you have to listen to you know the guys who pay us to be to be speedy Verizon would do the same thing  Tim Wu writing in the New York Times today says it's going to come down to the courts and he mentions something that comes up a lot when we're talking net neutrality a 2005 case a small phone company in North Carolina named Madison River  They blocked Vonage because they were a phone company and Vonage was a VoIP company that was anti-competitive consumers complained Michael Powell the chairman of the FCC at the time fined the company and forced it to stop blocking Vonage  Tim Wu says of course what's going to happen is the ban on blocking is going to end that any ISP can do anything they want provided they're transparent about it Madison River could block Vonage as long as they disclose the blocking on a publicly available website  And the FCC will no longer be in charge of enforcement the Federal Trade Commission which has very little expertise in telecommunications and is overburdened with all sorts of other things will be in charge  Tim thinks that the courts might have a shot at that he says Mr. Pye faces a serious legal problem because he's killing net neutrality outright not merely weakening it he will have to explain to a court not just the shift from 2015 but his reasoning for destroying the basic bans on blocking and throttling which had been in effect since that 2005 decision and have been relied on extensively by the entire internet ecosystem  Mark since you're new let me give you a chance to weigh in on this what do you think?

Start time: 410.60
End time: 450.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Sure well I think part of the danger is what their argument rests on and that's how everything is classified so do you classify the internet as an information service or as a telecommunication service and I think those who don't want to see things changed and go backwards really believe that the internet is a telecommunication service  and those who are saying that it's all about information are saying that just because your information is cashed just briefly that we're able to just reclassify the internet and are basically able to kill net neutrality so I think that that actually could come back to haunt this case and it's certainly one of the legal challenges that should be taken up

Start time: 451.18
End time: 473.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There's no question that Google is an information service but net neutrality doesn't regulate Google it regulates the telecommunications companies like Verizon and Comcast that transmit unchanged the content from Google but you're saying that the FCC essentially wants to treat them like an information service not like a telecommunication service

Start time: 473.00
End time: 476.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Yeah and I'm not sure that's a very strong argument either

Start time: 478.42
End time: 497.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah in fact I've seen articles that say that's a fundamental misunderstanding about the internet works  It's a series of tubes  But I don't think that you can blame this on misunderstanding I think it's pretty clear that the FCC is doing the bidding of the telecommunications companies who pay a lot of money. Davinder you have a thought?

Start time: 498.22
End time: 522.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean it's pretty clear I think like a lot of things we're seeing in this administration a lot of it's about dismantling the protections we've built up for consumers and against certain business practices over the past couple years so yeah it's not too surprising and I'm definitely I think Tim Wu would have a good sense of how we could fight back against this  He's the kind of point that term net neutrality by the way

Start time: 523.40
End time: 534.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I give him credit but also blame because it's the worst description that confuses you know this is the part of the problem is explaining what it is and why it needs to be defended to normal people

Start time: 534.02
End time: 553.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah and that's the bigger problem because right now I mean the world is on fire and everything is terrible so there is a sense that this can kind of be snuck through just because there's so much else happening to you it's hard to you know talk about this when you have Nazis walking around the United States right

Start time: 553.42
End time: 557.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It doesn't seem like the most important thing  Exactly  It's a shame

Start time: 557.00
End time: 583.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  No but even when the world isn't on fire though I still think you have a hard problem like so the listeners of the show and people who watch the show get what net neutrality is and what the threats are the hard thing is trying to explain that to the everyday consumer and I can tell you just like from a sheer like traffic perspective when people come to Tom's Guide and we try to explain that there's just not a lot of traffic to those types of stories because they don't really understand how it impacts them

Start time: 584.78
End time: 615.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah in fact I almost didn't want to start with this story because A it's kind of and we talk about this it feels like we're fighting this fight all the time and B it is I mean we're preaching to the choir and I think although let me try to play devil's advocate a little bit isn't it the case the internet's been doing just fine since even before the net neutrality regulations went out of effect they're relatively recent it's not like we didn't have of thriving  vital internet

Start time: 617.40
End time: 647.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I mean there are issues we fought through right like Comcast throttling Bittorrent I remember was a big deal and also what Netflix had to pay I think it was Comcast as well  Yeah it was  They had to pay the money so like we have seen these things happen and the big companies pay out because they have to Netflix and Google and all the others wouldn't survive if they didn't pay these ransom fees but imagine you know if they didn't have to do that imagine the sort of innovations  we've lost because these you know the ISPs could do whatever they want before

End time: 653.06
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Jill is there do you have a way is there a way that you describe this to your less technical family and friends

Start time: 654.74
End time: 735.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think and it comes up often you know the phrase that it's a public utility so in the same way that we don't allow free market open competition between say water supply companies right or electricity companies  There's some government regulation there and the reason is because as a public utility everybody needs it everybody relies on it and you can't just allow the market to be so free that companies can gouge us  I mean that's to me that's like the one of the simple ways to talk about it I mean I think you could go into some examples like saying you know if we take away net neutrality your service provider could sell you a package that gives you only access to Facebook  the New York Times.com and like a handful of other sites so you would buy it like a package the same way you might have bought a cable package many years ago and that's a bad move compared to what we have now and thinking about the internet differently than television  which is to say that it's a public utility as I said it's a place where people get information it's a place where people communicate it's a place where we do everything now we have to think about it from that point of view

Start time: 736.72
End time: 790.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Although the trend is right now in government to minimize government interference the you know the free hand of the marketplace let it rule in fact the FCC also decided to eliminate rules on holding radio and newspapers in large markets  you know there used to be limits on how much you could own more than media ownership rules you couldn't own more than four newspapers or I can't remember what the rules were but those are eliminated now so what we've already seen happening in radio which is really basically four companies on all the radio stations in the United States  I see the same thing happen with newspapers, TV stations a lot of this benefits companies like Sinclair Media which wants to buy Tribune Media this is the trend in Washington this is what the people seem to want why can't the free market solve this why isn't this something that competition can solve

Start time: 794.06
End time: 806.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's not really competition right I think that's it it's not really competition because the big pocketed companies can basically monopolize everything and buy out the competition and kind of squash any competition

Start time: 808.28
End time: 830.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Google is nominally philosophically in favor of net neutrality but in practical practically they haven't really been very outspoken nor has Facebook nor has Microsoft they may pay lip service to this but really it benefits the big incumbents  It's the new the next Google the next Facebook the next Amazon that's going to struggle

Start time: 832.56
End time: 864.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  And that's when you can say that it's anti-competitive in that sense because it's preventing the next one or the next service or the next startup from really getting a leg up but going back to your point on  It's just how this could be priced and messaged to consumers in a potentially positive way you could potentially have if this all goes through you can have ISP going to a mom and dad and saying oh you know what you know you probably use Facebook you use these other services  You could probably pay less than you are right now for your internet service and you know that family might not realize that they're getting less choice and less for their money

Transcript:  Yeah and they'll spin it as a la carte and as good for consumers

Start time: 880.26
End time: 895.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's part of the problem is and zero rating is another way of doing this where companies like T-Mobile say we won't charge you bandwidth for if you listen to Spotify or Apple Music  It feels good it feels like I'm getting a deal  Pay less what could be wrong with that

Start time: 896.60
End time: 923.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's kind of insidious too I'm a T-Mobile customer and there's just all these deals and discounts are throwing at you too like free Netflix when you subscribe  Spotify not counting against your data bandwidth and everything  It's weird because on the surface it looks like something that's good for consumers  You have to dig a little deeper and kind of go to the nerdy level to explain to people why it's a problem  And then I don't know if general consumers will even they would rather have their free stuff right or their free Netflix and Spotify bandwidth

Transcript:  When this came up a few months ago  The I think it was Colbert was it Colbert was John Oliver  F the FCC created a website and where you could petition  Because the FCC had to open this for comments they're legally required to open this for comments  And people were trying to and then the FCC said oh no our site is down  We've been D DOS and took the site down for a period of time  And now there are more than a million comments in favor of eliminating net neutrality  But there's some evidence that these were generated computationally  And this is a really interesting story on medium and the hacker noon's column  Jeff Cowell who's a data scientist software engineer language nerd big law refugee  Did a syntactic analysis was very interesting because if you read the comments  They they they looked like they're unique  For instance here's a chunk of comments  Five different comments each of which contain a sentence  Americans as opposed to Washington bureaucrats deserve to enjoy the services they desire  But paraphrased in many ways individual citizens as opposed to Washington bureaucrats  Should be able to select whichever services they desire people like me as opposed to  So-called experts should be free to buy whatever products they choose citizens rather than  The FCC deserve to use whichever services we prefer so he went he took these I mean that on the face  Of it those are all different. It's not like they had exactly the same contents  He figured out that one pro repeal spam campaign used mail merge  To disguise 1.3 million comments as unique grassroots submissions  There were likely multiple other campaigns aimed at injecting what may be several million pro repeal  Comments into the system  He says according to his analysis it's highly likely that more than 99 percent of the truly unique  Comments were in favor of preserving net neutrality  Now the FCC is required to listen to those comments  So it seems they may have found a way or someone may have found a way to make the comments  System useless he did this is really an interesting article which I recommend

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  It kind of reminds me of fake spot if you guys ever looked at that site  What's that?  So fakespot.com it's where you can enter an Amazon url  And they use algorithms to determine whether or not the user reviews are fake  I love this  And then it gives each product gets a grade basically  I bet there is a large percentage of fake right

Start time: 1090.26

Start time: 1112.96
End time: 1150.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah  Well you know I don't like to talk about stuff like this without giving everybody  A way to do something about it and obviously educating your friends and family is a good start  Finding an analogy that makes sense I think you're right Jill the utility analogy is a good one  And making sure that they understand that  There's some bad things that they understand that they understand  There's some bad things that could happen  Although again it wasn't like we were suffering in 2014 were we?  Before this was a rule  That's kind of what the chairman is saying  He's saying you know we're going to go back to the good old days

Start time: 1151.44
End time: 1169.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well aren't the companies pretty slow to move in the tech space  I mean some of the old behemoth companies right  The ones who own the internet tubes right now  They're slow they take a long time  I mean sometimes I think back and like how long did it take Facebook to get a mobile app  Do you remember that?

Start time: 1171.44
End time: 1177.34
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  They said the iPad wasn't mobile and yeah you're right  The first app was a web page  Productive companies in the internet

Start time: 1178.36
End time: 1207.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So if we look at some of these other companies like it's going to take them a little while  They're going to be slow about it  But that doesn't mean that we shouldn't protect ourselves in advance from the dangers that we can see coming  I don't know Leo if it's the same URL that you were talking about  From either Colbert or whoever  But you can type in go FCC yourself  That's it  Go FCC yourself.com and it will redirect you to the place where you can put comments  Yes  About this topic  And I would encourage people to do that once they've researched the topic

Start time: 1207.84
End time: 1209.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It's not too late I mean you could still leave comments

Start time: 1220.68
End time: 1225.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It took me I don't know 7 or 8 minutes to figure out how to leave a comment appropriately

Start time: 1226.81
End time: 1232.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  I left a comment, a long comment  Talking about how it would damage us  How it would harm twit specifically

Start time: 1235.49
End time: 1260.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And I would say too  A lot of times people will encourage  Other friends on social media  Like hey copy and paste this  Succinct  Analysis of the argument  But if then  You go to a site like fakespot  And you have multiple people  Filling in the same thing  So try to say something original  Try to say something that actually  Don't use mail merge

Start time: 1261.04
End time: 1310.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  That's what well it's interesting  Because the EFF which I love  And donate to the electronic frontier foundation  Of course has an action page and they say  Here the best thing to do now is to tell  The members of congress  Because congress is of course  Split over this issue  FCC can only do what congress allows it to do  And maybe the time has come  For the congress to weigh in on this  And make it an actual instruction  To the FCC  But they have a sample letter  I guess you kind of have to do that right  To get people  To encourage people  It's funny because  It has the phrase of free and open internet  Is essential for a free society  So don't mail merge it  But maybe paraphrase it  Contribute  There's the whole thing about calling your reps  Calling is better

Start time: 1311.76
End time: 1340.59
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have to log all those  And that's important  And we were saying the internet wasn't on fire  Pre 2014 but that was the time  When Netflix and a lot of the big  Data companies had to pay up  Comcast so they wouldn't be slowed down  It was starting to be on fire  Yeah  It was happening it was just quiet  Not everybody knew and I don't think the companies  Could really publicize what they were doing either  Although Netflix was really loud about it  I think that was really that was kind of a big deal  Because it affected their bottom line for sure

Start time: 1341.40
End time: 1431.30
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  There was a circulating  And I retweeted it  And I know a lot of people I saw all over  Facebook  Let me see if I can figure out where it came from  A sheet of things  That have happened in the past  That these big internet service providers have done in the past  That they're likely  To do again and it was a pretty  Stunning list of things  I don't know if I can find it  In my tweet stream  But retweeting  Or posting on resharing on Facebook  Things like that  I think is also useful right  Because it gives people concrete examples  Of things that  Will now be legal  And I think people look at that and they go  Well I also retweeted  Minion Clyburn who is  One of the democrat commissioners  On the FCC  Who has a fact sheet  Explaining  What the proposal is  She's of course a minority  Unfortunately on the board at the FCC  But she will be voting against this  But she's going to be outvoted  December 14th unless  Something happens but she has published  A two page fact sheet  On what net neutrality is  What the chairman  Pies chairman  Pies sounds funny what chairman  Pies initiative would do  And so forth so that will also be  A useful tool  For you I think you're right Jill if you know  Use your social network  To try to spread this

Start time: 1431.40

Transcript:  Yeah I mean it doesn't  Always come down to money too right like the only  People who are in favor of this really  Are the people who are lobbying  Right like it's just the companies  I have yet to hear  An actual non  Libertarian human being  Say that this is a good idea  It's just the companies  That want it nobody else wants it  But they're the ones who have the money

Start time: 1498.01
End time: 1521.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Just remember though that  Really the campaign funds are only useful  In swaying votes and  We're the voters we have  Ultimate control of the votes so  If we as the people  Say we don't want this ultimately  If enough of us get stand up  And say no that's more  Important than any money  Put into the campaign  Coffers of these representatives

Start time: 1522.03
End time: 1530.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That's an ideal way to look at it  But it's not like we vote for people  And then they fulfill their campaign  Promises oh gosh  That's a good point

Start time: 1531.48
End time: 1561.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I still think it would be  Good for them to at least have  An inkling that this could sway our vote  One way or another obviously it's not just  About this but I think it all comes back  To the messaging too and what you tell the  Everyday consumer I think it boils  Down to two things you know  One you will likely have less  Choice in terms of the services  That you're able to use and two  You will likely wind up paying more  Than you are now for  Internet service and we already pay too much  And there is an economic

Start time: 1562.05

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Argument to make with people  Who you know traditional  Conservatives and republicans who say  You know we have to have a vital economy  Government regulation in the way  Of this it's not government regulation of the internet  It's government regulation of internet service providers  Who want to make a less innovative  Less competitive economy  That the internet has been a real  Power a real engine  To building a great economy  In this country because of the innovation  That could happen and this is  Ultimately a way  To block innovation to block new companies  To block new ideas  It supports the existing  Businesses but it harms  Any new business coming along and so if you believe  In a true free market economy  And you believe in the power of American innovation  And building a strong economy  Then you will be against  Rules that repeal net neutrality  Net neutrality is good for the economy  It's good for business and ultimately  It's just bad for these handful  Of small businesses

Transcript:  I think they will and some of them will  Be a continuation of what we've already seen  Like the Amazon Echo Dot being 29 bucks  There's great console deals  Like the Xbox One S for 189  And the PS4 Pro is also on sale  One of the surprise categories  For us this year in terms of just  The amount of interest and also the amount of deals  Is soundbars because whenever we do a TV review  Unless it's from like a really high end brand  Like we almost always say  Get a soundbar with this  Because as TVs get thinner and thinner  The sound is not as good  So we're seeing a lot of great deals for soundbars  Some as low as 48 bucks  There's one from Vizio that we really like

Transcript:  So according to Wikipedia  The term Cyber Monday was  Coined by Ellen Davis  Who was a  PR person at Shop.org  They noted that the Monday after Thanksgiving  Was the 12th biggest shopping day historically  So they put out a press release saying  It's one of the biggest shopping days of the year  Online shopping days of the year  In November 2005  The New York Times said  Quote, the name Cyber Monday  I think they confirmed my thought  Grew out of the observation that millions of otherwise productive  Working Americans fresh off of  Thanksgiving weekend of window shopping  Were returning to high speed  Internet connections at work on Monday  And buying what they liked  At the time, according to Wikipedia  A lot of people had slow internet at home  But you're right, it was a marketing term  And by the way, they've tried other ones  Tony Velado  At 1-800-FLOWERS coined  White Wednesday the day before  Thanksgiving did not catch on  White Wednesday  Black Friday  Get some flowers  On White Wednesday  I don't think that would play these days  That's something else  It's a different kind of day  Alright  So should I shop on Monday?

Transcript:  Another  Conflict point  The game consoles  Both Sony and Microsoft at war  Trying to get  Because I think Microsoft learned a lesson with the release of the Xbox One  Which was $100  More than the Sony  PlayStation 4  That $100  Was enough to power  The PlayStation way beyond  The Xbox in terms of  Sales  So now they got an Xbox One S for $189  But that's not the  4K  It's 4K for TV  It has 4K blurring  And upscales some things a little  I used it, I actually liked it  I didn't really get a One X the minute I could

Start time: 2903.82
End time: 2912.69
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Start time: 2989.97
End time: 3003.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  My understanding is that  The Xbox One X is slightly  Or it is more powerful in terms of  Hardware  But they just don't have the exclusives that Sony does  And that hasn't changed in the last couple of years  And that's why people buy the consoles for the games

Transcript:  An un-bylined  Work for a company  That does custom home  Automation installations  And they wanted me to pull some research  And look at  What is the difference between doing a Google Home  Or an Amazon Echo set up  And getting a custom home installation  People ask me that all the time  It's like night and day  I understand that for people who  Move a lot, people who rent  People who can't afford to spend  A couple thousand dollars up front  They want the toys  They want to play with it, they want to screw in the light bulb  And connect it to their phone  But the custom home stuff  Is  It's just so much  More thoughtful  And has a lot more design  Put into it  So the wires go into your walls  They're not strewn across your tables  And the system becomes  Centralized and you think about that  Before you start buying all the products  And piecing them together  So before you even start you say  What do I want this to do?  What do I want my life to be when I walk into and out of rooms?  Whereas the experience you get  With these $100 products  Is very piecemeal  Everything needs to be upgraded  After two or three years  Nothing initially  Connects very well and works together  Very well, it's sort of slowly  Coming together  With centralized platforms  So again, I think it's fun  For people who want to tinker  And fun for people who  They rent or whatever  Just compared to what is actually possible  The dream is definitely  In the custom

Transcript:  Well we have  Much more to talk about and actually you said something I thought  Very interesting, you're interested in software  I'm going to talk about a Johnny Ive interview  In which he said that's the key  In just a second, you'd think the guy who designs  The hardware for Apple would be all into the hardware  But I'll tell you why you think software  Is important in a second  But first a word from our sponsor Rocket  Mortgage, this is an example  Of how software can make your life better  Rocket mortgage was  Created by Quicken Loans, number one  Technically the number two  Home mortgage lender in the country  92 billion dollars in loans  The other one is the Big Bank  And I have to tell you I have experience with the Big Bank  The last house we bought we went to the  Big Bank, you know the ones with horses  And stagecoach  And it took us more than a month  To get a home loan, we had to first go  To somebody who had a  This was four years ago, cracked me up  He had a calculator, a home  Amortization table  Calculator, well let's see  And then he had a sheaf, a clipboard  And a sheaf of papers with loans  And he'd go through them and say well let me just  This is what your payment would be, I mean this thing  Just that alone took like an hour  And then, okay you got to fax us  Your pay stubs, you got to fax us your bank statements  And then they came back and said well we also  Need this and that  We were faxing them stuff  We actually left on vacation and we were still faxing them stuff  It was the worst experience ever  We almost lost the house  Because those sellers said when are you guys getting a loan?  This is ridiculous, fast forward  Quicken Loans, great company  Number one in customer satisfaction  According to JD Power, year after year after year  They create something called Rocket Mortgage  It does away with all the pain points  So what they did is they created  Rocket Mortgage and the whole thing is online  In fact so simple you can do it on your phone  See, this comes back to like we're buying  Everything on our phone, you can get a home loan on your phone  Or a refi on your phone  And you don't have to go to the attic to get papers  You don't have to go to somebody with a calculator  Because computers, they do the whole  Thing online, so you go to  Rocketmortgage.com slash twit2  Actually bookmark that  So if you're at an open house or you decide to buy  At the spur of a moment  You can literally go to this website  Answer a few simple questions, they've got trusted partnerships  With all the other financial institutions  So they pull what they need, you give them permission  They pull what you need  You decide what your term is, what your rate is  What your down payment is, they crunch the numbers  And based on your income, your assets, your credit  They will make you a home loan offer  For a loan that's just right for you  In minutes  Not a month, not weeks, not days, not hours  Minutes, like you could do this  At an open house  And I love this button that says  Download the approval letter  If they still demand you have something in paper  You download the approval letter, you say  Look Realtor, I'm approved  And I have to say, that makes a big difference if you're house hunting  If you're the person out there that says  I'll be back to you in a month with my loan  Or you're the person that says, no we're already approved  Who's going to get the house?  Rocketmortgage.com slash twit2  Apply simply, understand fully  Mortgage confidently with Quicken Loans  And this 21st century  Tool called Rocketmortgage  Equal housing, lender license in all 50 states  And MLSconsumeraccess.org  Number 3030 Rocketmortgage  Bookmark this, you may need it  Rocketmortgage.com slash twit2  So Jill, to your point about software  I read an interview with Johnny Ive  Who's singing the praises  Of course, of the new iPhone, the iPhone X  But he said, which is interesting  Because this is the guy who does the hardware design  He said, the thing that's key on this  Is we can do everything in software  There's no physical button  In fact, I think Apple would love to get rid of all the physical buttons  Even the lightning connector  And just have it be a slab of glass  He says, because software is  Infinitely configurable, can be changed  At will, and I have to say  Having used the iPhone X now  I wish  Even Android phones should adopt this  Swipe up to go home  You could swipe to previous applications  By swiping along the bottom  Swiping down from the left to get notifications  Swiping down from the right  To get settings  This is such a natural interface  I see what he means, it is software  The hardware  Has to be simple enough that the software can get the job done  So I think you're right about software  Long way around of saying that  But  Do you agree to vendor? Have you used the iPhone X?  Do you agree about the UI?

Transcript:  For sure, especially that dumb mouse that has to be charged  From the bottom, things like that  But like the iPhone Plus design  Never worked for me  I reviewed the first one  That was the 6 Plus, right?  It felt awful because all they did was blow up  The existing  That particular iPhone design  So you still had the huge top and bottom bezels  It was just too big for your hands  The iPhone X at least feels like a good big screen phone  And the software is good  Those gestures are really nice  Although I've had a lot of issues with like  I don't think their software is  Doing the back great

End time: 4585.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I think the gestures are good  But I also think that I usually  Don't reveal traffic on our own site to particular stories  But the number one  How to of this entire year so far  On Tom's Guide is  How to close apps on the iPhone X  And if you have that many people  Searching for how to close applications  On your phone  I think that's an issue  I think that's a good case  And I'm glad they went in the direction they did

Start time: 4585.74
End time: 4595.91
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  But I think that's pretty telling  Yes and no, I think what the problem is  You're not supposed to close apps on any phone  Android either  That's a PC metaphor  They still crash

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  But no, like I have  On my iPhone, Twitter  Sometimes even Spotify, like things just stop working  I think that's a flaw  You have to do that to redo it  Okay, so force quit

Start time: 4615.42
End time: 4642.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  And that's always been the case for iOS  Yeah, I haven't seen that quite as much  On the iPhone X  So it hasn't come up for me  But you're right, it's not intuitive how you do that  But I think you have to swipe up  Hold, then press and hold  Then press the X  It's ridiculous  But I think that that comes from the fact that  Apple's really saying  It's a mistake to close apps  You don't want to close apps like you would on a PC  I mean, so that came about

Start time: 4644.17
End time: 4672.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  The whole idea of closing apps  Or not being a thing we should do  That came about when it comes to battery saving  I remember when this whole thing started  And that's somewhat true  Except when I go  Go for a run with Runkeeper  And it keeps using my location in the background  And the only thing I can do to stop it  Is to kill the app  There are still things you need to do to kill those  The other new interface on the iPhone X  That I don't like though is the way you do Apple Pay  And by being sure  And that's a face ID thing

Start time: 4673.84
End time: 4677.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 4701.40
End time: 4727.40
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  He means just shutting his screen off  So this is really the problem  With abandoning touch ID  And putting in face ID  Is there a few edge cases  Like buying apps  Or logging into your bank  Where  You need an additional gesture  And you don't have a physical button anymore  And you can overload the on off switch in a way that really isn't good  I agree with you on that  But if you think about the overall direction

Transcript:  Of what Apple was trying to do with this device  You remember how much heat they took  For those of us who were recovering tech in 2007  For getting rid of the physical keyboard  Right  So this is a continuation of that vision  But Mark  Surely you're not equating the headphone jack

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I don't miss the home button though  Not at all, like those bezels had to go  And this is probably the best way they could do it at this point  Do you miss the headphone jack?  I do, I do miss that  Even though I have like I have a Beats X  And a lot of my headphones are wireless  Just when I'm in a car  I'm in a friend's car or something  And they don't have Bluetooth, you gotta go with an OX jack  And if I forgot my little dongle  I have a $1200 phone  They can't do something a $50 phone could do  It's ridiculous

Transcript:  This is what like government oversight  And all that stuff is very helpful  There you go  But this solves like a problem  It's definitely nice that this feature is there  But I think the bigger problem we're seeing now with Facebook  Is sort of like the way they're managing news  And yeah, the way people are getting information from it  And their lack of human editorial  Yeah, who knows how much that affected the election  It seems like a lot, for sure

So it's going to create a portal  To enable people on Facebook to learn which of the internet research  Agencies, Facebook pages  Of which there were many, right?  There were hundreds, or Instagram accounts  They may have liked or followed  And they didn't look like they were Russian  It wasn't like it was in Cyrillic or anything  They looked like, they tried to look like anyway  Americans, although a lot of them  Were pretty obviously fake  Is that enough? I don't know if that's enough

Start time: 6153.70
End time: 6177.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, I think Facebook keeps trying to say  That the algorithms, like their new algorithms  Will save us from their older algorithms  And definitely after the election  We're seeing, we need more  General oversight  We need more editorial oversight from Facebook  And also more, honestly  More security controls too  Like these organizations creating these groups  It feels like the sort of thing  They should be tracking already

Transcript:  I mean what I'd like to know is  What ads did I see that were Kremlin sponsored  Exactly, that too  And what were those ads for those I didn't see  Those dark ads  Like to see what those looked like  That would be an eye opener  Supposedly they're getting those together  I hope they do that  Facebook's first investor, Peter Thiel  At least according to the movie  And that's all I know about Facebook, the social network  He gave Mark Zuckerberg half a million dollars  To Facebook beyond the Harvard University campus  He sold three quarters of his stake  He's not getting out of Facebook  He's still, he sold 29 million dollars  Worth of shares  That's pretty good for half a million  He sold a total of a billion dollars  Worth of its stock  And he still owns a little bit  I don't know if this is meaningful  Although it may have something to do with the fact that Peter Thiel  Is now suing to get the right to buy Gawker's remaining assets  So he can delete the bad articles about him  Forever and ever

Start time: 6243.40

Transcript:  Of course I don't have to tell you  I probably don't have to tell you but I will anyway  Thiel  Was mad at Gawker because they outed him  In an article some time ago  And  Got his revenge when Hulk Hogan  Was suing Gawker for  Publishing a sex tape of Hulk Hogan  Hulk sued in Florida court  And we found out after he won  That Peter Thiel had funded the lawsuit  So the lawsuit  Gave a fair, I think it was a hundred  Million plus award to Hulk Hogan  Which basically bankrupted Nick Denton  The owner of Gawker  He had to sell Gawker to  Univision  But the assets, I didn't know this  The assets, the website  The bad article about Peter Thiel  And many other people still is online  Thiel initially  Couldn't buy it  There was a provision that prevented him  From buying the assets  He put him out of business and then  He wanted to buy the assets  That's a standard move in the United States  But he's now filing a motion  Saying I want to buy those assets  And I think it's safe to assume that his  Real purpose is just to  Burn it to the ground  So that nobody can see

Just in case you didn't have enough food, this is going to be  Kind of an interesting episode. We're also going to  Show you some Internet of Things cooking  Devices. We're going to have some fun with some  Sous videing and beer tasting and  All that. See how nicely roasted that's getting.  It actually gives it a very nice  Finish. Now it's Instagram  Ready. Twitter. It's What's  For Dinner. I love it in our  Chat room. Missing is saying, why pay for  All that stuff when you just get, you know, like a toaster  Oven and a pot of water for  Nothing. If you have to ask  That question, you're watching the wrong show.  That's a Jill Duffy  Question. I got  Something else you could spend some money on. Something else  That's Internet of Things enabled.  Our molecule. I love  Our molecule air purifier.  It's the first molecular  Air purifier. Now I've always been  Skeptical about these HEPA filter  Air purifiers. And I  Never bought one. But then along  Came the molecule. And Lisa, who  Has been plagued by headaches ever since  We moved to the country. Lots of pollen.  Says her headaches are gone.  Because it's not just a HEPA  Filter. The problem with HEPA filters is  They're not fine enough.  This was invented in the 40s. There haven't been any  Innovations since. They're not fine  Enough to get pollutants.  Things like black mold and  Volatile organic compounds.  The molecule  Is. The molecule uses  Photoelectrical chemical  Oxidation or PICO  To go beyond the HEPA filter. Capture and eliminate  Allergens,  Mold, bacteria,  Viruses, airborne chemicals.  Pollutants 1000 times smaller  Than those HEPA filter can capture.  And I have to tell you  It works.  One customer  Said after 15 years  I can finally breathe through my nose.  I have to say I have not been  Congested since we got the molecule.  We have it in our bedroom. Now I want to get  One for the studio. Because it doesn't  Just get dust and  Pollen. It gets organic  Compounds. It gets  Black mold. If you live in an office  You know, work in an office where they  Don't open the windows. You know that sick office  Complex. This fixes it.  Molecules technology was funded by the  EPA. It's been tested not only by real  People but university laboratories  Like the University of South Florida's Center for  Biological Defense and the University of Minnesota's  Particle calibration laboratory.  It's easy to use.  It has a slick clean design.  Really looks beautiful.  And  With a solid aluminum shell. And  I love this. Now you don't have to use  This feature. But you pair it to your  Smartphone and it will monitor  Your filters and automatically  Send you new filters.  Automatically when you need them.  So you don't even have to think about it.  It has two kinds of filters. It has  An air filter but it also has this  Really interesting  Substrate that is a  Catalyst. And the  VOCs, the very fine particles  The black mold adhere to the catalysts.  And then they're burned off by, and you can see  The blue light from the molecule.  They're actually burned off by  The blue light so that you never  You never breathe them in. It's the apple  Of air purifiers.  Now you can but you don't have to  Connect molecule to your wifi network. Which means  I can control it. In fact I can turn my molecule  Off and on from here.  But you don't have to  Some people say I don't want an IOT device.  You can just use it as a regular air purifier. There's a switch  On the top. You can control it completely.  We have been  Blown away by this and I want to get one  For every room in the house and I want to get one from the studio too.  Right now you can get $75  Off your first order at Molecule.com  If you use the promo code TWIT.  They will also I think check but I think  That you also get a free year subscription to  Filters. It is  A really remarkable system. And by the way  If you don't pair it with your wifi  If you don't connect it to the bluetooth. They'll still  Do the filter subscription but they just  Send it on a regular you know monthly  Basis as opposed to when it's needed.  That's the only difference.  It is amazing. I want at least go to  M-O-L-E-K  U-L-E.com and check it out.  Molecule with a K.com  And read about it.  And I will testify.  It works. Lisa will testify.  She hasn't had a headache. In fact I took the molecule  Out of the room once.  And she had a headache the next day.  And she said what did you do? I said oh  It's going back. Molecule  U-L-E-K-U-L-E.com. Use the promo code  Twit. It's molecule with a K.  And it really  Works. I've turned down a lot of  What I consider kind of sketch  Purifier products. Ionizers  And stuff. We don't want to do ads for those.  And I even before we  Did the ad for the molecule. I said no I have to  Have it. I have to use it. I have to make sure it really does  What it says it does. And I did  All the research and I have to say this is the one I was  Willing to advertise. This really does work. I know  It's a little expensive.  But 75 bucks off it's really worth it.  Molecule.com. Use the offer code  Twit.  Let's see.  Anything to say about Twitter?  You like the 280 characters?  Are you happy? Everybody loving the tweet storm  Feature? I guess it's testing a tweet storm  Feature. I don't have that yet.  I haven't seen that. I don't want to  Encourage tweet storms. Let's not encourage tweet storms.  I don't like tweet storms.  That's a bad idea.  I've seen people who were effectively  Writing blog posts  As multiple like 20  Thing tweets.  Why would you do that?

It didn't cost much more than my Model X.  $150,000. That's nothing for a semi.  Take to it on the road, Leo.  I'm so tempted.  I could trade in my Model X. Just throw in a couple  Of maybe 10 grand more and I'd have a  Semi.  It doesn't include the  It's just the cab, right? You don't get the  The truck part.

Lance Yulanov writing in  Actually, this was last month, so I'm going to see if I  Can find a more recent one.  Mashable writes, Elon  Musk, master of deception.  Did Elon Musk lie to  Us?  They say,  This is from a website called  Seeking Alpa, who are going to believe Elon Musk's  Words are your own lying eyes?  So, I'm  One of those people who kind of buys the  Kool-Aid, and I, you know,  One of the problems people say is, you can't, this truck  Can't possibly exist with current battery  Technology. The 500 mile range,  The, you know, the acceleration.  And the roadster is even  More challenging. And then they  Can't even build a Model 3 because it turns out  The Gigafactory, the battery plant he built  Next to your dad in Reno  Isn't cranking out the batteries.  His newest  Promises break the law of batteries.  Carson, where is that  Article? That's the one I'm talking  About.  Break the law of batteries.  Let me Google that.  But I, for one,  Want him to succeed. Yeah, it's in Bloomberg.

I think Tesla was in trouble for a very long time,  As was SpaceX.  But he proved certain things were  Possible, right? He got the cars out there.  SpaceX is doing  What they're doing, shuttle deliveries.  They've proved their relaunching capabilities.  But yeah, I wonder if he's  Going too far at this point, for sure.

Transcript:  Yeah, I think one of the more  Troubling things is just the fact that they can't  Build enough Model 3s and get them out the door.  Because that was supposed to be like  Their one car that was supposed to be  Not for the masses, but it's the closest  To being for the masses. And if you can't live up to those  Promises, it doesn't almost  Matter what the other  Promises he's making about battery technology and that sort of  Thing. It's like you gotta deliver on something  That is going to be in more driveways, and he's  Not getting it done so far.

Transcript:  Even if Tesla,  Bloomberg writes, achieves record-breaking efficiency  For the truck, it would still require  And by the way, Tesla claims the truck  Is more aerodynamic than a sports car.  But even if Tesla achieves  Record-breaking efficiency for the truck, it would still require  A battery capacity  Somewhere from 600 to 1,000 kilowatt hours.  Say it's 800 kilowatt hours.  That would mean a battery that weighs  More than 10,000 pounds.  A 5-ton battery.  The battery alone would cost $100,000  Even before you build the truck around it.  And he's claiming  The truck will be $150,000.  And then, in order to charge it,  You need to build something  That doesn't exist, the mega-charger.  An electric vehicle analyst at Bloomberg  Says, I don't understand how that works.  I really don't.  A charger that can  Charge this truck 400 miles of  Range in 30 minutes.  To meet Tesla's claim,  The new mega-chargers  Would have to achieve an output of more than  1200 kilowatts.  That's 10 times more  Than the super-chargers they're making today.  But you know what?  I would not bet against Elon Musk.  And so far, the stock market hasn't.  Although, his burn rate  What was the number?  Like a billion dollars  A month or something?  Crazy burn rate.  At that rate, he's going to run out of money.  He's going to have to go back  And get more money fairly soon.

You know Hank Scorpio from The Simpsons?  He's just this crazy wacko  Possibly super villain.  Possibly evil genius.  We're not really sure yet.  But I think that's part of what he does  When he over promises.  He continues branding himself  As somebody who shoots for the moon.  And is unabashedly  Enthusiastic  About his own dreams.  And I think that plays  A lot into the American psyche.

Transcript:  I love him.  We've got to wrap up pretty soon because  HQ is coming up at 6 o'clock.  It's an $8,000 prize today.  And today is going to be my day.  Any of you play this game?  A bit.  I don't know very much.  Last time I played a couple of nights ago  142,000 people.  It's a live trivia game. It's nothing special, frankly.  But somehow it's captured people's imagination.  Maybe it's because they give away real money.  142,000 people were playing  Was it last night or the night before?  But the questions are really hard.  You have to answer all 12 correctly.  And then whoever's left will split the pot.  And I've seen people win $100.  It's real money.  You get a PayPal credit.  But the star of the show  Scott Rogowski  Is actually a guy who was a comic  In Manhattan for a decade.  Was about to leave.  He was about to move away.  He woke up on his dreams.  When he got the audition call  For HQ.  And he has now become a star.  And the Daily Beast  Wanted to write a profile  Of this guy.  So they contacted HQ.  And the founder of HQ  Who's a former Vine founder  Russ Yusupov said no.  Can't talk to him.  But the Beast went ahead and called Scott.  They actually sent an email to Scott and Russ.  Russ' response was no.  Scott contacted him. So they went and they interviewed him.  And chatted  With the Daily Beast.  At that point  The reporter reached out to the  HQ public relations account.  And Russ Yusupov.  Letting him know that they planned to write a story  About the host. Several hours later received an email  From Yusupov stating HQ  Was not making Scott available to discuss  His involvement with HQ with the media or the press.  So the reporter said  Well we already interviewed him.  The story is almost done.  Let us know if you have any concerns.  Did you guys read this?  It's hard not to just laugh.  Wait so did they go to HQ first?

Transcript:  Simultaneously went to HQ  And Scott.  HQ turned him down.  But Scott said alright.  So hey good reporter. He said okay good.  Yusupov the CEO of HQ  Called the reporter's cell phone and immediately  Raised his voice. He said  We were completely unauthorized to write  About Scott or HQ without his approval  And if he wrote any type of piece about Scott  I will fire him.  Yusupov continued to threaten Scott's job  Even after the Daily Beast explained  The story is framed around his daily life.  It revealed no corporate information.  You're putting Scott's job in jeopardy.  Is that what you want Yusupov said? Scott could lose his job.  Read me your story word for word  Or you can email it to me.  Reporter says although we don't typically share  The contents of our pieces we did share  Quotes from Rogowski.  Yusupov's objections began with a line  Scott said that despite his attention  He's still able to walk down the street and order  His favorite salad from Sweet Green  Without being accosted.  He cannot say that! Yusupov shouted.  We do not have a brand deal with Sweet Green  Under no circumstances can he say that.  Anyway the piece ended up being  About Russ Yusupov  Threatening to fire Rogowski  Yusupov backed down and in fact  Has now tweeted an apology saying  He was you know  Being a crazy start up guy  And the stress was getting to him and  Sorry.  But I think what's interesting is that  When Scott is not on HQ  If you watch the chat room people go crazy  They have some other hosts they use  Scott has become a real  Celebrity and I think he has enough power  At this point that I don't think he's going to get fired.  Just a funny  Funny story.  Nothing much to say about it.  It's kind of sad too because that guy

Intel  Golly this is a sad story  Has found more bugs in the management engine  This is a feature  The Intel management engine  On a lot of PCs  Pretty much every PC it's built in  It's not active on non-vpro PCs  However  There are eight severe bugs  In the IME  The trusted execution engine  And the server platform services  And as we've talked about on  Security now  Turns out they can be  Utilized  It can be attacked  It can be exploited  Through the USB port  So you can plug in a device called a JTAG  Programmer into the USB port  And completely own the machine.  So many people  Are now starting to get  Firmware updates. I know the  Lenovo has pushed those out  Other manufacturers are planning to push those out  And now we have updates to the Intel management engine  That  Fix the problem  There were a lot of people concerned about the fact that this  Basically it's an operating system  It's a Minix operating system sitting in your PC  That was designed  You know  I guess for  Remote management  And of course anytime there's something like that  In a machine, bad guys are going to take advantage of it.

They're $100,000 ransom  And then made them sign an NDA saying  They would never tell anybody about it. Of course, that's a violation  Of the law. You're legally supposed  To report breaches  7 million drivers  50 million riders  The drivers lost  Driver's license information, the riders  Account information, but not  Credit card numbers or anything like that.  The security officer  In charge of the time, Joe Sullivan, was fired  When the new CEO learned about this.  But the latest story is the new  CEO might have known a lot sooner  Took them a while to figure out what to do about it.  I think they had to reveal it.  I think not doing so would have  Made them liable.  Sullivan's fired. Kalanick is on the board  But of course is not an active manager.  He's not the CEO anymore.  Dara Koshwai  You better help me with his name.  Am I saying it right?  Dara Koshwai  Said he only recently  Learned of the breach, although  The latest I've seen is that he's known about it  For a couple of months.  Yet another problem  At Uber.  I still use Uber.

Find for me, well that's the same thing I've been covering and writing about or  Maybe not did get to talk to you guys.  But I just like to see I like if the same works with software.  To my own by my self think.  Which is one of the ikided by me.  And it sent me into the talk show.  While I'm doing pretty well.  And I feel better all the time.

And this guy Dr. Pimsleur came up with a theory about how often you need to repeat and  recall something.  So Pimsleur is very rigid in that you listen to one file per day and every so many days  it will ask you to recall something you did say two days ago.  So it's all about triggering the memory.  Right now one of the apps I really like is called 50 language.  No, I'm sorry not 50 languages.  Hello Talk.  And Hello Talk pairs you up with somebody who speaks the language you want to learn  and vice versa.  And then you can practice with one another and send each other corrections while you're  chatting.  So I've actually met a number of people who live in Romania and Moldova and are actually  young people who speak the language on the street.  And that's been a wonderful way to just kind of exercise it a little bit.

Transcript:  Yeah.  There's another one actually something you said earlier about reading and wanting to  hear the audio of something while you have the text highlighted.  There's an app called BeLingua app.  It doesn't have Romanian so I was using it in Spanish but it does exactly that.  It will highlight the words in Spanish as you read and then if you choose to see the  English too you can see the English translation all while playing the audio of the Spanish.  And you can find articles online that are about tech or society and culture or whatever  you have an interest in and then you can kind of practice your reading skills that way.

Transcript:  And I think it's actually helpful to see the words and you can hear them too right?  Because a lot of times if I'm learning a language from audio alone I like to see the word  because then I can associate the two.  And I don't know why but I feel like that's a better way to learn it for me.  Maybe that's just my style.
