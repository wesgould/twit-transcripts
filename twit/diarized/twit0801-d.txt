But they said that, you know, people just aren't  buying textbooks anymore. They all all these young people today get their information from YouTube  and Google. So that's right. My wife said, Well, why don't you pitch the same exact thing  is willing to invest. So I'm happy to announce right here on live Twitter, my new series,  the unlocked series.

But I'm really looking forward to your next book couple  of months ago, I went through a phase where I thought I should prepare for climate change.  Because it doesn't look like we're gonna do anything in time. So I really should figure out,  you know, what I'm going to do in the next 30 years. But you actually have written the book that  one must read it sounds like when does this come out? Oh, man, you put put put your

Transcript:  Guess what? Actually, here in Northern California, you're in Connecticut right now, but here in  Northern California, David, but here in Northern California, and you too, Richard, Southern  California, we had the worst wildfires over the last few years. That's really what's scaring me.  I don't know. I don't know if I can stay here. It's been really bad. Not the climate haven.

Start time: 496.40
End time: 519.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  but it is lurking out there. It is. The thing I worry about the least of all of those things,  like it should be the thing I'm most concerned. I felt like when I was a kid, that was the thing  I was the most scared of, was the most concerned about. And then because you know, it's like we had  the Landersquake and then we had Northridge and it was like, oh, the big one's coming. And now I'm  just like, ah, that was like the least of my worries. I'm more concerned about, you know,

Start time: 519.20
End time: 671.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  not having water in five years. Yeah. Life is just uncertain. I think worrying about the future is  probably doesn't pay off, but there's plenty to worry about in the present.  We can worry about that. In fact, this story just breaking as we began the show from Reuters,  hackers believed to be working for Russia have been monitoring internal email traffic at the  U.S. Treasury Department and another agency that decides internet and telecommunications policy.  This is now in the hands of the National Security Council. They had an emergency meeting at the  White House today. There's concern within the U.S. intelligence community that the Russian hackers  who targeted Treasury and the Commerce Department's National Telecommunications  and Informations Administration have used a similar tool to break into other government agencies.  This is according to Reuters who say they learned this from four people briefed on the matter,  but the people didn't say which other agencies. As always, it's hard to attribute these,  but apparently Russia is currently believed to be behind the attack. You may remember  that FireEye, which is a big U.S. cybersecurity company, was hacked fairly recently and  apparently tools that they had, hacking tools they had were exfiltrated.  It is believed that perhaps these are related.  This is a mess and probably couldn't have happened at a worse time. Maybe it could have  been worse if it had happened right before the election. The hackers broke into the NTIA's  Microsoft Office 365. Staff emails were monitored by hackers for months. This is one of those  advanced persistent threats. They sat on the network and watched what was going on.  The hackers are highly sophisticated according to Reuters and have been able to trick the  Microsoft platform's authentication controls. Another person briefed on the matter said this  is for sure a nation state. The full scope of the breach is as yet unclear. There's not much to say.  As you're listening to this, we're talking on a Sunday afternoon. This is just breaking. I  suspect over the next few days we'll learn more. Maybe. This is where I think

Start time: 674.66
End time: 692.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  warfare is headed, cyber warfare for sure. It's weird. There really hasn't been a lot of breach  news in a year. Remember for a while every other month it was Sony, it was Target, it was somebody.  I guess it's like everybody got distracted with the pandemic.

Start time: 692.24
End time: 699.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We had so many other things to worry about. But you know what? The hackers were not slowed  down by the pandemic. They took that as an opportunity in many cases I think.

Start time: 701.80
End time: 746.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's one thing for the government, but for the average person it's like I always just think about  what I have out there and what I could be hacked with. It's like that two factor  authentication. I talk to people all the time. You got to set this up. You got to make sure you  use different passwords. I'm talking to people all the time. I'm sure all of you know this,  but when you're a tech person you're kind of like that doctor at the party where you're like,  all right, now tell me your passwords so I can figure this out. It's like, okay, it's  Roomba1234. I'm like, what? They're like, oh, try 12345 at the end. I'm like, wait, seriously?  This is the thing. People are still using these terrible passwords and they don't want to make  it hard because then they can't log in. It's really a bad thing.

Start time: 746.88
End time: 767.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  But Rich, here's the thing. It doesn't matter. Even if everybody in the country magically started  using long complicated passwords, all distinct and change them every day, that's completely  irrelevant to data breaches. A breach is when they get the database of passwords. It doesn't matter.  It's not our fault. It's not our stupid passwords. It doesn't even matter at that point when they get

Start time: 768.02
End time: 772.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  a password because they already have all your information. It's like a whole database.

Start time: 773.44
End time: 787.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  So they got into the Microsoft authentication. It looks like they were just watching the emails  being sent back and forth. I mean, are we not putting two factor on our government 365 accounts?  I'm sure we are. So although remember four years ago, the DNC hack,

Start time: 788.52
End time: 798.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Marty Podesta, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, what was his password? It was  like password 123 or something. It was terrible. It was fished.  It was fished.

Start time: 799.26
End time: 836.57
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It reminds me of a long time ago, someone told me whatever technology you see the military  have, they're 20 years ahead. And I would like to amend that today to say whatever  cipher technology you see all of us using, subtract 20 years. That's what the government's using  because I feel like we just could not upgrade our infrastructure. And really a big part of it is,  you see these senators, these representatives, these Congress people, they're printing out their  tweets. They're printing them out. It's wild.

Start time: 838.64
End time: 847.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Executives still do that. I'm not on email. I'll just have my secretary print out the email and  I'll read it and handwrite the answer. And would you send that for me?

Start time: 848.04
End time: 869.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Well, it's like large corporations, this new software comes out and they don't want to  upgrade their computers because it breaks one tiny piece of functionality that they use in their  organization. And so it's like, I'm editing on one version of a program because I've got my  personal computer and someone I'm working with is like, oh, I can't update. I haven't updated in a  year because it breaks our graphics program. It's like, wait, what? Come on.

Start time: 870.08
End time: 1086.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  This is something I try to explain on the radio show and I don't think I've done a very good job,  there is this issue of your personal information, as you pointed out, of your personal information  or your phone being hacked or whatever. That's less likely because these are kind of general  attacks across a broad scope of people. They're not going after you per se. It's all a numbers game.  That's a little easier to protect against. In fact, I think everybody can doing simple things  like two factor, but then there's another level entirely of this nation state hacking where,  I mean, we're learning about, we learned about just last week, a drive by attack on iPhones.  It's been patched. I don't want to scare you, but it was discovered last spring by Google's  project zero where you wouldn't even have to touch the iPhone. You could be in another room,  capture the airdrop packets flying through the air, modify them. You could hack the iPhone,  get into it, get full access to everything on the iPhone, but worse yet, it could then  worm itself into every other iPhone it encounters. So a nation state, sitting at a cafe in Tel Aviv,  waiting for the Israeli attache or the US attache to walk by, have a cup of coffee,  hack his phone, he goes back to the US embassy. Every phone in the embassy is then hacked by him  and turned via a wormable exploit. This was a nightmare attack, a no touch, no involvement  attack. That's the kind of thing that fortunately was patched and probably isn't going to bite any  one of us, but I would not be surprised at all if a nation state or somebody like FireEye had this  for a long time and just, they sat on it because they're using it for specific targeted attacks.  So I try to explain on the radio, there's a mass attack. Those are easy to thwart. You don't have  to worry so much, but if you're a spy, a military attache, if you're the target of a nation state,  it's basically hopeless. You're dead. And so I don't know what we're doing for OpsSec. The  fact that the Treasury Department was hacked probably shouldn't be too surprising. We had a  panel a little while ago, Red Team versus Blue Team, about attack and defense, a last pass panel  last month. And we had people like Bruce Schneier on. Bruce, who is one of the key kings of security,  said, it's hopeless. There's nothing you can do. You assume, you should assume that you're not only  under attack, but that you've been hacked and that they are wandering around. You should assume that.  There is nothing you can do. You try to mitigate it maybe, and there are lots of things you should  be doing and one hopes that the Treasury Department and NTIA was doing. But this is my fear,  and this is what I actually was getting at, David, was I think just like we have a Geneva Accord,  because there are some military technologies like poison gas that are so horrendous, we just agree  universally never to use these. Because if one side does and you do, it's just horrendous.  That we need a Geneva Accord for cyber attacks, because these are so  pervasive and problematic. If we use them, they're going to use them. We all have to agree to just  put these by the wayside. Do you think that's even possible? No, I'm not sure. I mean,

Start time: 1088.02
End time: 1112.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I know where you're coming from, Leo. I mean, you've always been a huge advocate for security  and privacy. I've always been a little more relaxed about it. I mean, not for state secrets,  obviously, obviously, obviously. But when it comes to targeted ads, for example.  Yeah, it doesn't bother me. No, I agree.  I get some of my best ideas for reviews from the targeted ads, the tech products that show up.

Start time: 1112.40
End time: 1116.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I'd rather see ads for a product I'm interested in than something I'm not interested in, of course.

Start time: 1118.96
End time: 1138.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Although you did say something, you're like, we've probably all been hacked. Have you fooled  around in the latest Mac and iOS operating systems in that new Safari password protocol checker?  I love that. It shows you which of your passwords have been in a breach.  It's amazing. Chrome has a similar tool for that.

Start time: 1138.96
End time: 1141.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And actually, Firefox and Chrome have been doing for a while with extensions.

Start time: 1142.52
End time: 1159.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  One password also has a watchtower feature that notifies you if you double up on passwords on any  given website, if it's been used in a breach. I mean, it prompts you for a whole bunch of stuff,  which I use one password. That's the password manager that I have been using for the past years.

Start time: 1159.90
End time: 1175.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  And a lot of credit to Troy Hunt of Have I Been Pwned, because he's been the guy who has been  keeping track of password breaches. You can go to haveibnpwned.com and see if a password that you  use is in these breaches. It almost always is. Yeah.

Start time: 1176.36
End time: 1243.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I think there's two things, though, like what David was saying. There's privacy, and I get it.  Privacy is so overblown. I deal with the average person that's watching the news,  and they're always worried about Facebook tracking them and Instagram and all that stuff.  And when it came to the COVID-19 exposure notification systems in California,  everyone was like, no way. That's government tracking me. I'm like, well, it's not.  But I think there's privacy and then there's security. And I think that when it comes to  your email and your photos, I would hope that people want those to remain private.  And it seems to me that companies like Google and all these other companies are trying to,  they're almost protecting us from ourselves. When we use these, I was helping my dad the other day  with some photos, and I logged in with his password for my computer.  And even though he doesn't have two factor on, it still said, we think something's a little  suspicious here, because they saw I was logging in from California versus where he lives and where  he typically logs in. I thought that was pretty smart. I was like, that's a good kind of protection  that he wouldn't have in place. But Google kind of figures that out. So I do think there's two  things riding, which is privacy and security, which they're not always the same.

Start time: 1244.02
End time: 1306.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  They do. But they do, to some degree, together. I'll give you an example, David, of a privacy  invasion that actually is related to this and could be a hazard.  Apparently, the United States has been using the Patriot Act to gather logs of website visitors  so the Patriot Act, which gives government very broad powers, has been used by FBI to collect logs  from websites that list everybody who's visited those web pages. Now, that's a privacy breach,  but then when the government gets it, that becomes something of a little more concern.  And then when the government is breached, that becomes something of a little bit more concern.  So they do tie together. And I'm with you. I'm not a privacy puritan. I'm not saying...  It's understandable. We trade a certain amount of privacy or a certain amount of convenience  and usefulness. But at the same time, there is a relationship between your security and your

Start time: 1307.02
End time: 1364.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  privacy. And when you... I mean, the biggest tech companies are built on this. I mean, built on...  Oh yeah. Google and Facebook.  Like you said, I mean, yeah. I mean, it's like...  That's their job.  Apple is really the only one that's kind of done a pretty good job of just...  Like you pay a premium for that.  Exactly right. And that's why when people are talking about how expensive Apple stuff is,  it's like, well, when you go on the iPhone, the stuff that they have built into the latest  operating system is like, it's pretty amazing. Like that one... I don't know, if you download  a new app and it says, do you want to share... We get the whole one-time share of your location,  but then it goes into like, do you want to share your course privacy or your course location or  your precise, which is something that like Twitter is collecting people's exact locations  for years now. And the fact that you can... That Apple kind of realizes that and says,  okay, you know what? Let's give them like city level versus like exactly where Rich  Tabiro is tweeting from. That's pretty ingenious for Apple to... And now I think Google is doing  a little bit more of that with their operating system.

Start time: 1364.24
End time: 1383.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And that feels fair, right? Like that feels...  Fair to me. Like it's like, okay, I get that there are some pieces of information that help  these companies, these tech companies make better products, do their job. Obviously like  Apple's voice assistant that I'm not going to say her name because my home pod is going to go crazy.

Start time: 1383.44
End time: 1386.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We call her Shlomo around here. She never responds to that.

Start time: 1386.38
End time: 1407.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The thing is, that's the exchange that we make for having... If you own an Apple product,  you're giving less data in that way to Apple. And so they're going to have a subpar product  compared to the other voice assistants out there that collect a lot more information on a regular  basis because it's opt out, not opt in. I'm a little cynical. I kind of feel like

Start time: 1408.50
End time: 1412.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Apple would collect this information if it could.

Start time: 1412.36
End time: 1420.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Well, that's it, right? It's not out of the goodness of their hearts. They're not altruistic.  It's just because their business model isn't selling ads.

Start time: 1420.50
End time: 1433.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Also because they tried to sell ads and that flopped. Their iAds product was a flop.  So they made a virtue out of a failure and said, hey, you know what? We don't want that  information after all. That's a classic Steve Jobs.

Start time: 1433.16
End time: 1460.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  And now it's a marketing. Now it's marketing because it's like every other company. If you  look at Amazon, all of the smart home products from the three big companies, or I guess if you  include Facebook, but the portal hasn't really taken off. But if you look at all those products,  I mean, really they're, they're way like, I was thinking about this the other day because I've  got the Google assistant here and I noticed when my kids said something, they stopped a timer  and Google at the end said something. I can't remember what it was. It was like, by the way,  you know, I can also do this. And I was like, what?

I mean, they show these declarations when you download an app, this app would like this data.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  You know, it's funny with the, you know, with the whole privacy thing when it comes to Apple,  like, cause I actually, I actually don't like that Apple protects my privacy because when,  you know, when I'm using an Android device, it's kind of like that thing that David was talking  about that we were just talking about where you type in one letter and it kind of, it autocompletes  exactly what it thinks you're searching for. Whereas on my iPhone, because it doesn't collect  all that data, it's like, I have to type so many more things in. Like I'm like just doing more.

If you didn't know any better- None of my, none of your business.  How would, how would my mom know to go into settings and go into, you know, the security thing and say,  you know, open anyway. She would never find that. Right. A thousand percent.

Transcript:  How about you Ashley? Do you trust Apple? So I think of the four of us, I'm the only not white man  in this panel. I believe you're correct. Yes. And I think that for me, I have seen  too many friends. I've seen too many news stories about Rich. Rich made a really good point a little  while ago that there's a difference between a targeted ad and somebody having access to say  like your photos in a breach, right? Your private things you want to keep private. And you know, I,  I put pictures of my kid online every now and again, but I would not fire hose them on the  internet. And you know, I have pictures, just, just cherished pictures of like my family's  subsist. You know, I have a picture of my grandma in the ICU the day she passed away, like just  pictures that like, I would never want made public. I just would never want a picture like that.  Would you trust iCloud with them? And, and I, I trust Apple enough to choose their product over

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think because of their stance on encryption, I'm, I am more inclined to choose Apple. If Google  changed its mind, if they, I, it's, it's a hard conversation to have because as David mentions,  and it's a little bit of a cynics take, but it's not untrue, which is how much can you trust any  of these tech companies to actually tell us what's going on, what they're actually collecting,  how much they know about us, how much access they have. I mean, Apple can say all day long,  like we don't have access to XYZ thing on your phone, but like, do we really know that? I,  we don't, you know, and, and we may never know that, but, but at the end of the day,  with the information that is in front of me and what I know and what I would like to protect,  the, the, the information I would like to protect, I, I use an iPhone for that reason. And I, I  actually have gotten away from, I left Gmail for that, which is, this has been a wild,  couple of months for me. Leaving Gmail has been like just very bizarre and extricating yourself  from that ecosystem is difficult. But I moved over to Hey.com and-  Oh, really?  Yeah.

Transcript:  So Basecamp says that they're supporting it permanently. Like this is not a thing that  they're going to sundown. I actually, oddly enough, I think I trust Basecamp more than I trust Google  to launch a new product and keep that alive. Cause it just literally just like kill things-  You can't trust Google. You can't trust Google.  All the time. So it's, you know, Gmail is like one of the few things that they haven't killed.  So I, so I'm, why not? I'm trying it out. I mean, all my stuff still stays on my,  my Gmail account. It's, it's on that server. But new emails now are going to that Hey.com email  address.  It's funny. I did the same thing a few years ago. I moved everything off Gmail a few years ago.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was using Gmail cause they had the best anti-spam filtering, but once-  Once it didn't matter, I started using Fastmail, which is an Australian email provider,  because I figured, well, I'm paying them. That's probably better than getting something for free.  And I'm slowly weaning myself off of Google. I used to really love Google, but I,  I'm starting to trust them less and less. And we're going to talk a little bit about their labor  issues and firing Timur Jebru, which is pretty horrendous and some of the things they've been  doing lately. I feel like they're less and less trustworthy if even because their attention span  is so short.  Yes, a hundred percent. And I do trust Apple. I do trust Apple, but I, but I,  but the only way you should really trust a company is by looking at what their profit motive is,  because their only job is to maximize profits. And I trust Apple to protect my privacy mostly  because it's in their interest. It's in their profit interest. That's their business model.  And the more that becomes a business model, the more I will trust them. Ultimately though,  if what you're worried about is that they're going to give your grandmother's picture to  the government, I wouldn't trust them because they will do that at the drop of a hat.  Not that the government wants that.

It's a long time ago.  They fixed that.  But, but generally speaking, like for me, it's been partly what you were talking about with like,  I just, you know, the whole like, what is it?

I'm like, I just, I would like to stop supporting  companies that I really feel are like actively harming as opposed to maybe like  Bumbling, I guess a bumbling sort of like ignorance harm.  But it's just like it really, to me, I just, I'm at a point now where I'm like, I just,  I can't support that anymore. It's like Facebook, for example, I just feel really strongly that  it just is actively harming society.  I don't want to give them my attention.  I got to get, I want out of that system and there is nothing I want more than to get out of  Instagram or have the government break it up. I'm just, I would like to be out of that ecosystem.  I want an Oculus so bad and I just will not buy one. I will not buy one.

So let me ask you, cause you started this and I don't know, is it because we're white men,  privacy is a, it's a privileged position we have about security and privacy that people of color  and women can't afford. Is that kind of.

Start time: 2019.70

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I think it's, I think it's, I think in my experience and I can't speak for the larger  because I don't study it. I don't research it. Full disclosure there like, and fully admitted,  but in, in my experience and, and having been around tech for the, for over a decade at this  point and, and talk to so many people about it, I have found that oddly enough, like just straight  white men tend to tend to care the least about, about giving their data away for something.  Returned. It is a privilege in a way. And, and there are a lot of people in this world who need  anonymity. There are people in other countries and are maybe even in our country who are afraid  of being tracked because they're, they're protesting something that is really important to them.  And they, they don't want people to know who they are or they're giving information to the public  that they, you know, is really, is really sensitive. And, you know, for me, it's just,  it's very much like I, every, every woman in tech that I know is like very protective of their data  and very protective of their information. And, you know, I have this problem even outside of tech,  you know, we have these scraper sites in California where, where for whatever reason,  like, I don't know how it is in other States, but, you know, we have these like, what is it?  Like Spokeo or whatever, where you can look up a person and their address.  And it's just, why does this exist? Like we have this,  because it's public information. It's public information, but why does it have to be public  information? I could have, I remember the time where you could be like unlisted in the phone book,  right? Like you pay a little extra or whatever, and you, yeah, you pay for that. But the thing is,  is like, this is sort of how we built this and technology came along and we just said, well,  we'll just keep doing what we were doing before without actually considering the ramifications  of that, which is now not only can I look somebody up in a, in a phone book, the phone book is now  the entire world. And so it's the internet. And so for me, you know, California or any other state

Transcript:  Ashley, it sounds like that you're retreating from Facebook and Google is not about,  you are afraid that they can get access to your data and some human is going to look at it.  It's more a general discomfort with their negative effect on society.

Start time: 2174.56
End time: 2234.90
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And I think that it's, it's mostly that it's sort of that like lesser of all evils where I'm  just like, I, I feel so uncomfortable. The line has been so crossed with those companies in a lot  of ways that I just can't, I can no longer bring myself to, to, to put myself in their ecosystems.  Like that's a, it's a big thing for me. So it's not necessarily that I really feel in an extra  level of trust with Apple, but it's that at least at the base level of it, like Rich was saying,  I know that their business model and Leo is like their business model sort of relies on protecting  user information. And so at the very, just the bare minimum lowest bar, at least they can sort  of like half clear that. Like that's, that's how I feel about it. It's just, it's, it's so,  you know, I think you're right. We can't just, you can't take any of these companies word. I mean,  it's just, it's all a bunch of corporate, you know, back speak. They have a responsibility to

Transcript:  on board with, you know, being, making part of your identity, a product or a company. And this is why  I used to be Android Ashley. Like when I started out in this industry, I was Android Ashley. And  I remember getting death threats and rape threats. When I got in, I had tweeted, I got an iPhone as a  second line just to know what the competition was. That was it. That was all the only reason I got an  iPhone. And, and I got so many awful emails from people who were just furious. And, you know,  I just, to me, I can't, there are things I am enthusiastic about. There are things I am a fan of.  There are certain things I absolutely love. There are game companies that I love, and there are  tech companies that I really enjoy. And there are products I really like. And, and I will tell my  friends about them and evangelize about them because I enjoy them and I think they're good.  But at the end of the day, I just, I can't attach my identity to any of these companies. And I think  that that's actually one of the biggest problems that we see in, in sort of like the consumer base.  We've sort of turned it into this like, it's not just tech Ashley. This is universal. This tribalism.  Yeah. This tribalism is like, it's winners and losers. It's no longer sort of, it's, yeah, it's  just winners and losers. And it's like, it just doesn't have to be that. Like it just never has

Does anybody know what that, that there was a, again, like there was something I had read where  they said, imagine every single person in the world getting their own newspaper written exactly  for them to tell them only the news that they want to hear. And like, that's basically the internet.  You don't have to imagine. Yeah. And it's like, that's, that's what it is. It's that everyone gets,  no one's getting the same. Everyone gets this little individualized thing. And I don't know

It's so low cost that I think people do and say things that they wouldn't  normally do and say. Being abusive is easy and free. Yeah. I want to take a little break. We  should get to, we've been circling around this, but we should get to this. Facebook has been sued  for monopolization by the FTC 46 states, DC and Guam. This is a big lawsuit. Unlike perhaps some  of the other lawsuits we've seen recently. I don't think it's political. I think this one's  pretty serious, but we will at stock market didn't agree, but we'll talk about it when we come back  in just a little bit. Great panel here. David Pogue and his cat. What's his name? This is Wilbur.  Wilbur. Hello, Wilbur. Wilbur. Adorable. We've got Rich Demuro and his little teeny weeny Christmas  tree and Ashley and Jack Skellington. They're all here doing the show today. We thank you all for  being here. It's always fun to get together with my favorite people and talk about tech.  Yeah. And we do often end up talking about privacy. I mean that and security,  that really is often the topic. Our show today brought to you as it often is by stamps.com.  The holidays are upon us.

Transcript:  I don't know. The post office gives them a deal for one because of their volume. David, you know  Indissia, right? This is the thing when you print a stamp with stamps.com. There used to be other  companies doing this. I think Stamp owns them all, including Indissia, but that's called Indissia.  And there's a barcode on it and stuff. It speeds up the mail for the post office so much because  they can scan that. I think they actually want you, they really prefer you do that.  The other thing that happens, normally you can't put a package that's greater than a pound in the  mail since 9-11. You have to bring it to the post office so they can look at you and say,  are you a terrorist? But because stamps.com's Indissia ties to your account, you can put it  in the post office box. It doesn't matter if it's more than a pound. So the post office wants you  to do this. There's also, let's be honest, there's a subscription with stamps.com. I don't know how  much of that goes towards it as well, but it's not that much. So, I mean, there's no, it's not like  you get a nickel off every stamp up to the first 10. It's like forever. So I don't,  that's what I'm saying. I don't understand why people don't use it, but this is not-

That's not part of the ad either. So, Wednesday, Federal Trade Commission came out with a 124 page  lawsuit, which I read from cover to cover, fascinating,  indicting Facebook for monopolistic practices. They had a lot of, you know, clearly they'd been  doing their research for a long time. They had emails, they had a lot of internal information.  They had what I consider in many cases, smoking guns, Mark Zuckerberg saying,  yeah, we got to buy Instagram and put them out of business, things like that. It seems to me to be  an open the shut case, but the problem, I'm sure it won't be, I'm sure it'll go on for years. The  problem is, what's the remedy? My wife was saying this the other day, she said, you can't, it's like  you can't make them get rid of Instagram and WhatsApp now. Like you gave them permission  years ago. You can't say, oh, sorry, we take it back. Or can you?

Well, he's right, but he's also wrong because I also looked up the actual approval letter from  the FTC when it happened. And the last line, you can look this up online is we reserve the right at

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  any point to revisit this decision. And now they are.  And you could make the case when they bought Instagram, you know, it was a little company  that had five employees. They weren't huge. Although in the indictment, they make the strong  case that they were already so successful that it was legitimate for Facebook to say these guys  could eat our lunch. But a lot of people say, oh, Instagram wouldn't have been Instagram.  WhatsApp wouldn't have been WhatsApp if Facebook hadn't bought them.  But it was very clear, I think, that Facebook looked at these companies and others like Snapchat.  They mentioned a company that Facebook tried to buy forever, but they didn't say the name.  I had to be Snapchat, right? I don't know.

Transcript:  I think that that wasn't. That's the point, which is that they had internal documents  and they were probably, rightly so, being a little protective of Facebook's privileged  business information. That they had access to stuff that wasn't public. Must have been, right?  Otherwise, they don't protect it.

Transcript:  But the document makes a really good case that Facebook either bought companies and subsumed  them like WhatsApp and Instagram, or just bought them to shut them down. They named Glancy and  another one. They just bought them and then, and they said, this is all a screaming violation of  the Sherman Antitrust Act, right? And you read this document, you're like, of course, like very  obvious. But I kept thinking, but they all do this. Apple, Google, Microsoft, they all buy up  companies and shut them down.

Transcript:  Well, remember, remember David, you and I, of course, are old enough to remember 1998,  Microsoft, DOJ. And Microsoft was predatory in the 90s, right? Same thing in Gulf and Devour,  right? The whole idea of Microsoft would go take a meeting with a company, get all of the  information about the company, say, yeah, thanks anyway, and then duplicate it over and over again.  DOJ came after him. It was a protracted battle. I know it was a long time because it started the day  Tech TV launched. And even after Tech TV went out of business, this was still going on. So I know  it was a long battle. Eventually, there was a consent decree. Microsoft allowed an ombudsman  inside the company to watch over them. But I think more than anything, the effect of the DOJ lawsuit  against Microsoft was to chase in them, to make them in their boardroom say, yeah, maybe we  shouldn't do that. That could cause more problems for us. And I would bet that some of the benefit  of this, whether they succeed against Facebook or not, is to get Google, Apple, Microsoft,  Amazon, especially, to sit up and take notice and say, look, the government is  not a complete pushover. It's mostly a pushover. They let NBC, Universal and Comcast merge.

Transcript:  They let AT&T acquire Warner, HBO and Turner. I think the bigger, I think the issue here,  I look at this from two ways. Number one, what's the benefit to the consumer of breaking up  Facebook? How does it make my life any better? Or, you know, I think that's, well, in a second,  but I think the other part is if you start a company, there's almost no way to compete  with these large companies at this point. That's the answer to your first question.  And you're done. So, I mean, it's like, I don't even know how Dropbox is still,  you know, functioning when you've got, you know, it's like they're this small company compared,  and they're buying up little companies, but it's like you can't start a messaging app today  and have it compete with what is already out there. I don't know. Maybe you could.

Start time: 3073.68
End time: 3092.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That's the answer to your question. That's the harm. So there's consumer harm, but there's  business harm. Yeah, there's no innovation because you can't compete. Is somebody going  to start a search engine? Is somebody going to start a social network to compete with Facebook  today? You'd be nuts. Yeah.  Right. And even if it's just a photo, a photo social platform,

Transcript:  somewhere? If he wanted to, he could have, but he knows it's like, I'm not doing that.  Here's another example. The way Amazon, it's actually almost tragic. Remember diapers.com  was created to sell diapers. What Amazon did is they undercut them, they undercut them.  They took all their business, then they bought them. And of course, the founder of diapers.com  was so, you know, he got his payday, but he was so upset with the way this happened that he went  out and he started Jet. And Jet didn't succeed too well because Amazon, Walmart bought him. He had  another big payday. I'm sure he's not broke, but it's very hard to compete against these mammoth  companies. Even Walmart's having a hard time competing against Amazon.

Transcript:  Well, I think the goal at this point is not to compete. It's to get bought.  That's right.  But the thing is, is you end up with a Facebook who will look at, you know, Snapchat's a great  example. There was interest there, and then Evan was like, no. And then Mark Zuckerberg  decided to crush them. And it's like, they just, oh, okay, well, let's just copy everything that  they're doing.

Transcript:  Fleets. Yeah, those stories.  But the FTC complaint actually said that, that Zuckerberg was worried about WhatsApp  becoming a social media feed like Facebook. He was like, we've got to shut them down before  they become like us. And the other thing I thought was weird about that complaint by the FTC in the  States is that it said this is unfair to the advertisers. Like who's worried about how they're  harmed? But it said that-  No, I am. I think for small businesses-  Forget about us. It's about money.

You set up your thing on Yelp and next thing you know,  to get anywhere, you've got to spend hundreds and hundreds of dollars a month just to get some  traction there. And same thing with Google. And the bigger these companies get, the more you have  to spend, that's sort of unnecessary. It used to be you took out a big ad in the Yellow Pages,  everyone kind of flipped through whatever. But now it's like, it's just the more companies that are,  the bigger they get, the more you have to spend. And a lot of that spending is, in my kind of eyes,  nonsense spending. Like you're just spending to get back to where you were.

Start time: 3326.74

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think there's another reason they brought it up, David. So traditionally antitrust actions in the  United States have focused on consumer harms. And it's always been said in Europe, they focus on  innovation, on competing with other companies. And I think that there's a new generation of people  in Congress and in regulation in the federal government who are saying, you know, we got to  consider both consumer harm and harm to innovation, harm to other companies. And so I think what you're  seeing there, you remember that the action that the DOJ took against Google also, actually it was  Congress, I'm sorry, the Democratic, only the Democratic half of the Antitrust Committee in  the Congress brought this exact thing up. And they said, our antitrust laws have to perhaps be  adjusted for the new era to consider both consumer harm and innovation harm. And I think when you're  talking about regulating big tech, that's a big part of it. And ultimately, just as you said,  Rich, it's consumer harm. But what happens is these companies become so big, you can't compete  against them, it kills innovation. And so they just become more and more entrenched. And that's both a  harm to other businesses and to consumers in the end. So I think there was a specific reason they  brought up advertisers. In fact, as I'm reading this, I'm seeing a lot, I'm reading, but maybe I'm  overinterpreting it, but I'm seeing behind the lines a lot. That's what I agree with you. It was  so thoughtfully written that clearly they were anticipating some of the objections that judges  might have to this. I think they're going for a judge, a decision by a judge as opposed to a jury  decision. This was clearly aimed, I think at the bench as opposed to a jury. It's very, you know,  there's a lot going on. I'm not a great legal mind. I'm not a lawyer or anything. But to me,  this is kind of fascinating, is to kind of understand there's a game going on. There's  a chess game going on. And the people who designed this complaint, I think were very, very thoughtful  about what they mentioned and brought up in this. So we could go on and on. This is 124 pages. We  got a lot to talk about. Let's not. But what I'm curious about from all three of you, I'll start  with you, Ashley, is what would be a good outcome for this? Would it be breaking up the company?  What could government do to fix what is clearly a problem with Facebook?

Transcript:  there's some regulation, some sort of... Do you do what they did with Microsoft? Put somebody  inside the company to watch and say, don't do that? Maybe. Or maybe it just comes down to a

Start time: 3521.68
End time: 3565.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  watchdog group that is making sure that companies are not blatantly ripping off features from other  companies. So it's like, for me, I feel like Snapchat made something really good and they  should have been rewarded for that. Having it completely just basically stolen, the entire  concept of it stolen and tweaked in a very minor way and been like, oh no, no, see, clearly ours  is different because they're not horizontal. You have to swipe left and right and not up and down  or whatever it is. To me, that seems like a good way to sort of say, hey, if you make something  really great, you should be rewarded for that and it should not be able to be blatantly ripped off

Start time: 3565.86

Transcript:  by these other big tech companies. See, I do with what you do, Ashley, which is I don't participate  in the ecosystem. I don't like Facebook. I don't trust Mark Zuckerberg. I think we're going to find  out he is amoral. I don't think he's immoral or evil, but he is amoral and he's not a good  steward of Facebook. But it's also, I should point out, we're privileged to do that. There are a lot

Start time: 3593.70
End time: 3621.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of people, that's the only way they do it. Very much. That's the only way they can contact families.  It's the only way that they have access to. There are some places where there are emerging markets  where they have a slimmed down version of Facebook that is designed for,  and it is their internet. That's their internet. So yeah, absolutely we're coming from a place  of privilege. So I understand that. Not everybody can give up on Facebook. Rich,

Start time: 3624.48

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  what would be the positive outcome of this lawsuit? Again, I'm trying to figure out what

Start time: 3630.86
End time: 3756.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  the positive outcome could be. Because if you look at a company like Facebook,  and I think about this with Google and with Apple, all these big companies, it's like,  we talk about the things that they do really well. And Facebook, what they do really well is  they're a social network and they've done really well with their advertising and they've done  really well with Instagram. And so I think about, okay, if we broke them up,  what would be the benefit? So it would be that Instagram would now be able to compete against  Facebook in the social media category. When you look at messaging with Facebook, it's like,  sure, they're a leader there, but I mean, they're not the only messaging game in town. It's not like  nobody else uses any. In fact, I don't really know anyone that uses Facebook messenger at all.  And now WhatsApp, that's probably a different story, especially outside of the US.  Yeah, Facebook doesn't care if you use WhatsApp, they're happy. Right? They don't care.  Now they're all merged. Now you can cross platform message between Instagram and Facebook. And I  think WhatsApp is coming soon down the line as well. So I mean, I see things like that. So it's  like, now personally, I think in some ways that's better because I'm like, oh, finally, all the  people that will only be on Instagram, I can finally message through Facebook Messenger and vice  versa. But I don't know, I'm just trying to think what would be the benefit. And I think the point  that I brought up earlier is really what I keep going back to. It's like, I, as a consumer, want  the most innovation. If I own a small business, I want the best ways to advertise. And right now,  I see three ways to advertise, which is Google, Facebook and Yelp. And that's it. And so a small  company to come along, like can't really get into that game. Or, I want the best messaging platform.  And it's like, well, another little company is not going to come along and do that because  they just don't have all the ways and means of getting people to sign up. Or a photo service.  I want a better photo service, but Facebook got out of the photo service. I mean, it used to be  you could upload all your pictures there and keep them there. And now they don't even care about that.  So, I don't know what the solution would be, why it would be better if they're broken up at this  stage in the game. I think it's more about the innovation being stifled. I do see that as being

Start time: 3756.54
End time: 3762.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  a huge part of this. David, solution? That's my problem with this is I don't know what the

Start time: 3762.88
End time: 3834.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  answer is. I don't know how you fix this. Well, part of the problem is that what we're discussing  is the way the entire tech world works. I mean, they've all bought up their rivals to shut them  down. They've all stolen ideas from each other blatantly. I don't know if anyone remembers this.  I'm sure they don't. But I spent five years at Yahoo. And once when I was there, I wrote a really,  what I thought was a really cool article. You guys know, above all, how tribal Mac, I mean,  Apple versus Google, iPhone versus Android. I mean, they hate each other. They blast us when  they give something a good review. So and they always say, POG, you said that portrait mode  feature on the new iPhone is a cool feature, but Samsung had it first. Five years ago.  Exactly. So I did this massive research project where I tracked down 168 standard features and  found out who had it first. Turns out Google had long pressing first, but Apple had straight,  pinching and spreading first to enlarge a picture. And Samsung had portrait mode.  They all steal all the time. You're not going to be able to shut down.

Start time: 3843.56
End time: 3883.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  That makes both products better. And this is the other thing going back to kind of like this  innovation stifling. Like you would think with these big companies being in the positions they are,  that they'd be able to get into any business they want, but we've seen them fail over and over.  Facebook and Amazon tried to make a phone that failed horrendously.  Apple has, I'm sure there's been like that social media network they tried with their music service.  That failed. I mean, there's a lot of things that like these companies, just because they're huge,  don't necessarily aren't able to just like, I mean, look at Microsoft. They have billions and  billions of dollars and Bing cannot figure out a way to get people to search on it. And they tried

Start time: 3883.96
End time: 3901.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  for many years now they gave up. But I would argue that that is because Google has created  a natural monopoly there, just like Apple and Google have created a natural monopoly for phones.  Right? So it's like, Facebook could try to launch a phone now, but it's too late.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I was like taking pictures on a potato, but it's like, you know, at the end of the day,  it's that, you know, even the biggest companies are struggling to get into verticals where a  natural monopoly or duopoly already exists. Like, and that, I guess to me is even more of an argument  that these companies should not be this big. Like they just shouldn't.

Transcript:  But I don't think anybody wants a heavy handed federal agency to come in and say,  if this had happened at Microsoft, they would not have made Microsoft weaker. They would have made  Microsoft stronger. They would have divided Microsoft. This was one of the plants into three  or four companies, each of which would be bigger than Microsoft today is. And there would have been  worse. They tried that with Ma Bell. They broke up AT&T and what happened? We just got a lot of baby  bells that just reunited and now there's it's in some ways it's worse. So I don't think they all  came back together at the end. I don't think that govern, I don't think breaking, I don't know what  the answer is. Okay. I'm gonna throw in one thing that this is a minefield and I shouldn't bring it  up. If I were smart, I would just shut up. But I honestly think that social media, we kind of touched  on this a little bit. Social media has been bad for democracy. It's been bad for this country  100% because it's like what you said, Ashley, everybody's got their own personal newspaper  filled with facts that they're sure of no one else agrees with. That's a big, to me, that's the real  hazard of Facebook is that so many Americans, that's where they get their news. That's the real hazard  and I don't think there's anything you can do about that. That's protected by the first amendment. I  mean you can't, I don't know what the government would do. You know, I wouldn't want the government  to come in and say, well, you shouldn't have posts about anti-vax posts. Sure, of course not. No. I  wouldn't want that.

Start time: 4072.62

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  potential topics list for today was the fact that all these executives are leaving Facebook. Pissed  off. As each one leaves, they leave a note, a farewell note to their company and they say,  the reason I'm leaving is because I can't stand how little this company is doing to stop  misinformation and hate speech. So obviously there is a sector, there are people who think that  Facebook should be in the business of regulating. And yeah, let's

I think, I don't think he wants because he's looking at the growth of  Facebook and if Facebook is, is synonymous with misinformation, which it sort of is right now,  that is not a good trajectory to be on. Now imagine, I work for a news organization,  right? I mean, we are, and I've been in the newspaper world and the TV world and the radio  and like the whole point of like the system that was built of journalism in America for the past  whatever years is you had reporters and editors and fact checkers and you put stuff out there  that you believe to be true to the best of your knowledge. And that was all upended by anyone  being able to start a blog and putting a link on Facebook and sending it out to a million,  billion people. So the system has changed and I don't know what the answer is, but like,  you can't go through every link on Facebook and they try AI and this and that, but like  who even sits there in fact checks every single webpage that is immediately put up with information  on it and you have bots. I mean, there's just too many things going on. That's the bigger issue

But I also argue that is there was alternatively, there could  have been 10 tech companies that all competed with each other to make good products. And we  could have gotten to a similar, albeit different place with 10 different CEOs who make, you know,  marginally less than what Bill Gates was making at Microsoft.

And I also think that Microsoft was forced to reconsider its goals and they've pivoted and it's  been good for Microsoft. Microsoft is a better company now than it was in 1998. So I don't,  I think that whatever happened with the DOJ and Microsoft, and as long as it went on, it was in,  it was absolutely beneficial. It absolutely did the right thing. I, I'm hoping the same thing

And I really, I think if Mark, I mean, I don't think Mark would do this, but, but we  don't know what if Mark Zuckerberg decided I want this to happen. I think he has the, the dials and  switches to do it. He's got the most powerful mass medium in the history of mankind easily,  better than any television network, any movie company I was watching. It's a great movie,  Mank, the Netflix. Oh, very good. Isn't it great? It's black and white shot like it was in the 30s  is the story of the writing of Citizen Kane. And at one point, Herman Mankiewicz, who's the,  you know, protagonist in the, in the movie, Gary Oldman, Gary Oldman's brilliant,  goes, you know, Louis B. Mayer has given him a hard time and he talked to Irving Thalberg movie  guy. He says, you know, what the issue is that Upton Sinclair, a socialist,  is running for governor and mayor doesn't want him. William Randolph Hearst doesn't want him.  And Mankiewicz says, what are you worried about? You control a movie studio. You can kill this  guy's candidacy. And a light goes on and Irving Thalberg's brain, he says, oh my God, that's right.  We'll just make a bunch of phony news reels that lie about the candidate. And they, and they, of  course, they were very, very successful. That's nothing compared to what Facebook could do. And  not just in the U S but with two and a half billion people all over the world. They've been used by  despots and dictators in the Philippines and Myanmar. They clearly are the most powerful  medium ever. The human. And there's nothing to stop them from, if Mark Zuckerberg decided he

And then I have to  run in because she's holding the cat down. I have to run and take a picture so she can post it on  Instagram. And somebody had a very, I think a very good comment on the last one. It was Samantha  wearing an aviator's cat with her ears sticking out and the comment was simple as two emoji was  the poop emoji and the shoe emoji. And as anybody's ever owned cats, they know exactly what that means.  Right? Revenge. Revenge. She didn't poop in the shoes, but she did poop in the bathtub. So  I figured that's a warning shot.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  You know, I think it's no question in my mind that a company does well when they say  the most important thing is serving our customers. Customer service is everything.  You know that because if you've called your bank and been put in hold, or if you called an Uber  and it didn't show up, anytime you get bad customer service, you go, ugh, ugh. Sometimes  it's a little hard. That's why the best companies use Zendesk. Zendesk's award-winning support,  sales, and customer engagement software helps businesses offer personal service at scale.  So your team can create conversational experiences that, bottom line, keep customers happy.  It's always going to happen. You're going to have a bad customer interaction, but Zendesk  gives you the tools you need to make them better, to communicate seamlessly across all channels.  That's all we want as customers, right? Just communicate, email, phone, chat,  messenger, community forums, help centers, social media. Zendesk does it all. They call that a  conversational experience. Connected, ongoing, and this is really important to natural customer  interactions. All made possible with Zendesk's complete customer profile and unified set of  tools that give you the context you need to deliver great service in every conversation.  Most support software requires expensive consultants. Months of setup, not with Zendesk.  It'll take you a couple of hours to get up and running. Of course, it will grow with you. As  your company grows, you can do all sorts of things. Zendesk software easily scales to meet  whatever your needs are. The whole point is Zendesk gives your organization the flexibility  to move quickly, focus on innovation, and adapt to growth. 150,000 paid customer accounts are proof  that it works over a decade of experience. You know what? Zendesk is pretty good at customer  support and service themselves. See for yourself why the best customer service experiences are  built with Zendesk. Get started at zendesk.com slash twit. That's z-e-n-d-e-s-k dot com slash  twit. That's why when you think of great companies, you always think of the ones that  had the best customer service, right? That's the one customers remember. When Tony Hsieh passed  away, Jason Rapp, one of my friends, posted a tweet about one year, I guess a few customers'  shoes were delayed by Zappos by a day, and Tony sent them each a personal email. He said,  we're going to FedEx them to you. You're going to get them tomorrow. I'm so sorry they didn't come  on the day that you expected them. If you're still irate, please call our customer service reps and  have them do something humiliating. Sing Twinkle Twinkle Little Star, put on a funny hat, do  something humiliating. That's what Tony Hsieh was brilliant at. Great customer service. That's why  people remember him. Zendesk, z-e-n-d-e-s-k dot com slash twit.

He says,  heavy is the head that wears the AirPods Max. Have you tried them? Anybody tried them yet?  Anybody got a pair? You can't, at this point, if you tried to buy them,  you'd be kind of out of luck because I think the delivery date is well after Christmas now.  I think it's sometime in February. They sold out very quickly as Apple stuff often does.  So I think that, you know, the really the only question that matters with headphones is do they  sound good? But we won't know that. How good can good sound? 500. Yeah. What is it? $550 good?

I mean, Apple, you know, they, when they come out with something, it does,  it usually lives up to the hype. You know, the $200 price tag extra that you're paying on top  of these things. Like I remember when I bought my Bose noise cancelling headphones, this was 10 years  ago. Even that's breathtaking. Yeah. It was like, you know, Japan. And I was like, I need, you know,  these are so expensive. Like, oh my gosh. And they've been great. You know, 350 at the time  seemed insane. 550, you divide that by a couple of plane flights. When you start, you know,  flying again and you're a frequent traveler and you're an iPhone person and you have AirPods,  you know, it's, you're going the, the 400, let's say it's a buck 43 a gram.

These headphones  incredibly do not have an input. There's no wire. You cannot plug this into a seatback on an  airplane. You cannot. Oh no, you could, but it's not included. Unless you buy Apple's adapter  for $35. So the price of the AirPods max is correctly said to be 585 bucks. That's a good

So I have in fact, a very expensive pair of Hi-Fi man headphones that I  can listen to audio file, high quality music. And it costs more frankly, but what you're not paying  for audio quality on these, you're paying for an accelerometer and microphones and an Apple watch  style knob. And I don't know if you're paying for audio quality on this. I don't think that they're,  you know, they're not using a planar magnetic or any of the fancy stuff. And it really bothers me  that, you know, it's really a wireless pair of headsets. So that's by definition, not audio file.

Start time: 6058.54
End time: 6116.04
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was not a rant.  I think that's too much to say.  I was trying to make people feel better who don't have an M1 yet.  Oh, no.  Merely to say that a lot of what you see, at least initially what you saw about M1,  these geek bench and other kind of synthetic benchmarks,  aren't really reflecting real world use.  And it is true, it is snappier.  But ultimately, do you care if it is one bounce or two bounces  on the dock before an app launches?  I don't think that's a quality of life game changer.  However, having had the M1 now for a little bit longer, it's pretty snappy.  You've evolved.  It's snappy.  I just don't want people to feel bad if their machine isn't snappy anymore.  I mean, Ashley, you love your ancient Mac because-

Transcript:  Mommy, what's that HDMI port for?  So I have a different philosophy on that.  You got all those built in.  You're carrying them around the additional weight, the additional bulk, the additional thickness  all the time, even when you don't need those ports.  I would prefer a slimmer, simpler chassis and have a little dongle when I need them  and not have to carry around all that extra baggage.

I know my co-producer here in LA, Logan, he said there was a scene where you're supposed  to get a chip put in your head or some chip put in someone else's head.  It was a gun.  No, don't put a gun in your head.  It was like I had a gun installed in my head, which was very funny.  That made me laugh very hard.  My husband's been playing it on his computer and all of the palm trees keep popping to  the foreground.  All the trees keep popping to the foreground.  It's very weird.  I've seen a couple other ones on Twitter where it's like a woman walks through a filing cabinet.  There's that weird one about like the people's junk.

But the argument is how is this different than Netflix?  It's a streaming game.  I'm streaming a movie.  I'm streaming a game.  There's no difference.  But anyway, Apple's, yeah, there's a good end to that.

Transcript:  I have a theory on streaming stuff.  So I think Stadia, Google Stadia was waiting for Cyberpunk 2077.  It's just been, it's been around for a while.  But I think this is going to be the big launch.  And I think it's interesting that in some cases it's actually a better experience  than on your own hardware, like an Xbox One or PlayStation 4.  And I don't think it's for either Microsoft or Google.  It has anything to do with gaming.  I think, A, it's a proof of concept that, you know, that their cloud is amazing.  But especially for Microsoft, I think what Microsoft's saying is, well, if you can run  Cyberpunk 2077, what about Windows?  What about Office?  I mean, if you can do a game in real time over the internet, could you do?

I mean, with a game, especially a game like this where you're shooting things,  you're dodging things, I mean, that's where you put a chip in your ear and it turns out  to be a cup of coffee.  That's what latency will do for you.  I'm not sure how they're getting around this.  You'd certainly have to have enough bandwidth.  Yeah, magic of some kind.  That's actually a really good question, David.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  It's probably, I mean, the bandwidth is probably one aspect, but the latency of your connection,  I think that's why this whole 5G idea is so important because the latency is improved.  I think that's what does unlock a lot of these things in the future.  Like even the Windows VD, whatever you're saying, it's like the latency is really almost  more important at this point.  Like people are sitting there, they email me, they're like, Rich, you know, my internet's  buffering.  I've got 200 down from Spectrum and it's buffering and I can't watch Netflix.

Sony bought Gaikai so they've been doing this streaming gaming.  Everybody's doing streaming gaming now.  And we're in this weird period.  I even thought this when Apple came out with its new Macintosh computers based on its own silicon.

Deadpool does the ads for Mint Mobile. It's the first  company to sell premium wireless service online only. Mint Mobile lets you safely order from home,  maximize your savings with plans starting as low as $15 a month. That's that's $15 a month,  including unlimited nationwide talk and text. I love my Mint Mobile. In fact, I have an iPhone SE  with Mint Mobile in it. That's kind of my backup phone. It's fantastic. I've been using it for a  year. I went for this before they had the unlimited plan. I went for the 12 gigabyte a month plan. So  I paid a year ahead 300 bucks. Unlimited nationwide talk text 12 gigabytes a month, $25 a month. That's  less than a third what I'm paying T-Mobile for the same thing. And incidentally, it's on the T-Mobile  network. Now this is the best offer they've ever had for a limited time. When you buy any three  month plan, you'll get three months additional for free. They're basically cutting it in half.  By going online only, eliminating the traditional cost of retail, Mint Mobile passes significant  savings on to you. It makes me wonder why I was paying more for these big name companies when I  can get it for so much less. Every plan comes with unlimited talk and text, high speed data on the  nation's largest 5G network. You can bring your own phone. They make it easy. They don't even charge  you. They'll send you the SIM, no cost. That way you keep your same phone, the same phone numbers.  You can even port the number over so you keep your phone number if you want. They also sell phones.  I got my iPhone SE from them. That was a good deal too. 30 bucks a month. I got a phone and  the best cellular service. And if you're not 100% satisfied, Mint Mobile has you covered.  Seven day money back guarantee. Switch to Mint Mobile. Get premium wireless service starting at  just 15 bucks a month. Why are you paying more? There's a limited time offer by any three month  Mint Mobile plan. Get three more months free. Cut your wireless bill to 15 bucks a month.  It's minty fresh. It's delicious. And it's kind of cute, those little green fox in the glasses.  Thank you so much for supporting this week in tech.

Yeah, there's a couple of things. So first of all, it's not a watch.  There's no face. It's just a Velcro band with a thing, a bump that's measuring the normal heart  rate steps and stuff. But if you press a button, it also listens to everything you say and then  gives you a report card at the end of the day. Says you were a little nasty when you talked to  Ashley. You should probably apologize to her. That kind of thing. And then you're supposed to pose  naked in front. You can wear underpants, right? Yes. Okay. Just like in cyberpunk.  Just like in cyberpunk. But they might, you might be able to see your junk, but still. So  wear baggy shorts. Yeah. You pose in front of it. Same. Senator Amy Klobuchar wrote a letter to the  health and human services secretary, Alex Azar, saying, what is your agency doing to make sure  that all this information that's going to Amazon is protected? She says it's even more intrusive  than many of these other products. I'd already been concerned. She says this one takes it to the  nth degree. Now Amazon says your voice recordings don't ever leave the watch. Actually, I'm sorry.  They don't ever go to Amazon. They leave the watch. They go to your phone. They're analyzed  on your phone by the app and sent back to the watch. But your pictures go to the Amazon cloud  because they're analyzed and then destroyed. But then you have to keep taking pictures because  they're looking at your body fat. And I don't know, I didn't even really want to, I decided  I didn't really even want to, I don't want to look at it. By a tape measure. I just like,

Start time: 8478.12

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  why I wanted it. Cause Lisa says, sometimes you sound a little mean to me. And so I said, well,  let's see what the halo says. Okay. Let's go to the halo. Go to the halo. I have an app right here  that says I am not being dismissive. I'm being opinionated all last week. I was so nice to you.  Yeah. Did not work. This is a perfect example of what Tim Gubrew was talking about at Google,  where the training set that you use on these AI very much influences what the AI says. It's  imperfect. And if you train it on male voices and then you have a female voice and it's not going to  do as good a job. She did her initial work not before she came to Google on how face recognition  technologies did a very poor job with women and people of color. Very famous. Google hired her to  be an ethicist in their AR. She actually ran the AI ethics research at Google until she wrote a paper  maybe was a little critical of the way Google was doing things. They withheld the paper. She wrote  an email saying, I'm going to quit unless you tell me who said this was a bad paper. You hired me to  tell the truth, not to whitewash what's going on rather than respond to her email. Google fired  her immediately. Now, of course, Google's CEO Sundar Pichai, actually alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai,  apologized and said, well, I'm going to look into this. The paper was called on the dangers  of stochastic parrots. Can language models be too big? And it lays out the risks of large  language models. AI is trained on, according to the MIT technology review, which actually saw the  paper. They didn't publish the paper, but they summarized it. AI models trained on staggering  amounts of text data have gone increasingly popular, increasingly large. The paper talks about  the energy consumption, which Google said, well, that's old data. We don't do that anymore.  Haven't you heard? We're carbon neutral. Don't listen to that David Pogue. Climate change isn't  real. The costs and of course, the problem, inscrutable models. An AI model taught to  view racist language as normal is obviously bad. The researchers, though, point out a couple of  more subtle problems. One is that shifts in language play an important role in social change.  The Me Too and Black Lives Matter movements, for example, have tried to establish a new anti-sexist,  anti-racist vocabulary. An AI model trained on vast swaths of the internet won't be attuned to  the nuances of this vocabulary and won't produce or interpret language in line with these new  cultural norms. You can see there's all sorts of issues. We as humans are very subtle in our  understanding of gestures, handwriting, speech. Computers are not subtle.

Start time: 8677.94
End time: 8751.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  No, but when you have humans programming that training set, it helps. But also when you have  those- Their biases can be- They talk about, right, their biases come into play and also  their blind spots come into play. And I think that that's actually even a bigger issue is it's not so  much people programming AI to purposefully end up, you know, we've seen these examples of,  like, oh, Microsoft put up this AI and within like two hours it was racist or, you know,  like neural networks, they have stuff like that. But, you know, I think it's actually blind spots  really are the problem. And when you have such a large- When they talk about in this particular  study or in this paper, the summary mentions these sort of really large repositories of information,  of text information. You know, you're just going to- By default, you're going to run into more  issues and it's not going to be as nuanced because it's not a small batch, you know, kind of  specifically crafted AI. And so it's tough. It's a tough thing. But blind spots, I think,  are the hardest thing about AI is that, you know, there is nobody on earth who could program

Start time: 8752.24
End time: 8758.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  with an understanding of everybody else on earth. And the other thing that's frustrating is this is

Start time: 8758.50
End time: 8785.86
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  why Google hired Gebru to do this. Yeah. And you characterized Sundar's response as an apology.  It's my understanding that there really wasn't an apology. He said we could have done better at  de-escalation. Yeah. And she's a little upset. She's like, oh, great. So now I'm the angry black  woman. Oh, boy. You're making it look like the emotion of it and not the logical point.

Transcript:  She painted this, they paint me as this angry black woman because they put you in this terrible  workplace. And if you speak up about it, then you become a problem. And then they start talking  about de-escalation strategies. You write emails, they get ignored. You write documents, they get  ignored. Then you discuss how it's being done. And they talk to you, talk about you as if you're like  some angry black woman who needs to be contained. This is regardless of what really happened. And I  think often, and I've said this before, a disclaimer with employment cases, you don't always  know all the information. There's all sorts of legal restrictions on what companies can say about  this. So there may be other stuff that happened we don't know about. It's not a good look for Google

The circumstances, he writes, that led up to Dr.  Gibbrew's departure, examining where we could have improved and led a more respectful process. The  company needs to accept responsibility for the fact that a prominent black female leader with  immense talent left Google unhappily. Those are issues. Those are issues.

I have to say, I used to love this company and now I'm really wondering what's  happening there. But you were right, Ashley, when you said it's not a team sport. You may love a

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  company, but the company doesn't love you. Yeah. And also companies change. You have every right  to feel like you used to love a company and now you don't love them as much. And there are people  who feel that way about Apple and Samsung. And that's fine. And you should be open to criticizing  companies that you care about, especially the most, I argue. You should be critically thinking  about the things that you use every day. I love my iPhone, but I don't just blindly go with whatever  Apple says. I mean, jeez, if you've seen any of my live tweets for their events, I kind of drag them  a lot of the time because they're just so easy to drag. But also, you know, it's just, you should  be doing that. You should be looking at the companies that you love to use their products.  You should be looking at them with a critical eye and you should demand that they make their  product better for you, for everybody who uses it. Like you deserve that as a consumer. You've  given them your money. You demand better from them. Well, and as tech journalists, we have an

Start time: 9009.96
End time: 9045.10
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, that's an interesting one because, you know, as a journalist, yeah, I mean, you're not really  supposed to be doing that. But I agree. I mean, I think that opinions have evolved of these. Like I  have loved Google for many years and in the last couple of years, they haven't really given me a  lot to love. Whereas Apple, I historically was a little bit more critical of because, you know,  the way they do things and I feel like they've given me more to love with some of the stances  they've taken with inclusivity and, you know, just the way they run their company. And so,  and then Samsung's somewhere in the middle. Like, I just don't really understand them at all.

And actually this part works where you open it up and there's,  there's, you know, it's got a big screen. Let me unlock it. It's got a big screen. I love the size.  I can play Stadia on it, but there are pitfalls to folding screens. One of which  is, I guess it's so delicate that you have to have a screen protector on it.  This one is apparently made of rubber. So I don't know if you've ever  used a rubber touch screen before. It's not a good thing.  Oh no.

Now you remember the first batch  of the first fold people took it off and it broke. So no, I'm reluctant to touch it,  but people have it bubbling up and stuff. You can bring it to a Samsung depot and they'll put a new  one on. So it's a great quality for a touch screen phone. I'm afraid to touch it.  Yeah.

Cause you know, you carry this around and you feel like  if I dropped this, it is definitely going to break and that's $2,000.  So this is the leather case they send you  for $50.  It goes snaps on the back. And by the way, it's not that leathery. It's more like a  rubber. It's like plastic.  More rubber.  Maybe I'm tactically challenged.

They have a special  long spatula because you're cooking like 800 hamburgers at once. A special long spatula.  And you're supposed to, I was taught to anyway, you put the spatula under the burgers,  you hold them with your fingers, things are searing hot and flip them.  And it's considered, you just have to, it's macho. You can't say, it hurts. Ow. No, you have to do that.  I can almost guarantee that's not the way they're doing it.

Transcript:  Actually, I loved working at McDonald's. I really enjoyed it. It was my first job.  I learned how to work. They say to every, you're never standing still. You're always cleaning.  You're always doing something. It was a very, it was a great lesson. I got, I remember $3.25 an hour.  And that was more money back in the 1920s, but still, you know, it was,  was for the depression, for the depression. That was good. I was happy to have it.  I was happy to have it. All right. All right. Let's take one more break,  but I do want to talk about HBO Max streaming movies, Disney. Did you watch the four hour Disney  plus reveal talk about talking for a long time? You know, I did Leo. Come on. Of course you did.  All right. We're going to talk. We'll wind up with all of that. And I just like to say the word  John Stanky over and over again. So we'll get, we'll get to all of that in just a little bit.  What I love this panel. Can you just stay here all week and I'll come back and we'll do it again.  How about that? Our show we're here in the beautiful LastPass studio. I really want to  thank LastPass all year long. LastPass has been our studio naming sponsor.  I've been using them for 12 years. They're their absolute best password manager out there.  We use, we started using LastPass corporately about five years ago.  There's kind of a funny story around this. One of our engineers could never remember the passwords  to things like our web pages and you know, databases and Amazon and all that stuff. So  he made a nice little public website with all the passwords in it. So he wouldn't forget.  Turned out that was probably not a good idea. When we saw that we said, oh, we're getting  LastPass right now. If I imagine for a lot of companies you're sending employees home,  there's a little trepidation. They have the keys to the kingdom. You know, your bank accounts,  your databases, everything. They've got those passwords. If you're using LastPass, you don't  have to worry. First of all, they don't got those passwords. LastPass does. The data is never  does. The data is never decrypted anywhere but on device, computer, laptop, phone. They have every  application, every browser, every operating system. And so your employees may not even have to know  the password. They just see the dots and it's all done. They're logged in. In many cases, they use  single sign on 1200 applications, which is even better. It's passwordless. They love it. Life is  simple for them, but you will love it too. And your IT department security people will love it  too because they know exactly who's using what, when, and where. And because LastPass does things  like multi-factor authentication, contextual information like IP address, geolocation,  you can really be sure that only the right people are accessing your data. It's called  a zero knowledge security model. This was invented at Google. The idea that, you know,  in the old days you'd figure anybody inside the perimeter, well, you know, they're inside the  perimeter so they're safe. No, no, we know that's not, you can't do that. You assume everybody  is a threat and you have to make sure that everybody is authenticated properly. That's  what LastPass does. You can have absolute control over, there's a hundred plus policies you can  enforce. We, for instance, require employees to use two-factor authentication. We have minimum  standards for their master password. You can view password scores for every employee. You  can see what accounts they're sharing, what groups they're members of. When they share passwords,  they can do it with LastPass securely, not on a post-it note or via text message. It makes it easy  to integrate onboarding users and revoking access, syncing groups, because it'll work with, no matter  what your organization's source of truth, it'll work with whatever directory system you're using.  I can just go on and on. It's so easy to use. It's so powerful and it's so secure. And it does the  thing that is so hard to do, which is it makes it good security more convenient. And normally  that's a trade-off. It's more secure, it's less convenient, but LastPass makes it actually easier.  Employees love it, you will love it. And of course it uses the best strong encryption algorithms.  Your master password's never transmitted anywhere but on the device, things like that. IT leaders  need to invest now in upgrading or adding security technologies because remote work isn't over. It's  not going to be over for a while. Let your employees be more productive and more secure.  Start with LastPass. It's what we did and I am so glad. This is no time. Don't wait till the end  of the year when you get your new budget to get strong security. Now's the time to start solidifying  your cybersecurity strategy with the award-winning LastPass, the best password manager out there. Go  to lastpass.com slash twit to find out how they can help you. Thank you, LastPass. Thank you from  the bottom of my heart. They kept this network on the air during a very difficult time because of  COVID. We really appreciate it. Lastpass.com slash twit.

Transcript:  I think this is an interesting point that you're making. They engineered this game because there  is no in-app purchase. There's no push to these kids. I have two young kids that are like,  you know, with Roblox, and this is why I'm kind of like on a rant against it, is because  it's this whole thing of like getting them to play as long as humanly possible.  Because all they want is in-app purchases and clothes and this and that. And like the Roblox,  you know, the Robux, I think they're called. Oh my gosh, fight a nickel for every time they

And I would look at it for the kids because you're building, you have a house, you're decorating it,  you're making things for it, then eventually you're decorating your island, you're trying  to make it look nice, you get awards for the better your house looks.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, but that's one, not 20. Well, so I, I argue that there are, so some of these are limited.  So like, for example, they might only be like one season. So Loki is a good example of something  that is probably not going to be very successful as a movie trilogy, as you know, six hours of  film, but a six hour mini series on Disney plus with a smaller budget. Great for them. Great.

Transcript:  So this is the problem with Apple TV faces, which is they don't have enough  depths. So Disney not only started with a great catalog, but now they're creating massive amounts  of content. I think that's a very smart. Meanwhile, over at HBO, which is now, which is owned by time,  which is owned by Warner Brothers, which is owned by Warner media, which is owned by AT&T.  They've just announced, Warner's just announced, you know, the movie theaters overrated COVID.  All of the movies next year are going to go on at the same time as they're released for theaters  are going to go on HBO Max free, free, which is going to cost them a pretty penny.  This was that thing we were talking about earlier, which is we're moving away from  owning content, physical content, even movie theaters to everything is over the internet,  all streamed all the time. And partly that's been hastened by COVID. But I think it's also the next  big thing. I think there's a few. Was there ever any doubt? Yeah. People get mad at me when I say  that they say, no, I love books. I love my DVDs. The best quality is on UHD Blu-ray.  And I go, well, yeah, that is true. That's true. I'm not denying that.

And now that  we know they're going to do it again. I think they're doing Raya the Last Dragon is the one  that's going to be. How about Tenet? Who owns Tenet? Oh, that's Warner Bros.

It was cheaper than  buying movie tickets. And it was so cool. I mean, it was so cool. So you had 10 people. How many  people did you have? We had nine people. And so you had the whole theater yourself? The whole  theater to ourselves. And we could talk, we could use our phones. Did you feel safe? Yeah, totally  safe. They come in with a crew right before you go in and they disinfect everything. And yeah,  I mean, this was probably three months ago. Is there popcorn? Is there a concession? Okay.  There's popcorn. You buy all the same stuff. And then we watched that really cool and had no clue  what was happening. That movie, that movie is bad storytelling. You just have no idea what's happening.  Well, that's kind of, I just bought the screenplay. You bought the screenplay hoping to understand it.  And it still makes no sense. Who are these people? Who are they working for? What's going on?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  his thing. Have you seen it? The HBO Max thing is like, so there's like a few things at play here.  One, there is no longer the paramount rule. So these movie studios like Disney and Warner Brothers,  they do not care if AMC goes out of business because then- No, they want them to go out of  business. By AMC and then they will own a theater chain because there's no rule preventing them.  So that's one part of it. But the other part of it for HBO Max, I think actually this is a little  bit short-sighted and there has been a lot of outrage in the industry about this from filmmakers  and actors. Christopher Nolan did an interview and discussed this and he doesn't mention like him  specifically. He talks about the unions and residuals. Well, there's a big problem because

Start time: 10252.96

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  talent is going to get back end. So they're getting, like they had to buy out Patty Jenkins.  What's the back end on HBO Max? So they're buying them out on the bed. There is none. So the thing

Start time: 10271.58

Speaker: SPEAKER_03

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  $90 million. So here's $9 million. So as I understand it with Wonder Woman 1984,  Patty Jenkins and that entire cast got ahead of what they knew was coming in 2021.  And there was a separate discussion made to allow Wonder Woman to launch. She's the director and

Start time: 10302.38
End time: 10368.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  been paid. So a lot of times if you're not familiar with how movies work and how payments  work. So a lot of times like an actor will take $10 million. And then if the movie makes a billion  dollars at the box office, they get an extra $10 million. And so that's their bonus. They get a  box office bonus. And so Warner bought out those bonuses to allow Wonder Woman to stream day and  date on Christmas Day. None of the talent next year in 2021, none of those as I understand it.  And I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure I had read it. 2021. Wow. HBO Max just announced,  hey, we're releasing these day and date. And all of the filmmakers are very upset, not only for  obviously themselves, because that's a lot of money, but they're also upset for the unions.  Because when these things go to streaming and they're signed for and everything, there are  union agreements for IAZI and a lot of these other, they're crew. These are regular people who  barely make ends meet a lot of times in Hollywood or who just work jobs.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  there is a residual payment made. Well, I mean, look, at the end of the day, I give HBO Max credit.  I would have never thought that they would do something like this. Now, maybe it's a push AT&T.  Like you said, Leo is the parent company at this point. So clearly they are, I mean, you would  think they're forward thinking, but they're the death star. AT&T wants this because it gets people

You had, what was the other one? Fire TV  just came on board two or three weeks ago. When you look at the two largest streaming platforms  here in the US, Fire TV, Roku, two of the biggest were not even available. Then you had these  different apps. There's three different apps that people were downloading, which was HBO Now, HBO Go,  and HBO Max. It was totally a mess. It was insane.

Transcript:  This is why AT&T is doing this. There's two possible reasons. It could be an antitrust thing,  trying to put the theaters out of business. I wouldn't put it past them. But the other reason  they're doing it, they're recognizing the facts of the matter, which is people at least through  June aren't going to be going back to the theaters. And that their big competition is not, it's Netflix.  That's where people are going to be getting their content from going forward is Netflix,  Amazon Prime. And so they've got to do something to compete.

It's just like Netflix has a million new things every month, but Disney Plus is really doing a  good job of keeping the service fresh. Not with these huge things, but enough to keep you going.

Transcript:  Yeah. There's an interesting theory that someone had put forth that I had heard that was,  that this was actually very advantageous for, for Warner's to do in 2021 during the,  while the pandemic is still happening and while not, while movie theaters aren't going to be back  100%, is that by releasing these movies day and date for one month, which they say,  so it will be one month, it's like 30 days. It's not forever. Is that HBO Max, HBO will be able to,  and Warner Brothers will be able to write off the production costs of these movies as marketing  expenses. And so, so instead of taking that really big hit for a below box office,  it ends up being, okay, well, now we're not going to go bankrupt because now we can write these  movies off as a marketing expense for HBO Max. Right. Because it'll, because technically it is  a promotion. It's, they're promoting it by only allowing it to be available for the first month

Now that enough people have done it, we can see what some of the issues  are and so forth. There is a big tech story. I mean, both of these technologies, both of these  vaccines are using mRNA, messenger RNA, which is a really amazing breakthrough in vaccine design.  And the fact that we were able to design these in under a year, and I guess you did the story,  so you could tell me the Moderna and the Pfizer vaccines are very similar. They're almost

Start time: 10753.74

Transcript:  interchangeable. Yeah, there's actually an even more incredible story. They didn't come up with  this in a year. First of all, a lot of it was done for the SARS virus that was already in place.  Which was a coronavirus as well, right? Right. Yeah. And if you go back even farther,  there's this amazing Hungarian woman, this researcher at University of Pennsylvania,  who started with this idea of harnessing mRNA to fight diseases. And it was such a far-fetched,  ridiculous idea. Nobody would give her a grant. And she was actually demoted. Oh my God. And then  in 2005, she finally nailed it. She published the paper. The two guys who read that paper  went on to found, get this, Moderna and BioNTech. No kidding. Those are the two vaccines we have now.
