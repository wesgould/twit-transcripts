Transcript:  Yeah. Thank goodness, by the way. It was a little scary. It really was.  So we're glad all of our friends and listeners on the East Coast have, I presume, survived.  Dicky D. Actually, Dick D. Bartola did a funny thing. He put a drop cam on his boat  so that he could watch to see whether it was... I don't know. What was he going to do if it  started sinking? He said he would run down the three blocks and tie it up better or something  if it started sinking. But then he decided he wanted to do a show. This is how far people  go to do a show. The camera was inside the cabin of the boat looking out the window so you'd hear  the rain on the roof and see the water coming down. It was actually really cool. So he started  calling his answering machine on the boat and he knew that it would play back. So he would do like  two minute monologues into the drop cam by calling his answering machine on the boat.

Transcript:  to the radio show. It's pretty funny, I have to say. Where was the boat? It was in the...  I want to say... I can't remember which marina. It's in New York City. It was on the Hudson,  I think. I think it's on the Hudson. 79th Street, that's right. Thank you very much on the Hudson.  The Hudson overflowed its banks. It did. It came up on Riverside Drive.  So what happened to his boat? Did his boat... I think it was fine. Right, everybody in the chat  room? Yeah. I think the only risk is that it would... This has happened, he said this happened  before, is that the river rises high enough that it's above the pylons of the pier and then the  boat could come back down on the pylons and poke a hole in it. What's the chat room, what's the  link to Dick's Drop Cam? We'll see if we can see his boat. And then we'll get to actually the news.  Dropcam.com. Thank you, Myra. Myra Joyce. So let's see if we can see Dick DiBartolo's boat on the

I've gotten so much better.  You lie. I have. I'm lying. Steve Jobs retires this week. That's really the big story. This was a month  of amazing stories. Motorola, Google, HP getting out of the PC business and now one of the true  pioneers, the legend, probably, arguably the single most important person in the  personal computer business and the technology business, the Henry Ford of PCs announces his  retirement and it does it in a kind of a sad way with a letter to the board of directors saying,  I always said that if I couldn't do my job, I'm paraphrasing here, I would be the first to  say so and step down and that time has come. Which I have to say, knowing how sick Steve has been  really implies that the end is nigh, I guess. I hate to be a morbid person.

Start time: 475.14
End time: 564.50
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  What was your take on all of this? When I first heard it, my initial thought was what you thought  that, well, we're writing this now and we may end up doing an obit soon, but to a certain extent,  I don't think so and I like what John Dvorak said about the timing of it that it may have had as  much to do with Tim Cook as it did with Steve Jobs. Tim Cook is the COO of Apple who Steve is now the  CEO. Nominated to take his place. Dvorak said that you can't pen a temporary, an interim CEO  title on somebody forever. Except didn't Steve Jobs have interim CEO forever? He was the ICEO.  They didn't want to lose Tim Cook and so they wound up essentially pushing this forward.  Steve does remain as chairman and he does remain as an Apple employee and both the New York Times and  the Wall Street Journal said he will continue to have a hand in product development. That makes a  lot of sense and Steve probably isn't well. It's probably still taking a lot of his time.  Put all those together and I think it kind of makes sense that it may not be as morbid as we

Start time: 565.10
End time: 595.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  all initially thought. Does that scenario make sense? If he wanted to do it at the best possible  time, it made a lot of sense because Apple is at its absolute high point now. It couldn't be at a  higher peak. Over the last two and a half years, I mean, Jobs has been on medical leave for about  half of the last two and a half years. He's certainly contributed but on the other hand,  with him less deeply involved, they not only have done okay, they've flourished. My hope would be  that he did it because the timing felt right rather than because he had no other option.

Transcript:  Merlin, your thoughts on all this?

Start time: 601.58
End time: 653.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  I wouldn't want to speak to anything about the health part because I don't really know.  What we know is he resigned from a position. So it's hard to know how much he'll be involved but  I would have to guess that rather than assuming that it's telegraphing something either about  his health or the company, I would just say he doesn't want to be a distraction or he doesn't  want speculation about his health to be a distraction or any of that stuff. It's clear  enough that even during a slow news month, that is the story. It's still a distraction.  That's not surprising necessarily but it just strikes me that he's a man who's very careful  with words inside of a company that is very aware of how important, I don't say the look of things,  but I think it's nice to do it in the way that he wants. I think he should be allowed to pick  his shot and if it's the time, it's the time. The culture of that company though is so, gosh,

Start time: 654.12
End time: 664.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  is there anybody more associated with a brand? Tim Cook says Apple's not going to change. I think  to reassure the rank and file, the company itself, but I have to say Apple, there's no way Apple

Start time: 664.72
End time: 753.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  doesn't change. That's the point. That's what makes Apple. Apple's are always changing. What  doesn't change though is in my opinion is that they have such a, what's the word, they seem to,  something Gruber said a while back on Daring Fireball is that where most companies  seem scared of not replicating their success, they're a company that is much more concerned with  not doing something new and trying something different. I think that culture is such a part  of the company. I don't know. I think it will change a lot. Think about how the company's  changed in the last five years. I bought a Norwegian black metal album on my phone.  My point being, if you wanted to buy a Norwegian black metal album, I believe it might have been  Mayhem, I think, if you wanted to buy that a few years ago, you would have had to go to some  really squirrely record store outside of town. Which might have been part of the fun, let's face  it. Sure. Back in Florida, we would always have to go to Tampa to go to Vinyl Fever to get these  records. But my point being, it's changed. We're still kind of treating these computer stories and  the whole market has changed so much. The whole landscape has changed. Doing good part to Steve  Jobs and iTunes. A lot of people say do to Tim Cook too in some ways. Just that ability to run  operations. Anyway, I don't know what it means. I try not to read too much into it because  I'm bummed because I like what the guy's done and he's been really inspirational to me in terms of  the way he approaches business. So I feel bad for the guy. It's hard to know that somebody powerful  is moving closer toward a position where they have less power. I think that's always feels a

Start time: 753.96
End time: 855.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  little tragic. I totally feel bad for the guy. But I do think that they're... I just don't see  Steve relinquishing the reins unless he absolutely had to. I don't see him doing it because Tim Cook  is going to leave or because Tim Cook is tired of being the ICEO. I don't see him doing it because  it's the right time for the product cycle or the stock market. This is Steve Jobs life is Apple  Computer. When he was wandering in the wilderness, when he was at Next and Pixar, he still... I know  because I spent a little time with him, never stopped thinking about Apple Computer. It was  first, last, and always on his mind. For him, I can only imagine how difficult this must be.  I think that if you read between the lines and the letters, the letter that he wrote, it really  feels elegiac. How would you pronounce that? Elegiac. She might not be that soft, but that's  how I roll. It feels like a very poignant farewell. Steve Jobs has never been the kind of guy that  soft pedal anything or do anything to be nice. He's the kind of guy who would say,  no, I'm standing here until I absolutely cannot. I think the fact that he took two medical leaves  of absence and came back again and again, despite obviously grave illnesses, shows that.  Nevertheless, I think what really you got to do is just say, this guy... Doc Searles called him  the Beethoven of technology. This guy was Da Vinci. This guy was Henry Ford. This guy was so  important to the thing that we care a lot about, which is technology, that you've got to mark the

Start time: 855.74
End time: 887.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  transition. Absolutely. I don't question that things are going to change. I think the interesting  question would be, how will it change and when? Because they seem like they've been pretty good  at reacting, not reacting to the market, but really they bake... One of the things I think  drives people crazy about Apple is how adamant they are about defining their own market.  Somebody starts chasing their tail and they change tails. In some cases... I think what's  interesting about it though is that... I agree with you. I think he cares so much about his company  though that he would never want the story to become more about him than benefits the company.

Start time: 887.30
End time: 942.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I agree. I think what really happened is he finally... He was diagnosed with a fatal illness  five years ago, so almost six years ago. They said, you have six months to live. I think he  held on and through what must have been uncalculable pain and suffering, got the iPad out the door,  got the retail on track. iPhone. iPhone. And I think that his last public appearance was two  months ago in front of the Cupertino City Council, asking them permission to build this amazing space,  flying saucer in Cupertino. I think those pieces were the pieces he wanted to put in place as his  legacy. I think he says with the iPad, I think he says, I did it. I finally got the computer that  Apple was created to build. The computer for the rest of us, I got it out into people's hands.  And I think that in a way, that's what really happened was that Steve got to the point that

Start time: 942.50
End time: 966.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  he could say, I've done it. Well, Leo, I wouldn't discount the fact that he is...  He's still the chairman and he still is an Apple employee. When you're a CEO,  you have all kinds of things that you need to do and that you need to pay attention to  in terms of fiduciary duties and corporate duties. And he could toss those aside and  focus on the thing he does best, which is product. I hope that's the case.

Start time: 966.96
End time: 971.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Good point. God, we pray that's the case, right? He said, I can't be CEO anymore,

Start time: 971.40
End time: 974.64
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  which is not the same thing as saying I can't work for Apple anymore.

Start time: 976.34
End time: 1010.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so if this frees him up to be more Steve Jobs, the caveat to that is...  I hope that's true, boy.  Merlin mentioned the Gruber piece. Gruber talked about that Steve Jobs' best product was Apple  itself. And hopefully that will continue with its current vision for a long time. But I think he's  still free to kind of play in the space, maybe even be more free to play in the product development  space. We may see even more things that have his hand on them.

Start time: 1011.58
End time: 1047.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I pray that that's true. I just can't see... I'm looking at the executive  chart now. The people in charge, post Steve Jobs, Tim Cook. I just don't see here the creativity,  the talent. Or maybe we just don't know them yet. Scott Forstall, Johnny Ives. There's a guy. But  again, this was very much under... Now, I don't know why Ron Johnson's still on that org chart  because he works for JCPenney's now. Not yet. He's leaving in November.  So he's technically still there. He's running the retail operation. Bob Mansfield. We saw a  lot of Bob Mansfield with the iPhone, most recent iPhone. We don't know most of these people all

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  that well. Phil Schiller's the one we know best. We know Phil. And Tim Cook, we don't know that he  doesn't have what it takes to provide some of the vision. We just know that he's a really

Transcript:  Bill Gates. There was an interesting thing in that... I think this came up... I don't think I have  access to the full article. In that Fortune story about the hiring of... I'm sure I'll mispronounce  his name. Joel Padolny, who was at the Yale Business School, your alma mater. They hired  this big business school to come in. At the time, everybody thought it was going to be to come into  Apple and work on theoretically something like iTunes University. But it turned out that the  reason he was there was to work on a problem that a lot of companies struggle with, which is taking  all the institutional wisdom and all the information that's floating around that hasn't been put  anywhere and figure out how to institutionalize that and put it somewhere where it can be shared  that's more than like a wiki. We've got a wiki. I think it's one of the interesting things to watch.  That's what our wiki is for. I was on your wiki. I learned a lot about this. That's what our wiki is for.  I think one of the interesting things to watch is going to be... First of all, you met people from  Apple. They don't have to have Steve standing over their shoulder to understand the man's state.

Start time: 1135.90
End time: 1140.26

Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  just about Apple, but companies in general. Gosh, everybody could go to one of the pages with all  those faces on it and all those bios and wonder, gosh, will it be okay with or without these people?  Well, the strength of a lot of these companies is in the rank and file and in the director level  people. Those people at the top are certainly important, but I think what makes some of these  companies so great is that down to the person... I was at Pixar a few weeks ago and every single  person in that building feels imbued with the spirit of trying to make something truly great.

End time: 1195.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  too wasn't thinking about it that way, but yeah, exactly. There's not that many places you can go  where you will see that level of engagement with making something unforgettable. So I just think  that's a super interesting idea for companies in general, though. I wonder how many companies have  taken that much time to try and turn what is currently a good idea with lots of wizards into  something that they can share for 10 years down the road. Package. Yeah. You did a great job, Harry,

Start time: 1208.98
End time: 1217.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Transcript:  Employees in the field away from... This is a great quote from the Infoworld article. Employees  in the field away from the daily news reports that dwell on the dark specter of layoffs  seem ebullient. Quote, at last we have someone who's watching the bottom line, says a nearly  five-year Apple veteran about the rise of John Scully. He's brought accountability to an  organization which has been lacking for five years. I think Apple's making the transition from one  phase of its life to the next. I don't know that the image of a leader clad in a bow tie,  jeans, and suspenders could help us survive in the coming years. Well, they were wrong. It turned  out he was the only guy who could ever help Apple survive. 10 years later, of course,  Jobs returned to save that company. And that's something else we can't forget is that Apple

Transcript:  bit like it's the end of an era. Well, it is like the end of an era. And that's partly,  you know, why I'm upbeat. I mean, it's like a lot of things. I'm a pretty quiet guy. And I don't let  out a lot of personal feelings. And even directly to people, you know, when they matter, I just am  that way. And it's like, you know, this was an important time to make sure that, you know, I  haven't felt like I wanted my own feelings to get hurt. And, you know, the world, you know,  recognize Steve in the right ways. And, you know, and I've always felt that way about him.  You know, it's kind of neat. You know, we go back and we think about, I watched Steve on some of the  interviews he does, and even things like, you know, DSEF and Bill Gates. And he really talks  fondly even on the phone with me about those early days. So I know that in the last year or so,  it had really started getting to him those fond memories, you know, when we were kids doing kid  things. And, you know, another thing that really strikes me, it doesn't get brought up a lot,  but it was when they did that D7 interview and Bill Gates said, he just wished he had that thing  that Steve has. And it's the visionary thing of being able to realize what the future is. And last  time I spoke to Steve, he said, well, you know, I'm not very technical. I halted him on that one  right away. And I said, you know, first of all, what's most important is knowing what people  really want and what they will appreciate and like. That's what leads to knowing how to make  the good products. And well, Steve got silent right away. I don't know if he was going to  put me down or put me up or something. I think he'd read somewhere something saying I might want to  return to Apple, which every once in a while that comes up. So I denied it right away to relieve him.  But I don't know what his call was about. But anyway, it was like, it's like, you know, he knows  how to tell who's BS and who's really got strong, especially when it comes from technical people and  engineers, which one knows what they're doing, which one is on a track that could lead to a leap  frog, you know, a jump in technology, and which ones are just, you know, kind of using a bunch of  words, but you know, that are going around the tech industry, but they really don't know how to  make an advance. And he was always good at telling that difference. So I think those were a lot of  things that were important factors in his making great products. And you know, every time I ever  spoke to him over the years, every time it came out that the products had to be great, you know,  and I would talk about things to him like how a lot of what Apple has is this huge following  community. Apple introduces a product, a million people buy it right away, all of a sudden, the  world has a direction rather than a whole bunch of competing companies, you kind of like you have a  standard when Apple comes out with a new product. And Steve wanted to buy that right away, just  wanted to put it in the focus of when you make great products. I remember you talking about

Transcript:  every time you'd invent something, whether it's a blue box or the Apple one or the Apple two,  Steve would say, I think we can make a business out of this. Well, he was yeah, I mean, that's how we

Start time: 1489.26
End time: 1606.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  started. That story is pretty well known now. He was more the businessman and marketing. He always  had a clue to sales, and he wanted to start companies. And if yeah, the Apple two was actually  the sixth time that I designed something for myself, except for breakout. Steve came to me  with the idea from Atari for doing breakout. Every other one I just did on my own for myself,  no thinking about ever having a sale or a product. And Steve wanted to do that. So  you need that kind of team. It was so fun. You know, it was so fun because because I'd be sitting  there in the in, you know, in my house building all these great things. And he'd come by and see it.  And you usually go up to Oregon and come back after a few months. And he just loved seeing it.  He always had ideas of where it could go. But he was always like 10 years ahead of me saying,  could you put a disk on this? And I would just say yes, yes, yes, because I know you can  always put something on anything. And, you know, I was so I was, you know, kind of appeasing him.  And then he would say, Oh, could you also write an operating system? Well, yes. And I wasn't sure if  a microprocessor could support an operating system. And then he would say, you can have  multiple people call in because he was thinking of starting a business that would replace one he  knew, which was time sharing service in Mountain View called Call Computer, which was actually  where we sold my video terminal that turned into the Apple one. So so Steve was Yeah, he was always  looking for ways to make something in the world out of these designs. But see, he was also good  at spotting me as young engineer doing all these super creative things that nobody had done before.  You know, I could just sit down and do circuits with almost no parts. And so he spots he spots  people like that all his life, I think, and the best. And even you know, when I get kind of rusty  on technology, Steve's always been very, very nice to me, very cordial, very respectful.  And, you know, so I think you just have to be at a point in time, you have to be that greatness.  But he wants great people around him. And that's why I see that Apple is is stock full of gotta be  stock full of, you know, Steve Wasiak's in their categories or, you know, or better.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  I don't know, Tim, all I know of him is is aside from hearsay and reading articles and all that is  a couple of videos that I watched, both which impressed me a lot. One was he talking to analysts  about iPhone or something handled it very well. I you know, back in a day of well, what about why  doesn't the iPhone have this or what about that his answers were very good, because I was trying  to get a clue how to answer questions without getting myself in trouble with Steve and the  company. But more than that, I saw his commencement speech to to Auburn, Auburn State,  and was just very impressed. You know, he just spoke candidly and openly and it was coming from  the heart. It wasn't, you know, phony executive type talk about having feelings and emotions  and what he what he liked about Steve Jobs and how it just totally influenced him to come to Apple and  how you had to you had to figure in what you're really believed inside emotionally,  you know, and that's that's a large part of it. It helps to have a nice, well known big company  with Apple's reputation too. But you just sometimes have to say, I'm not going to necessarily take the  safe path. I'm going to go with what I think is the better way. Is there a particular kind of genius

Start time: 1683.22
End time: 1761.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  he was very young, right? It's very difficult to recognize any type of genius back then mine was  rather easy. It was a specific type. His was he was very like rapid fast thinking like he was  desperate, almost either ADHD or kind of like a little bit paranoid or something like that,  desperate, high anxiety to find the next thing to do the next thing to have some company have some  way to get little tiny bits of income, you know, get a job here, get a job there. He was really  good at on his phone in his parents room. He could take a call and find somebody that's willing to  sell him some types of electronic switches for six cents that he knew he could sell for six bucks.  And you know, I would say, geez, you could talk to you know, I didn't even think that was ethically  right. But I was kind of far end of the ethical scale that doesn't match business ethics. Matter  of fact, when we started Apple, our founding person, our mentor, the guy that really made Apple  told us what kind of people we have to hire, how Steve Jobs had to learn to run every division in  a company like grooming him for a CEO. That was Mike Markla. And he said that, you know, he turned  to me because I had questions about some of the things that you would have to do in business is  business ethics is not the same as personal ethics. Yeah. And I just grunted, well, I'm just going to  be in engineering anyway. You can stay at it. Yeah, because you are ethical in engineering,

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Yeah, the issue came up around things like, well, a I want I had told some people we could sell this  new computer for like $500. And, and they were down at Hughes in Southern California. So Mike  Markla was a nice sweetie, he let me keep my word, and he kind of made a few boards available for 500  bucks, but then only for a very short time, and nobody could ever really find out about it.  So that I kept my word, but the company, you know, wasn't going to be a low profit company.  And also, also, we had it, we had to get the TV, the picture onto a TV, there was no video in those  days. So you had to use some kind of modulator. And as a ham radio operator, I was, you know,  my life, I just grew up so I was such a young ham radio operator, when you are pure and your ethics  are, you know, very, I don't know, it's very, whatever you call that nonprofit, it's not about  money. It's about no, it's not nonprofit. It's, it's kind of, it's kind of a range of ethics. And  the word is just skipping me right now. You're well, you're idealistic, idealistic. There you go.  I was going to be a protector for the rest of my life of the airwaves and not have  spurious transmissions if you ignore TV jammers. But as a company, as a company,  can you make a product that transmits on channel three? I wouldn't let Apple do that. I mean,  I said, no, we can't do that. And, you know, people weren't going to be able to open up the  back of their TVs and use the oscilloscopes and run wires into their TVs with little adapter  circuits to get the video displayed. And so what we did, I think, behind my back,  Mike Markla or some somebody in our company, I think Rod Holt, the guy who designed our power  supplier, analog engineer designed a little modulator circuit, and then gave it to an outsider,  which was Marty Spurgill. And he sold it, I forgot what he called it. But it was it was the it was  the way to get your Apple two on to every time we sold an Apple two, we sold one of those.

Speaker: SPEAKER_04
Transcript:  Oh, it was a few months ago. It's been a while. And he called me. He called me and  I don't know if he'd heard something about me. Are you anxious to talk to him again? Or?  I always I always love talking to him. I don't call him enough. It's really funny. But the day  his resignation came out was a day I was going to send him an email. Because you know, everybody  has ideas, a product should do this product should do that. And I decided long ago, I'm not going  to get into this marketing game and decide what's right for Apple inside. They have top people,  they really know what they're doing. They're on top of the answers better than me. And in the old  days, I used to always notify Steve when something was wrong with a program, like if you were in a  hotel, you know how you have to dial nine for an outside line, right, and then one in area code,  it would switch the nine and the one it was just for it was remote access. So I told him about it,  he got it fixed. But they took out the ability to call into your own remote access, which is  way I called from distance to join my home network back in the early pre internet days, you know.  So I was pissed. I didn't want to send any more to Apple. No more fixes for you.  It might also take out the things you like, which is kind of true of all technology nowadays. It's  going so fast. Right. And I wanted to send a note to him to tell him that because Steve always  thought about, let me think what the issue was, I gotta get it back in my head. It's something  current. And it's something in the way things should work for humans. It'll come by me. I'm

Transcript:  I know what it was. On my iPhone, I was starting to get blown away thinking these computers are  going to become more like humans, more like people, we're going to be the pet dogs. And my  favorite examples of all, I had three of them, my favorite on Siri assistant on the iPhone,  I could ask the question, what are the five largest lakes in California? I've tried Google  searches and all these other methods, and it'd give me lists of lakes you have to come try to  figure out and you don't get the right, it's hard to find the one that will get you the right answer.  Siri came back with a list, one, two, three, four, five, credited to Wolfram Alpha. Then I said into  Siri, I said, I spoke, what are the prime numbers greater than 87? The answer came back with only  the ones greater than 87 from Wolfram Alpha, which understands greater than, I thought this was so  amazing. This is the most amazing thing I've ever had. It disappeared. Apple bought Siri,  and just recently those features disappeared. Maybe Siri doesn't go to Wolfram Alpha anymore,  but I don't want to ask a question and get a bunch of links that might get me to the answer or get me  closer to the answer. I want to ask a question and get the answer. Steve always used to talk about  that in the early days of spreadsheets. You don't want a spreadsheet, you just want to ask how much  is my car payment, get the answer. Maybe it's from some other token, some other device out there on  the cloud. I think he always had that in his head. I thought that was his philosophy. Again,  I was going to write him about that because my God, when you can start asking the questions you  have all day long, I want to actually ask it right into my iPod Nano on my watch band. I just want  to ask questions all day long and have somehow enough battery to connect to the internet.

I mean, he's  looked so different at different times and he's still got that stupid bow tie and it looks awesome.  And it's just, it's great to be in the room and see how excited that guy is. And there's times when  you, not to be all hashyographic, but you see a little glint where he's like, this is pretty cool, isn't it?  Yeah. Oh yeah, you totally see that.

That's pretty good with  the big bow tie. It's a pretty good moment. We will continue in just a bit to talk about, there is  lots of other news as well, but I think this is, there's no question this is the story of not just  the week, probably of the year. But first, before we go on, GoToMeeting. I want to talk a little bit  about GoToMeeting now with HD faces. We've been using and recommending GoToMeeting for a long time,  all our meetings, all our conference calls, our GoToMeeting, because of this great screen sharing,  you can show people a PowerPoint presentation or, you know, collaborate on a document together,  you can train. But now they've added, and it's so mind boggling, HD faces. You get video,  high def video of your conferees. There's nothing like seeing the person you're in a meeting with  and seeing them smile or nod or, you know, fold their arms. Body language is so efficient and so  important to communication. That's why I love GoToMeeting with HD faces. A chance for you to see  the people you meet with. Let me turn off the sound on this. We don't have to listen to the piano music,  but if when you see the video in here, it's incredible. Just visit GoToMeeting.com. You  can try it free for 30 days. GoToMeeting.com. Use the offer code TWIT. And this is exactly what you  see. You get the screen sharing, but you get up to six high def pictures, crystal clear pictures,  the best in the industry. So you, when you, I can't explain it, but it really does transform meetings.  It is really fantastic. If you've been wanting to try GoToMeeting, now you've got an extra reason  to do it. GoToMeeting.com. Try the HD faces. All you need is the internet and a webcam, and you can  do it, and you can do it for free for the next 30 days if you use the offer code TWIT. All our meetings  are GoToMeetings. I think that should be true for everyone. And we do thank them for their support of  This Week in Tech. We've been having fun with Eileen and the TriCaster. Eileen, you know, I  got to tell you, our producer, Eileen, is running the whole show. I often say that one of the ideas  that we had to make TWIT financially feasible is instead of having a couple people in front of the  camera and two dozen people behind the camera, we have four big minds here, all the content here,  and one person is doing the job of about 20 back there as the TD. And of course, you couldn't do it  without that TriCaster 850. Give me a TriCaster transition. Watch this. She's really good at this.  She's sitting there. I don't know. You can't even do it.

But so many people use Linux without knowing it because Android is Linux.  Android is Linux. You're right. It's half a million new Linux users a day.  Yeah. It turned out to be something which is profoundly important, but you just don't,  you're not aware you're using it for the most part.

Transcript:  It's infrastructure more than anything else. It was August 25th, 1991 that a Finnish computer  science student, Linus Torvalds, first released, first announced to the world.  He did it on, by the way. It's on Usenet, right?  Usenet, exactly. I think he said something like, I'm writing an operating system.  It will be like Minix. Anybody want to help? Come on, you can help.  Here it is. Here's the, this is from the Linux foundations, Linux history gallery.  Hello, everybody out there using Minix. I'm doing a free operating system, just a hobby.  Won't be big and professional like GNU for 386 AT clones. This has been brewing since April and  starting, I'm starting to sound like a leprechaun. I'm just thinking you're very Swedish chef right  now. Merlin's just, his eyeballs are getting bigger. You guys missed like 35 minutes of  Transylvania before this. I'd like any feedback on things people like, dislike in Minix as my OS  resembles it somewhat. This is so cute. I've currently ported bash and GCC and things seem  to work. Wow. 20, it's 20 years isn't that long and yet I doubt very much. And what the thing that  Linus did that was really cool, he trademarked the name so that he would be the one who could  say this is Linux, this isn't Linux. And I think that was actually smart, but he didn't patent or  in any way encumber the source code. He gave it away basically.

Transcript:  I think this is a software patent issue fundamentally and the fact that SCO sued, of course,  a failed lawsuit ultimately, but one that went on for a long time, and then that Microsoft then  licensed and indemnified people and said, well if you buy our products, you don't have to worry  about getting sued, really created, and this was intentional on Microsoft's part, really created  this perception that it might be dangerous to use Linux. And I think that that was, I think that's  a lot of it. I think that Linux enterprise, when you talk about in the enterprise, I think that  that was one of the things that really kind of put a chill on it, unfortunately.

Start time: 3008.32

Transcript:  Street Journal yesterday, no, this is, you know, I, I, I, maybe this is just me, but I just cannot  get upset about this. That Google for years was selling ads on AdSense or AdWords, I should say,  to Canadian pharmacies, targeting American consumers. And he did nothing about it.  The Google agreed, agreed, admitted to doing that and they paid a half billion dollar fine.  But apparently at least one attorney general from Rhode Island and the Department of Justice say,  but Larry Page knew, he knew. Can you get, to me, I feel like,  bully for him. Let's get some more Canadian pharmacy ads on the internet. What the hell's  wrong with that? Why do you think people want Canadian pharmacy ads? Because it's cheaper to  buy the drug from Canada. And illegal. It's illegal. I understand it's illegal. But it's  illegal because big pharmacy wants to charge us more than they charge in Canada, right? For the

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  the evil one here. Google, there was a story, I forget who wrote it this week, that where  somebody explained what don't be evil means. And it doesn't necessarily mean  the kind of thing you're talking about. It's don't be evil to your customers. Be good to  your customers, which is your users, your searchers. So things that look like it's Google being  predatory towards other companies. If you look at the one of the side effect of the motivation  for them to do that is that it benefits their customers in some way. If you look at that,  that part of it, then it is not being evil. And, you know, having ads for cheaper drugs on your  website, not evil, right? Well, if you're, if you're, if you're looking at it in terms of a  U S consumer who wants to use Google to do that, I guess the question is, are these drugs somehow

Start time: 3355.04
End time: 3398.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  dangerous? No, they're the same. They're from well, they're from Canada. Okay, so here's the issue.  There is an there is a little loophole in the Canadian law that says, so these drugs were  neither FDA approved nor Canadian drug regulation approved. There was a little loophole that said  Canadian pharmacies if they are shipping the drugs to the US are not subject to Canadian regulation.  So they could be they could have been dangerous. They could have been paid poison pills. But I  don't think that they were. I think they were in fact, the same exact drugs that the farmers sell  us in the US for four or five. Don't people get on buses and drive to Canada to get their cancer  medicines because it's so much cheaper there? It's ridiculous. And isn't that evil? Well,

Transcript:  There's a little time. Yeah, wait a minute. We came up with a different kind of,  you know, container for it. So we get a new patent. No, but the thing is, I think Google,  it's going to be one of the things like eBay or any of those things where they're a platform  for this. Can you imagine how many billions of ads they run every year? And the last thing in the  world they want to incur the wrath on is like suddenly becoming the people who have to filter  each one of those for legality. Well, that's a good point. Well, they vet them. They vet them  for relevance right now. But what would happen if Google again? I don't have this is not a value  judgment, but I bet they would happily go, sure, here's five million dollars. Like I so don't want  to have to figure out if this lady really does nails or is a hooker. Like I so don't want to

And they are protected in that case by the digital millennium copyright act, which says that they are  a carrier. They have the safe harbor protection that they don't have to vet everything on YouTube.  They don't have to protect copyright holders. They merely have to provide a mechanism for  copyright holders to complain. Wouldn't it be kind of similar for these ads or maybe not? I mean,  isn't it onerous to expect them to vet every ad for legality? Well, supposedly they knew explicitly

Start time: 3502.38
End time: 3550.00
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  that they weren't legal. Oh, new schmoo. Also, chat room guy, generics and name brands are not  the same. They're not? They're not the same chemical? Ask one of those doctors about the  quality control and generics are like, you know. Really? Oh, sure. Because I always,  I always opt for the generic drug. Well, it depends if it's something like this is,  you should play the music. It's a rattle. I'm sorry. No, it's not a rattle. It's interesting.  It's crazy though, because you know, boy, you think about that this has happened in some  locations where they get where there are places where they go like, oh my gosh,  you've got to start policing the weekly news ads for. How do you do that? Well, that's the thing  is I bet you just think about how much of their revenue, I guess maybe not. But I imagine the

I got one of those mystery meat numbers,  like on an 800 number. Of course, the first thing I do, I grab it, I search for it on who called me  or whatever. Use Google Chrome, Google.com to find this. It was apparent that it is a  ad call from Google to try and get me to upgrade to a business listing. I've had that call. And  then I use Google Voice to block that number. That's what I would call an end to end solution  that scales across the enterprise. Thank you, Google, I guess. I can Google with Google.

And they were very, very proud of the  fact that they made the slide division kind of independent. And they came out with a bunch of  programs, most recently photovine, but pool party, a bunch of really interesting programs, except  that they were all on iOS. Most of them used Facebook Connect. None of them used Google's own  tools. And shortly after photovine, Super Poke Pets. That's one you probably use all the time.

Although it was a little weird to  PP somebody in the pool party. It's just an odd thing. They bought this company. Max Levchin,  who was really probably the guy they wanted to hire, is gone. He's leaving Google. And they  shut down Slide. And they allowed them to do photovine, which came out last week. Even that

I think there's something, somebody was saying this this week on  one of our shows that this is kind of a really an indicator of the new economy in technology and  startups. Maybe, I know Merlin, you're a big startup. You know a lot of these guys, but  that you got to have a hit right away or you go. It's like the movie industry.

But somebody said, and forgive me, chat room, you can,  you, the Jackals can look it up. The, you, when you buy a company, you can buy it for one of  three things. You can buy it for resources. You can buy it for talent. You could buy for like  market share, but even that you have to pay a price that covers all three of those, but you can  only really do one. You only get one. Yeah. And so I think one of the problems is, and this is even  setting aside the kind of cultural clashes that you see. I mean, AOL, Time Warner, that, how great  did that go in terms of, you know, culture? It happens all the time. It's so hard to do acquisition.

Transcript:  Well, I guess, I guess you cannot fault a company. Even a company like HP, you know, it's funny.  Somebody said the eight, we now know the HP touchpad was not a failure.  The price was the failure because they're selling it out at 99 bucks.  No, I don't think so. It makes to build that will do well.  Bear with me here. What if you did sell it at 99 bucks and you, I mean, Google's shown that in the  Firefox is shown in the browser. You can make lots of money by Google searches in the browser.  What if you did subsidize it to buy market share? Look at, they already lost that money.  Maybe they should have lost the money up front subsidized market share, get developers going,  get people excited about it. You think Harry, I mean, Dwight, you sounded skeptical, you know?

Transcript:  No, I think that that HP and Leo Apotheker have a completely different direction for that company.  I think they want to go enterprise. And I saw a description of the of the HP touchpad as being  similar to the to the Newton for Apple is that when, you know, as soon as Steve Jobs came back,  he killed it. And as soon as Leo Apotheker had the opportunity, he killed something that Mark  heard had, you know, essentially, it wasn't Marsher. It wasn't Mark. Right. Right. And I just  think that he was looking for any excuse and when it didn't sell out immediately. But see,  if you sell anything of that complexity, any type of gadget like that, and you have a limited amount  of them and you sell it for ninety nine bucks, every nerd who wants to hack it is going to go  buy it. Right. And that's what happened. And I don't think you can look at that and say, OK,

Harry's piece about Amazon, which was I really liked, it was really simply written and he walked  through kind of OK, what if this price, what is this price is a good exercise of kind of looking  at what a real you know, what tablets will cost. The iPad is actually a pretty cheap piece of  technology in terms of cost. We all expected it to be nine hundred bucks when it came out. Right.  And and it's four ninety nine. But I think we're about to see the quote Apple tax be applied to  the iPad, because once the Amazon tablet comes out, I think that's going to set a new bar for

You should wear a fedora with a piece of paper in it that says  press. I should wear that red hat. Yeah, the red hat, red hat. That's right. Brought to you today,  of course, by audible.com. I live for audible books. I listen to audible books all the time.  I'm listening to right now Stenislav's, Lem's, Solaris. They did a new translation. Audible  should get a lot of credit for this because it was a crappy translation of the original Polish  that's been in print for years. Audible said there's a better way. Lem even didn't ever like  that translation. They commissioned a new translation of this classic science fiction book  and also produced it as part of their audible frontiers program. I really want to give them a  plug because audible frontiers, if you're a science fiction fan, is saving science fiction books,  recording them often for the first time ever. Classics. What a great way to listen. I think  science fiction particularly makes good audible books because they come alive. You really are  seeing it. I wasn't really crazy about the George Clooney movie. It was a little slow.  What about the other one? I started watching the other one. I haven't seen the Polish one.  I haven't seen that. I look great. I just started watching it. I'm going to watch that.  It's on the Netflix. Is it on the streaming? Yeah, I fell asleep. It looks great.  Like you don't. You will not fall asleep during the book. It's really, really good.  A little credit due there. I'm also listening to this book that was recommended by Andy Iannacco.  The latest, it's about the Americans going to Paris in the 1830s. The Greater Journey.  Oh, is that a good book. I really enjoyed this. I want to show you since Americans Paris,  David McCullough's latest. He narrates the first chapter. When you hear David McCullough reading,  it's like, why don't all narrators sound this? You can just follow it so beautifully. I love

He's going to be on triangulation Wednesday to  talk about getting things done. This is a chance for you to quickly get getting things done.  You know what? What a great way to listen to this book because David himself narrates it.  It's really like going to the seminar. I have listened to it. Yeah, it's fantastic.  I just gave you three books. Now, here's the deal. There are 75,000 titles at audible.com.  You can pick two and have them for free. Almost every book you can get for free. Not all of them,  but almost every book you can get absolutely free by going to audible.com slash twit two,  twit number two. All one word. You get the Platinum Plan. That's two books a month. That's  what I do. Your first month is free. Your first two books are free. You can cancel it any time.  They're yours to keep forever. It's a very good deal. There's three. Stanislaw Lem's  incredible Solaris with his new translation is mind-bogglingly good. The Greater Journey by  David McCullough. Again, another great book if you like history, science fiction history.  And then business, Getting Things Done, the Art of Stress-Free Productivity. You see, this is what  I love about audible. I flip around. I just did a nonfiction book, so I'm doing a fiction book,  and then I'm going to do a nonfiction. I just love doing that. Give them a try. They play back  on everything, including if you've got a new Kindle, you'll see in addition to your Amazon  books on the Kindle, you'll see your audible audio books because they play on the Kindle.  All the Apple devices, the Zune, if you've got one, the Windows phone. In fact, the Android app is  incredible for audible. Audible.com slash twit two.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01

Start time: 4375.28
End time: 4399.17
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Seems logical. All the rumors seem to point that direction.  The rumors are that it is going to be, I think the New York Post said it's going to be hundreds  less than the iPad. And Amazon is one of the few companies that could plausibly subsidize the  hardware because they've got the music, they've got the movies, they've got the books, they've got apps.  My guess is maybe $299. $199 would seem to involve a lot of subsidy.

Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  So the tablet's going to be more expensive than the Kindle, but Amazon, unlike everybody else,  might be willing to subsidize it. Apple, by the way, probably could subsidize the iPad,  but it doesn't want to because it can easily sell them at $499 and then make even more money

Well, yeah, I just mean if you're an Amazon Prime nerd, you could go in and just say,  I want these dish towels tomorrow. Do you think the whole store would be on there?  I do that already all the time.  Wouldn't it be kind of a no-brainer to put all that on there and subsidize?  So that's why they could give this away, be truthful.  Hardware to your account?

But if you put the Amazon store, Facebook, email, and Twitter on there,  I think tons of people would buy that.  I don't know if you call that a tablet, but you know what I'm saying?  What do most people do with their computer or with their iPhone or with their whatever?  Do you need a browser or email?  Here's the thing. Andy said, remember when Andy, when the Kindle first came out,  he made that great remark of saying, well, depending on what you do,  best thing for you might be a lifetime of free 3G, depending on what you're using.  The problem is right now that browser, that experimental browser is no fun to use.  But if you tune those hardware buttons, this might be a little ambitious for Amazon,  but I'm just saying, if you have a store, Facebook, Twitter, email browser on there,  basic syncing, I could see people buying that.  It's almost the computer of the future.  I think ginning up a Kindle and calling it a tablet, I don't know about that.  But if it had the store on it, wouldn't you? I think that'd be awesome.  Of course it'll have the store on it.  Oh, yeah.  The whole Amazon store.

But predicting based on this that the Kindle would be free.  It's a pretty steep slope.  Well, if you look at the line, it's a perfect straight line.  I realize that's nothing to bank on.  But it's such an interesting idea.  In the same way, I wouldn't charge a buck for iTunes.  It's worth more than a buck to me, but I think it's worth a lot more to Apple to give it away  and make a platform for buying stuff.  That's the thing is the Kindle.  Gosh, to even compare it to Apple, I know I'm the big fanboy or whatever.  But I think comparing those, I don't think Honda Accords are going to sell less because  somebody makes a cheaper skateboard.  We're talking about different kinds of things.

Eagles singer Don Henley says that the Electronic Frontier  Foundation and Google aid and abet criminals.  In a op-ed piece in USA Today this week,  Don Henley, who was the drummer, was he not?  He was a drummer and vocalist, occasional vocalist.  He says that blocking rogue websites, banning them from  search engines and cutting off their advertising and credit  cards is just common sense.  He's talking about the Protect IP Act, which is in fact far  from common sense and breaks the internet.  That's what the EFF says.  Eric Schmidt says it's a disastrous precedent for freedom of speech.  He says there's no First Amendment right to infringe intellectual property.  See, he's going to be the new Lars Ulrich for the 21st century.  And by the way, that went well for Lars.  Lars is now making appearances, making fun of himself.  What movie was he in?  Get him to the Greek.  And he mocked him.  In fact, I think in Get him to the Greek, didn't the comedian,  Russell Brand say, go sue Napster or something?  So just Don Henley, I'm just telling you what your future holds.

Transcript:  But like, do you how much do you think they put into the whole battery life thing?  Because I'm finding I love the long battery.  I got a lot of problems.  But I love the long battery life of my iPad.  I love the crazy long battery life of my Kindle.  How much trade-off do you think you can afford to make in battery life  to bring in something like what, H264 video?  I mean, what's I don't know what the most power.

Start time: 5217.62
End time: 5232.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You get that battery life because that thing has an E-ink screen.  It doesn't do anything.  See what I'm saying?  If you have a pad.  As soon as you're playing video, you're kind of screwed.  Actually, this is your main because one of the things people said about the touchpad  is the reason it's so sluggish is because it didn't have the  optimizations that Apple made for the iPad.

Start time: 5232.72
End time: 5254.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  It is so optimized.  And I mean, every other tablet, one of the big differences between  the iPad and the zoom and everything else is the battery life.  And almost all of them is.  And the responsiveness.  I think the the rim playbook is kind of the only other one  where the battery life seems to be pretty good.  Right.  But yeah, Apple, I mean, it designed its own chip.  It puts way more thought in that experience and it pays off.

Start time: 5255.31
End time: 5261.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  There's advantage.  For instance, if you know you're not going to be doing flash,  you can make a simpler chip that is more efficient.

Start time: 5261.72
End time: 5283.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Does that question make sense, though?  Because do other people value battery life as much as I do?  And even if we take a bread, they don't want to spend that much on an iPad.  If they pick up the Kindle with the Facebook in the store and the whatnot,  are they going to expect 13 to 20 hours of battery life?  They pop in one life to live and suddenly they go down to like 2 percent.  Is that going to happen on a pad like that?

Start time: 5283.80
End time: 5303.60
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, even the even the iPad, the battery life drops really quickly.  Once you start watching video, you watch two hour movie on it.  And it's at 100 and you'll be down to about 60, 55 percent on the battery.  Yeah.  When you're done with the movie.  That is still pretty impressive.  And if Amazon wants to sell movies through that,  they're going to have to do probably at least that good.

You buy your grandma this thing and it's like got a phone and email  and it's all you'll ever need.  It seems like along the lines of like the success HP seems to have had  with these all in one devices in the past.  It just seems like that's been the wet dream for a lot of these companies  is to come up with the mom and pop thing that you can truck around.  And I think Harry's probably right.  A lot of people are not going to want to go out and spend.  I was.

Transcript:  I think that the tablet stuff has to be, and I think that's what everyone's looking at.  And I love the Metro UI, and I think it has a lot of potential, and we'll see what happens  when it's translated over to the tablet.  I'm a little concerned about the idea of essentially having two interfaces and swapping  between them and the confusion that might lead to, but we'll see how they handle it.

Start time: 5580.02
End time: 5609.02
Speaker: SPEAKER_01
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, well, the one thing they've shown us so far is this dual UI, where you  can have a rather iPad-like UI or classic Windows.  I think it's possible, though, that it doesn't really give us that good an idea of what's  important.  If you looked at Windows 7 when they first demoed that, they also showed touch stuff  in Windows 7 first.  So people thought that would be really important in Windows 7, and it turned out not to be  a big deal.  Not to be, yeah.  So I'm sure at Build we will get some sort of beta, and we'll get all the details, and  it will be a little bit clearer.

And I think that comes through in a way where, and I don't want to bust a gut about Jobs,  but that's one of the things I find so inspiring about Steve Jobs is how much would you,  I mean, as much as a character as Steve could be, to be around somebody with as much,  who cares as much about nerdy stuff as Woz,  but then somebody who cares so much about making it good, Steve.

I think he heard the second hand the sitting at a conference table with Jobs.  And, you know, I guess it's a presentation.  They do the presentations of what, you know, what we're going to talk about,  the keynote or something.  And somebody says, well, I hope you had a nice weekend.  And Jobs says, can we get down to business?  You know, can we get down to waste a little less time and get down to serious business here?  It's just very focused.  I mean, I think that that's true.  I think that's true.  No small talk exactly.  Right.  I think actually was kind of alluded to that a little bit that there was no lot of not a lot of  smoke.  Elevate the tone.  Thank you.  That was the line.  He said, we can we elevate the tone a little bit.  Enough about this chit chat about the weekend.  All right.  I think we're done.  Yes.
