And I guess this episode will be covering the year's tech news too, because it's our last  show, normal show of 2016.  This week we'll be doing a holiday episode with Steve Gibson, Denise Howell, and Renee  Ritchie.  It'll be a look back at 2016, the top big stories that we talked about in 2016.  Everything from the exploding Samsung Galaxy Note 7 to...  Wow.  Was that me making that sound?  To why your computer makes strange sounds.  This is the...  I'm using my new computer for 2017 already.  This is the very nice Surface Studio from Microsoft.  I'm going to say the computer of the year 2017.  The following week we'll do a best of, the January 1st episode.  The New Year's...  Christmas Day will be the roundup, and then New Year's Day will be the best of.  So there'll be all new podcasts, but I won't have to sit in this seat those days.  So we're going to go off and do some holiday things.  Meanwhile, for the last show, I thought it'd be fun to bring in some of my favorite people,  starting with somebody we haven't seen in a long, long time.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Johnny Ive padded cell.  You were not in the room where it happens, however, this week.  On Wednesday, neither was Jack Dorsey though, so don't feel too bad.  On Wednesday, President-elect Trump met with the tech titans, everybody above the billionaire  line except Jack Dorsey in Trump Tower.  I love the pictures of Tim Cook, who went along with Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos.  There was some debate over whether these guys should go, Sheryl Sandberg, Safra Katz of  Oracle, or whether they should stay at home.  Mark Benioff seems to have stayed at home.  Travis Kalanick of Uber stayed at home.  Brian Chesky of Airbnb did not go.  Jack Dorsey was not invited because it turned out, I didn't believe this.  I thought this is fake news for sure until it was confirmed by the Trump campaign that  Twitter had refused to make a custom emoticon for crooked Hillary.  And that apparently that failed emoji deal was enough to keep Jack Dorsey from getting  an invite.  Not sure if that's a good thing or a bad thing.  So I guess the question, and Kara Swisher is going to be on in a couple of weeks because  I'm going to ask her, she said you should absolutely not go.  She interviewed Chris Sacca who said it was in effect endorsing fascism.  I disagree.  I think it was probably a good thing to go.  But it didn't mean you had to smile.  There's Tim Cook not smiling.

Start time: 374.46
End time: 405.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I was in the lobby with the press scrum waiting for a chance to maybe have one of the executives  come by and talk to us.  I got the impression they did not want to be there.  Many of them kind of swooped through the lobby and didn't even like, I missed them.  Like I never saw Tim Cook.  He had some kind of stealthy ninja skills or something and he got on that elevator before  anyone could catch him.  Same with Bezos and same with Musk.  And Satya Nadella just whisked through.

Start time: 406.32
End time: 419.68
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  See, I said before this happened that the thing to look at is what they say and how  they act afterwards.  That's when you'll know if they got spanked, if they got to say something.  It's interesting they snuck out of there pretty much.

Start time: 420.28
End time: 423.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Nadella literally ran when the meeting was over.

Start time: 423.72
End time: 426.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He ran?  Maybe he was late for a plane.

Start time: 427.74
End time: 456.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  It was really funny.  I mean, he has a private jet, but they didn't want to be there.  It was clear they didn't want to talk to the press about it.  A lot of times when people meet with Trump, they'll come and talk to the scrum and say  it was a great meeting and some platitudes about that.  There was none of that.  They were in and out, all of them.  A lot of them came in through a different entrance so they could sneak on the elevators  easier.  Yeah, it was an interesting day standing in Trump Tower for six hours.

Start time: 456.92
End time: 468.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  For no apparent purpose.  Most of them were Clinton supporters during the campaign.  But I think that the, I would guess that their chief interest was not giving, making this  a media opportunity for Trump.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Well, they did that whole thing.  They had cameras in the room and stuff.

Start time: 475.04
End time: 535.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Go ahead, Stan.  They had cameras in the room for the first couple minutes.  I think, yeah, go.  But the protest I would like to see them lodge is the protest against saying that the meeting  was going to be off the record, which of course it wasn't.  Cara got them to talk and I think other people will hear really what happened there, which  wasn't so remarkable judging from the rumors coming out of there.  I think the protest would have been saying, yeah, I'm going to go, but I'm not going to  hide this from the public.  We're not going to be collaborating in secret to do something behind the public's back.  We're going to talk about what happened in there.  This is the people's business.  If you're going to be talking about what the direction of the Trump administration is in  the most important industry in this country, maybe the people need to know about this.  To me, the two big things coming out of it were that they weren't talking, whatever it  was, and that Trump's kids were in the room.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Four seats went to the family.

Start time: 539.65
End time: 581.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  I mean, which to me is actually, we've seen this before, but it's kind of a shocking circumstance  to me that when you have a meeting like this, you have these four people.  Maybe Jared Kushner, okay, he's sort of a consigliere unofficially there, but to have  your other kids in the room, there's no security clearance.  There's no official point in the transition for them.  It's just basically what you see in countries that aren't democracies with stuff like this.  I think that's disappointing, and I can't imagine that the big brains in the room were  impressed by that.

Start time: 582.82
End time: 588.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's not unprecedented for a president to use his family in some degree.  Hillary Clinton worked on health reform for Bill Clinton.

End time: 613.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  She wasn't sitting in the meeting.  To be honest, if she were in one of the meetings, it could be more easily justified.  She was a distinguished person in her own right who achieved quite a lot without having been  inheriting the business she was involved in.

Start time: 614.60
End time: 627.27
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It also shows such a huge conflict of interest as they're still running his businesses.  Then they're also sitting in on meetings that could influence the way that people are going  to be doing business with them.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  As Ivanka Trump sat in with the Prime Minister of Japan earlier.  These are some quotes from Kara's sources.  One source said the meeting was weird but not as awkward as it could have been.  Another said Trump was reasonable and fair the whole time.  Clearly, there are several reasons why the CEOs go.  One is, of course, the president-elect asks you, you go.  There's also the carrot of repatriating.  I would love to see the math for how many billions of dollars are represented by these  CEOs.  People alone is 18 billion more than that.  Trump has promised repatriation of that money for a lower tax rate.  That's one of the things they'd like.  Satya Nadella asked for a better H-1B visa situation.  That's something Trump's been inconsistent on.  On the one hand, acknowledging that they're often misused, bringing in less skilled tech  employees to replace American tech workers.  But of course, Silicon Valley argues, but no, we need to bring in the smart ones.  The H-1B visas are for the most educated workers that we can't get here in the United States.  Elon Musk apparently brought up climate change or at least did in another meeting.  There was some head shaking about Larry Page.  Kara writes, here's an outlier I personally liked.  Alphabet CEO Page brought up about infrastructure spending, the need to rejigger the electrical  grid, something about AC current versus DC current.  But everyone I spoke to was a little confused by this.  That's kind of what you'd expect Larry Page to come and say, you know, we should really  convert this all to DC.  No one would say to Kara, none of her sources would say who brought up the repeat patriation  issue, but it was brought up.  I don't see a problem with it and I understand why they skipped out quickly so as to not  make it a photo op.  But I think it was reasonable that they go and try to build a bridge, right?  Yeah, for sure.

Transcript:  Well, they could say no.  I mean, Kalanick said no, apparently.  Chesky said no.  Mark Benioff said no.

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Kalanick is on his team though.

Start time: 788.01
End time: 799.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Oh really?  Yeah, then we hear Kalanick is going to be on the team as Steve said, working with the  transition.  That's interesting.

Start time: 799.68
End time: 834.81
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Travis Kalanick, the CEO of Uber.  Well, Uber is interesting because Uber has been in constant battle with local governments  at first to get in the cities because taxi commissions and taxi medallion owners didn't  want Uber in there.  Now they're fighting with the state of California and the city of San Francisco because the  city of San Francisco says they never paid the cheap, by the way, $150 autonomous vehicle  license for those autonomous Volvos that Uber started to drive around on Wednesday in San  Francisco.  Uber says, well, you don't make people drive Teslas with autopilot pay it, so we're not  going to.

Start time: 837.23
End time: 915.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  This is an interesting pattern.  We did a story a couple of weeks ago.  We broke a story where Auto, which is the self-driving truck company.  Also owned by Uber.  Yeah, but right before they went to Uber, maybe this helped make them attractive to  Uber, is they did a big test run in Nevada.  As it turns out, they didn't have the proper license or authorization to do that.  There was actually, our reporter found some really heated correspondence going on beforehand  where the Nevada DMV said, you can't do this without the authorization.  They just did it anyway.  The irony was that the regulation was actually pretty much written by one of the co-founders  of Auto when he was at Google.  And they violated it anyway.  And I guess because they wrote the regulation, they knew that there was no penalty for violating  the regulation.  So now this particular fellow is the head now of the Uber self-driving car unit.  And apparently he likes going on and asking forgiveness rather than permission.  We're saying, I don't care whether you forgive me or not.

Start time: 915.70
End time: 927.65
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And by the way, Uber bought them right after for $680 million.  I could see why Travis Kalanick might want to get into the corridors of power and bypass  this whole regulation thing.

Start time: 929.82
End time: 942.42
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  And Trump is good for them.  Trump is anti-regulation.  So it very well could be, I think we did another story saying that the Trump administration  might be the best thing that ever happened to Uber in terms of this regulation.

Start time: 942.46
End time: 977.82
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, that's what's really interesting about all this because even though these CEOs all  were for the most part, Clinton supporters, they stand to make some major gains in it.  It's hard to know what a Trump administration would look like.  But I think one thing that's pretty apparent so far from his cabinet picks is he's probably  good for big business.  And that's what these guys run is big businesses.  So maybe there isn't this natural antipathy.  Maybe there's some of this partisan antipathy.  But it does seem like these guys could probably get a lot more even than repatriation from  a Trump administration.  Right.

Start time: 979.60
End time: 987.20
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  But then you see silly things like him promising they're going to start building iPhones here  in the United States and just untenable stuff like that.

Start time: 987.22
End time: 1012.32
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  He hasn't said anything about that since the part of the problem is there's this big red  line but pre-election, post-election.  And already they've repudiated many of the things they said pre-election.  And I haven't heard anything about bringing iPhone production back to the United States.  I think what would happen pretty quickly is you'd find out that it's just not practical.  And it wouldn't bring jobs because all you're doing is bringing the robots back.

Start time: 1013.09
End time: 1044.33
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  And they probably, when it comes to jobs, which I think was the main topic of this whole  thing, the repatriation plays into that.  They kind of dangle, OK, we'll give you a better tax rate when you want to repatriate  that cash.  But in exchange, we need to see some more jobs created here.  Now, again, those aren't the kind of jobs that Trump has been promising.  They're not blue collar jobs.  They're not manufacturing jobs.  They're high skilled, highly educated jobs.  So there's just that irony there, too.

Start time: 1045.42
End time: 1083.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Here's some more confusion.  Here's an article from November 20th, 2015.  Donald Trump's plan for a Muslim database in a Newton, Iowa campaign stop, he said,  I would certainly implement that.  Absolutely.  There should be lots of systems beyond databases.  We should have a lot of systems.  Then the Trump team a year later saying he never advocated for a Muslim database.  And now Silicon Valley tech workers planning to not build the database that Donald Trump  either does or doesn't want.  We live in interesting times, do we not?

Start time: 1085.00
End time: 1094.96
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I mean, this whole Muslim database thing was a strange story this week because, you  know, they're getting these tech companies are getting cheered for vowing not to do it.

Start time: 1095.56
End time: 1096.67
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  When no one's asked them to.

Start time: 1097.90
End time: 1114.51
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  No one's asked them to.  And they didn't start falling in line until I forget what the I think it was Twitter or  maybe only one company, major company came out and said, like, flat out, no, we're not  doing this when asked, I believe.  Well, remember, Gina Rometty of IBM wrote a open letter to President-elect Trump a couple

Start time: 1117.34
End time: 1203.66
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  of weeks ago pledging her support, the support of IBM.  And of course, people immediately pointed out the IBM had made a database for the Nazis.  And so there was some clamor over that.  And then who was it?  Was it Safra Katz?  Was it Oracle that promised to do anything that the Trump administration wanted?  So I think some of this is in response to that.  NeverAgain.tech, we the undersigned employees of tech organizations and companies, engineers,  business executives, designers, we commit to refuse to participate in the creation of  databases.  600 people have signed.  It's quite a few, including, you know, most of the big companies at that table.  But it's almost I mean, good.  I mean, right on.  Don't.  You shouldn't do that.  Clearly, that's a bad idea.  And it's a pledge anybody can get behind.  It feels like right now there's a lot of confusion and wheel spinning.  And I wonder if that I wonder what these tech executives sitting at this table really think.  What they don't wouldn't it be reasonable as in most cases, CEOs of publicly held publicly  traded companies that they look to find any advantage that they can for their business.  And if you're talking to the future president of the United States, that's where you go  to lobby for the stuff that's good for your business.

Start time: 1204.72
End time: 1282.29
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  I know you're absolutely right on that.  But there's two tracks here.  There's the pure bottom line track.  And then there's the morals track, the vision track.  CEOs believe that their companies aren't just money machines, but they're doing things that  are good for the world.  And in two major areas, the Trump administration is clearly diverging from core values of these  companies in the good for the world category.  One is diversity, which a lot of these companies, even though their employment rules may not  reflect it, they certainly like to talk about how they're going to do better in achieving  diversity among their ranks.  And the second is climate change and companies like Google and Facebook, even though they're  software companies, they work very hard to prove their data centers are green and climate  change is something they really believe in.  Apple has a head of environment.  It used to be head of the EPA.  I doubt she's going to quit and join the Trump administration.  So I think there's this tension there, whereas on one hand, it might be good for their bottom  line.  They didn't vote for the guy and they don't like this guy.

Start time: 1284.56
End time: 1382.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I have to point out that at least in diversity, it's more about public relations and actually  really doing anything.  I do think that companies are doing a lot about climate change.  Google announced this year that they're going to be 100% solar powered by 2017 for everything.  Their network centers, their business operations, their office operations, 100% solar.  So I think that they're serious about that, but somewhat it seems to be about optics more  than anything else.  If Twitter is worried about it, we better put out an open letter.  All right, enough.  We don't want to do too much politics.  That's a big tech story.  We're all there and I don't know what to say about it.  I thought it was interesting.  Elon Musk has now added tunnel drilling on Twitter as one of the things he's interested  in after tweeting that he hated traffic so much he wanted to drill a tunnel to drive  to work.  An underground hyperloop.  Well what's interesting is when the tunnel become immediately exactly as congested as  anything else.  Elon Musk's new bio says, Tesla, SpaceX, tunnels.  Yes, tunnels.  And he wants to call it the boring company.  Traffic is driving me nuts.  I'm going to build a tunnel boring machine and just start digging.  His most recent tweet, I'm actually going to do this.  I thought at first this was the fake Elon Musk.  This is the real Elon Musk.

But I know that I kind of dated, you know, there was a, at one point, Microsoft did this  thing of a hood canal, which is Bill Gates' little vacation complex and his family.  And they pulled together some of the reporters of that era to, you know, to go and have a  pajama party with Steve, Steve Ballmer and Bill.  And wait a minute, wait a minute.

And, you know, we spent two days, that's for two years in a row, talking to Steve and Bill.  They gave us a download on the company and, you know, really went deep.  And, you know, then we would peel off.  Bill's family usually vacations there.  So, you know, a guy slept in one of Bill's sister's rooms there.  So Markov and I were the last working reporters left from that trip.  And now he's going to still be working.  He's going to be a historian for the Computer History Museum.  I saw that.

Transcript:  They didn't sell enough watches.  Basically, they were not profitable.  And when you're not making money, bad things happen.  Can you outspend the money you have?  They started out...  It was a fascinating story.  I met them when they were at Y Combinator in 2011.  And they were the only hardware startup, I think, in the bunch.  And they were probably the lowest funded company in that whole bunch.  And then they came out of it.  And since they didn't have much funding, they decided to do a Kickstarter for their first  product, the first watch.  Brilliant.

Start time: 1839.18
End time: 1839.79
Speaker: SPEAKER_08
Transcript:  They did great.

Start time: 1840.16
End time: 1893.11
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  And for a couple of years, they were going well.  And then last year, they had a bad second half, didn't make the numbers and never were  profitable again.  And early this year, they laid people off.  Steve was able to nail down something that I didn't get on the record, which was they  almost got bought by a company.  And this year, they tried to make it and they could not.  They had a couple of interesting new products that they did a Kickstarter on because they  couldn't get funding to do it the normal way.  And as the year went on, it became clear that there was no exit.  They went through some wacky ideas they explored, weird private equity companies and even an  idea that they would cut down to like 10 people and see if they can keep going.  But the only exit turned out to be a sale and it turned out to be Fitbit.

Start time: 1894.85
End time: 1903.63
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yes, Steve.  So tell me about that because I think people were surprised to see that they had at one  point an offer of what was it?  Seventy-four million dollars?

Start time: 1904.38
End time: 1939.48
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  That wasn't true.  So that was not true.  OK.  That was not true.  I spent a week trying to dig into that.  And, you know, it seemed really funny that someone told TechCrunch that there was a  seven hundred forty million dollar offer on the table from Citizen, the Japanese watchmaker.  That just didn't make sense.  You look at Citizen's market cap, it's not that much.  You know, that's that's almost half of Citizen's market cap.  So why would they spend that on?  So I heard that that was someone disgruntled, like literally lying to the press.

Start time: 1940.30
End time: 1941.58
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Why did they stop at seventy-four?

Start time: 1941.80
End time: 1962.28
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Although that's kind of seven.  No, seven hundred forty million.  Seven hundred forty.  Oh, so I mean, that's just insane.  And so, you know, at first it sounded like, oh, man, how could they turn down that acquisition?  You know, that that would have been such a nice exit for them.  They would have had this cushion of, you know, a traditional watchmaker, which we've seen,  you know, like fossil bio, you know, smartwatch.

Start time: 1962.46
End time: 1969.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It almost makes sense because the traditional watchmakers, don't they want to find new markets?  And I mean, watch sales have to be down overall.

Start time: 1970.55
End time: 2017.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Right.  But it turns out that's not what happened.  So the Citizen thing was there was actually a collaboration between the two companies.  Pebble paid Citizen about fifty grand to help them design the Round, which is that circular  watch that launched, I don't know, like a year ago or so.  It turned out they ended up not using Citizen's design.  Citizen submitted like ten designs.  Pebble found them a little too thick and chunky.  They were really looking for something slimmer and they went internally with their own design.  And literally that, you know, was the end of the relationship with Citizen.  There was no offer.  There was no acquisition talks.  Maybe internally Citizen discussed it or something, but there's certainly no nothing formal and  there definitely wasn't anything for seven hundred forty million.

Start time: 2017.28
End time: 2024.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Thank you for doing the legwork and debunking that, because I think it made it really made  the rounds.  Everybody kind of repeated.  I repeated that number.

Start time: 2024.79
End time: 2098.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah.  And then it became this thing like, oh, what a fool.  And it made Eric Majakovsky, the CEO, look like an idiot for and which he's not.  So the real acquisition that fell through was the Intel one in late spring ish of this  year.  And that was for approximately 70 million.  There's a little debate internally at the company why that fell through until ultimately  withdrew and the offer was higher than 70 million.  Then they went down to 70 million.  So it's unclear who exactly said no.  Some people think Eric was trying to get more than 70.  Some people say no.  It's just it's kind of a he said she said situation.  But once that deal fell through, you know, they everyone at the company knew things were  on the way out.  They were in the employees were even offered a chance saying, hey, we know things look  bad.  You guys can leave now.  We'll give you a severance package.  Or if you guys want to stay on and try to see this thing through to the end, we'll double  your shares in the company.  And some people left, but a lot of people did stay on and hoping those new products  like the core and the time to kind of reinvigorate interest in the company.  But ultimately, that just didn't happen.

Start time: 2099.18
End time: 2106.55
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  The core was kind of interesting.  The idea was you have Amazon Echo kind of built into a little worry.  Yeah.  In your pocket.

Start time: 2107.46
End time: 2111.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I wish that thing actually a lot of people wish that they're going to refund

Start time: 2111.28
End time: 2127.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  your money.  Yeah.  But what's what's I think one of the reasons is an interesting story.  And people assume that Pebble was doing better than they were is that they did such a good  job of raising money on Kickstarter with three separate campaigns, raising many millions  of dollars.  They were the first kind of breakout Kickstarter campaign.

Start time: 2129.22
End time: 2164.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  But when you look at that money, even if it's like 12 million dollars was the latest one,  really to be successful, you know, they have to sell through their channels, Best Buy and  other places like that.  So you you really get your table money, table stakes from starting on there and getting  some money in advance.  But the real money comes when you really build out the channels to many millions of people.  I think they had twenty four thousand buyers for the Pebble Corps.  And that's a product that if it's successful, would have had a million buyers.

Start time: 2165.18
End time: 2176.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah.  I think maybe in some ways that's that's the problem with being a success on Kickstarter.  It seems like a lot and it's really not.  It's it's a preorder.  It's a preorder.  Yeah.

Start time: 2177.70
End time: 2196.94
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah.  Well, I think that from an emotional standpoint, people are sad to see Pebble go.  It was one of the first smartwatches that were hitting the ground running.  And I think that everyone that I know have everyone, all of my tech friends have a Pebble.  And so it's really sad.  But in the end, it's survival of the fittest.  And, you know, they just couldn't keep their momentum going with that.

Start time: 2197.28
End time: 2226.38
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, and here's the real question.  You know, people combine this with the announcement by Motorola, they're not going to work on  any more 360 Android Wear watches for at least for the time being.  And and and looked at sales of the Apple Watch, whether you believe IDC or you believe Tim  Cook, they they they maybe don't look like a significant amount.  And Fitbit is is the only one that seems to be doing well in the market.  And it's mostly selling low end, inexpensive pedometer style fitness devices.

Start time: 2226.88
End time: 2302.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Right. And its stock is way down.  I mean, it's not doing that well.  Is there is this category dead?  So when I when I when I talked to Eric and he was nice enough to sit down with me because  mainly I like really like the company.  I've been following them pretty closely over the last couple of years.  We even had a series that we called Adventures of Pebble where every, you know, a couple  of times a year I would check in when they had something new and we'd write about it  early. And he told me that his big mistake, he thought, was not seeing early on that it  really was all about fitness for these things, that that was the number one thing that people  wanted to do with these wrist wearables.  They wouldn't even call it a watch.  And the last group of products had increased fitness features.  They had a heartbeat monitor.  They all had GPS that worked offline.  So he was hoping that that would align them for what people are using it.  But in general, the transition from watch to smartwatch has not been gangbusters.  And, you know, Apple's professors to be happy with what they're doing.  But if you look at what they've done, they've doubled down on fitness and they don't talk  about it as a fashion item anymore.

Start time: 2303.22
End time: 2306.70
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Right. They eliminated the gold, a very expensive gold one.

Start time: 2307.86
End time: 2315.07
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, your gold watch now is now obsolete, which you could probably know if you gave  it about 10 minutes thought before you sprung $24,000 for it.

Start time: 2316.68
End time: 2320.12
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Well, I guess anybody with that kind of money to spend probably didn't care.

Start time: 2320.36
End time: 2385.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They weren't really caring whether their watch was going to be obsolete enough.  If you can shell out that much money for a smartwatch of the first gen, then you can  probably afford to get another one when they want.  I think that the problem when people talk about our wearables dead because of the prices,  like the thing with it is you cannot compare them the same to a laptop or a phone.  Odds are if you're going to get a smartwatch, you're going to buy one.  And that's going to be good for many years.  You're not going to be upgrading it every single year.  So if they did sell over 12 million year one, that's a lot of wearable smartwatches  that Apple has sold.  And then you're not going to upgrade it.  So this is something that you have and it's good and you're still using it.  So most of the people that were really interested and wanted to get on board right away have  already bought one and they're probably not going to be upgrading for three or four years.  And so only then will we be able to see.  I think that when watches become more autonomous and you're able to use them without your  phone, that's when we're going to see a huge spring in wearables because Fitbit is always  going to take the low end market for something that's going to be cheap, easy and just deal  with fitness. Whereas Apple is going to take that high end market where you're going to  be able to replace it eventually for your phone.

Start time: 2386.52
End time: 2389.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Steve, you wrote a couple of weeks ago, wearables are dead.

Start time: 2390.50
End time: 2459.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, I totally disagree with that.  I mean, people they were pitching this thing and all smartwatches as a new kind of computing  platform. I mean, from the very beginning, the smart the Apple watch was pitched as it  decreases your reliance on the phone and you're going to be able to do just about everything  on your wrist versus on your phone.  But that just doesn't make sense.  I mean, you look at so many of the original applications for this Apple watch were just  like shrunken down versions of what you see on your smartphone.  Like no one wants to squint down on Instagram photos.  Unusable, unusable shrunken down versions.  Slow, slowness aside, let's pretend it was super fast.  OK, you don't want to squint at Instagrams or tweets or headlines from New York Times on  your wrist. Plus the inscrutable UI.  Yeah, and they fix that.  A lot of that's been fixed now.  The UI issues, I mean, it's better, but it's better as a passive device, as a fitness  tracker, heartbeat heart rate monitor, maybe notifications and of course, time.  But then again, do you really need to spend between three and five hundred bucks for

Start time: 2459.94
End time: 2485.16
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  that? No, it's not just by the way, it's not just fitness because it's really casual  fitness, because if you're a runner, a serious fitness buff, you're going to get a serious  runner's watch and it's not going to be one of these.  It's going to be from Garmin or Polar.  It's going to be a much more serious device.  And I don't think these these middle ground devices really aid into that market  particularly. So it's it's for casual fitness users.  That's a fairly small market.

Start time: 2485.56
End time: 2517.13
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, Apple wants to get it.  I mean, they really took a lot of care to make sure you could swim with a watch, which  is not the first thing I want to do when I buy a watch.  But but they have this amazing thing.  And it's like like shows how an apple wants to be fanatical about something.  It does it is one of the big features of the watch is that you can swim in it.  And then, you know, when you turn that part on, you know, can spit the water out.  Yeah. Yeah. Which is kind of amazing.  Right. Amazing.

Start time: 2518.08
End time: 2522.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Slightly ineffective, but amazing.  It's amazing. But it's not three hundred fifty dollars.

Start time: 2522.46
End time: 2524.01
Speaker: SPEAKER_05
Transcript:  Amazing. It's like over the top.

Start time: 2525.18
End time: 2593.83
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Right. Yeah. I think that what we're missing is that it's not just for health.  But I think that one of the biggest features for the Apple Watch that's often  overlooked is for safety.  I think that the SOS safe feature, especially if you're dealing with someone  that you don't know if they might fall down or get hurt and be able to is  absolutely amazing. You're saving forty dollars a month just in that.  So it saves you money if you were going to plan on buying your parent  something that's going to be able to track them and they're going to be able  to call out for safety for that.  And so the SOS feature in itself is going to save you money within year one.  And so that's why I think that it's going to be one of these devices that,  yeah, it's new, it's out there getting their grounding.  Definitely, Steve, I think that you're absolutely right.  I think that there's a certain amount of expectational debt for people that  thought that this would replace your phone.  No, I think that anyone that would have thought that, though,  wasn't really thinking about the small interface and the way that they could use it.  And they're going to be able to have to get their feet grip to be able to see  what exactly how do we use our watch and what will be useful versus not.  I think the scribble feature has made messaging so much easier and the  dictation is much better than it was before.  But it's again, this is this is a first gen product, so you can only expect  so much to it now, second gen.

Start time: 2595.42
End time: 2667.21
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  It's interesting that Apple Apple's strategy here has been to find  a hundred different little things like that emergency button, like swimming,  the breathe app, the breathe app, which are all niches.  And it almost feels like they're trying to cobble together enough niche products  to make one whole product.  And I think the fundamental problem with the Pebble, with the Apple watch,  with Android Wear watches is face it, you don't really need it.  And I wonder if we're entering it.  It's not that we're maybe are we in economic hard times?  I can't I never know.  It seems like we are. We aren't.  I don't know. The job numbers are good.  But Donald Trump says everything's crap.  So somewhere there's some I don't know what's going on.  But I feel like when you are in hard times, or if at least people  psychologically are reluctant to spend discretionary money,  that a watch is the easy thing to say, well, I'm not going to buy that.  That's the one where you can say, yeah, I don't think I'll spend money on that.  Apple's managed to stay alive in this market,  but it feels like they're hanging on by their fingernails.  And when you see Pebble and Motorola  and ultimately even Fitbit struggling.  And Google. And Google.  I mean, they make the average.

Start time: 2667.90
End time: 2674.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah. What's going on there?  It's they delayed it and their partners are just kind of abandoning the platform.  Nobody needs it.

Start time: 2675.12
End time: 2693.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah. And of course, if anybody's going to sell something, nobody needs.  Apple's probably the best person to do it  because they're just brilliant marketers.  They're brilliant at creating an aura and a mystique around it.  But that's not going to be enough in the long run to save the category.  So I you know what?  I'm going to have to rule in your favor, Steve Kovac.

Start time: 2694.22
End time: 2702.88
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I think I guess I guess we'll see in two years.  I said I said back for two years to find out is the Apple watch still alive?  I own an edition. My vote is it will be.

Start time: 2703.50
End time: 2756.09
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I own an edition.  You know, it's interesting. I was in Vegas.  Yeah, there you go, George is.  I was in Vegas and a lot of people in Vegas,  a lot of Chinese people in Vegas were wearing Apple watches.  So I think this is where Apple's so good at.  As Apple's become, I think, a fashion brand.  And so when you're selling a fashion product,  status and look and that becomes more important than functionality.  So in in the rest of the world, where when it comes to spending  an extra 350 bucks, you can easily forego buying the fitness watch or the smart watch.  You're going to that that business is going to die.  That business is going to tank.  And Apple's unfortunately, Apple doesn't release numbers.  So we don't you know, Apple could say it's the best we had the as Tim Cook did.  The best weekend we've ever had for the Apple watch is meaningless.  That means what they sold a few.  I don't know what that means.

Start time: 2756.76
End time: 2761.96

I noticed when other people are watching and wearing an Apple watch,  it also shows their level of technology that they enjoy, which, you know,  I like. But I don't know.  I think that for fashion in and of itself, I think that the watch kind of ends up a little bit short.

Transcript:  Ben Thompson, a strategic had a good article last month on niche strategies.  But that was awesome. Yeah.  Like things like the surface studio, which I'm using right now, the Nintendo switch.  These are he even says the PC market in general is a is a is in some respects a niche  product. He says for most people,  particularly outside the US, a smartphone is all they need or care to buy.  The world today is the exact opposite of the world a mere decade ago,  where we bought dedicated devices to plug into our digital hub PCs.  The smartphone and cloud is now the hub. Everything else is optional.  And I think that that's kind of what we're what we're seeing.  It's too bad, though, I think Pebble, you know, Pebble was a nice story.  What's going to happen?  Fitbit is going to acquire them.  Will they keep many of the employees or they're going to go?  What's what's going to happen to what's left of Pebble?

Transcript:  Yeah, the question is, I guess, how much of the Pebble iOS  morphs into what will be the Fitbit iOS?  Eric indicated to me that  one thing he tried to do in that deal was to give some sort of bridge for developers.  So the work that they would they have done on Pebble  might still live on in some way.  And they'd be able to write in the future to the platform that takes over  some of the ideas, if not the code, of the Pebble iOS.

Transcript:  He's going to look for his next thing.  For sure. Yeah.  Yeah, I hope so.  Let's take a break when we come back.  I want to talk about Magic Leap and what's going on there.  I'm I'm curious what you all think, because I'm not sure what to think.  I mean, on the one hand, it looks like it might be the next Theranos.  On the other hand, maybe it's just a hard thing to solve.  I bet Stephen Levy has some thoughts on that.  First, though, a word from Squarespace.  That's where I make my website, my home on the web.  And I think a lot of you are already.  But if you're not, if you're looking for somewhere,  let me tell you, Squarespace is the simplest, the best way to create a beautiful website,  whether you're a designer.  And of course, if you're a designer, aesthetics are paramount.  A photographer, you got to have aesthetics and functionality, right?  A filmmaker, a writer, a musician, a freelancer, a blogger.  If you sell online for all of you, Squarespace is the place to make your next website.  It's the best hosting tied with the best software.  It's a great content management system.  You start with the Squarespace templates, beautifully designed and beautifully engineered.  You see the design, but under the hood, incredible engineering  that gives every Squarespace site the modern features that you need on your website.  Things like mobile responsive design.  So one site fits any size screen.  In this day and age, that's what you need.  You don't need a separate mobile site.  You need a site that looks good no matter what size screen your visitors are using.  And every site has e-commerce built in.  And I venture to say it's the only web hosting,  web software that gives you e-commerce that looks every bit as good as your site,  because it is. It's the same design, the same template.  It's not some afterthought hanging off your site.  It is your site and all of the features.  They have an amazing commerce platform.  You'll definitely want to check that out.  Squarespace is also very fast, reliable, hosting with an amazing uptime record.  You just, you cannot bring a Squarespace site down.  You get a free custom domain name with an annual purchase.  By the way, they do now sell domain names with over 200 top level domains.  So you can get your domain name right from Squarespace.  One of the advantages of that is you'll get a, if you're not ready to design the site yet,  when you buy the domain at Squarespace,  you get a beautiful parking page with Squarespace's style and template.  So it doesn't look like it's one of those janky parking pages  that those other guys offer you. It really looks nice.  Squarespace members who have built or contributed three more active websites,  and by the way, that's a lot of them,  because once you do it once, you want to do it again and again.  There's even a lot of people who've made a living designing and selling Squarespace sites.  You'll get access to Squarespace Circle.  Circle membership includes advanced guides, optimized support,  six month trial periods for new projects and more.  But all of you can try it for free regardless.  Just go to squarespace.com, click the get started button and play with it.  You'll see how it's great.  They've got a new magazine style templates with grid style landing pages,  infinite scroll related posts, the author profile, the integrated search field.  I'm a big fan.  It's where I host my sites, where we host our inside Twitter site.  You're going to like it. Squarespace.com.

I wear it a lot, but it is a little thick and clunky and big.  And I don't. The thing about it, it has that trait where if you leave it behind,  you don't go, oh, I, oh, I got to go back and get it.  It you can live without it.

Transcript:  Definitely, definitely at the beginning, because it's just not a device  that can work on its own as of yet.  But that's the beginning of it, right.  And eventually, that's what it's going to end up being, is a device that you can use  on the run when you want to be able to travel light.  It's never going to be able to replace a laptop or your phone.  And if you're expecting that, I think that you'll be very sorely upset.  But it will be something that eventually you're going to be able to use  and go out when you're running or, you know, dealing with something or exercising  or what, and you don't have to carry your phone with you because everyone hates  having to carry their phone in their pocket or in their purse.  They're heavy, they're large, they're clunky.  You end up with that bonus of the real estate.  But then you end up with that weight and carrying in that that extra luggage  that you may not want.  And in the end, all of our smart devices are going to be something that's small  and easy and wearable.  It's just we haven't gotten the math right yet.  And of course, that's going to take us.  That's why we needed the Pebble core.  I know. Oh, I'm sorry. Yeah, I hear you.  I know. I hear you. I hear that sadness for it.  It's just it's one.  I feel sad, too, about losing Pebble, just because I think that we need to have  that, you know, a whole bunch of people in the ecosphere  so that they're going to be able to, you know, that competition and new ideas  and be able to do things.  So, you know, it's sad when we lose a great company  that made all kinds of different innovations.

And he was nice enough to spend time with me and talk about it.  I think he was upset for his employees more than himself.  He's he's he'll have a soft landing.  He's always not walking away like a rich person.  There have been a lot of exits in Silicon Valley where companies didn't do well.  And the executives walked away, you know, super rich, right?  And, you know, they managed to take money off by Ferraris or whatever.  So he never took money off the table on any of that.  I can't speak to what he did or didn't take off.  But I know that driving a Ferrari, he's not driving a Ferrari.  He's not living in a palace.  But if I were starting a hardware company and I could hire him, I certainly would.

I was thinking about Joshua Topolski, who's doing kind of something a little swimming upstream.  He's just launched his new site, the outline dot com.  And kind of I mean, content aside, I'm not really sure where he's going with the content,  but it's a it's an interesting design, really targeting mobile, I think,  with a lot of scrolling sideways and up and down scrolling and  animated graphics.  And have you guys played with it?  Well, I was curious what you thought of it.

I mean, we saw this, you know, when they're experimenting in the early days of the verge,  trying to, you know, stuff like a lot of like layout and responsive designs and so forth  onto the Web. And it just doesn't always make sense on the Web.  I just want to be able to read it.  Well, I was clearly I wonder.

Transcript:  And maybe, Steven, you could talk to this about the idea of creating a site these days.  I mean, it seems to me nobody goes to a site anymore to read stuff.  They get to an article from Facebook or Twitter or Friends or whatever via links.  And my initial thought was that one of the things Josh was trying to do here is is make it sticky,  that once you get to the site, you kind of because of the interesting design are kind of  encouraged to browse around a little bit.  What's your experience with back channel?  Do people enter at the front door?

Transcript:  Increasingly, when we started, you know, they didn't do it.  And when we started, actually, you couldn't even go to backchannel.com, medium.com slash backchannel.  Eventually, we did manage to medium changed its policy and did domains when they decided to emphasize  publications more. And then we did manage to get backchannel.com.  So we're starting to see some.  But one reason why I went to start on medium is that I felt it was going to be super tough just to  start something on its own without some sort of traffic funnel.  And that dovetailed with Ev Williams theory that there's going to be just a very few platforms,  whether it's Twitter or Facebook and something else.  And people aren't going to hopscotch from one place to another that you're going to get your  attention from platforms.  And the medium would be one of those platforms.  So right now we've got about 150,000 followers just on medium.  Right. So that's the slice of the world, which is signed in the medium.  150,000 of those people are signed in.  And then when they open their medium app, they could see, oh, there's a story on backchannel  you haven't read.  And they get a daily email saying, you know, here's what you missed in backchannel.  So we can get a really good chunk of our traffic, a baseline from that, in addition to people  coming through recommendations in Facebook or Twitter or Hacker News or whatever.

But I think that sometimes different is not always better.  I think that most people go, they want to surf the internet to de-stress to get news.  But in a way that's really calming and I don't feel comfortable with a site that kind of  gives me a sensory overload feeling that it's almost screaming at me.  And I think that that's where it fails.  A little bit too much is sometimes a bad thing.

The art director was talking about how they had this deal with this Italian press to print  it on high quality paper.  And they did all these exotic neon inks.  The first run came off the test and they said, that's not intense enough.  And they made them for more ink, more ink, more ink, more cowbell.  And they wanted it until it went beyond the machines, the printing press's capability  to do it without smearing.  They got it to the point of smearing and dialed it back a bit.  And of course you couldn't read it for love or money.

I know you're not responsible for driving traffic and everything.  But I'm wondering, do they see it?  I look at BuzzFeed and Vice.  BuzzFeed said, we don't think there is even a home page will even exist anymore at some point.  They believe that their primary platform is Facebook.

Start time: 3772.56
End time: 3862.92
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  We have a lot of distribution channels, but we're talking about this and I just took a  peek at our Chartbeat.  Almost always without fail, the top page being read on Business Insider is the main page.  So thousands of people at a time are literally typing in businessinsider.com and seeing what  the latest is.  A lot of that is a testament to we take great pains to make sure there's always something  fresh and new every time you load the home page.  You can just always come to businessinsider.com and get a snapshot of what's going on in tech  and finance and business and now, of course, politics.  Facebook is a huge driver for us.  Increasingly, Google, because of AMP on mobile, is a big deal for us now.  Twitter is negligible.  Wow, really interesting.  I don't think any publisher would say they get a lot of traffic from Twitter, even BuzzFeed  and all those guys.  Then, of course, it's a mix.  We try to be as many places as we can and be platform agnostic.  Our goal is to have people enjoy the content where they are.  Whether that's Facebook instant articles or clicking through from Facebook,  or I think we've built such a really powerful home page.  Especially during repeat times, it's not unusual to have a couple thousand people just  typing in businessinsider.com.

Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  It's kind of interesting.  So they have this dilemma that these phony stories were getting circulation.  When you see them on Facebook, of course, something created in a Macedonian coffee  house looks just as legitimate as the story from the New York Times or Backchannel or  Business Insider or wherever.  Some people, I guess, are affected by it, will buy this stuff.  Whether they do or not, that's the perception, and Facebook had to answer for it.  But Facebook does not want to be in a position of being the arbiter of what truth is or what  a legitimate publication is.  So they basically outsource this problem to these fact-checking organizations who are  happy to take it on for free because that's part of their mission.  I think their profile will be elevated if they do this.  So there's this little system where now the people can report things if they think it's  fake news.  Facebook will algorithmically try to identify some of the stuff.  And then if it passes the test, it'll get sent on to these places like Snopes or Fortifact.

Start time: 3999.38
End time: 4021.22
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You had to go deep.  So that's the current one.  But right now it comes up on the first menu.  And then if you type it's a fake news story, they'll ask you whether you want to alert  the person who posted it or whether you want to report it as a fake news story, in which  case it'll be registered as that.  And if enough people register it and it passes...  Are there humans involved?

Start time: 4021.34
End time: 4022.74

Start time: 4024.34
End time: 4092.08
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  You know, it's generally an algorithmic identification there.  I get concerned either way.  So along the line there could be people involved, but maybe that's the last step there.  Some people were wondering whether you could do a denial of service attack on these...  Exactly.  ...facts of the news by just clicking.  But I don't think you can.  I don't think you can click on a story from the New York Times if you're part of some  sort of anti-New York Times movement and then make PolitiFact check the New York Times.  The algorithm will look at the publication that originated and they'll see how old this  is publication, this is publication of followers, how much the traffic is publication.  And it'll be able to eliminate the New York Times.  I'm pretty sure that the way it's set up, even though Facebook says it's not possible,  but I don't think any of the New York Times stories or Washington Post are going to get  sent off to the fake news fact checkers.  It'll be interesting to see whether any Breitbart stories eventually pass that test there.

Start time: 4105.90
End time: 4173.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that you're right.  I think that it's difficult who says what is true and what isn't.  There's definitely a slippery slope that we deal with.  But the reason that fake news is such an issue is that we're naturally mimicked.  So we see a news story.  One is most people don't even read the news story.  We just read the title to whatever it is.  We share before reading.  If we see something, yeah.  And so if we see something over and over again, eventually, unconsciously,  we will believe that it's true.  And I think that a lot of us like to think that we are above that and that we're very  critical thinkers.  But when we run through a decompression mode, we're just kind of passively absorbing things.  And that's why advertising works so well.  And it's a billion-dollar industry.  And so the good part about what Facebook is doing is it just alerts you to say,  think twice about this.  So right away, we're going to look slightly more critical, especially when we're  just kind of surfing the net passively.  And so I think that that's a good part to that.  But I think that it goes even further because many of us will think that  we are beyond having to really look at things critically because we have a certain amount of  technology or we're so educated.  And that's when we're more easily swayed is when we don't think that this could be an  issue in the first place.

You know, the things done, you know, with no attempt.  Stuff Snopes would debunk.  Yeah, well, but Snopes also debunks things that, you know, they might debunk the $740 million.  That's true.  That's not a hoax.  But at this point, Facebook is saying we're going after the bottom of the barrel,  intentionally misleading hoaxes, right?  You know, from like places that even pretend to be kind of news organizations that they're not there.  So at this point, you can pretty much know it when you see it, what they're talking about.  Though I don't think that solves the larger problem of truth.  So I think there's places you can look at.  I'm going to use some right wing places, so maybe people will be unhappy with me.  But, you know, Breitbart and Fox sometimes will do things that have been debunked before  they publish it, before they go with it, you know, particularly about climate change.  And, you know, they'll, you know, stack the deck and write things that they maybe know aren't even true.  And that's another level of what some people are calling fake news, or certainly things that  people don't want to see on their news feed.

It's a red square with a triangle and an exclamation mark disputed by third party  fact checkers.  Then learn why this is disputed.  I guess that's fair.  I mean, they're not blocking it, right?

Transcript:  I don't think this is going to change anything, though, because I think  chiefly people share fake news not because they want it to be true or they believe it to be true,  but because it reflects a worldview they believe.  And it's like it's a nod.  It's a pat in the back.  So it has nothing to do really with the content of the story.  In my opinion, it's more a cultural thing, which of course this doesn't hurt, I guess.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, well, I think that where it becomes important is that how does  fear based or insightful news work on our brain?  So when you read something and it makes you feel an emotion of fear or worry and you feel  protectionistic, you're activating your limbic system, which is like that middle reptilian  part of your brain.  And the problem with the reptilian system is it's highly emotional, but it's not really  connected to your analytical cognitive center of your brain.  And so it almost like goes into a belief system that is past analytical thought.  And that's where fears and phobias come in.  You might be scared of the dark, but know that nothing bad is going to happen in the dark.  Yet you still have this irrational fear towards it.  So news stories that say, you know, this person is dangerous or this type of media is going  to melt your children's brains without having that little tiny moniker of saying this might  not be true immediately.  It creates an emotional reaction that supersedes analytical thought.  And then we are a little bit more fearful of that or at least cautious to that.  You hear that enough.  It becomes belief because that part of your brain says, you know what, we might as well  be safe than sorry.  And that's why this is so important is that even the most rational of people, if you hear  something enough that I should be scared of this, you might start to be cautious.  And then with enough repetition, you might actually believe it.

Transcript:  And I think that that's a misunderstanding of why this stuff gets shared.  I think many of the people who share this stuff, it's not whether they believe it or  not.  It reflects a worldview that they believe.  I also worry about what about the worldview, usually a fear or protectionism or

Start time: 4487.18
End time: 4494.72
Speaker: SPEAKER_02

Transcript:  I think it's a good book to start telling you that.  And you poor little person, you're living out of your limbic system.  We gotta help you here.  That bothers the hell out of me.  The last person I want telling me what my beliefs are is Mark Zuckerberg.

Start time: 4510.78
End time: 4527.26
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  No, but you also have other people crowdsourced that maybe you should think twice about  something.  Isn't a bad thing.  Now I'm not saying that maybe Mark Zuckerberg should be the one that's doing it, but I  think that you would be greatly, you know, it makes it easier.

Start time: 4527.50
End time: 4538.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Crowdsourcing it is also fraught with peril.  And I worry about the Andy Borowitz at the New Yorker and the Onion because I think a  lot of satire is also fake news.

Start time: 4539.54
End time: 4645.36
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  So I disagree with that to a degree because, you know, should Facebook be doing this?  Should Mark Zuckerberg have to say of what's true and what's not true and what's a hoax  and what's not a hoax?  Of course they should.  Because they are a major distributor of information and news.  And with that comes an awesome responsibility to make sure people are getting accurate  information and not just, you know, it's dangerous as we learn with the pizza gate  thing.  It can be dangerous otherwise.  And it took them a long time or too long rather to kind of admit to themselves, wow,  we really do have this responsibility.  We really do have an effect on how people think and work and possibly an effect on  elections and so forth.  And it's the stuff that traditional media has done forever.  You know, us here as the journalists on this panel do it every single day.  Every single day we're vetting stories for truth, we're vetting stories for accuracy,  we're vetting stories for hoaxes and, you know, we're vetting Trump's tweets, whether  or not he's lying about millions of people illegally voting and you name it.  And, you know, there's always that discussion as Facebook, a media company, as Google, a  media company, whether they want to be or not, you know, as a distributor of news, there  is and a curator of news, you have a responsibility to make sure it's right.  And so what this fake news button or whatever you want to call it does is it kind of  deemphasizes it in the algorithm too.  So, you know, hopefully it doesn't go quite as viral on the platform.  And then it's also saying, hey, you know, we edit this, we try to vet this and it  might be fake. So, you know, take it with a big grain of salt.  So I think it's nice to see them, you know, at least attempting to take some responsibility  for all this media they're putting out there.

Start time: 4647.36
End time: 4732.74
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, I think that Google really is the, you know, the model for dealing with this.  And I find it interesting.  So I wrote a book about Google and running one about Facebook now.  And Facebook is undergoing a lot of the things that Google did when it realized that its  search engine had such power that their logical view of how it worked and how it was fair  really wasn't enough for people, you know, when they felt that it wasn't treating them  fairly here.  And in this case, people feel that there's consequences from the news feed circulating  the stories that, you know, don't fit the Facebook's engineering response, which would  be, well, it shouldn't feel you should basically know to take everything with  a grain of salt because it's just these people linking, right?  And, you know, and it isn't all determined by an editor.  And Facebook, of course, can't edit a billion stories a day.  It's a difference between Business Insider and the other places in Facebook is that, you know,  no human being can get all the stuff that goes through Facebook there.  So they're trying to find that balance on how to do things while not stifling the voices  and the desires of the people who are their customers who come to that newsfeed and spend  time there, which is what Facebook wants.

Start time: 4735.30
End time: 4780.53
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  I worry that we get out of this an impression that every story is either true or fake  and that we can tell the difference.  I mean, there are people in our chat room right now are saying,  and you believe what the CIA says about Russian hacking.  When do we start believing the CIA?  Who's going to determine whether that's fake news or not?  I just worry about algorithmic solutions.  And I have to point out, Stephen, that Google is as much responsible for this as Facebook is  even to this day, partly because of AdSense.  That's where these fake news sites get their revenue.  And partly because search results to this day continue to pull up all sorts of spurious stuff,  right?

Start time: 4781.27

Transcript:  Well, I mean, they haven't...  Google didn't solve it, did they?

Start time: 4786.94
End time: 4851.47
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, they didn't solve it, but there was a case.  The solution that Facebook has in this bottom of the barrel effort to get the bottom of the  barrel places is very similar to me than the one that Google used when it turned out that  if you typed in J-E-W in the search engine, Google didn't want to take down the site and block  the site that was this anti-Semitic Holocaust denier site that came up towards the top of  the results.  But instead, they automatically took out an ad that would appear whenever someone pulled  this up explaining why that site showed up and what kind of site it was there.  So in this case, Facebook, you can still even share something once it gets a scarlet letter,  but you get a warning saying, hey, you're sharing something like that.  You might like to share it, in which case then other people will also see the scarlet letter,  which is like sewn very tightly onto the link that you can't get rid of.  Wow.

End time: 4906.18
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I fully agree with you on that.  I think that just giving a little moniker to think about it is a minor inconvenience,  and it's not actually shutting down thought.  In the end, the only thing that really helps us against groupthink would be education in  learning how to critically think.  Right now, that's not happening enough in our school systems, and we're becoming almost  the worst.  We're kind of like just wanting to get little bites of information and having them be as  easily digestible as possible.  And so most people are just really reading the headline anyways.

Transcript:  Okay.  Tomorrow we're interviewing Tim Wu.  His new book is called The Attention Merchants.  In the book, he talks about the first fake news, which actually goes back to the first newspaper  in 1862, where there was a real newspaper war going on in New York.  Newspapers were expensive at first, didn't make a lot of money.  And a couple of publishers came along.  I don't remember the names.  I'll have it for you tomorrow because it's in the book.  I think it was The New York Sun.  I think it was Benjamin Day.  Benjamin Day, who said, well, first of all, we're going to charge a penny, which is a loss  at a loss, but we're going to make the money up in display ads.  And in order to boost circulation, made up a story about telescopes seeing the people on the moon  and describing the people who lived on the moon and the houses that they had.  And it was a sensation.  Soul papers like crazy.  Fake news is as old as mass media.  Literally.

Start time: 5036.22
End time: 5058.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  I would say it's even older because you can take a look at cave paintings of unicorns  of aliens coming down.  And if you take a look at the graffiti in Pompeii, which is a fascinating read,  it is all spreading of certain belief systems of different people  and anger towards the government.  And so I think that fake news is as old as humanity, really.

Start time: 5060.18
End time: 5100.44
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  And so ultimately, I fear that this is another witch hunt.  And it really is about censorship.  Censorship from the left is opposed to censorship from the right,  but censorship all the same.  And I really worry that that opens a bad precedent.  But I also think that there is a problem with fake news.  I think you're right that I think it does influence people.  So I don't know what the answer is.  I also wish that we didn't get so much of our news from Facebook,  but that's another problem entirely.  Where are you going to go, though?

But he does talk about Daniel Kahneman,  professor of psychology at Princeton,  who was the one who came up with this evidence that people who think they're smart,  smart people suggested that smart people are more vulnerable to thinking errors  because we think intelligence is a buffer against bias,  but it's actually a subtle curse.

So it's only appropriate that this week's big stories include  some of the largest tech grievances of the year.  First, for all you Galaxy Note 7 loyalists out there,  Samsung is pushing out an update on Monday, December 19th  that will prevent your recalled device from charging  and eliminate the ability for it to work as a mobile device.  Depending on your carrier,  that update might not be pushed out until the end of December  or early January.  But either way, it's time to bring it back to the store, my friends.  It's time.  According to Mac rumors,  Apple will begin selling their wireless AirPods in stores on Monday, December 19th,  just in time for the holidays,  if you've waited until the last minute to shop for the holidays.  And don't forget to use NORAD's Santa tracker this week  to track the old man on his way to delivering all the good stuff.  And speaking of holidays, TNT will be here all week,  and Jason Howell and I will cover all this news and a whole lot more every day  at 4 p.m. Pacific.  That's the week ahead.  Back to you, Leo.

NORAD and Google went their separate ways,  and Google now has its own Santa tracker that is not with NORAD.  So pick your pick.  Drama.  Drama.  Pick wisely.  Decide which Santa tracker.  I think the results are roughly the same, though.  Just want to point that out.  I'm going to ask you about those AirPods.  Shut up.  I'm not asking you, computer.  Stupid computer.  I'm going to ask you about those AirPods.  I thought that was me.  No.  Everyone's checking.  Windows just doesn't like to be ignored for too long.  Have you noticed that?

They're so boring.  Two dimensional when you could go high tech with GoToMeeting.  Now, what's great is it can be a stealth phone bridge.  So you could start a GoToMeeting.  It's easier than anything because you just click a link.  They have a plugin for Outlook.  You just send it sends an email out to your client or your colleague.  They click the link when the time comes.  If they don't have the software, it's installed automatically and quickly.  And they're there.  They're ready.  And you can be just talking to each other.  Just like a conference call.  But then you could slip this in.  You could sneak it in.  You could say, hey, I'd like to show you my PowerPoint presentation.  Would you mind?  And then boom, all of a sudden, he's seeing your screen.  You're sharing the PowerPoint.  You're showing the document.  You can collaborate on the document.  And then you could say, you know, I wonder how you're liking this.  Can I?  Would you mind?  Turn on your camera.  I'd like to see your reaction.  And I'll turn on mine.  And suddenly you've got crystal clear HD video.  And this is not just a conference call.  My friends.  This is an engaging, effective, efficient meeting.  Whether it's a sales demonstration, a presentation, a collaboration, an ad hoc meeting.  I know teams that stay on GoToMeeting most of the day because they're all over the world.  And that's how they stay in touch.  Nine out of 10 GoToMeeting users agree they close deals more than 20% faster.  And you can do it too right now free at gotomeeting.com.  Don't phone it in.

Verizon has decided, by the way, Megan had the story that on Monday your Note 7,  if you still have one, and apparently over 100,000 people in the United States  have not turned in their Note 7.  Samsung's sending out an update that will mean you can't use it unless it's plugged in.  Verizon said at first, no, we're not going to do that.  It's Christmas.  Everybody has the right to have a fire at Christmas.  Even CeeLo, right?  Did CeeLo's Note 7 blow up late?  Somebody was saying that.  Verizon was going to block that update.  Now they say, all right, all right, we'll do it.  Verizon's going to brick your Note 7 January 5th.  T-Mobile December 27th, AT&T January 5th sprint will be the one that keeps your Note 7 going  the longest, January 8th.

He's got it right up to his head.  This looks real to me, folks.  Well, wait a minute.  Now he's rolling closer to the camera.  That worries me.  Maybe that's it.  Oh my God!

He plays Christmas Carol music and then shows her the title cards.  So there have been a number of fakes.

So let's talk about what's going on at Google since we've got Steven Levy who knows everything.  He's got very good sources inside of Google.  One thing I'm hearing from a lot of Googlers and people who know Googlers is…  I'll put it bluntly, so to speak, that Larry Page and Sergey Brin are off kind of in space,  not paying that much attention, that Ruth Porat, the new CFO, is just cutting and slashing, hacking  and hewing and reorganizing Google on better financial basis.  Does that sound accurate to you?  Because we do see a lot of changes over there.

Start time: 5861.30
End time: 5868.97
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Well, there's a lot of changes.  You know, the alphabet thing.  I think the jury's still out.  I never was in love with it.  I think that…

Start time: 5871.39
End time: 5878.78
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Splitting Google up into one big hole in the alphabet with lots of little companies,  Google being its own company run by Sundar Pichai.  The bats, yeah.

Start time: 5879.00
End time: 5998.98
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Google is the alpha company and the rest of them are the bats.  It just changes the character of those companies.  It used to be that the whole was more than the sum of the parts.  Now parts all have to be accounted for there.  So they almost went in the direction there.  So something like Fiber, it had a mission before, which success was in terms of building  the number of people who can get the internet and then use Google.  Now that they're asking it to sort of be a business on its own, it isn't doing that great.  So that's a key example.  And then the other thing it was supposed to do was give the CEOs more autonomy and power.  And now we're seeing all these CEOs falling off because  maybe Google didn't like the way they used the power.  And they were ticking off people there.  So I don't think Larry is totally checked out from what I hear.  I think that in some ways he really likes the structure that he can zoom in  and pay attention to the things that he cares about.  But I think that Google itself has sort of recreated it.  The Google part of Google sort of recreated itself by taking on  aspects that used to be part of say X.  Now there's a research division within Google itself and the virtual reality is in Google itself.  So eventually will Google be spinning off companies of its own?  Will they become alphabet bets or will they be just part of an Uber Google there?  Because Sundar is doing such a good job.  Everyone thinks that he's killing it there.  So it's an interesting time for the company.  But meanwhile, look, the revenue and the business model still keeps everything afloat.

Transcript:  Google's a great engine, right?  I mean, there's no question about it.  They're going to spin off the self-driving car.  They've got a name for the company.  It's going to be called Waymo.  Apparently, the change here is that Google's not going to build their own.  They're doing a deal with Fiat Chrysler to make cars  and that the cars will probably have steering wheels.  Famously, they have to.  Say again, Steve?

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Maybe this is why Uber is rushing to get its Robo taxis out.  Maybe they see Chauffeur coming up behind them.  Also, let's see what else has changed in Google.  There's Calico, which is the anti-aging spin-off.  That one seems to be doing okay.  They have one and a half billion dollars in the bank,  according to Antonio Regalado writing for the MIT Technology Review.  I think it's interesting how they measure success for different bets.

Start time: 6098.52
End time: 6163.24
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Because obviously fiber they see as more of a shorter term.  They want to see something material in the shorter term,  whereas something like Calico, where they're literally trying to stop us from dying  or get us to living to age 400 or whatever.  They realize that's not going to happen tomorrow.  That's going to take years or decades of research and they might not even get there.  So it's kind of interesting.  Calico is not making any money, but their mission is way out there.  That's pretty interesting too.  I want to hear what Stephen has to say about this.  What are Larry and Sergey focused on out of all these other bets?  What's your impression of the company?  I think it's interesting because it's a very interesting company.  I think it's interesting because it's a very interesting company.  Are they more into things like sidewalk labs?  Are they more into these crazy other bets like curing death?  What's your impression Stephen?

Start time: 6165.34
End time: 6221.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Sergey spends most of his time at X.  The moonshot.  I think Larry, from what I hear, is also super interested in that.  I know he watches things like sidewalk.  Calico is interesting because like life sciences, which does have some revenue stream,  what Calico possibly could do is if some of the scientists make one breakthrough,  maybe it won't make us live to a thousand years old, but could make us look better  for ten more years as we get older because it's all about stopping aging.  That's like a multi-billion dollar drug.  Just the prospect of one of those things could wind up being a pretty hefty revenue stream.

Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  It's one of those areas where time is one of those things that we can't stop.  It comes for all of us.  So yes, the same thing with aging or just looking better.  Though it's funny that you said that because the naked knoll rat is probably one of the  least attractive of creatures on the planet.  They're in contention for it.  But they also have cancer resistant properties and they're also impervious to certain types of  pain.  So it's not even just that, it's also quality of life that they can improve upon.

Actually, I think this is a good idea.  And boy, it's good for Amazon because it'll introduce people, a lot of people, to the Echo  who probably have never tried it before.

Transcript:  Okay, I guess that's true.  In fact, Evernote got in a little bit of hot water this week because  they announced a new privacy policy.  Something that had always been true that Evernote employees could look at your notes  and might from time to time that really upset people.  So they took it back out of the privacy policy without changing the ultimate fact that of  course they still can at any time look at your notes because they're storing them.  That's called cloud.  Oh, we didn't mention the Yahoo hack.  Actually, I want to before we get to that, I do want to since we were talking about Google,  talk about something Google has a big investment in.  But of late, there may be people saying that the emperor has new clothes.  And I'm talking about Magic Leap.  Have any of you gone to see the Magic Leap demo?  I wish.  Yeah.  I mean, Kevin Kelly did a whole story on it in Wired and talked a lot about it and how  amazing it was and they've raised a ton of money.  But now it turns out, according to some, that maybe this technology isn't near ready for  prime time.  They had that it looks a little more like this than the HoloLens, another augmented  reality project that's a little bit farther along.  And in fact, according to one report, it's not even as good as HoloLens.  It still requires you wired up to a massive computer.  It looks like apparently, Magic Leap might have made a bet on a technology that hasn't  really paid off.

Start time: 6556.45
End time: 6582.14
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  Yeah, it sounds like the first thing they're going to release is going to be kind of like  a watered down version of what they've been showing people in demos and has been showing  investors and thousands of people or maybe a thousand or so have tried it under NDA.  So even if they have used it, they can't really talk about the experience publicly.  But I hate the Theranos comparison for anything now.  So I mean, I feel like, yeah, it's not that.

Start time: 6582.26
End time: 6589.00

End time: 6625.52
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah, the Theranos thing is a crazy comparison.  I mean, the investors in Magic Leap are the most savvy tech investors on the planet.  Sundar Pichai is on the board.  They have other super knowledgeable tech investors.  If Magic Leap doesn't succeed, then, you know, look, they went and gave a shot at it.  I personally can't say whether or not I've seen it, but.

End time: 6655.39
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  All right.  But I can't say.  But I think what's happened in the past couple of weeks has been a little  nuts.  The information did a story on it.  The information story was not a story which was the equivalent to the Wall  Street Journal Theranos story.  It didn't have wrongdoing.  There wasn't like deception.  It showed what a lot of people knew that they were moving as fast as they hoped.  These things happen.

Start time: 6655.82
End time: 6682.84
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  There is one accusation in the information story that is not great, which is this video  that was made and used apparently to recruit employees just another day at the office of  Magic Leap.  It turns out it was created.  In fact, it even says on the stamp here at the Weta Workshop, the folks who did the special  effects for the Lord of the Rings and the Hobbit.  It is completely whole cloth.  This is not using the Magic Leap technology at all.  This is special effects.

Start time: 6683.87
End time: 6751.80
Speaker: SPEAKER_07
Transcript:  Yeah.  No, I think it's clear to anyone that that's not what happens when you go to work at Magic  Leap.  That's the way you do your work.  So I think if that's the smoking gun, you know, big deal.  I mean, it was a solidly written story.  But I think what was more interesting to me was the way that Magic Leap responded to the  story, which Rony Bromowitz, the CEO, has gone into it like he's going a little Twitter mad  trying to defend Magic Leap there.  And I think, you know, maybe he would be do better off holding his powder and, you know,  waiting until he had something to show whenever that is, you know, contacting his investors  and assuring them that he's going to be able to eventually do the launch and then improve  on it and win the long game, which this really is, you know.  So I think that right now, if you follow him on Twitter, you're going to get a lot of tweets.

Start time: 6752.66
End time: 6773.56
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  These things happen.  I mean, in fact, as all these investors know, and they've poured more than a billion dollars  into Magic Leap, sometimes you make a bet.  It's a high risk, high reward bet.  Maybe it takes longer.  Maybe it doesn't ever happen.  But that doesn't mean it's malicious.  It just means that they're trying something difficult.

Start time: 6774.56
End time: 6800.41
Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  I think it's also just way too soon to judge something most people haven't seen publicly,  that they haven't done a public demonstration of.  And I think the reason why there's so much interest is they've been hyping it up for years.  I mean, you know, beyond the money that they've attracted, you know, cover story in Wired,  cover story in Forbes, you know, this is the future and, you know, glowing profiles  that don't really say very much.  Yeah, that's what I mean.

Start time: 6801.02

Transcript:  It lumps a lot of expectations on the company between the amount they've raised and, you know,  these glitzy magazine stories on them that, you know, are light on, you know, meat.  There's no meat to it, like, what's really going on there.  So it's no wonder why, you know, the information wanted to poke around and see, you know,  what the heck's going on.  You know, I think it's rightful to be a little bit skeptical, but again,  no one's really tried it and they don't have their final product.

Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  Yeah, no, it's no skin off my nose.  I just, you know, I also think it's suspicious when a company will show it to people,  but then insist that you're not, that you not talk about it.  And it's one of the reasons I don't do any NDAs because I feel like that's,  it doesn't help me.  It doesn't help my audience if I know something that I can't tell them.  It's, you know, so, and it feels like, well, okay, why are you showing me this then?  Who are you trying, whose hearts and minds are you trying to win here?

Start time: 6868.94
End time: 6897.76
Speaker: SPEAKER_02
Transcript:  They have to walk a very careful line because they want to be able to build up  press and interest so that they can make a certain amount of money  that they need in order to invest into that, to develop.  But then you also end up with your audience having what could end up being  expectational debt. And that's when you have oversold something and you under deliver.  And then people end up really angry and upset with something that they expected would be  mind blowing and ended up being pretty awesome.  But for the fact that you expected the world.

They've lost their chief marketing officer and they've  lost their head of comms in the past. This week, they lost their head of comms and  month or two ago, they lost their chief marketing officer.  And, you know, they're not, there's nothing to even communicate or market yet.  So you got to wonder what's going on there.  But why are they losing, you know, that that side of the business?  And they've lost a lot of other employees too. And that's,  those are the people chatting to the press right now.

And the people who are putting money into it are smart and know what they're,  know what they're doing. I would assume.  Let's take a break. Final thoughts. I do want to talk about that latest Yahoo news.  Holy cow. And whether Verizon is going to keep buying it. I don't know what's going to happen  with the, and if Verizon does pull out of the deal, which I'm sure at this point it could,  what happens to Yahoo? But first, a word from our sponsor. Audible is my audio book store. I love it.  I've been an audible listener since the year 2000. That's when I started listening. I've always  loved audio books. I love the idea of somebody reading to me. I learned so much. And there's  always times in the day when I can't hold a book, but I can listen to a book when you're in your  commute, when you're at the gym, when you're walking the dog, watching the dishes, whatever  it is you're doing. It's really nice. And I, you know, talking about the Amazon Echo, it will read  to me. I could say, echo, read, read me, read to me. And it picks up where I left off on my most  recent book automatically. I love audible. We're going to get you two free books right now. If you  go to audible.com slash twit and the number two, uh, there's some really good books in here.  Everybody's raving. I haven't read it yet about Trevor Noah, the host of the daily show's new book,  Born a Crime. He narrates it. I think that's always great. Let it Cohen passed this year.  This is the biography to read. I'm your man. It's available at audible.com.  You want to, you want to really get into some heavy history. 57 hours and 13 minutes, the rise  and fall of the third, right? I, I have to say, I read this in paper. I love this. Audible has so  many great books, all the bestsellers, classics, science fiction, history, biography. Here's a  little something called hackers heroes of the computer revolution. Uh, if you haven't read  Steven Levy's classic, you gotta read it. They have, I think they have all of your books. I'm  sure they do. Let's see here. Uh, in the plex that's the book on Google.

Transcript:  That's a lot of work. The good thing was it was about 10 years after I wrote it. So to me,  what it was horrible is if you have to read a book that you just wrote, it's like torture because  you're sick of it by then. And, uh, you know, you've gone over it 50 times and copy edits and  things like that. You think it's horrible. So just sit in a studio for four days and read it.

Transcript:  It will be torture to me. But this was fun. It was like visiting an old friend. And we should  mention that, uh, since we were talking about, uh, John Markoff, I wonder if yes, machines of  loving grace is at audible. This is a wonderful book. Uh, John Markoff's written so many great  books about the tech revolution. Uh, that's, that's probably the classic. Uh, he also wrote  what the Dormouse said. I wonder if they've got that. They've got a lot of, uh,  have his New York times pieces here as well. That's another thing you get, by the way,  if you go to audible.com slash twit two is the daily digest of the wall street journal  or the New York times read to you. I guess they don't have, uh, his, uh, his book about  the, what the Dormouse that was him, right? Or was it, what is it? Katie Hafner wrote that  anyway, there are great books at audible and you must join and you must take advantage of our offer.  You're going to go to audible.com slash twit two.

Uh, and it's just, well, it's a, it's powerful, I guess is the best word for it,  but this is the beauty of audible. You get great experiences. Um, uh, you know, it's almost like  you're there when they're reading to you, there's something about the way you're taking it in.  Here's the book you were talking about, Steven, the undoing project, a friendship that changed  our minds. This is about David Kahneman and Amos Tversky's, um, studies about the decision-making,  uh, process. Michael Lewis is so great. Uh, he always picks fascinating subjects. This is  his most recent, all of his books are also in audible. So look, pick two and get them free.  You cancel in the first 30 days, you'll pay nothing. The books will be yours to keep audible.com  slash twit two. I've just given you so many books to get,  I don't know. You know, it's funny is now I'm adding that because I have a wish list on audible.  That's got an 80 books on it. I'm going to add that, uh, to the list cause I want to read that  too. That's the book about the economy and stuff. All right. Yahoo. It's just one thing after another  with Yahoo. Isn't it? Um, now they say that one and I think it's a story just because of the number  one billion user accounts have been breached. This happened a few years ago. Uh, remember that, uh,  of course, earlier Yahoo had revealed that half a billion accounts had been breached in a separate  hack. At this point, you got to wonder, is Verizon going to go through with the deal?

Speaker: SPEAKER_03
Transcript:  What happens to Yahoo next? We had, um, uh, AOL CEO, Tim Armstrong, who's kind of helping  spearhead that deal at our conference, uh, a week and a half ago now. And this was before the  disclosure of the hack. And we asked him, uh, my colleague asked him point blank, like, you know,  what, get it, put a number on this. What's the percentage chance that this happens? And he  wouldn't do that, but he's like, I'm cautiously optimistic that the deal's going to go through  week later. This happens. So, uh, so it's either going to be a discount. Uh, you got to think  that they still want Yahoo. They asked for a billion off. They already, why isn't our

Start time: 7343.32
End time: 7376.62
Speaker: SPEAKER_06
Transcript:  answer a billion off for the first hack? And actually exactly what's really important is,  uh, what did Marissa Meyer know? And when did she know it? What did she hide this material  information from, uh, Verizon and other suitors when they were selling the company?  And there's some evidence that she did on the 2014 hack. This billion  account hack happened a year earlier. So it would stretch, it would stretch credulity to  think that Marissa Meyer did not know about this billion account hack from 2013.

The company says it thinks it's distinct from the 2014 hack and it, it says,  oh, and the hackers aren't in our network anymore. So they say, I don't, I don't know.  Yeah.  Yeah. What do you think if Verizon pulls out,  maybe they'll just ask for another billion off. What happens?

Transcript:  Yeah, they're okay. I mean, um, so the production ones had a lot of issues, um,  probably mostly related to the software. You know, Apple told me ahead of time  before you try these, make sure you have the latest iOS update and before you start rocking them.  Um, but you know, I, before I had issues, like if I was listening to music and someone called me  and I answered the call, like the audio wouldn't carry over and it would just get all screwed up  and things like that, that seems to mostly have been fixed. Um, my big problem, I just have two  issues with them and one, they look really goofy when you wear them. And two is the control  mechanisms. It's really annoying to adjust the volume and switch tracks. When you're listening  to music, you have to enable Siri. Yeah. So like, you know, if I want to turn up the volume,  I double tap it, say Siri, raise the volume, and then the music stops and then plays again  with a higher volume. That's just awkward. I mean, yes, you can use your watch and yes, you can,  you know, just physically touch on the phone. But that little dongle on the wired earbuds were so  nice. And, you know, it seems like they didn't really figure out a solution to replace that.  But other than that, they're cool. Battery life is great. Um, yeah, they're neat.

People were complaining about the new MacBook Pros, including one Mossberg,  about the new MacBook Pros battery life fluctuating wildly. So Apple did fix that.  They removed the time remaining estimate. I love this story. Now you just don't know.  Now you just don't know. You can't trust it. So we'll just take it out.

Like who was begging  for a creepy clown, but maybe that's, you know, most of us have chlorophobia. So they have the  crooked Hillary. No, by the way, that's a funny story. The, the, the, the crooked Hillary emoji  that the Trump campaign was asking for was what a couple of bags of cash. And then they wanted to  simplify it to just a person running off with a bag of cash and Twitter, I think quite rightly said,  you can't have a custom emoji. What are you talking about? And then Jack Dorsey is glad he  did because he didn't have to go to that tech summit. Here, let me see if I can get the clown  for you. This is a video of all of the new emoji. Apple has decided to make these kind of, uh,  almost realistic, at least with the food, the humans aren't so much. And thanks to Google,  by the way, for creating male and female.
